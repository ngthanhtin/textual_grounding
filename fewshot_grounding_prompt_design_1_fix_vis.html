<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Reformatted Question:</strong> For <a style="background-color: yellow;">every 12 cans you recycle</a>, <b style="background-color: lightblue;">you receive $0.50</b>, and for <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">every 5 kilograms of newspapers</c>, <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">you receive $1.50</d>. If your family collected <e style="background-color: violet;">144 cans</e> and <f style="background-color: orange;">20 kilograms of newspapers</f>, how much money would you receive?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Answer:</strong>There are <e style="background-color: violet;">144</e>/<a style="background-color: yellow;">12</a> = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected. So, the family would receive <b style="background-color: lightblue;">$0.50</b> x 12 = $6 for the cans. There are <f style="background-color: orange;">20</f>/5 = 4 sets of <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">5 kilograms of newspapers</c> that the family collected. So, the family would receive <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">$1.50</d> x 4 = $6 for the newspapers. Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $12. The answer is 12.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Reformatted Question:</strong> <a style="background-color: yellow;">Betty picked 16 strawberries</a>. <b style="background-color: lightblue;">Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty</b> and <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">twice as many as Natalie</c>. They used their strawberries to make jam. <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">One jar of jam used 7 strawberries</d> and they <e style="background-color: violet;">sold each jar at $4</e>.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Reformatted Question:</strong> <a style="background-color: yellow;">Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund</a>. The fund promised a <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">yearly interest rate of 10%</c>. If he deposited an additional <b style="background-color: lightblue;">$100 every month</b> into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Answer:</strong>For the first year, Joseph will have invested <a style="background-color: yellow;">$1000</a> + (<b style="background-color: lightblue;">$100</b> * 12) = $2200. The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">10%</c> = $220. The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $2420. For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + (<b style="background-color: lightblue;">$100</b> * 12) = $3620. The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">10%</c> = $362.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Reformatted Question:</strong> The price of buying <b style="background-color: lightblue;">a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20</b>, and <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">the cost of buying a hat is $10</c>. If Kendra <e style="background-color: violet;">went to the shop with a $100 bill</e> and bought <a style="background-color: yellow;">two wooden toys</a> and <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">three hats</d>, calculate the change she received.</div><div class='answer'><strong>Answer:</strong>When Kendra bought <a style="background-color: yellow;">2 toys</a>, she paid 2*<b style="background-color: lightblue;">$20</b> = $40. Since the price of a hat is <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">$10</c>, when Kendra bought <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">3 hats</d>, she paid 3*<c style="background-color: lightgreen;">$10</c> = $30. The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is $40+$30 = $70. From the <e style="background-color: violet;">$100 bill</e>, Kendra received change worth $100-$70 = $30.
