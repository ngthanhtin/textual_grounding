Question: Among the various models of Delta vacuum cleaners, <fact1>one cannot accurately predict how effectively a particular model cleans</fact1> simply by <fact2>determining how powerful its motor is</fact2>. The efficiency of <fact3>dust filtration systems varies significantly</fact3>, even between models of <fact4>Delta vacuum cleaners equipped with identically powerful motors</fact4>. The argument's conclusion is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? Answer Choices: (a) All Delta vacuum cleaners that clean equally effectively have identically powerful motors. (b) One cannot accurately assess how effectively any Delta vacuum cleaner cleans without knowing how powerful that vacuum cleaner's motor is. (c) For each Delta vacuum cleaner, the efficiency of its dust filtration system has a significant impact on how effectively it cleans. (d) For any two Delta vacuum cleaners with equally efficient dust filtration systems, the one with the more powerful motor cleans more effectively.
Answer: The argument states that <fact1>one cannot accurately predict how effectively a Delta vacuum cleaner cleans</fact1> by just <fact2>knowing the power of its motor</fact2>. This is because the <fact3>dust filtration systems differ significantly</fact3> even between <fact4>models that have motors of the same power</fact4>. A does not align with the argument, as the efficiency of the <fact3>dust filtration systems was noted to vary significantly</fact3>, making <fact2>motor power alone insufficient to predict cleaning effectiveness</fact2>. B seems partially relevant, but the argument suggests that <fact2>motor power alone is not enough to determine effectiveness</fact2> due to the role of dust filtration systems. C directly aligns with the argument. The <fact3>efficiency of the dust filtration system</fact3> is emphasized as a key factor, even for models with the same motor power. D contradicts the argument by suggesting that motor power is the main factor, but the argument highlights the <fact3>varying dust filtration systems</fact3>. The answer is {C}.

Question: Scientists examined <fact1>diamonds</fact1> that were <fact2>formed on Earth about 2.9 billion years ago</fact2>. These diamonds had a <fact3>higher-than-normal concentration of sulfur-33</fact3>. This concentration can be explained only by <fact4>certain chemical reactions that are stimulated by ultraviolet light</fact4>. If there had been <fact5>more than a trace of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago</fact5>, then not enough <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> would have reached Earth’s surface to stimulate the chemical reactions. The information above most strongly supports which one of the following? Answer Choices: (a) Earth’s atmosphere contained very little, if any, oxygen 2.9 billion years ago. (b) Most diamonds with higher-than-normal concentrations of sulfur-33 were formed at least 2.9 billion years ago. (c) Ultraviolet light causes the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere to react chemically with sulfur-33. (d) The formation of diamonds occurs only in the presence of ultraviolet light.
Answer: The key point is that <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> was necessary for the chemical reactions, but <fact5>high levels of oxygen</fact5> would have blocked that light. This suggests that <fact5>oxygen levels</fact5> must have been very low or nearly absent during this time for the reactions to occur. Therefore, the diamonds' <fact3>high sulfur-33 concentration</fact3> indicates that <fact5>Earth's atmosphere 2.9 billion years ago</fact5> had very little oxygen. A directly aligns with the argument since it matches the conditions required for <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> to reach Earth's surface and cause the reactions. B is unrelated to the argument, which focuses on the specific conditions of the atmosphere <fact2>2.9 billion years ago</fact2>, not the overall formation of diamonds. C is incorrect because <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> facilitates the reaction, but <fact5>oxygen</fact5> would block the light, not cause a reaction with <fact3>sulfur-33</fact3>. D is also incorrect as the argument does not state that <fact6>ultraviolet light</fact6> is necessary for <fact1>diamond</fact1> formation, only that it explains the <fact3>sulfur-33 concentration</fact3>. The answer is {A}.

Question: In recent years, many cabinetmakers have been winning acclaim as artists. But since <fact1>furniture must be useful</fact1>, cabinetmakers must exercise their craft with an eye to the practical utility of their product. For this reason, <fact2>cabinetmaking is not art</fact2>. Which of the following is an assumption that supports drawing the conclusion above from the reason given for that conclusion? Answer Choices: (a) Some furniture is made to be placed in museums, where it will not be used by anyone. (b) Artists are not concerned with the monetary value of their products. (c) Cabinetmakers should be more concerned with the practical utility of their products than they currently are. (d) <fact3>An object is not an art object if its maker pays attention to the object's practical utility</fact3>.
Answer: Premise: <fact1>Cabinetmakers must exercise their craft with an eye to practical utility</fact1>. Conclusion: <fact2>Cabinetmaking is not art</fact2>. The question asks for an assumption that supports drawing this conclusion from the given reason. To bridge the gap between the premise and the conclusion, we need an assumption that links practical utility to the definition of art. A This statement about museum furniture doesn't help connect practical utility to the definition of art. It's irrelevant to the argument. B The monetary value of art is not mentioned in the original argument and doesn't relate to practical utility. This is also irrelevant. C This is a normative statement about what cabinetmakers should do, but it doesn't help us determine whether cabinetmaking is art or not based on practical utility. D This statement directly connects practical utility to the definition of art. It states that <fact3>if an object's maker considers practical utility, then the object is not art</fact3>. This assumption would indeed allow us to conclude that <fact2>cabinetmaking is not art</fact2> based on the <fact1>premise</fact1> that cabinetmakers consider practical utility. The answer is {D}.

Question: Doctor: There will be <fact1>more local cases of flu infection this year</fact1> than there were <fact2>last year</fact2>. In addition to the <fact3>strains of flu that were present in this area last year</fact3>, a <fact4>new strain has infected some people this year</fact4>. The conclusion of the doctor's argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? Answer Choices: (a) It is rare for new strains of flu to appear. (b) The new strain of flu cannot be addressed with the approaches used to deal with the strains of flu that were present last year. (c) <fact5>There will be no decline this year</fact5> in the number of cases of flu infection due to strains that were present last year. (d) The new strain of flu is expected to be more dangerous than the strains of flu that were present last year.
Answer: A is irrelevant to the argument, as it doesn't address the relationship between practical utility and art. B focuses on monetary value, which is unrelated to the argument about practical utility. C may reinforce <fact5>the importance</fact5> of practical utility in cabinetmaking but does not directly support the argument that cabinetmaking is not art. D aligns directly with the argument's reasoning, stating that an object's focus on utility disqualifies it from being classified as art. The answer is {C}.

Question: The growing popularity of <fact1>computer-based activities</fact1> was widely expected to result in a decline in <fact2>television viewing</fact2>, since it had been assumed that people lack sufficient free time to maintain current <fact2>television-viewing levels</fact2> while spending increasing amounts of free time on the <fact1>computer</fact1>. That assumption, however, is evidently false: in a recent mail survey concerning media use, a very large majority of respondents who report increasing time spent per week using <fact1>computers</fact1> report no change in time spent <fact2>watching television</fact2>. In order to evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to determine which of the following?  Answer Choices: (a) Whether a large majority of the computer owners in the survey reported spending increasing amounts of time per week using computers (b) Whether the survey collected information about the amount of money respondents spent on free-time media use (c) Whether the amount of time spent <fact2>watching television</fact2> is declining among people who report that they rarely or never use <fact1>computers</fact1> (d) Whether the survey respondents' reports of time spent using <fact1>computers</fact1> included time spent using computers at work
Answer: The argument needs to be evaluated by determining whether the survey truly refutes the assumption that people don’t have enough free time to do both <fact1>computer-based activities</fact1> and <fact2>television viewing</fact2>. A key factor is understanding the context of how the time spent on <fact1>computers</fact1> is being measured. Specifically, if the survey includes time spent using <fact1>computers</fact1> at work, then it might not accurately reflect free-time media use. A fact is already stated in the argument, so confirming it wouldn’t provide new useful information. Option (b) is about time spent on media, not about money spent, so this wouldn't be directly useful in evaluating the argument. Option (c), while it could be interesting, doesn’t directly address the survey group that the argument is focused on, i.e., those who are increasing their <fact1>computer</fact1> use. Option (d) is crucial. If the time spent using <fact1>computers</fact1> includes work-related activities, then the survey does not accurately reflect the respondents' free time. The argument would be weakened because the increased <fact1>computer</fact1> time might not be taking away from <fact2>television viewing</fact2> due to the fact that much of it is happening during work hours. The answer is {D}.

Question: The <fact1>Great Sphinx</fact1> is a huge statue in <fact2>Egypt</fact2> that has a <fact3>lion's body</fact3> with a <fact4>man's head</fact4>. The face of the Sphinx has long been claimed to be that of pharaoh <fact5>Khafre</fact5>, who lived around <fact6>2600 B.C.</fact6>, but it cannot be: erosion patterns recently discovered on the lion's legs can only have been caused by <fact7>heavy rains</fact7>, and the Sahara has <fact8>not had heavy rains in over 10,000 years</fact8>. Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? Answer Choices: (a) Other erosion patterns that appear on the body of the Sphinx are of a sort that could be caused by wind and sand alone (b) The face of the Sphinx bears a resemblance to the faces on certain stylized statues dating from both before and after the reign of Khafre. (c) Other than the Sphinx, there are no surviving sculptures that have been claimed to portray the face of Khafre. (d) The face of the Sphinx is small relative to the rest of the head, indicating that the face may have been recarved long after the Sphinx was built.
Answer: To weaken the argument, we need information that undermines the conclusion that the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> predates <fact5>Khafre</fact5>. Specifically, we need evidence that the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> may still have been altered or changed during <fact5>Khafre's</fact5> time, or that the face could have been recarved later. A does not address the specific erosion caused by <fact7>heavy rains</fact7>, so it doesn’t directly weaken the argument. B while this suggests stylistic similarities, it doesn’t provide a strong reason to doubt the conclusion about the erosion patterns or the age of the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1>. C is irrelevant to the argument, as it doesn’t address the age of the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> or the erosion evidence. D <fact4>the face of the Sphinx</fact4> is small relative to the rest of the head, indicating that the face may have been recarved long after the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> was originally constructed, it could explain why <fact4>the face</fact4> resembles <fact5>Khafre</fact5> while the body and erosion patterns suggest an older origin. This suggests that the <fact1>Sphinx</fact1> could still have been altered during <fact5>Khafre's</fact5> time, weakening the claim that <fact4>the face</fact4> couldn't be <fact5>Khafre's</fact5>. The answer is {D}.

Question: <fact1>Lawyer: Did Congleton assign the best available graphic artist to the project?</fact1> Witness: Yes. <fact2>Lawyer: And the best writer?</fact2> Witness: Yes. <fact3>Lawyer: In fact everyone she assigned to work on the project was top notch?</fact3> Witness: That's true. <fact4>Lawyer: So, you lied to the court when you said, earlier, that Congleton wanted the project to fail?</fact4> Each of the following accurately describes a flaw in the lawyer's reasoning displayed above EXCEPT: Answer Choices: (a) It takes for granted that Congleton was not forced to assign the people she did to the project. (b) It ignores the possibility that the witness failed to infer from known facts what should have been inferred and therefore was not lying. (c) It takes for granted that the project could fail only if Congleton wanted it to fail. (d) It ignores the possibility that Congleton knew that the people assigned to the project would not work well together.
Answer: We need to identify a flaw in the lawyer's reasoning. The lawyer is assuming that assigning highly qualified people to the project guarantees that the project would succeed, which overlooks several potential reasons the project could still fail, including factors outside of the team's qualifications. A is a valid flaw in the lawyer's reasoning because it’s possible that Congleton was not forced to assign these people, even if they were top-notch. B is another valid flaw. The witness might not have correctly inferred from the facts, but it doesn't mean they were intentionally lying. C is not a flaw in the reasoning—it accurately describes the lawyer's assumption. The lawyer is assuming that if the project failed, it would have been because Congleton wanted it to fail. This assumption supports the lawyer’s argument and is the point being taken for granted. D is another valid flaw. Even if the team members were top-notch, they might not have worked well together, leading to project failure. The answer is {C}.

Question: Editor Y: This is a <fact1>good photograph</fact1>: the composition is attractive, especially in the way the image is blurred by smoke in one corner. Editor Z: It' s <fact2>very pretty</fact2>, but it' s a <fact3>bad photograph</fact3>. It doesn' t make a statement; there' s no obvious reason for the smoke to be there. The editors' dialogue provides the most support for the claim that they disagree with each other about whether Answer Choices: (a) a photograph that is not attractive can still be a good photograph (b) <fact4>attractiveness by itself can make a photograph a good photograph</fact4> (c) a photograph's composition should be related to a statement that it makes (d) a photograph that makes no statement can still be attractive
Answer: Editor Y values the <fact1>attractiveness and composition</fact1> of the photograph, focusing on its visual appeal. Editor Z values a photograph’s <fact3>statement or purpose</fact3> and feels that, without <fact3>a clear reason for the smoke</fact3>, the photograph cannot be considered good despite being <fact2>attractive</fact2>. A is not the core of their disagreement. Both editors recognize that the photograph is <fact2>attractive</fact2>. B is the main point of disagreement. Editor Y believes that the photograph’s <fact4>attractiveness</fact4> makes it good, while Editor Z does not think <fact4>attractiveness alone makes a photograph good</fact4>. C while Editor Z might agree with this, Editor Y doesn’t directly reference whether a photograph needs to make a statement. D both editors agree that the photograph is <fact2>attractive</fact2>, so this doesn’t capture their disagreement about what makes a photograph good. The answer is {B}.
