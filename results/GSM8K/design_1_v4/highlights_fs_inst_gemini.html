She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">In the morning</fact2>, she gives her flock of chickens <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15 cups</fact3> of feed.  <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">In the afternoon</fact4>, she gives her chickens another <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">25 cups</fact5> of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20 chickens</fact6>?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Wendi's chickens eat a total of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15</fact3> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">25</fact5> = 40 cups of food in the morning and afternoon. Since Wendi has <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20 chickens</fact6> that each need <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 cups</fact1> of food per day, she needs enough food for <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20</fact6>*<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3</fact1> = 60 cups. Therefore, Wendi needs 60 - 40 = 20 cups of food for the final meal.
The answer is {20}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>1/ Reformatted Question:</strong> John drives for <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 hours</fact1> at a speed of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">60 mph</fact2> and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 hours</fact3> but spends the first <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 hours</fact4> in standstill traffic.  He spends the next <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">half-hour</fact5> driving at a speed of <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">30mph</fact6>, before being able to drive the remaining time of the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 hours</fact3> going at <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">80 mph</fact7>.  <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?</fact8><br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First find the distance John travels away from home:  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 hours</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">60 miles/hour</fact2> = 180 miles.
Then determine how much time he spends driving towards home during the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 hours</fact3>:  <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 hours</fact3> - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 hours</fact4> = 2 hours
Then subtract the <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">half-hour</fact5> he spends driving <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">30 mph</fact6> to find the amount of time he spends driving <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">80 mph</fact7>: 2 hours - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">0.5 hours</fact5> = 1.5 hours
Then multiply that time by his speed to find the distance he travels at <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">80 mph</fact7>: 1.5 hours * <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">80 mph</fact7> = 120 miles
Then multiply his time spent driving <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">30 mph</fact6> by his speed to find that distance: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">0.5 hours</fact5> * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">30 mph</fact6> = 15 miles
Then add those two distances to find his total distance traveled towards home: 120 miles + 15 miles = 135 miles
Then subtract that distance from the distance he traveled away from home to find how far he is from home: 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles
So the answer is {45}.</div></div>

His financial advisor speculates that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the jewelry market will go up 2.5%</fact3> while <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2%</fact4> within the same month. If the merchant is looking to maximize profit at the end of this month by making a choice, how much profit would this be?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the potential profit for each option:

* **Jewelry:**
    * Profit: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$5,000</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2.5%</fact3> = $125
* **Electronic Gadgets:**
    * Profit: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$8,000</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1.2%</fact4> = $96

The merchant would make a larger profit by investing in jewelry. The profit would be $125.</div></div>

She <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">cut each pie into 8 pieces</fact2> and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves.  At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">14 pieces of pie remaining</fact3>.  How many pieces were taken by the guests?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Grandma Jones had a total of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5</fact1>*<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8</fact2>= 40 pieces of pie.
Since there were only <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">14 pieces</fact3> left, that means 40 - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">14</fact3> = 26 pieces were eaten.
The answer is {26}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>4/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about</fact1>. Last week, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">she wrote 5 articles on Monday</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;"> 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</fact4>. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5</fact2> = 2 more articles than on Monday. 
This means she wrote a total of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5</fact2> + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, she wrote 2 * 7 = 14 articles.
In total, she wrote <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5</fact2> + 7 + 14 = 26 articles in three days.
Thus, she spent a total of 26 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4</fact1> = 104 hours writing the articles.
The answer is {104}.</div></div>

On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee</fact2>.  If she had <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">23 post-it notes remaining overall</fact3>, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Candice used a total of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">220</fact2> Post-it notes at work.

Since she started with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">80</fact1>, that means the new pack had 243-<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">80</fact1>=163.
The answer is {163}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>6/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$60</fact1> and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$40</fact2>.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 truck tires</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 car tires</fact4>.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">12 car tries</fact5> and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>On Thursday, the mechanic earned <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$60</fact1>*<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6</fact3>=$360 for repairing truck tires.  
On that same day, he earned <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$40</fact2>*<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4</fact4> = $160 for repairing car tires.
So, in total, the mechanic earned $360+$160 = $520 on Thursday.
On Friday, the mechanic only repaired car tires, earning him a total of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$40</fact2>*<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">12</fact5> = $480.
So, Thursday was the day with higher revenue, and on Thursday, the mechanic earned $520-$480 = $40 more than on Friday.
The answer is {40}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>7/ Reformatted Question:</strong> The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 kittens adopted from the local animal shelter</fact1> when their mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have just had kittens.

How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Patchy had <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">thrice</fact2> the number of adopted kittens, which means she had 3 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7</fact1> = 21 kittens.
That means in total, their cats had 21 + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12</fact3> = 33 kittens.
Adding the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 adopted kittens</fact1>, the Doubtfire family now has 33 + <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7</fact1> = 40 kittens.
The answer is {40}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>8/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A wooden bridge can carry no more than <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5000 pounds</fact1>. A delivery truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 pounds</fact2>, will pass over the bridge. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds</fact3>. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The bridge can hold a maximum of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5000 pounds</fact1> and the truck plus driver weigh <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3755 pounds</fact3>, leaving  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5000</fact1> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3755</fact3> = 1245 pounds of weight allowance for the boxes.  Since each box weighs <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 pounds</fact2>, the truck can carry a maximum of 1245 / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15</fact2> = 83 boxes. 

The answer is {83}.</div></div>

The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10% of the initial salary every year</fact2> for those who've stayed in the company for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">five years</fact3>. If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December</fact4>, what's her annual salary after <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">three more years of service</fact5>?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Sylvie's salary increase per year is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10/100</fact2>*<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$600</fact1> = $60
So in a year, her salary will be <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$600</fact1> + $60 = $660
Her annual salary will be $660 * 12 = $7920
After 3 years, her annual salary will be $7920 + (3 * $60 * 12) = $10080

If there will be <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 adults</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 children</fact4> at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">A child eats half as much as an adult</fact2>, who eats <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 lbs</fact1>, so each child eats 10/<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2</fact2> = 5 lbs.
That means the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 adults</fact3> will eat <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20</fact3>*<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1> = 200 lbs of potato salad.
And the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 children</fact4> will eat <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5</fact4>*5=25 lbs of potato salad.

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>* **Second friend's rings:** The second friend pressed the doorbell <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1/4 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20</fact2> = 5</fact3> times more than the first friend. This means the second friend rang the doorbell a total of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20</fact2> + 5 = 25 times.
* **Third friend's rings:** The third friend rang the doorbell <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 times more than the <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">fourth friend's 60 rings</fact5></fact4>, meaning the third friend rang it 10 * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">60</fact5> = 600 times. 
* **Total rings:** Adding up all the rings from each friend, plus the first friend's <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20</fact2> rings, the total is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20</fact2> + 25 + 600 + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">60</fact5> = 705 rings. 

**Therefore, the doorbell made a total of 705 rings.**</div></div>

On <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Friday</fact4>, Frankie watched 1 hour/episode * 2 episodes = 2 hours.
On <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Thursday</fact3>, Frankie watched a total of 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
Therefore, from <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Monday to Friday</fact1>, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">excluding Wednesday</fact4>, Frankie watched 2 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 5.5 hours of TV.
So on <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Wednesday</fact2>, Frankie watched <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">7</fact5> total hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours of TV.
Since each episode on <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Wednesday</fact2> was 30 minutes, Frankie watched 60 minutes / hour * 1.5 hours / .5 hours/episode = 3 episodes.
The answer is {3}.</div></div>

Since he baked 15 more than intended, he meant to bake 115 - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15</fact2> = 100 cookies.
He wanted to bake twice as many as last year, meaning he baked 100 / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2</fact1> = 50 cookies last year.
The answer is {50}.</div></div>

A customs officer at the main port of SeaSide clearances counted <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 containers of imported vehicles, each having 5 vehicles inside</fact1>. The next day, more containers were brought in, and the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">total number of vehicles at the port became 30</fact2>. Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">all the containers contain 5 vehicles</fact3>. 

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**

* **Step 1: Vehicles from the first day:**  Since there were <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 containers with 5 vehicles each</fact1>, the total number of vehicles from the first day was 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles.

* **Step 2:  Vehicles imported on the second day:**  The <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">total number of vehicles became 30</fact2>, and we know 10 were from the first day. Therefore, 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles were imported on the second day. 

* **Step 3: Containers imported on the second day:**  Since <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">each container holds 5 vehicles</fact3>, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

**Therefore, 4 containers were imported on the second day.**</div></div>

This means it takes him 15840/<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">440</fact3> = 36 minutes to get home.
Then find how long it takes Tim to get home: He travels <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2</fact4>*5280 = 10560 feet, so it takes him 10560/<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">264</fact5> = 40 minutes.

Then find the total number of tricycle tires Shawnda inflated: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 tricycles</fact3> * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires
Then add the number of bicycle tires, tricycle tires, and the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">one unicycle tire</fact4> to find the total number of tires inflated: 10 tires + 9 tires + 1 tire = 20 tires
Then multiply that number by the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">price per tire</fact1> to find her total earnings in cents: 20 tires * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">25 cents/tire</fact1> = 500 cents

When the seagull landed, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate</fact2>. Then <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries</fact3>. Later, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Ants carried off a final french fry</fact5>, <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">leaving five behind</fact6>. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Working backwards, before the ants took one, there were <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">5</fact6> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1</fact5> = 6 french fries.
Before the raccoon stole his share, there must have been 6 * 3 = 18 french fries.
The three pigeons ate 3 * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3</fact3> = 9 french fries.
This means that before the pigeons arrived, there were 18 + 9 = 27 french fries.
The seagull ate half as many as Dave who ate <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">14</fact1>, meaning the seagull ate <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">14</fact1> / 2 = 7 french fries.
So before the seagull stole the fries, there were 27 + 7 = 34 french fries.
This means that Dave bought 34 + <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">14</fact1> = 48 french fries.
The answer is {48}.</div></div>

Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">40-yard line</fact3> and back. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">She does this 34 times</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">How much farther does the winner run than the loser</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Blake runs <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 times</fact2> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100 yards</fact1> per time = 1500 yards.
Kelly runs <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100 yards</fact1> * 2 = 200 yards when she runs the length of the field.
Each time she runs to the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">40-yard line</fact3> and back is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">40 yards</fact3> * 2 = 80 yards.
So Kelly runs <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">34 times</fact4> * 80 yards per time = 2720 yards when she runs to the 40-yard line and back.
Therefore, Kelly runs 2720 yards + 200 yards = 2920 yards total.
That means Kelly runs 2920 yards - 1500 yards = 1420 yards farther than Blake.
The answer is {1420}.</div></div>

Then convert that time to seconds: 90 minutes * 60 seconds per minute = 5400 seconds

Then, subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find the number of pieces given to the rats: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">160 pieces</fact6> - 50 pieces - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20 pieces</fact5> = 90 pieces. Then, divide that number by the number of pieces each rat gets to find the total number of rats: 90 pieces / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 pieces/rat</fact2> = 15 rats. Finally, divide the total number of rats by the number of cages to find how many rats are in each cage: 15 rats / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 cages</fact1> = 5 rats/cage.
The answer is {5}.</div></div>

After a month, she collected <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">three times that number</fact2>. In the second month, she collected <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact3>. In the third month, she collected <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months</fact4>. <question>How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?</question>

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>* **Month 1:** Elaine started with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 cards</fact1> and collected <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">three times</fact2> that amount, meaning she collected 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:** She collected <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 fewer cards than month 1</fact3>, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Months 1 & 2 Total:**  Over those two months, she collected a total of 60 + 40 = 100 cards.
* **Month 3:** She collected <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">twice the combined total of months 1 and 2</fact4>, meaning she collected 100 * 2 = 200 cards.
* **Total Cards:** In total, Elaine now has 20 (initial) + 60 (month 1) + 40 (month 2) + 200 (month 3) =  320 Pokemon cards.

**Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokemon cards.**</div></div>

Mark edits a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">total number of 1000 sentences each week</fact2>, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?</fact4><br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Mark edits <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1000 sentences</fact2> / 2 publishers = 500 sentences for each Publisher per week.
That means Mark makes 500 sentences * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 cents per sentence</fact3> = 2500 cents per week from Publisher A.
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays</fact1>, so Mark makes 2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents per week from Publisher B.
Therefore, Mark makes a total of 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents per week.
The answer is {7500}.</div></div>

That means he used 7*<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2</fact1> = 14 slices of cheese on sandwiches. 
He used 1 more slice of cheese in each omelette than he did on each sandwich so he used 2 + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1</fact2> = 3 slices per omelette.
Since he ate omelettes 3 times that week, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese in his omelettes.

Over the course of the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 week movie</fact4>, that's 24 hours per week * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 weeks</fact4> = 120 hours

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. How much more is the total price of the house than <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Mrs. Cruz's budget</fact1>? 

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">brokerage fee</fact3> will cost <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$350,000</fact2> * 0.05 = $17,500.

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First find the total cost of the business suits: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 suits * $100/suit = $600</fact2>.
Then find the total cost of the suitcases: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $150</fact3>.
Then find how much more expensive the flight ticket is than a business suit: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 * $100 = $500</fact4>.
Then add that amount to <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$700</fact4> to find the total cost of the plane ticket: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$500 + $700 = $1200</fact4>.
Then add up the cost of the suits, suitcases, and flight to find his total spending so far:  $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.
Then subtract his spending from his total budget to find how much money he has left: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$6000 - $1950 = $4050</fact1>.
Then subtract the amount he wants to <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">save</fact5> from the money he has left to find how much he can spend on gifts: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$4050 - $2000 = $2050</fact5>.

If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees</fact3>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">they are each paid $2000 per month</fact4>, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**1. Calculate the number of junior programmers:**

* There are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100 employees</fact1> in total.
* Junior programmers make up <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2/5 of the total employees</fact3>, so there are (2/5) * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1> = 40 junior programmers.

**2. Calculate the monthly salary of a senior programmer:**

* <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers</fact2>, who earn <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$2000</fact4>.
* Therefore, senior programmers earn <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$2000</fact4> + $400 = $2400 per month.

**3. Calculate the number of senior programmers:**

* Total programmers = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1> (total employees) - 40 (junior programmers) = 60 senior programmers.

**4. Calculate the total monthly salary of all junior programmers:**

* Total salary for junior programmers is 40 (junior programmers) * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$2000</fact4> (salary per junior programmer) = $80000.

**5. Calculate the total monthly salary of all senior programmers:**

* Total salary for senior programmers is 60 (senior programmers) * $2400 (salary per senior programmer) = $144000.

**6. Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers:**

* Total salary for all programmers is $80000 (junior programmers' salary) + $144000 (senior programmers' salary) = $224000.

**Therefore, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all programmers per month.**</div></div>

How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?                     <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Job A pays $15/hour</fact2> and he is expected to work <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2000 hours a year</fact3>. That means that his gross income is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$15</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2000</fact3> = $30,000. A <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20% tax rate</fact4> means that he will pay 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000 in taxes. This makes his net income for <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Job A</fact2> $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000 per year.
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Job B</fact5> has a gross income of <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$42,000</fact5>. Before income tax, Nick has to pay <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$6,000 in property tax</fact6>, leaving him with <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$42,000</fact5> - <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$6,000</fact6> = $36,000 in taxable income. He pays a <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">10% tax rate</fact7> on this income, meaning he pays 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600 in income tax. This leaves him with a net income of $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.
The difference between these two salaries is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.
So the answer is {8400}.</div></div>

The train <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">needs service every 18,000 miles</fact5> so how many days does it go between services?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The distance from the second city to the third is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">100 miles</fact2> and the distance from the first city to the second is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">75 miles</fact1> so the total distance for these two legs of the trip is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">75</fact1>+<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">100</fact2> = 175 miles.
That means the distance from the third city to the first is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50 miles</fact3> less than 175 miles or 175 - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50</fact3> = 125 miles.
So in total, the train travels 175 + 125 = 300 miles in one complete trip.
The train <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">makes this trip 3 times per day</fact4> so it travels 300 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3</fact4> = 900 miles in a day.
Since the train needs service every <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18,000 miles</fact5>, it can go <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18,000</fact5>/900 = 20 days between services.

So each picture frame costs $<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20</fact2> + $4 = $24
The picture frames cost a total of $24 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44</fact1> = $1056
The pins cost a total of $<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2</fact4> * $<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5</fact4> = $10
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1/4</fact1> of the seniors is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44</fact1> / 4 = 11 seniors.

* **Saturday's Sales:** They sold <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">double</fact2> the amount from Friday, which is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">14 pairs</fact1> * 2 = 28 pairs of shoes.
* **Sunday's Sales (Before Returns):** They sold <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">half</fact3> of Saturday's sales, meaning they sold 28 pairs / 2 = 14 pairs.
* **Sunday's Returns:**  <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Six pairs</fact4> were returned on Sunday.
* **Sunday's Net Sales:** After returns, they sold 14 pairs - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 pairs</fact4> = 8 pairs on Sunday.

She spends <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">She sells each cup of lemonade for $1</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open</fact4>. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, find the total number of cups Millie can sell by multiplying the number of pitchers by the cups per pitcher: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 cups/pitcher</fact2> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 pitchers</fact1> = 36 cups
Then, calculate her total earnings by multiplying the number of cups by her selling price: 36 cups * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1/cup</fact3> = $36
Then, divide her total earnings by her total cost to find her overall profit: $36 - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$18</fact1> = $18
Finally, since she makes $18 in profit and sells an average of <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 cups per hour</fact4>, divide her total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all her lemonade to find her hourly profit: $18 / (36 cups / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 cups/hour</fact4>) = $2/hour
The answer is {2}.</div></div>

Half of the girls couldn't make it to the performance because of the <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">bus breaking down</fact5> which means 26/2=13 girls missed the performance.
So, 26-13=13 girls were able to perform.

How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Tyson needs enough sandwiches to feed <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 people</fact3> and each sandwich feeds <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 people</fact2> so that's 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.
Since <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">each sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1>, he needs 5*1 = 5 pounds of meat and 5*1 = 5 pounds of cheese.
The meat will cost 5*<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$7.00</fact4> = $35.00 and the cheese will cost 5*<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$3.00</fact5> = $15.00

She bought <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">four packs of gum</fact1> the last time she was at the store. She got <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">two packs</fact2> of her favorite flavor, <target>strawberry</target>. She paid <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$2</fact3> for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">half as much</fact4> for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$7 in all</fact5>, how many dollars did each pack of <target>strawberry</target> gum cost?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate the cost of the green apple gum:** Suzie paid <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">half as much</fact4> for the green apple gum as the grape gum, which cost <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$2</fact3>.  Half of $2 is $2 / 2 = $1.
* **Calculate the total cost of the grape and green apple gum:** The grape gum cost <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$2</fact3> and the green apple gum cost $1, for a total of $2 + $1 = $3.
* **Calculate the total cost of the strawberry gum:** Suzie paid <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$7 in all</fact5>, and the grape and green apple gum cost $3, so the strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4.
* **Calculate the cost of each pack of strawberry gum:** Suzie bought <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">two packs</fact2> of strawberry gum for a total of $4, so each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2.

**Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.**</div></div>

If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans</fact3>, how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's assume there are 100x blue jelly beans.
Then, there are 100x - 100x * 1/100 = 99x red jelly beans (<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans</fact1>).
And, there are 100x + 100x * 1/100 = 101x green jelly beans (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans</fact2>).
The total number of jelly beans is 99x + 100x + 101x = 300x, and we know this equals 4500 (<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans</fact3>).
Therefore, x = 4500 / 300 = 15.
So, there are 101 * 15 = 1515 green jelly beans and 99 * 15 = 1485 red jelly beans.
The difference is 1515 - 1485 = 30.
Therefore, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

Finally, the Mastiff weighed <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">44 times</fact4> the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Papillon's</fact3> weight of 5 pounds, meaning the Mastiff weighed <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">44</fact4>*5=220 pounds.
The answer is {220}.</div></div>

Adding the porcelain crown, the total cost of the dental work will be $4000 + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$500</fact3> = $4500
Subtracting his deposit, George still owes $4500 - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$600</fact4> = $3900
Thus, George needs to work $3900/<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$15</fact5>/hour = 260 hours.

After Gunther added more bananas, he had 24 + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">25</fact3> = 49 bananas.
After Arnold stole more bananas, Gunther had 49 - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">12</fact4> = 37 bananas.
When Gunther counted his bananas, he had 37 + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">6</fact5> = 43 bananas.

How much does replacing the movies cost if <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">a normal movie costs $10</fact4>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Mike has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">600</fact1>/3 = 200 movies that are part of a series.
That means <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">600</fact1>-200 = 400 of the movies are not part of a series.
The series movies will cost him 200*<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$6</fact2> = $1200.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">40%</fact3> of the remaining movies are older, which is .40*400 = 160 movies.
So 400-160 = 240 of the movies are normal priced.
Those will cost him 240*<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$10</fact4> = $2400.
The older movies will cost him 160*<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$5</fact3> = $800.
So in total, it will cost him $1200+$2400+$800 = $4400 to replace his movie collection

As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">drops 1 of each</fact5> and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Rose begins with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 flowers</fact1> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 petals/flower</fact1> = 15 petals on the first set of flowers.
She then adds <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 flowers</fact2> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 petals/flower</fact2> = 24 petals from the second set.
The third set of flowers adds <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 flowers</fact3> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 petals/flower</fact3> = 20 petals.
Finally, before she drops any, the last set of flowers adds <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 flowers</fact4> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">7 petals/flower</fact4> = 42 petals.
That means, in total, she picked 15+24+20+42 = 101 petals worth of flowers
However, because she <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">drops one of each flower</fact5>, she loses <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6</fact2> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4</fact3> + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">7</fact4> = 22 petals from the dropped flowers.

* **Julie's score in the first game:** Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha's 14 points in the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">first game</fact1>, so she scored <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">14</fact2> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4</fact3> = 10 points.
* **Sasha's score in the second game:** <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game</fact5>, meaning she scored 10 - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">6</fact5> = 4 points in the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">second game</fact4>.
* **Sasha's total score:** To find Sasha's total score, we add her score from the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">first game</fact1> and the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">second game</fact4>: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">14</fact2> + 4 = 18 points.

So, over three years, the town will build a total of 96 + 48 = 144 homes.

If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day</fact3>, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>After the rain, the amount of water passing through the river is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">doubled</fact2>, meaning it becomes <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4000 gallons</fact1> * 2 = 8000 gallons.
With the increase on the third day, the total amount of water passing through becomes 8000 gallons + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6000 gallons</fact3> = 14000 gallons.
Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is 14000 gallons.

If <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon</fact2>, then each pack costs 2 * 2 = $4.
So her 6 packets of chicken cost 6 * 4 = $24.
Her <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">strawberries cost $4 each</fact3> so <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 packs cost</fact3> 3 * 4 = $12.
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Each pack of apples costs half the price of the strawberries</fact4>, which is 4 / 2 = $2 per pack of apples.

They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">500 gallons of water per day</fact3>, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 days</fact4>?

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**
* Half the amount of water in the pool is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10000</fact1> / 2 = 5000 gallons, so the tank starts with <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5000</fact2> gallons of water.

He then finishes the remaining distance while going <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">half the speed</fact5>.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to break down the solution:

* **Distance of the first leg:** James swims <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">60%</fact3> of the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20-mile</fact1> lake, which is 0.60 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> = 12 miles.

* **Time for the first leg:** He swims the first 12 miles at <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 miles per hour</fact2>, so it takes him 12 / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2</fact2> = 6 hours.

* **Rest time:** James rests for <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">half</fact4> the time of his first leg, which is 6 hours * 0.5 = 3 hours.

* **Distance of the second leg:**  The remaining distance is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

* **Speed of the second leg:**  James swims at <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">half</fact5> his normal speed, which is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2</fact2> miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour.

* **Time for the second leg:**  At 1 mile per hour, the second leg takes him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

* **Total time:**  The total time is 6 hours (first leg) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (second leg) = 17 hours.

**Therefore, it took James 17 hours to get across the lake.**</div></div>

Andy works in the pro shop of a tennis resort. He has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 racquets</fact1> that need restringing. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 of them are to be strung with synthetic gut</fact2>, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 of them will be strung with polyester string</fact3>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 of them will be strung with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string)</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">How long will it take Andy to string all of those racquets if it takes him an average of 15 minutes for him to string with synthetic gut, 22 minutes to string with polyester string, and 18 minutes for hybrid sets</fact5>?

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**

* **Synthetic Gut Time:** Andy needs to string <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 racquets</fact2> with synthetic gut, and it takes him <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">15 minutes per racquet</fact5>. So, this will take him 3 * 15 = 45 minutes. 

* **Polyester String Time:** He has <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 racquets</fact3> that require polyester string, and each takes <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">22 minutes</fact5>. This will take 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.

* **Hybrid String Time:**  With <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 racquets</fact4> needing hybrid strings, and each taking <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18 minutes</fact5>, he'll spend 4 * 18 = 72 minutes on them.

**Total Time:** To find the total time, add up the time for each string type: 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes.

**Therefore, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.**</div></div>

That means he sold <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5</fact3> = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
On Saturday, Sunny earned <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1> * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$6</fact5> + 11 * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$15</fact6> = $60 + $165 = $225

The air conditioner <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">ran on low for 3 hours</fact4>, then <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">it was turned up to high for 4 hours</fact5>. Afterward, <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">it was turned off for 2 hours</fact6>. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>In the first <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 hours</fact4>, the air conditioner cooled the room <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3</fact4> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2</fact1> = 6 degrees.
Then in the next <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4 hours</fact5>, the air conditioner cooled the room another <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4</fact5> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3</fact2> = 12 degrees.
This means in total, the air conditioner cooled the room down 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
However, the <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 hours</fact6> the air conditioner was off, the room warmed back up by <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2</fact6>*<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2</fact3> = 4 degrees.
This makes the final temperature 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than it initially was.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Three-quarters of the first plane's trips</fact1> are to Greece, totaling (3/4) * 88 trips = 66 trips.
This leaves 88 total trips - 66 trips to Greece = 22 trips that are not to Greece.
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Half of the remaining flights are to France</fact2>, so the first plane makes 22 trips / 2 = 11 trips to France.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined</fact3>, so he howls for <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1>+40 = 60 seconds.
Thus, all three wolves howl for a total of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1>+40+60 = 120 seconds.

The cake would require <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 hours to cool</fact3> and an additional <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 minutes to frost the cake</fact4>.  If she plans to make the cake all on the same day, what is the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5:00 pm</fact5>?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>It will take <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 hours</fact3> * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes for the cake to cool. 

In total, Jordan needs <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 minutes</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30 minutes</fact2> + 120 minutes + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 minutes</fact4> = 180 minutes to prepare the cake.

This is equal to 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

Therefore, to serve the cake at <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5:00 pm</fact5>, the latest Jordan can start making the cake is <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5:00 pm</fact5> - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>After Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, there are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12</fact1>-<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1</fact3>=11 sodas left.
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Her brother then takes 3 sodas</fact4>, leaving 11-<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3</fact4>=8 sodas remaining.
Originally, Ellen shook up <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 sodas</fact2>, and since her brother took <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1 shaken soda</fact4>, there are <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3</fact2>-<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1</fact4>=2 shaken sodas left.
Therefore, there is a 2/8=0.25=25% chance that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda.

What is the new balance on her credit card?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>After returning the item her new balance was <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$85.00</fact1> - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$15.00</fact2> = $70.00. The discount for the frying pan was <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$20.00</fact3> * 0.20 = $4.00, so the frying pan cost <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$20.00</fact3> - $4.00 = $16.00. The discount for the towels was $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00, so the towels cost <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$30.00</fact4> - $3.00 = $27.00. Therefore, the total cost of her new purchases was $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00. Therefore, after her purchases, her new credit card balance is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00
The answer is {113.00}.</div></div>

The second group of workers produces 2 workers * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 toys/worker/hour</fact4> = 8 toys per hour.
Together, the first four workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.
Over the <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">10-hour shift</fact5>, they produce 20 toys/hour * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">10 hours</fact5> = 200 toys.
This means the fifth worker must produce <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">400 toys</fact1> - 200 toys - <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20 toys</fact6> = 180 toys during the shift.

If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Since Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach at a speed that takes her 40 minutes, she walks at a rate of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 miles</fact2> / <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">40 minutes</fact5> = 1 mile every 20 minutes on the beach.  Because she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1 mile / 20 minutes) = 1 mile every 10 minutes. Therefore, her time spent on the sidewalk is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1 mile</fact3> / (1 mile / 10 minutes) = 10 minutes.

At least how many degrees is the second bottle?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Since Donny <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">can now drink the water</fact5>, we know the mix is at least 40 degrees.  He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">used 4 times as much of the 33-degree water</fact3>, so we can essentially say that the mix is 4 parts 33 degrees and 1 part the unknown temperature. If all 5 parts were 33 degrees, the mix would be 33 degrees.  Since we need the mix to be at least 7 degrees warmer than that (40 degrees - 33 degrees= 7 degrees), and we have 5 parts, the unknown temperature needs to be at least 7 degrees * 5 parts = 35 degrees warmer than 33 degrees.

* **Third day:** They ended the third day with <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">78 bandages</fact7> and used half a pack, which is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50/2 = 25 bandages</fact1>.  So, before using any on the third day, they had <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">78</fact7> + 25 = 103 bandages.
* **Third day (continued):** They ordered two bulk packs (<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 * 50 = 100 bandages</fact5>) on the third day. Therefore, before the order arrived, they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages. 
* **Second day:** On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, meaning they used <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">38</fact2> - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10</fact4> = 28 bandages. 
* **First day (end):** This means at the end of the first day, they had 3 + 28 = 31 bandages.
* **First day (start):** They ordered a bulk pack (<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50 bandages</fact3>) on the first day, so before the order, they had 31 - 50 = -19 bandages. This is impossible, meaning there's an error in the information given. 

**Conclusion:** It seems like there's a mistake in the problem. It's impossible for them to have a negative number of bandages.</div></div>

Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>On the first day, Mr. Julius planted <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak</fact2>, meaning he planted 2*<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.
Therefore, the total number of trees planted on the first day is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> + 40 = 60 trees
On the second day, he planted <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day</fact4>, meaning he planted (1/4)*40 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.
In total, on the second day he planted 40+10 = 50 Lodgepole pines.
He also planted <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 more White Oak trees on the second day</fact3>, bringing the total number of White Oak trees planted on the second day to <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1>+<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10</fact3> = 30 trees
Thus, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 50+30 = 80 trees.
Adding the number of trees from both days, Mr. Julius planted a total of 60+80 = 140 trees.

Then account for the packing efficiency of the jelly beans: 540 cubic inches * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">.8</fact4> = 432 cubic inches of jelly beans
Then figure out how many jelly beans that would be: 432 cubic inches / <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">.15 cubic inches per jelly bean</fact3> = 2880 jelly beans
Then multiply that number by the percentage that Tim estimates are red: 2880 jelly beans * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">.3</fact5> = 864 red jelly beans
Finally, calculate how far off that estimate is from the real number: 864 red jelly beans - <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">900 red jelly beans</fact6> = -36

If <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">only 8 students can try the escape room at a time</fact2>, then they'll need 40 students / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8 students per group</fact2> = 5 groups to allow all the students to participate.
Since each group takes <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">45 minutes</fact3>, all the students will need 5 groups * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">45 minutes per group</fact3> = 225 minutes to try the escape room.
The answer is {225}.</div></div>

If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 1-hour lessons with a veteran</fact4>, what is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First find how much Charlie makes from the <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">lessons at his standard rate</fact3>: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 lessons</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$80/lesson</fact1> = $320
Then calculate how much Charlie charges per hour for lessons with veterans: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$80/lesson</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">.25 discount</fact2> = $20 discount, so he charges <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$80</fact1> - $20 = $60 per lesson
Then find how much money Charlie makes from the veteran lessons: $60/lesson * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 lessons</fact4> = $120
Finally, add the money made from both types of lessons to find the total amount made: $320 + $120 = $440
So the answer is {440}.</div></div>

There are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8 rooms</fact1> in the house and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 people</fact2> living there, including Brianna. There is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">a flashlight for every person to carry</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">two for each room</fact4>. They have a variety of candles available; <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4 small candles each for half the rooms</fact5> and <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms</fact6>. <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">With everything combined</fact7>, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Brianna's family has <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4</fact2>*<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1</fact3> = 4 flashlights for each person.
They also have <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8</fact1>*<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2</fact4> = 16 flashlights for the house.
So in total, they have 16 + 4 = 20 flashlights.
They also have <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8</fact1>/2 = 4 rooms that need small candles.
That means they need <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4</fact5>*4 = 16 small candles.
The other <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8</fact1>/2 = 4 rooms need medium candles.
That's <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">5</fact6>*4 = 20 medium candles.
They have 20 + 16 = 36 candles in total.
So, with everything combined, Brianna's family is using <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">36 candles</fact7> + 20 flashlights = 56 candles and flashlights.
