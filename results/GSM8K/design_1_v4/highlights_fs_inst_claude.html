How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day</fact1>.
2. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">There are 20 chickens in Wendi's flock</fact5>.
3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The feed is given in three separate meals</fact2>.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed needed for all chickens:
20 chickens * 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups of feed per day

Now, we know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15 cups are given in the morning</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">25 cups are given in the afternoon</fact4>. So, we can subtract these from the total:

60 cups (total) - 15 cups (morning) - 25 cups (afternoon) = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The answer is {20}.</div></div>

He tries to get home in 4 hours but <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic</fact2>. He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph</fact3>, before being able to <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph</fact4>. How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">John initially drives 3 hours at 60 mph</fact1>. This means he travels 3 * 60 = 180 miles away from home.

2. He then turns back, trying to get home in 4 hours:
   - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He spends 2 hours in standstill traffic</fact2>, so he doesn't move during this time.
   - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He drives for 0.5 hours (half an hour) at 30 mph</fact3>. This covers 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.
   - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">He spends the remaining time at 80 mph</fact4>. The remaining time is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
     In this time, he covers 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

3. Total distance covered on the return journey: 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. Distance from home: 180 - 135 = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is still 45 miles away from home.

The answer is {45}.</div></div>

His financial advisor speculates that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the jewelry market will go up 2.5%</fact3> while <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the electronic gadgets market will rise 1.2%</fact4> within the same month. If the merchant is looking to maximize profit at the end of this month by making a choice, how much profit would this be?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To maximize profit, we need to compare the potential gains from both options:

For jewelry:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$5,000</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2.5%</fact3> = $125 profit

For electronic gadgets:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$8,000</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1.2%</fact4> = $96 profit

The jewelry option provides a higher profit of $125, so the merchant should choose this option to maximize profit.

The answer is {125}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>3/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies</fact1> for the fireman's luncheon. She <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">cut each pie into 8 pieces</fact2> and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">there were 14 pieces of pie remaining</fact3>. How many pieces were taken by the guests?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of pieces from all pies
2. Subtract the remaining pieces from the total

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Grandma Jones baked 5 pies</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each pie was cut into 8 pieces</fact2>.
So, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40 pieces.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">There were 14 pieces remaining</fact3> at the end of the evening.

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
40 total pieces - 14 remaining pieces = 26 pieces

The answer is {26}.</div></div>

Last week, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">she wrote 5 articles on Monday</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</fact4>. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total hours Meredith spent writing articles in three days, we need to determine the number of articles written each day and multiply by the time per article.

For Monday: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">She wrote 5 articles</fact2>
For Tuesday: She wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles
For Wednesday: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">She wrote twice the number of Tuesday</fact4>, so 7 * 2 = 14 articles

Total articles: 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each article takes 4 hours</fact1>, so:
Total hours = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The answer is {104}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>5/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse</fact1> before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop. On her way, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes</fact2>; At work, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee</fact3>. If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall</fact4>, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given:

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Candice had 23 post-it notes remaining</fact4> after using some.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">She used 220 post-it notes at work</fact3>.
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">She started with 80 post-it notes in her purse</fact1>.

Total post-it notes used and remaining: 220 + 23 = 243
Total post-it notes needed: 243
Total post-it notes she started with: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">80</fact1>

The difference between what she needed and what she started with must be the number of post-it notes in the package she bought:

243 - 80 = 163

Therefore, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased</fact2> contained 163 post-it notes.

The answer is {163}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>6/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires</fact4>. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the revenue for each day:

Thursday's revenue:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$60 per truck tire</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 truck tires</fact3> = $360
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$40 per car tire</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 car tires</fact3> = $160
Total for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Friday's revenue:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$40 per car tire</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">12 car tires</fact4> = $480
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">No truck tires repaired on Friday</fact4>, so $0 for truck tires
Total for Friday: $480 + $0 = $480

The day with higher revenue was Thursday with $520.
The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

The answer is {40}.</div></div>

She says that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens</fact2>, while <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Trixie, the other cat, has had 12</fact3>. How many kittens does the Doubtfire family now have?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of kittens:

1. Adopted kittens: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 kittens</fact1>

2. Patchy's kittens: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Thrice the number of adopted kittens</fact2>
   3 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7</fact1> = 21 kittens

3. Trixie's kittens: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 kittens</fact3>

Total kittens = Adopted + Patchy's + Trixie's
               = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7</fact1> + 21 + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12</fact3>
               = 40 kittens

The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total.

The answer is {40}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>8/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds</fact1>. A delivery truck filled with <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds</fact2>, will pass over the bridge. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds</fact3>. What is the maximum number of boxes which can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the maximum number of boxes, we need to:
1. Calculate the remaining weight capacity: 
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5000 pounds (bridge limit)</fact1> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3755 pounds (truck and driver)</fact3> = 1245 pounds

2. Divide the remaining capacity by the weight of each box:
   1245 pounds / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 pounds per box</fact2> = 83 boxes

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83 boxes.

The answer is {83}.</div></div>

How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then multiply it by the tank capacity.

First, let's calculate the fuel efficiency:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100 miles</fact1> were driven using <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 gallons</fact2> of gas.
So, the fuel efficiency is 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Now, we know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the tank holds 12 gallons of gas</fact3>.

Therefore, on a full tank, Sophia can drive:
25 miles/gallon * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 gallons</fact3> = 300 miles

The answer is {300}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>10/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot</fact1>, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">petunias for $1.87 per pot</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">begonias for $2.12 per pot</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>. If Artie <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">sells 12 pots of marigolds</fact5>, <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">9 pots of petunias</fact6> and <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">17 pots of begonias</fact7>, how much will he make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to round the prices to the nearest dollar and then calculate the total:

1. Rounding prices:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Marigolds: $2.74</fact1> rounds to $3
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Petunias: $1.87</fact2> rounds to $2
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Begonias: $2.12</fact3> rounds to $2

2. Calculating total sales:
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Marigolds: 12 pots</fact5> * $3 = $36
   <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Petunias: 9 pots</fact6> * $2 = $18
   <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">Begonias: 17 pots</fact7> * $2 = $34

3. Total amount:
   $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Therefore, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">after rounding his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>, Artie will make $88 from selling the specified number of flower pots.

The answer is {88}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>11/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Gene is sewing a quilt out of old souvenir t-shirts. He has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">one shirt from each vacation he has been on</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Every shirt is its own quilt block</fact2>. Each row is made of blocks from a different year of vacations. He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">goes on four vacations a year</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">has been vacationing since he was 23 years old</fact4>. He <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">is now 34</fact5>. How many quilt blocks does he have in total?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of quilt blocks, we need to determine how many years Gene has been vacationing and multiply that by the number of vacations per year.

Gene <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">started vacationing at 23</fact4> and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">is now 34</fact5>, so he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He goes on four vacations each year</fact3>, so the total number of vacations (and therefore quilt blocks) is:

11 years * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 vacations per year</fact3> = 44 vacations

Since <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">he has one shirt from each vacation</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">every shirt is its own quilt block</fact2>, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total.

The answer is {44}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>12/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The first time it went off today, it rang four times.</fact1> <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time.</fact2> <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time.</fact3> How many times did the alarm ring in all?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The first time, the alarm rang 4 times.</fact1>

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time.</fact2>
   So, the second time it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time.</fact3>
   The second time was 12 rings, so half of that is 12 / 2 = 6 times.

4. To get the total number of rings, we add all these together:
   4 + 12 + 6 = 22

Therefore, the alarm rang 22 times in total.

The answer is {22}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>13/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A company <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">pays each of its employees $600 in a month</fact1>. The company has a policy of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year</fact2> for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">those who've stayed in the company for five years</fact3>. If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December</fact4>, what's her annual salary after <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">three more years of service</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600</fact1>. Her annual salary would be $600 * 12 = $7,200.

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Sylvie has just completed 5 years</fact4>, so <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">she's eligible for the 10% increase every year</fact2>.

3. The 10% increase is based on the initial salary. So each year, her salary will increase by $7,200 * 10% = $720.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">We need to calculate her salary after three more years</fact5>. So that's three increases of $720 each.

5. Total increase over three years: $720 * 3 = $2,160

6. Her new annual salary will be: $7,200 (initial) + $2,160 (total increase) = $9,360

Therefore, after <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">three more years of service</fact5>, Sylvie's annual salary will be $9,360.

The answer is {9360}.</div></div>

He knows that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">a child will eat half as much as an adult</fact2>. If there will be <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 adults and 5 children at the picnic</fact3>, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to consider both adults and children:

For adults:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 lbs per adult</fact1> × <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 adults</fact3> = 200 lbs

For children:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Half of an adult's portion</fact2> = 10 lbs ÷ 2 = 5 lbs per child
5 lbs per child × <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 children</fact3> = 25 lbs

Total amount needed:
200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to have enough to feed everyone at the picnic.

The answer is {225}.</div></div>

If there were <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">originally 30 cars on the motorway</fact4>, how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to work backwards:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">There were originally 30 cars on the motorway</fact4>.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 cars took an exit and didn't go through the traffic jam</fact3>, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars went through the jam.
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 cars went through in the last 15 minutes</fact2>.
So, the number of cars that went through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5 cars.
We can verify this: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 cars in the first 15 minutes</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 cars in the last 15 minutes</fact2> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 cars that exited</fact3> = <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">30 original cars</fact4>.
Therefore, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.
The answer is {5}.</div></div>

How many potted plants will Mary remain with?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to calculate:

1. The total number of plants she currently has:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 plants per ledge * 40 ledges</fact2> = 80 plants on ledges
   Plus <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">18 new plants</fact1> = 98 total plants

2. The number of plants she will give away:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1 plant from each ledge</fact3> * 40 ledges = 40 plants

3. The remaining plants:
   98 total plants - 40 plants given away = 58 plants

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

The answer is {58}.</div></div>

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times</fact4>, how many doorbell rings did the doorbell make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of doorbell rings for each friend:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend</fact2>. 
   This means: 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times</fact4>.

4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend</fact3>.
   This means: 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add up all the doorbell rings:
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 doorbell rings in total.

The answer is {175}.</div></div>

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours</fact1>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours</fact3>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Friday: 2 hours</fact4>

Total time for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday: 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The total time for the week was 7 hours</fact5>, so the time spent watching TV on Wednesday was:
7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On Wednesday, Frankie watched 30-minute episodes</fact2>. To find out how many episodes he watched, we divide the total time by 30 minutes:

1.5 hours = 90 minutes
90 minutes ÷ 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The answer is {3}.</div></div>

1. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Henry now has 110 cookies</fact4> after dropping some.
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He dropped 5 cookies</fact3>, so before dropping them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.
3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He baked 15 more than he meant to</fact2>, so he originally intended to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
4. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">He wanted to make twice as many as last year</fact1>, which means 100 cookies is twice the amount he made last year.
5. Therefore, last year Henry baked 100 ÷ 2 = 50 cookies.

If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">they both ate their entire amount</fact3>, how many did they eat on average?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many they ate on average, we first need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 roll-ups wide * 24 roll-ups long = 48 roll-ups</fact1>

For Marcell: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 roll-ups wide * 14 roll-ups long = 42 roll-ups</fact2>

Total roll-ups eaten: 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups

Since <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">they both ate their entire amount</fact3>, we need to divide the total by 2 to get the average:

90 roll-ups ÷ 2 = 45 roll-ups

Therefore, on average, they each ate 45 roll-ups.

The answer is {45}.</div></div>

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs</fact3>. 
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">This is 6 times more than Brittany's phone</fact1>, so Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Brittany's phone capacity (300) is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph</fact2>.
So, the number of ducks in the photograph is 300 / 50 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

The answer is {6}.</div></div>

How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards:

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Julia ended up with 12 spoons in total</fact4>.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">She used 3 spoons while cooking</fact3>, so before that, she had 12 + 3 = 15 spoons.
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Her husband gave her 5 spoons</fact2>, so before that, she had 15 - 5 = 10 spoons.

Since <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Julia was out of spoons and bought a new package</fact1>, these 10 spoons must have been the ones she bought.

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

The answer is {10}.</div></div>

Then <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours</fact4>. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many bees returned in the last 6 hours, we need to calculate:

1. How many bees left in total:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 bees left in the first 6 hours</fact1>
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Two times as many (60 bees) left in the next 6 hours</fact3>
   Total bees that left = 30 + 60 = 90 bees

2. How many bees returned before the last 6 hours:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1/2 of the first group returned in the second 6-hour period</fact2>
   1/2 * 30 = 15 bees returned

3. Bees that return in the last 6 hours:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">All bees that left and hadn't returned come back in the last 6 hours</fact4>
   Total bees returning = Total bees that left - Bees that already returned
   90 - 15 = 75 bees

If <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute</fact6>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to calculate how long it takes each person to get home and then find the difference.

For Steve:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Steve's distance: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 = 15,840 feet</fact3>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Steve's speed: 440 feet per minute</fact4>
Steve's time = 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes

For Tim:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Tim's distance: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 = 10,560 feet</fact5>
<fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Tim's speed: 264 feet per minute</fact6>
Tim's time = 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The winner will be the one who gets home fastest</fact1>, which is Steve at 36 minutes. Tim will arrive 4 minutes later.

Therefore, Steve (the winner) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before Tim (the loser) finishes the race.

She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</fact1>. On the first day, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated</fact3>. Finally, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">one person actually came by on a unicycle</fact4>. How many dollars did she make that day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the amount Shawnda made for each type of vehicle:

1. Bicycles: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5 bicycles</fact2> with 2 tires each = 10 tires
   10 tires × <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">25 cents per tire</fact1> = 250 cents = $2.50

2. Tricycles: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 tricycles</fact3> with 3 tires each = 9 tires
   9 tires × <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">25 cents per tire</fact1> = 225 cents = $2.25

3. Unicycle: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1 unicycle</fact4> with 1 tire
   1 tire × <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">25 cents per tire</fact1> = 25 cents = $0.25

Total amount: $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day.

The answer is {5.00}.</div></div>

Then <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries</fact3>. Later, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind</fact5>. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's work backwards to find the original number of fries:

1. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">There were 5 fries left after the ants took 1</fact5>, so before the ants, there were 6 fries.

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The raccoon stole 2/3 of the fries before this</fact4>. If 6 fries represent 1/3 of what was left after the raccoon, then before the raccoon there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Before the raccoon, 3 pigeons each ate 3 fries</fact3>. So before the pigeons, there were 18 + (3 * 3) = 27 fries.

4. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The seagull ate half of what Dave ate</fact2>. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Dave ate 14 fries</fact1>, so the seagull ate 7 fries. Before the seagull, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

5. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Dave ate 14 fries</fact1> at the beginning. So the original number of fries was 34 + 14 = 48.

Therefore, there were 48 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

She does this 34 times</fact4>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the distance each person ran:

Blake's distance:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Blake runs back and forth 15 times</fact2> on the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100-yard field</fact1>.
Each back and forth is 100 yards * 2 = 200 yards
Total distance for Blake: 15 * 200 = 3000 yards

Kelly's distance:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Kelly runs back and forth once</fact3> on the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100-yard field</fact1>: 100 * 2 = 200 yards
Then, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times</fact4>.
Each of these shorter runs is 40 * 2 = 80 yards
Total distance for Kelly: 200 + (34 * 80) = 2920 yards

Blake ran 3000 yards, while Kelly ran 2920 yards.
Blake is the winner, and he ran 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards farther than Kelly.

The answer is {80}.</div></div>

It's a big event, so <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">he has 60 potatoes to get through</fact1>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact2>, but <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">only about 5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total time, we need to consider both peeling and cutting times for all potatoes:

Peeling time: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60 potatoes</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1.5 minutes</fact2> = 90 minutes

Cutting time: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60 potatoes</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 seconds</fact3> = 300 seconds = 5 minutes

Total time: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

To convert this to hours and minutes:

Therefore, it will take Billy 1 hour and 35 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

The answer is {95} minutes or 1 hour and 35 minutes.</div></div>

If <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Zaid earns 6000$ per month</fact6>, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Zaid's monthly salary is $6000</fact6>

2. Rent: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1/4 of $6000 = $1500</fact1>

3. Car fuel: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1/3 of $6000 = $2000</fact2>

4. Remaining amount after rent and fuel: $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500

5. Charity donation: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Half of the remaining $2500 = $1250</fact3>

6. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Daughter's expenses: $200</fact4>

7. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Wife's budget: $700</fact5>

8. Total expenses and donations:

She also ordered <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">200 pink calla lilies</fact2>, which were <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">five times the number of white carnations</fact3>. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to calculate the number of white carnations first, as the number of red roses is based on this.

From <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;"> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">, we can determine the number of white carnations:
200 pink calla lilies = 5 * white carnations
So, the number of white carnations = 200 / 5 = 40

Now, using <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">, we can calculate the number of red roses:
Red roses = 4 * white carnations = 4 * 40 = 160

There are <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw</fact4>. There is also <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</fact5>. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, how many rats are in each cage?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. For the hamsters, we know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">there are 10 cages</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw</fact4>. So, the total straw used for hamsters is 10 * 5 = 50 pieces.

2. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The rabbits use 20 pieces of straw</fact5>.

3. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">The total straw used is 160 pieces</fact6>. So, the straw used for rats is 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces.

4. We know that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each rat gets 6 pieces of straw</fact2>. So, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

5. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups</fact1>. So, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5 rats.

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The answer is {5}.</div></div>

In the second month, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month</fact3>. In the third month, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months</fact4>. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Initial cards: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Elaine started with 20 cards</fact1>

2. First month:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">She collected 3 times her initial number</fact2>
   3 * 20 = 60 cards

3. Second month:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">She collected 20 fewer than the first month</fact3>
   60 - 20 = 40 cards

4. Third month:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">She collected twice the combined number from first and second months</fact4>
   (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards

5. Total cards:
   Initial + First month + Second month + Third month
   20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokemon cards in total.

The answer is {320}.</div></div>

How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, we need to break it down step by step:

1. Since <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher</fact1>, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he edits 1000 sentences in total</fact3>, he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence</fact4>. So for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays</fact2>. So Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B

4. Total earnings:
   2500 cents (from Publisher A) + 5000 cents (from Publisher B) = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

The answer is {7500}.</div></div>

If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting</fact5>, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy
2. Calculate how much money she has after babysitting
3. Determine how much more money she needs
4. Figure out how many lawn mowings it will take to earn that amount

The total cost of the items is:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$30 for the jacket</fact1> + (<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$20 per pair of shoes</fact2> × 2 pairs) = $70

Sara's money after babysitting:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$10 initial savings</fact5> + (<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$5 per babysitting session</fact3> × 4 sessions) = $30

Sara still needs: $70 - $30 = $40

Number of lawn mowings needed:
$40 / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$4 per lawn mowing</fact4> = 10 lawn mowings

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

When she came back two weeks later, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them</fact3>. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Initially, there were <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">120 watermelons</fact1>.

2. After two months, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30% were harvested</fact2>. This means:
   30% of 120 = 0.3 × 120 = 36 watermelons were harvested
   Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

3. Two weeks later, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3/4 of the remaining melons were harvested</fact3>:
   3/4 of 84 = (3/4) × 84 = 63 watermelons were harvested

4. Watermelons not ready for harvest:
   84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

Therefore, after the two weeks, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested.

The answer is {21}.</div></div>

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The total number of students is 1000</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30% of students left through exit A</fact2>. This means:
   30% of 1000 = 0.30 × 1000 = 300 students left through exit A

3. The number of remaining students after exit A:
   1000 - 300 = 700 students remained

4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B</fact3>. This means:
   3/5 of 700 = (3/5) × 700 = 420 students left through exit B

5. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The rest of the students left through exit C</fact4>. To find this number:
   Total remaining after exit B = 700 - 420 = 280 students

Therefore, 280 students went out through exit C.

After the movie is done <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount because of the amount of work done</fact5>. How much did Jean pay?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much Jean paid, we need to determine the total hours of makeup work and the total cost before the discount:

1. Hours per week: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 hours per day</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 days per week</fact3> = 24 hours per week
2. Total hours: 24 hours per week * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 weeks</fact4> = 120 hours

3. Total cost before discount: 120 hours * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$250 per hour</fact1> = $30,000

4. Discount amount: $30,000 * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">10% discount</fact5> = $3,000

How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total price of the house:

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Selling price: $350,000</fact2>
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 = $17,500</fact3>
3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 = $42,000</fact4>

Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

How many lines does Sean have to memorize?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. For the solo song, Sean needs to memorize <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">54 lines</fact1>.

2. The first scene has <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">twice the number of lines as the song</fact2>, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines total. However, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">only a third of these are Sean's lines</fact3>, which means 108 * 1/3 = 36 lines for Sean to memorize from this scene.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The second scene has 6 more lines than the song</fact4>, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines total. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Four-fifths of these are Sean's lines</fact5>, which means 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines for Sean to memorize from this scene.

4. To get the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize, we add up all his lines:
   54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines

Therefore, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total.</div></div>

1. Calculate the total length occupied by topaz gemstones:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8 gemstones</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1 inch per gemstone</fact2> = 8 inches

2. Calculate the remaining length for sterling silver beads:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">25 inches total</fact4> - 8 inches of topaz = 17 inches

3. Calculate how many sterling silver beads fit in the remaining length:
   17 inches / <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">0.25 inches per bead</fact3> = 68 beads

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

How many pieces of paper would be used in a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">32-page tabloid</fact3>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">32-page tabloid</fact3>, we need to consider how many pages can be printed on a single piece of paper. 

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">By folding a piece of paper vertically and unfolding</fact1>, we create four printable surfaces: the left back, left front, right back, and right front.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">As stated in the question, we can print four pages on a single piece of paper: two on the left side (front and back) and two on the right side (front and back)</fact2>.

Since we can print 4 pages per piece of paper, and we need <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">32 pages in total</fact3>, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper needed as follows:

32 pages ÷ 4 pages per piece of paper = 8 pieces of paper

Therefore, a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">32-page tabloid</fact3> would require 8 pieces of paper.

1. Cost of business suits: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 * $100 = $600</fact2>
2. Cost of suitcases: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 * $50 = $150</fact3>
3. Cost of flight ticket: 
   - Cost of one business suit is $100
   - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 times the cost of a business suit: 5 * $100 = $500</fact4>
   - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Flight ticket costs $700 more than that: $500 + $700 = $1200</fact4>

Total expenses so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Theo has $6000 to spend</fact1>, and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">he wishes to save $2000</fact5>. 
So, the amount available for spending is: $6000 - $2000 = $4000

Amount left for gifts: $4000 - $1950 = $2050

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

If <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45</fact2>, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3</fact1>. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">We know there are 45 electric wires in total</fact2>.

3. To find out how many sets of "1 pole : 3 wires" are in 45 wires, we divide 45 by 3:
   45 ÷ 3 = 15

4. This means there are 15 sets of "1 pole : 3 wires".

5. Since each set has 1 pole, and there are 15 sets, the total number of poles is 15.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>49/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Jaime is a computer programmer for a company that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">currently has employed 100 people</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers</fact2>. If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees</fact3>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">they are each paid $2000 per month</fact4>, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total amount paid to all programmers, we need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers and their respective salaries.

Number of junior programmers:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2/5 of the total employees</fact3> = 2/5 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1> = 40 junior programmers

Number of senior programmers:
Total employees - Junior programmers = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1> - 40 = 60 senior programmers

Monthly salary for junior programmers:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$2000 per month</fact4>

Monthly salary for senior programmers:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$2000</fact4> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$400</fact2> = $2400 per month

Total monthly payment for junior programmers:
40 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$2000</fact4> = $80,000

Total monthly payment for senior programmers:
60 * $2400 = $144,000

Total monthly payment for all programmers:
$80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

Therefore, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all programmers per month.

The answer is {224000}.</div></div>

How many dollars did the customer pay on this shopping trip?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, let's calculate the rewards from the previous shopping trip:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$80</fact2> / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$20 per reward</fact1> = 4 rewards, so they had $4 in rewards.

Now, for this shopping trip:
Initial amount: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$43</fact3>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Subtract rewards</fact4>: $43 - $4 = $39
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Apply coupon (twice the rewards)</fact5>: $39 - (2 * $4) = $39 - $8 = $31

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.

The answer is {31}.</div></div>

How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the net pay for each job:

Job A:
Gross income: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$15 * 2000 hours = $30,000</fact1>
Tax: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20% of $30,000 = $6,000</fact2>
Net income: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Gross income: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$42,000</fact3>
Property tax: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$6,000</fact4>
Taxable income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Income tax: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">10% of $36,000 = $3,600</fact5>
Total tax: $6,000 + $3,600 = $9,600
Net income: $42,000 - $9,600 = $32,400

Job B has a higher net pay rate. The difference is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

The answer is {8400}.</div></div>

How many hours will all Peyton's after-work activities take?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the duration of each activity:

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Monday's yoga class: 1 hour</fact1>

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Tuesday's cooking class: 3 times Monday's yoga</fact2> = 3 * 1 = 3 hours

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Wednesday's cheese-tasting: 0.5 hours</fact3>

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Thursday's museum tour: half as long as the cooking class</fact4> = 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Friday's errands: 2 hours</fact5>

Now, let's add up all the hours:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours

Therefore, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take 8 hours in total.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">75 miles</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">100 miles</fact2> = 175 miles (first to second to third city)
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50 miles less than 175</fact3> = 175 - 50 = 125 miles (third city back to first)
Total distance per trip: 175 + 125 = 300 miles

Daily distance:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 trips per day</fact4> * 300 miles per trip = 900 miles per day

Days between services:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18,000 miles</fact5> / 900 miles per day = 20 days

The train goes 20 days between services.

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart</fact4>, how many were kicked out for other reasons?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks</fact1>

2. For shoplifting: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 times the number of mask refusers, minus 5</fact2>
   4 * 3 - 5 = 7 people kicked out for shoplifting

3. For physical violence: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 times the number of shoplifters</fact3>
   3 * 7 = 21 people kicked out for physical violence

4. Total kicked out for known reasons:
   3 (masks) + 7 (shoplifting) + 21 (violence) = 31 people

5. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Total people kicked out: 50</fact4>

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total cost of senior gifts, we need to consider all the components:

1. Picture frames:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44 seniors</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$20 per frame</fact2> = $880

2. Etching cost:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20% additional cost</fact3> of $880 = $176

3. Pins:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 seniors receive $5 pins</fact4> = $10

4. Cords for officers:
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1/4 of 44 seniors</fact5> = 11 officers
   11 officers * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$12 per cord</fact5> = $132

How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of tennis shoes sold:

1. Friday's sales: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">14 pairs</fact1>

2. Saturday's sales: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Double Friday's sales</fact2>, so 14 * 2 = 28 pairs

3. Sunday's sales: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Half of Saturday's sales</fact3>, so 28 / 2 = 14 pairs

4. Total sales before returns: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs

If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we need to determine her total revenue, total cost, and the time it takes to sell all the lemonade.

Total lemonade available: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 pitchers</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 cups per pitcher</fact2> = 36 cups

Total revenue: 36 cups * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1 per cup</fact3> = $36

Total cost: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$18</fact1>

Profit: $36 - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$18</fact1> = $18

Time to sell all lemonade: 36 cups / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 cups per hour</fact4> = 9 hours

Profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.</div></div>

The choir's <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">3 teachers then decide to sing with them</fact5>. How many people sang in the performance?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many people sang in the performance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female members in the choir:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">52 total members</fact1> × <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">50% girls</fact2> = 26 female members

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Only female members were to perform</fact3>, so we start with 26 performers.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Half of the performers couldn't make it</fact4>, so we divide by 2:
   26 ÷ 2 = 13 female choir members who could perform

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Add the 3 teachers who decided to sing with them</fact5>:
   13 + 3 = 16 total performers

Therefore, 16 people sang in the performance.

How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how much money Tyson would spend, we need to calculate the number of sandwiches needed and the cost of ingredients.

First, let's calculate the number of sandwiches:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 people</fact3> / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 people per sandwich</fact2> = 5 sandwiches

Now, let's calculate the amount of meat and cheese needed:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 pound of meat per sandwich</fact1> * 5 sandwiches = 5 pounds of meat
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 pound of cheese per sandwich</fact1> * 5 sandwiches = 5 pounds of cheese

Next, let's calculate the cost:
Meat cost: 5 pounds * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$7.00 per pound</fact4> = $35.00
Cheese cost: 5 pounds * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$3.00 per pound</fact5> = $15.00

Total cost: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Elliott's daily goal is 10,000 steps</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He finished half of his steps going to and from school</fact2>. This means he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps during these walks.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He then did 1,000 steps on a short walk with his friend</fact3>.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal</fact5>.

5. So, to calculate how many steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the known steps from his goal:
   10,000 (goal) - 5,000 (school walks) - 1,000 (walk with friend) - 2,000 (steps left) = 2,000 steps

Therefore, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">during his short jog around the block</fact4>, Elliott took 2,000 steps.

How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">For the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 km per day</fact2>. So for these 4 days, he traveled: 
   4 * 200 = 800 km

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">For the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance of the first 4 days</fact3>. That's:
   30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel at all</fact4>, so 0 km for this day.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">For the second week (7 days), he traveled 300 km per day</fact5>. So for these 7 days, he traveled:
   7 * 300 = 2100 km

5. Now, we sum up all the distances:
   800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 km

Therefore, during his <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">two-week-long trip</fact1>, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers.

Stanley called Oliver on his cellphone and asked Oliver to find Stanley's comb. How many feet must Oliver climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we need to:
1. Calculate the elevation of Stanley's comb:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Stanley's elevation</fact1> - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Distance the comb fell</fact2> = 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet

2. Calculate the difference between the comb's elevation and Oliver's elevation:
   Comb's elevation - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Oliver's elevation</fact3> = 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The tattered jeans cost $28</fact1> after the sale.
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans</fact2>, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22 after the sale.
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The total savings were $6</fact3>.
4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1/3 of the savings came from the jogger jeans, and 2/3 from the tattered jeans</fact4>.

So, the savings on the jogger jeans were $6 * 1/3 = $2, and the savings on the tattered jeans were $6 * 2/3 = $4.

The original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.
The original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

To find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract:
$32 - $24 = $8

Therefore, the tattered jeans originally cost $8 more than the jogger jeans.

But <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Prince Bruce, having forgot his sword at home, slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file</fact4>. How many Dragons has Prince Bruce slain?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slain, we need to calculate the number of dragons slain by each prince in order:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons</fact1>.

2. Prince Arthur slew <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus</fact2>, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.

3. Prince Walter slew <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur</fact3>, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.

4. Finally, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter</fact4>. So, Prince Bruce slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

Therefore, Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons using his nail file.

Wayne is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</fact3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes</fact3>.
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Bernadette's travel time is 4 times Wayne's</fact2>, so 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne</fact1>.

To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave earlier than Wayne by:
Her travel time + 5 minutes - Wayne's travel time
16 + 5 - 4 = 17 minutes

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The answer is {17}.</div></div>

Or you can <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">buy a movie ticket for $12</fact4> and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price</fact5>. What's the regular price of popcorn if <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">the soda costs $3</fact6> and <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2</fact7>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. If you bought the super ticket, the total cost would be:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$20</fact1> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1</fact3> = $21

2. You didn't buy the super ticket, so you bought:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Movie ticket: $12</fact4>
   <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Soda: $3</fact6>
   Popcorn: Let's call this price 'x'

3. The total cost of your purchase is: $12 + $3 + x

4. <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">You saved $2 compared to the super ticket option</fact7>, so:
   $21 - ($12 + $3 + x) = $2

5. Solving this equation:
   $21 - $15 - x = $2
   $6 - x = $2
   -x = -$4
   x = $4

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

The answer is {4}.</div></div>

While <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the second charges, $25 per person who attends</fact2>. However, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price</fact4>. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we need to set up an equation:

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$200</fact1> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$5 * x</fact3> = <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$25 * x</fact2>

Where x is the number of guests.

Simplifying:
200 + 5x = 25x
200 = 20x
x = 10

Therefore, when there are 10 guests, the cost for both venues will be equal:

First venue: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$200</fact1> + (<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$5 * 10</fact3>) = $250
Second venue: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$25 * 10</fact2> = $250

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The grape gum cost $2</fact3>.
2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum</fact4>, so it cost $1.
3. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The total cost of all gum packs was $7</fact5>.
4. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Suzie bought four packs in total</fact1>, and we know the cost of two of them (grape and green apple).
5. So, the cost of the two strawberry packs is: $7 - $2 - $1 = $4
6. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">There are two packs of strawberry gum</fact2>, so each pack costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of skeins needed, we need to multiply the number of skeins required for each item by the number of grandchildren:

Hats: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 skeins</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins
Scarves: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 skeins</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 12 skeins
Sweaters: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 skeins</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 36 skeins
Mittens: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1 skein</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 3 skeins
Socks: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 skeins</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up all the skeins needed:
6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool to make <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her 3 grandchildren</fact2>.

The answer is {63}.</div></div>

How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's solve this step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Chris starts with 100 math problems</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On Monday, he completes 12 problems</fact2>. So after Monday, he has 100 - 12 = 88 problems left.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many as Monday</fact3>, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems. After Tuesday, he has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems</fact4>. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. After Wednesday, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left.

In total, how many quarts of strawberries can Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the strawberry-picking rates for each person:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Tony picks 6 quarts per hour</fact1>.

2. Bobby picks <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">one less quart than Tony</fact2>, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby</fact3>, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy</fact4>, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

Now, we can add up the quarts picked by all four people:
Tony (6) + Bobby (5) + Kathy (10) + Ricky (8) = 29 quarts per hour.

Therefore, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a total of 29 quarts of strawberries per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm.

How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix</fact4>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many cups of raisins Heather will use for the cookies. Since she's <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">dividing the raisins equally among three items</fact4>, she'll use one-third of the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">27 cups</fact1> for the cookies. 
   27 ÷ 3 = 9 cups for cookies

2. Now we know Heather has 9 cups of raisins for cookies. We need to determine how many batches she can make with this amount, given that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">each batch requires 3/4 cup</fact3>.
   9 ÷ (3/4) = 12 batches

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies if she <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix</fact4>.

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys</fact4>, how many seashells were brought by each girl?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided in the facts:

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The group was divided equally into boys and girls</fact2>, so there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each boy brought back 60 shells</fact3>.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys</fact4>.

Let's calculate:
1. Total shells brought by boys = 60 × 10 = 600 shells
2. Girls brought this amount (600) plus four times this amount:
   600 + (4 × 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells

Now, we need to divide the total number of shells brought by the girls by the number of girls:
3000 ÷ 10 = 300

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

The shop <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items</fact9>. How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy:

Notebooks: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$1.50</fact1> * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5</fact5> = $7.50
Pens: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$0.25</fact2> * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2</fact6> = $0.50
Calculator: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$12</fact3> * <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">1</fact7> = $12.00
Geometry set: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$10</fact4> * <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">1</fact8> = $10.00

Total before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">10% discount</fact9>:
Discount amount: 10% of $30.00 = $3.00

Final price: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The pyramids are at a 32-degree angle from the ground</fact1>. This is our starting point.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid</fact3>, so it begins at this same 32-degree angle.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour</fact2>.

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The sun moves for 10 hours</fact4>.

So, we calculate:
Initial angle: 32 degrees
Sun's movement: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5 degrees/hour</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 hours</fact4> = 50 degrees

Total angle after 10 hours: 32 + 50 = 82 degrees

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each</fact2>.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">For the last two teeth, Sharon received half of what she got for each of the previous three teeth</fact3>. 
   The previous teeth were $1.00 each, so half of that is $0.50.
   For the last two teeth: 2 × $0.50 = $1.00

4. Now, we add up all the money:
   $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

If she can <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">sell her muffin crayons for $1.50 each</fact3>, how much money can Kate make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many muffin crayons Kate can make and multiply that by the selling price.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Kate has:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 boxes of 64 crayons</fact1> = 3 * 64 = 192 crayons

Now, we need to determine how many muffin crayons she can make:
Number of muffin crayons = 192 crayons / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8 small pieces per muffin</fact2> = 24 muffin crayons

Finally, we can calculate how much money Kate can make:
Total money = 24 muffin crayons * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1.50 per muffin crayon</fact3> = $36

Therefore, Kate can make $36 by selling her muffin crayons.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each component:
1. New carpet: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$12 per square foot</fact1> * 216 square feet = $2,592
2. Padding: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$2 per square foot</fact2> * 216 square feet = $432
3. Removing old carpet: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$4 per square foot</fact3> * 216 square feet = $864
4. Installing new carpet: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$34 per square foot</fact4> * 216 square feet = $7,344

1. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is x.
2. According to <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">, the number of red jelly beans is 99% of x, or 0.99x.
3. According to <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">, the number of green jelly beans is 101% of x, or 1.01x.
4. We know from <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;"> that the total number of jelly beans is 4500.
5. So we can write the equation: 0.99x + x + 1.01x = 4500
6. Simplifying: 3x = 4500
7. Solving for x: x = 1500

Now we know:
- Blue jelly beans: 1500

How many seats will Alex need?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Alex initially invites 100 people via email</fact1>. That's 100 seats.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends</fact2>. That's an additional 100 * 2 = 200 seats.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Alex calls 10 more friends</fact3>. That's another 10 seats.

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8 of these friends are bringing their spouses</fact4>. That's 8 more seats.

So, the total number of seats needed is:
100 (initial invitees) + 200 (their friends) + 10 (friends called) + 8 (spouses) = 318 seats

The answer is {318}.</div></div>

And <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon</fact4>. How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the Mastiff's weight, we need to calculate the weights of all dogs in sequence:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher</fact2>, so:
   Dachshund's weight = 10 * 2 = 20 pounds

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund</fact3>, so:
   Papillon's weight = 20 * 1/4 = 5 pounds

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon</fact4>, so:
   Mastiff's weight = 5 * 44 = 220 pounds

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total cost of the dental work:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 implants</fact1> at <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$2000 each</fact2> = $4000
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Extra cost for porcelain crown</fact3> = $500
Total cost = $4000 + $500 = $4500

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">George has already paid a deposit of $600</fact4>, so the remaining balance is:
$4500 - $600 = $3900

To determine how many hours George needs to work:
Remaining balance / <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Hourly wage</fact5> = $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work.

In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the meat portions from the first three players:

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The first player ate 6 ounces of steak</fact1>.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce</fact2>, so that's 8 ounces of meat.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The third player ate a one-pound steak</fact3>. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, this player consumed 16 ounces of meat.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The fourth and fifth players had vegetarian meals</fact4>, so they didn't consume any meat.

Adding up the meat portions: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat.

How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Jim starts with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 pieces of gum</fact1>.

2. During school, he chews <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1 piece every 2 hours</fact2> for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">8 hours</fact3>. This means he chews 8/2 = 4 pieces at school.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">He chews 1 piece after dinner</fact5>.

5. So far, Jim has chewed 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.

6. This means he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left before giving some to his sister.

7. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister</fact6>. Half of 14 is 7.

Tuesday (Clara):
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 pomegranates at $20 each</fact1> = 20 * $20 = $400
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$2 off with voucher</fact2>
Final price for Clara = $400 - $2 = $398

Wednesday (Sheila):

He also decided to <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">buy himself a donut for $2</fact5>. How much did everything cost?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the price of the coffee and add the cost of the donut.

First, let's calculate the price of the more expensive coffee:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$5 per pound</fact1> * (1 + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20%</fact2>) = $6 per pound

Now, let's calculate how much coffee Roger needs for a week:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">A week's worth</fact3> = <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1 pound per day</fact4> * 7 days = 7 pounds

The total cost of coffee:
$6 per pound * 7 pounds = $42

Adding the cost of the donut:
$42 + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$2</fact5> = $44

Therefore, the total cost of everything Roger bought is $44.

The answer is {44}.</div></div>

If <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">the next three days were good, neutral, and good</fact8>, how many good days were left in the month?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">thirty days in total</fact1>.
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Twelve of these days were good</fact2>.
3. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The first eight days were good</fact5>, which accounts for 8 of the 12 good days.
4. <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">Of the next three days, two are good</fact8>.
5. This means that 8 (from the first eight days) + 2 (from the next three days) = 10 good days have been accounted for.

When James came back yet again, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 dogs were gone</fact4> so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">James had 4 toys for 4 dogs</fact1>.

2. Then, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8 more dogs arrived</fact2>, so he needed 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

3. After buying toys for these 12 dogs, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the number of dogs doubled</fact3>. This means there were now 12 * 2 = 24 dogs in total.

4. James needed to buy toys for the additional 12 dogs, bringing the total toys needed to 24.

5. Finally, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 dogs left</fact4>, reducing the number of dogs (and toys needed) to 24 - 3 = 21.

1. First, we need to calculate the total number of people:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Aiden and 12 friends</fact1> = 13 people
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">7 more friends at the cinema</fact2> = 7 people
   Total: 13 + 7 = 20 people

2. Now, we know how many seats they have, which is equal to the number of people: 20 seats

3. For each seat, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">they need 2 drinks and 3 snacks</fact3>:
   Drinks: 20 × 2 = 40 drinks
   Snacks: 20 × 3 = 60 snacks

How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's</fact2>, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds</fact3>.

4. To find Gary's truck capacity, we need to subtract Gissela's and Gordy's capacities from the total:

1. For the 3 minutes when her arms are not raised:
   - Right foot: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">300 taps per minute</fact1> * 3 minutes = 900 taps
   - Left foot: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">250 taps per minute</fact2> * 3 minutes = 750 taps

2. For the <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 minutes when her arms are raised</fact5>:
   - Each foot: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">200 taps per minute</fact3> * 2 minutes = 400 taps
   - Both feet combined: 400 * 2 = 800 taps

3. Total taps:
   - When arms are down: 900 + 750 = 1,650 taps
   - When arms are raised: 800 taps
   - Total: 1,650 + 800 = 2,450 taps

Therefore, over the course of <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 minutes of dancing</fact4>, Helga would tap her feet a combined total of 2,450 times.

Ron will also have to <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25</fact3>. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the cost of fixing it versus the cost of not fixing it.

Cost of not fixing:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$450 worth of damage to his car</fact1>

Cost of fixing:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$120 fine for unauthorized road maintenance</fact2>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each</fact3> = 3 * $25 = $75
Total cost of fixing = $120 + $75 = $195

Savings:
$450 (cost of not fixing) - $195 (cost of fixing) = $255

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The answer is {255}.</div></div>

If there are <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">64 students' cars with four windows each</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">32 teachers' cars with two windows each</fact4>, how many windows does Hannah smash?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Students' cars windows:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows</fact3>
   Total students' car windows = 64 * 4 = 256
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Hannah smashes 1/4 of these</fact1>
   Students' windows smashed = 256 * 1/4 = 64

2. Teachers' cars windows:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows</fact4>
   Total teachers' car windows = 32 * 2 = 64
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Hannah smashes 3/4 of these</fact2>
   Teachers' windows smashed = 64 * 3/4 = 48

3. Total windows smashed:
   Students' windows + Teachers' windows = 64 + 48 = 112

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of 112 windows.

The answer is {112}.</div></div>

How many bananas did Gunther find were in the pile?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Initially, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Gunther had 48 bananas</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Arnold stole half of the bananas</fact2>, which is 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas. 
   So, Gunther was left with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Gunther then added 25 bananas</fact3>, bringing the total to 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Arnold then stole another 12 bananas</fact4>, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

5. Finally, <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Gunther added 6 more bananas</fact5>, making the total 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther counted his bananas on the third day, he found 43 bananas in the pile.

1. Small stickers traded:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Lorraine has 30 small stickers</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">She trades 90% of them</fact5>, which is 27 small stickers.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">A large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons from this trade.

2. Large stickers traded for large buttons:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Lorraine has 40 large stickers</fact4>. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">She trades 50% of them for large buttons</fact6>, which is 20 large stickers.
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each large sticker is worth a large button</fact1>, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

3. Remaining large stickers traded for small buttons:
The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each large sticker is worth three small buttons</fact1>, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from this trade.

4. Total buttons:
Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons
Small buttons: 60 (from remaining large stickers)

Total buttons: 29 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 89 buttons

The answer is {89}.</div></div>

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of shirts for each size:

Extra-small: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">11 students</fact1>

Small: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Twice as many as extra-small</fact2>, so 11 * 2 = 22 students

Medium: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Four less than small</fact3>, so 22 - 4 = 18 students

Large: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Half as many as medium</fact4>, so 18 / 2 = 9 students

Extra-large: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Six more than large</fact5>, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, let's add up all the shirts:
11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts

Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts.

1. Calculate total weekend hours:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 hours on Saturday + 5 hours on Sunday = 12 hours total</fact1>

2. Subtract reading time:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 hours - 3 hours for reading = 9 hours remaining</fact2>

3. Calculate video game time:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1/3 of the remaining 9 hours = 3 hours for video games</fact3>

4. Calculate soccer time:
   9 hours - 3 hours for video games = 6 hours for soccer

5. Calculate percentage of time spent on soccer:
   (6 hours for soccer / 12 total hours) * 100 = 50%

How much does replacing the movies cost if <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">a normal movie costs $10</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Total movies: 600</fact2>

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Movies in series: 1/3 of 600 = 200 movies</fact3>
   Cost for series movies: 200 * $6 = $1,200

3. Remaining movies: 600 - 200 = 400 movies

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Older movies: 40% of 400 = 160 movies</fact4>
   Cost for older movies: 160 * $5 = $800

5. Normal-priced movies: 400 - 160 = 240 movies
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Cost for normal movies: 240 * $10 = $2,400</fact5>

1. Enemies: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma</fact4>. According to <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">they receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on</fact1>. So Ava scores 8 * 10 = 80 more points than Emma for enemies.

2. Berries: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Ava collects 3 more berries</fact5>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">They get 5 points for each berry</fact2>. So Ava scores 3 * 5 = 15 more points than Emma for berries.

3. Time: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower</fact6>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">They receive 30 points for every second left on the timer</fact3>. This means Emma scores 4 * 30 = 120 more points than Ava for time.

Now, let's calculate the total difference:
Ava's advantage: 80 + 15 = 95 points
Emma's advantage: 120 points

The difference between their scores is 120 - 95 = 25 points, with Emma having the higher score.

The answer is {25}.</div></div>

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He bought 17 more fish from the pet store</fact2>.

3. After adding the new fish, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the number of orange fish became twice the number of white fish</fact3>.

4. Let's say he bought 'x' white fish from the store. This means he bought (17 - x) orange fish.

5. Now, the total number of white fish is (4 + x), and the total number of orange fish is (3 + 17 - x).

6. According to <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">, we can write:
   (3 + 17 - x) = 2(4 + x)

7. Solving this equation:
   20 - x = 8 + 2x
   20 - 8 = 3x
   12 = 3x
   x = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish from the store.

If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">it was 45 degrees during the day</fact3>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day</fact4>, how many logs does Carson need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, let's first calculate the nighttime temperature:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Daytime temperature: 45 degrees</fact3>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Nighttime temperature: 45 - 33 = 12 degrees</fact4>

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees</fact1>, so Carson needs to raise the temperature by at least 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each log raises the temperature by 5 degrees</fact2>, so we need to calculate how many logs it will take to raise the temperature by 20 degrees:

Number of logs needed = 20 degrees ÷ 5 degrees per log = 4 logs

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

1. Calculate the number of groups:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">90 people</fact1> ÷ <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">9 people per group</fact2> = 10 groups

2. Determine how many groups brought back seashells:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3/5 of the number of groups</fact3> = 3/5 * 10 = 6 groups

3. Calculate the number of seashells per group:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">9 people per group</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 seashells per person</fact4> = 18 seashells per group

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate Billy's current hourly rate:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Billy's starting rate: $10/hour</fact1>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">After 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50/hour</fact2>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">After 1 year: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50/hour</fact3>

Now, let's calculate Sally's hourly rate:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Sally's rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50/hour</fact4>

For 20 hours of work:
Billy earns: $11.50 × 20 = $230
Sally earns: $10.50 × 20 = $210

The difference is: $230 - $210 = $20

During the week <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he made $105</fact3>. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how many branches Felix climbed in total for the week. We can do this by dividing <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the total money he made ($105)</fact3> by <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the cost per branch ($0.25)</fact2>:
   $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

2. Now, we need to find the average per day. Since a week has 7 days, we divide the total branches by 7:
   420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

Total petals before dropping: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

However, <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Rose drops 1 of each type of flower</fact5>. So we need to subtract:
1 * 5 + 1 * 6 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 7 = 22 petals

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
101 - 22 = 79 petals

The answer is {79}.</div></div>

When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot had gone</fact3>. What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cars before lunch:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50 cars</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 more cars</fact2> = 70 cars

2. Apply the reduction mentioned:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1/2 of the cars had gone</fact3>, which means 1/2 of 70 cars remained

3. Calculate the remaining cars:
   1/2 * 70 = 35 cars

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.

The answer is {35}.</div></div>

Sasha always struggles during away games and their second match was at Julie's home court. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game</fact3>. How many total points did Sasha score during both games?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to determine her scores in each game:

First game: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Sasha scored 14 points</fact1>

Second game:
- First, we need to calculate Julie's score in the first game:
  <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha</fact2>, so Julie's score = 14 - 4 = 10 points
- Then, we can calculate Sasha's score in the second game:
  <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's first game score</fact3>, so Sasha's second game score = 10 - 6 = 4 points

Total points Sasha scored in both games:
First game score + Second game score = 14 + 4 = 18 points

The sales assistant told her that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200</fact2>. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">already has some savings in her purse</fact3>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her</fact5>. If <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop</fact6>, how much money does she have in her purse?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she needs and subtract the known contributions:

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The original cost of the laptop is $600</fact1>.
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">After trading in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200</fact2>, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.

Now, let's add up all the known contributions:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$150 from her part-time job</fact4>
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$80 from her mom</fact5>
<fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$50 still needed</fact6>

Total of known contributions: $150 + $80 + $50 = $280

The amount in Erika's purse can be calculated by subtracting the known contributions from the reduced laptop price:

Money in purse = $400 - $280 = $120

Therefore, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Erika already has $120 in savings in her purse</fact3>.

1. Initially, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the river has 4000 gallons of water passing through it</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">After the heavy rain, this amount doubles</fact2>. So on the second day, the amount of water is:
   4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On the third day, the volume increases by an additional 6000 gallons</fact3>. So we add this to the previous day's amount:
   8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Kelly's budget is $65</fact5> then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the cost of each item and then subtract the total from Kelly's budget:

1. Bacon: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 packs cost $10</fact1>, so each pack costs $2.

2. Chicken: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 packets, each costing twice as much as bacon</fact2>. 
   So, each packet costs $4 (2 * $2).
   Total cost of chicken: 6 * $4 = $24

3. Strawberries: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 packs at $4 each</fact3>
   Total cost of strawberries: 3 * $4 = $12

4. Apples: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">7 packs, each costing half the price of strawberries</fact4>
   Price of one apple pack: $4 / 2 = $2
   Total cost of apples: 7 * $2 = $14

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The pot can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls</fact1>. This means 1 adult bowl is equivalent to 2 child bowls.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">There are 2 adults and 2 children eating</fact2>. 

3. For dinner, they will use:
   - 2 adult bowls (for the adults)
   - 2 child bowls (for the children)
   This is equivalent to 3 adult bowls or 6 child bowls.

4. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The pot originally had enough for 8 child bowls</fact1>, so after dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = 2 child bowls left.

5. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">If each child eats one bowl at a meal</fact3>, and there are 2 child bowls left, then each child can have 1 more bowl of soup for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch 1 time from the leftover soup.

How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. The cake cost <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$11</fact2>.

2. For the balloons, they bought <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1 dozen (12) balloons at $0.5 for 2 balloons</fact3>. 
   This means they spent 12/2 * $0.5 = $3 on balloons.

3. They bought <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each</fact4>, which is 2 * $7 = $14.

4. The total spent was $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

5. Since <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance</fact1>, and they combined their allowance to make these purchases, each of them must have contributed half of the total.

Assuming he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours</fact2>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to consider how many trips the sloth can make in the given time frame. 

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The sloth has 8 hours in total</fact2>, and <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">each trip takes 4 hours</fact1>. This means the sloth can make 8 / 4 = 2 trips in the given time.

Now, we know that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total</fact2>. If he makes 2 trips, he needs to collect 24 / 2 = 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries.

1. Calculate how much water is in the tank:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Half the amount of water in the pool</fact2> = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10000</fact1> ÷ 2 = 5000 gallons

2. Calculate how much water is used in 6 days:
   Water used = <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">500 gallons per day</fact3> × <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 days</fact4> = 3000 gallons

3. Calculate the remaining water:
   Remaining water = Initial amount - Water used
   Remaining water = 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons

Therefore, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">after 6 days</fact4>, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much money Cameron would save, we need to:
1. Calculate the duration of Cameron's stay
2. Calculate the cost of his stay using the hourly rate option
3. Compare this cost to the 24-hour rate

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Cameron's stay is from 5 pm to 10 am the next day</fact4>, which is 17 hours.

Using the hourly rate option:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1000 pesos for the first 12 hours</fact1>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">70 pesos for each additional hour beyond 12 hours</fact3>
Additional hours = 17 - 12 = 5 hours
Additional cost = 5 * 70 = 350 pesos
Total cost = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The 24-hour rate is 1600 pesos</fact2>

Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos

Therefore, Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the hourly rate option instead of the 24-hour rate.

The answer is {250}.</div></div>

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>130/ Reformatted Question:</strong> James loves to go swimming and has to <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">swim across a 20-mile lake</fact1>. He can <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour</fact2>. He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">swims 60% of the distance</fact3>. After that, he <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time</fact4>. He then <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total time:

1. First leg:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">60% of 20 miles</fact3> = 12 miles
   Time = 12 miles / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 miles per hour</fact2> = 6 hours

2. Rest time:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Half of the swimming time</fact4> = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

3. Second leg:
   Remaining distance = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 miles</fact1> - 12 miles = 8 miles
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Speed is halved</fact5>, so 1 mile per hour
   Time = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

The answer is {17}.</div></div>

He gets a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10% commission on each copy of the New York Times</fact1> and an <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8% commission on each of the Wall Street Journal</fact2>. How much commission will he earn in total from the sales of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 copies of the New York Times</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 copies of Wall Street Journal</fact4> if each costs <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$5</fact5> and <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$15</fact6> respectively?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to determine his earnings from each newspaper separately and then add them together.

For the New York Times:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 copies</fact3> at <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$5</fact5> each = 6 * $5 = $30 total sales
Commission: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10%</fact1> of $30 = 0.10 * $30 = $3

For the Wall Street Journal:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 copies</fact4> at <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$15</fact6> each = 10 * $15 = $150 total sales
Commission: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8%</fact2> of $150 = 0.08 * $150 = $12

Total commission:
$3 (from New York Times) + $12 (from Wall Street Journal) = $15

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15 from the sales of these newspapers.

The answer is {15}.</div></div>

One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am</fact2>. Also, that day <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom</fact3>. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how many minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to consider her normal sleep schedule and the interruptions:

1. Normal sleep duration: 
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.</fact1> is 8 hours or 480 minutes.

2. Interruptions:
   a. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am</fact2> = 23 minutes
   b. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Waking up 5 minutes earlier than usual</fact3> = 5 minutes

3. Total sleep time on bed:
   480 minutes (normal sleep) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 5 minutes (early wake-up) = 452 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.

The answer is {452}.</div></div>

After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag. The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">If Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls</fact3>, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Jason carried 2 balls</fact3>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey</fact2>. This means Jeffrey carried half as many as Jason. So Jeffrey carried 2/2 = 1 ball.

3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason</fact1>. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.

4. To find the total number of balls, we add up what each boy carried:
   Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls = Total balls
   4 + 2 + 1 = 7 balls

Therefore, the coach brought a total of 7 basketballs to practice.

The answer is {7}.</div></div>

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 dozen</fact1> (made herself) = 12 brownies
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1/2 dozen</fact2> (from office) = 6 brownies
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 dozen</fact3> (from surprise party) = 48 brownies

Total brownies: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Now, we need to subtract the eaten brownies:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1 1/2 dozen eaten</fact4> = 18 brownies

Brownies left over: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies

The answer is {48}.</div></div>

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 racquets</fact2> with synthetic gut: 3 * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">15 minutes</fact5> = 45 minutes
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 racquets</fact3> with polyester string: 5 * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">22 minutes</fact6> = 110 minutes
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 racquets</fact4> with hybrid sets: 4 * <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">18 minutes</fact7> = 72 minutes

Total time: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

To convert this to hours and minutes:

The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day</fact3>. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine the number of flights to France, we need to calculate the total number of flights the first plane makes and then find out how many of those are to France.

From <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">, we know that the second plane makes 44 trips, which is half of the first plane's trips. So, the first plane makes 44 * 2 = 88 trips per day.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;"> tells us that three-quarters of these 88 flights go to Greece. This means:
Flights to Greece = 88 * 3/4 = 66

The remaining flights are: 88 - 66 = 22

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;"> states that these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the flights to France are:
Flights to France = 22 / 2 = 11

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The answer is {11}.</div></div>

And <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact3>. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the combined length of time for all three wolves' howls:

1. Tobias: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Tobias howls for 20 seconds</fact1>.

2. Chikote: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias</fact2>, so Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.

3. Igneous: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact3>. Tobias and Chikote together howl for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds, so Igneous also howls for 60 seconds.

4. Total time: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds

5. Converting to minutes: 120 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$500 from neighbors</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$1500 from online fund</fact2> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$200 from his friend</fact5> = $2200

2. Apply the lawyer's offer:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The lawyer will donate three times this amount</fact3>

So, the lawyer's contribution will be:

How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">9 inpatients at the clinic</fact4>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Doctor Jones has a total of 9 hours (540 minutes) at the clinic</fact1>.

2. For inpatient rounds:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 minutes per inpatient</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">9 inpatients</fact4> = 180 minutes

3. For appointments:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">30 minutes per appointment * 10 appointments</fact3> = 300 minutes

4. Total time for rounds and appointments:
   180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

5. Time left for updating records:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">540 minutes (total time)</fact1> - 480 minutes (rounds and appointments) = 60 minutes

How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. First day:
   - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank</fact2>, which is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">18000</fact1> * 1/4 = 4500 gallons
   - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Ms. B pumped 3/4 of Wanda's amount</fact3>, which is 4500 * 3/4 = 3375 gallons
   Total pumped on first day: 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons

2. Second day:
   - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Wanda pumped 2/3 of her previous day's amount</fact4>: 4500 * 2/3 = 3000 gallons
   - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her previous day's amount</fact5>: 3375 * 1/3 = 1125 gallons
   Total pumped on second day: 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons

3. Total amount pumped over two days:
   7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons

4. Remaining water to fill the tank:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Tank capacity (18000 gallons)</fact1> - Total pumped (12000 gallons) = 6000 gallons

Therefore, 6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full.

Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact3>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability that none of these scenarios occur:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Substitute teacher (50% chance)</fact1>
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Class-wide extension (40% chance of the remaining 50%)</fact2>
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Personal extension (20% chance of the remaining chances)</fact3>

Let's calculate step by step:

1. Chance of regular teacher: 100% - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50%</fact1> = 50%
2. Chance of no class-wide extension: 50% * (100% - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40%</fact2>) = 50% * 60% = 30%
3. Chance of no personal extension: 30% * (100% - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20%</fact3>) = 30% * 80% = 24%

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>146/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Richard wants to make a video to share online of him doing a science experiment that creates a fountain of diet soda after placing a specific branded candy inside it. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide</fact1> and he wants to <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway</fact2>. After starting at the first bottle, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in</fact3>. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how long it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to:
1. Calculate how many bottles he'll place on the driveway
2. Calculate how many intervals he'll need to travel between bottles

First, we can calculate the number of bottles:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The driveway is 24 feet wide</fact1>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">A bottle is placed every 3 feet</fact2>
Number of bottles = 24 / 3 = 8 bottles

Now, we need to determine how many intervals Richard will travel:
Number of intervals = Number of bottles - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 intervals

Finally, we can calculate the total time:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each interval takes 5 seconds</fact3>
Total time = 7 intervals * 5 seconds per interval = 35 seconds

The answer is {35}.</div></div>

She had <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks</fact4> that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the cost of each item:
1. Tank top: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$10</fact1>
2. Running shorts: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$10</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$5</fact2> = $15
3. Tennis shoes: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$48 / 2</fact3> = $24
4. Athletic socks: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$8 - $2</fact4> = $6

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Therefore, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

Two hours after the trucks had departed for delivery, Mr Hezekiah got the news that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures on the road and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers</fact3>. Calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to:
1. Determine how many trucks successfully made deliveries
2. Calculate the total tons of fertiliser on those trucks

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">There were 20 trucks initially dispatched</fact1>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">A quarter (1/4) of these trucks had mechanical failures</fact3>. This means:
- Number of trucks with failures = 20 * 1/4 = 5 trucks
- Number of trucks that successfully delivered = 20 - 5 = 15 trucks

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser</fact2>. So the total tons delivered:
15 trucks * 20 tons per truck = 300 tons

Therefore, 300 tons of fertiliser reached the farmers that day.

The answer is {300}.</div></div>

Melanie's mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. Melanie started saving them and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">has saved 10 toothpicks each week</fact2> for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the past 12 weeks</fact3>. If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, let's first calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 toothpicks per week</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 weeks</fact3> = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">200 toothpicks needed</fact1> - 120 toothpicks collected = 80 toothpicks still needed

Since Melanie collects <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 toothpicks each week</fact2>, we can calculate how many more weeks she needs:
80 toothpicks needed ÷ <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 toothpicks per week</fact2> = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks needed for her sculpture.

The answer is {8}.</div></div>

In one month, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes</fact4> among the types listed. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Half of them were Trekking bikes</fact5>, and <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">15% were BMX bikes</fact6>. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:
   - Trekking bikes: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Half of 300</fact5> = 150 bikes
   - BMX bikes: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">15% of 300</fact6> = 45 bikes
   - MTB bikes: The rest = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

2. Calculate the price of each bike type:
   - MTB: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$500</fact1>
   - BMX: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Half of $500</fact2> = $250
   - Trekking: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$450</fact3>

3. Calculate the earnings from each bike type:
   - MTB: 105 * $500 = $52,500
   - BMX: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Trekking: 150 * $450 = $67,500

4. Sum up the total earnings:
   $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Therefore, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

The answer is {131250}.</div></div>

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, there were <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 sodas</fact1>, of which <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 were shaken</fact2>.

2. Ellen <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">took 1 unshaken soda</fact3>, leaving 11 sodas, 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas</fact4>, leaving 8 sodas total.

4. After Ellen's brother left, there were 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas remaining.

5. The probability of Ellen's friend picking a shaken soda is 2 out of 8, or 2/8 = 1/4.

6. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 1/4 * 100 = 25%

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 25%.

What is the new balance on her credit card?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Initial balance: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$85.00</fact1>

2. After returning the item: 
   $85.00 - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$15.00</fact2> = $70.00

3. Frying pan cost:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$20.00 - (20% of $20.00) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00</fact3>

4. Towels cost:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$30.00 - (10% of $30.00) = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00</fact4>

5. New balance:
   $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Since she put both new purchases on her credit card</fact5>, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total time, we need to add up the time each person spent on their chore:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn</fact1>.

2. Megan's time: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">She took 2 hours longer than Amalia</fact2>. So, Megan's time = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4 hours</fact1> + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. Dior's time: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">She took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia</fact3>. We can interpret "well over" as at least 4 hours, so Dior's time = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4 hours</fact1> + 4 hours = 8 hours.

Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
           = 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each</fact3>, so in 10 hours they produce: 
   2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Another two workers produce 4 toys per hour each</fact4>, so in 10 hours they produce:
   2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys

3. The total toys produced by these four workers in 10 hours is:
   120 + 80 = 200 toys

4. The <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">total order is for 400 toys</fact1>, and <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20 toys are still needed after the shift</fact6>, so the total toys produced during the shift is:
   400 - 20 = 380 toys

5. The fifth worker must have produced the difference:
   380 - 200 = 180 toys

6. Since they <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">worked for 10 hours</fact5>, the fifth worker's hourly production rate is:
   180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach</fact5>.
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The beach portion of her walk is 2 miles</fact2>.
3. This means her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 1/20 mile per minute.
4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On the sidewalk, she walks twice as fast as on the beach</fact4>. So her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 mile per minute.
5. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The sidewalk portion of her walk is 1 mile</fact3>.
6. Time spent on sidewalk = 1 mile / (1/10 mile per minute) = 10 minutes.
7. Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">her entire 3-mile walk</fact1>.

At least how many degrees is the second bottle?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. We know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</fact1>.
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">One mug is 33 degrees</fact2>, which is too cold for Donny to drink.
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug</fact3>.
4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">After mixing these, he can drink the water</fact4>, which means the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

Let's call the unknown temperature x. We can set up an equation:

(4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 ≥ 40

Solving this equation:
132 + x ≥ 200
x ≥ 68

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of days, we need to determine how long it will take Lauren to complete each size of picture scene:

For large-sized scenes: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">45 large scenes</fact4> ÷ <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 large scenes per day</fact1> = 9 days

For medium-sized scenes: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">36 medium scenes</fact5> ÷ <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 medium scenes per day</fact2> = 6 days

For small-sized scenes: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">49 small scenes</fact6> ÷ <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">7 small scenes per day</fact3> = 7 days

The total number of days required is the sum of these individual times:
9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days

Therefore, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes for the project.

How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the fruit production for each year:

Year 1-4: 0 fruits (not mentioned in the question, assume no production)
Year 5: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50 fruits</fact1>
Year 6: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 * 50 = 150 fruits</fact2>
Year 7: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">7 * 50 = 350 fruits</fact3>

Year 9: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">0 fruits</fact5>
Year 10: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20 * 50 = 1000 fruits</fact6>

Now we can calculate Year 8:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one</fact4>
So, Year 8: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits

Total fruits over 10 years:
0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2,350 fruits

The answer is {2350}.</div></div>

So, at the start of the third day, they had: 78 + 25 - 100 = 3 bandages

On <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the second day, they used 28 bandages</fact4> (10 fewer than the first day)

So, at the start of the second day, they had: 3 + 28 = 31 bandages

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On the first day, they used 38 bandages</fact2>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">They ordered one bulk pack (50 bandages) on the first day</fact3>

So, at the start of the first day, they had: 31 + 38 - 50 = 19 bandages

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

The answer is {19}.</div></div>

How far off was his guess?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Tim's guess:
1. Volume of the jar: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 * 6 * 15</fact1> = 540 cubic inches
2. Total jelly beans at 100% efficiency: 540 / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">0.15</fact2> = 3,600
3. Actual jelly beans with <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">80% efficiency</fact3>: 3,600 * 0.8 = 2,880
4. Tim's guess for red jelly beans: 2,880 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">0.30</fact4> = 864

The difference between Tim's guess and the actual number:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">900</fact5> - 864 = 36

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The bus started with 20 people</fact2>.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">At the first stop, 40 people entered</fact3>. So now there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">At the second stop, 3/4 of 40 (which is 30) people entered</fact4>. Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">At the third stop, the number of passengers doubled</fact5>. So now there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

5. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The bus capacity is 200 people</fact1>, so the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20.

If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many groups will need to try the escape room and how long each group takes.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">There are 10 students from each grade</fact1>, and there are 4 grades (4-7), so the total number of students is 10 * 4 = 40 students.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The escape room can accommodate 8 students at a time</fact2>, so we need to divide the total number of students by 8 to get the number of groups:
40 / 8 = 5 groups

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each group has 45 minutes to try the escape room</fact3>. 

Therefore, the total time needed is:
5 groups * 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes

To convert this to hours:
225 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3.75 hours

The answer is {3.75} hours.</div></div>

1. For the standard rate lessons:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 lessons</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$80 per hour</fact1> = $320

2. For the veteran lessons:

   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 lessons</fact4> * $60 per hour = $120

3. Total earnings:
   $320 (standard rate lessons) + $120 (veteran lessons) = $440

When he went back home, he inspected the marbles further. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">One of them he picked up wasn't a marble, but actually a bead so he got rid of it</fact4>. How many marbles did Brendan end up with?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, let's follow the events step by step:

1. Brendan started with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 marbles</fact1>.
2. He <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">dropped half of them</fact2>, which means he dropped 5 marbles. This leaves him with 5 marbles in the bag.
3. He then <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">found 3 of the dropped marbles</fact3>. Now he has 5 (in the bag) + 3 (found) = 8 marbles.
4. However, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">one of the items he picked up was actually a bead, not a marble</fact4>. So we need to subtract 1 from his total.

Therefore, Brendan ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

He knows based on historical averages, that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars</fact2>. And <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car</fact3>. Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many calls Jason needs to make, we'll work backwards from the number of cars he needs to sell.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jason needs to sell 15 cars</fact1> to earn his bonus.

According to <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the ratio of customers to sales, for every two customers that come in, one will buy a car</fact3>. This means Jason needs twice as many customers as cars sold. So he needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Now, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">for every 25 telephone calls, one person comes into the dealership</fact2>. To get 30 people to come in, Jason needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.

Therefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.

The answer is {750}.</div></div>

With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of flashlights and candles separately:

Flashlights:
- <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">One flashlight for each person</fact3>: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4</fact2> flashlights
- <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Two flashlights for each room</fact4>: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8</fact1> rooms * 2 = 16 flashlights
Total flashlights: 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights

Candles:
- <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4 small candles for half the rooms</fact5>: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8</fact1>/2 rooms * 4 candles = 16 small candles
- <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">5 medium candles for the other half of the rooms</fact6>: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8</fact1>/2 rooms * 5 candles = 20 medium candles

How much longer will it take for the coat of varnish on <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 paintings</fact3> with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the difference in drying time, we need to compare the total time for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 paintings</fact3> with both varnishes:

Old varnish: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 minutes</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 paintings</fact3> = 42 minutes

New varnish: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 minutes</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 paintings</fact3> = 72 minutes

The difference in drying time is 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

To return home, he will need to hop and swim his way back. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute</fact2>, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute</fact3>, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water</fact4>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Phineas spends on land and in water separately.

First, let's determine the distance for each terrain:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Half of the total distance</fact4> = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">200 yards</fact1> / 2 = 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water

Now, let's calculate the time for each part of the journey:

Time on land = Distance on land / Speed on land
             = 100 yards / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 yards per minute</fact2>
             = 5 minutes

Time in water = Distance in water / Speed in water
              = 100 yards / <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 yards per minute</fact3>
              = 10 minutes

Total time = Time on land + Time in water
           = 5 minutes + 10 minutes
           = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.

First, let's calculate how many photos Jade can upload in one day:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">7 photos per batch</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 batches per day</fact3> = 42 photos per day

Now, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload per day:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">210 total photos</fact1> / 42 photos per day = 5 days

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos to Instagram.

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Conor saw an average of 60 people each day the rest of the week</fact4>, calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down day by day:

Day 1: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50 people</fact1>

Day 2: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">50 + 20 = 70 people</fact2>

Day 3: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">70 * 2 = 140 people</fact3>

For the remaining 4 days of the week, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Conor saw an average of 60 people each day</fact4>. So for these 4 days, the total is: 60 * 4 = 240 people

How many lemons will Tim need?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of lemons Tim needs, we'll break it down step by step:

1. For the regular lemonade:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Tim needs to make 4 gallons</fact3>
   Each gallon requires <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 cup of lemon juice</fact1>
   So, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice for the regular lemonade

2. For Allen's extra tart gallon:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Allen wants 1 gallon that's twice as tart</fact4>
   This means it needs 2 cups of lemon juice

3. Total lemon juice needed:
   4 cups (regular) + 2 cups (extra tart) = 6 cups of lemon juice

4. Converting cups of juice to lemons:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice</fact2>
   So, for 6 cups of juice, Tim needs:
   6 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 36 lemons

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons in total to make all the lemonade.

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">At the end of the first street, there are 5 children</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On the second street, each child is joined by another child</fact2>. This doubles the number of children:
   5 * 2 = 10 children

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children</fact3>. This triples the number of children:

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>178/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Tim makes a special honey and jam mix. To make <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit</fact1>. It also <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">takes 2 pounds of special honey</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The passion fruit costs $6 per pound</fact3>, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the jackfruit is $8 per pound</fact4>, and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">the honey is $10 per pound</fact5>. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">He sells each jar for $50</fact6>. How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the cost and revenue for 10 jars:

Cost per jar:
- Passion fruit: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 pounds</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$6 per pound</fact3> = $12
- Jackfruit: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1.5 pounds</fact1> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$8 per pound</fact4> = $12
- Honey: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 pounds</fact2> * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$10 per pound</fact5> = $20
Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Cost for 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440

Revenue for 10 jars: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$50 per jar</fact6> * 10 = $500

Profit: Revenue - Cost = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

The answer is {60}.</div></div>
