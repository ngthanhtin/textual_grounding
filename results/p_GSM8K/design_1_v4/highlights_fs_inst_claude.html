She <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">accepts the opening bid of $200</fact3> and continues bidding until she wins. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people</fact4> and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The auction starts at $200</fact3>.
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Three other people bid once each</fact2>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Carmen bids after each of them</fact4>. This means there are 4 bids after the opening bid.
3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each bid increases the price by $50</fact1>.

So, we can calculate the final price as follows:
Opening bid: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$200</fact3>
4 additional bids: 4 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$50</fact1> = $200
Total: $200 + $200 = $400

Therefore, Carmen wins the antique desk for $400.

The answer is {400}.</div></div>

How many games does Steve have after 3 years?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of games Steve accumulates each year:

Year 1:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 games from birthday</fact1>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1 game per month for 12 months = 12 games</fact2>
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5 games from Christmas</fact5>
Total for Year 1: 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games

Year 2:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 games per month for 12 months = 24 games</fact3>
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5 games from Christmas</fact5>
Total for Year 2: 24 + 5 = 29 games

Year 3:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 games per month for 12 months = 48 games</fact4>
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5 games from Christmas</fact5>
Total for Year 3: 48 + 5 = 53 games

Total games after 3 years: 22 + 29 + 53 = 104 games

The answer is {104}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>2/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">he has 60 potatoes to get through</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact2>, but <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">only about 5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total time, we need to consider both peeling and cutting times for all potatoes:

1. Peeling time:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1.5 minutes per potato</fact2> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60 potatoes</fact1> = 90 minutes

2. Cutting time:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 seconds per potato</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60 potatoes</fact1> = 300 seconds = 5 minutes

Total time: 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes (1 hour and 35 minutes) to finish prepping the potatoes.

The answer is {95}.</div></div>

He decides <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each CD cost $15</fact3>. He <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">gets them for 40% off</fact4>. How much money was he out?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">James bought 10 CDs</fact1>
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each CD originally cost $15</fact3>
3. But he <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">got them for 40% off</fact4>, so the actual price per CD was $15 * 0.6 = $9
4. Total cost for 10 CDs: 10 * $9 = $90
5. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He sold 5 CDs for $40</fact2>
6. Money recovered: $40
7. Money spent - Money recovered = $90 - $40 = $50

Therefore, James was out $50.

The answer is {50}.</div></div>

How many students were there in the school auditorium?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many students were in the auditorium, we need to calculate the total number of seats and then subtract the seats occupied by administrators and parents.

Total seats: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">18 seats per row</fact1> * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4 rows</fact5> = 72 seats

Administrators' seats: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1/4 of 72</fact2> = 18 seats

Remaining seats: 72 - 18 = 54 seats

Parents' seats: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1/3 of 54</fact3> = 18 seats

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Students occupy the rest of the seats</fact4>. So, the number of students is:
54 - 18 = 36 students

Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

The answer is {36}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>5/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips</fact1>. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic</fact3>. If he has <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how many glass chips Milo has in total:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">One bag contains 72 chips</fact1>
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Milo has two bags</fact4>
   So, total chips = 72 * 2 = 144 chips

2. Now, we need to determine how many square inches Milo can cover with 144 chips:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">It takes 12 chips to cover one square inch</fact3>
   Square inches covered = 144 / 12 = 12 square inches

3. We know that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the mosaic will be 3 inches tall</fact2>
   So, if we divide the total square inches by the height, we'll get the length:
   Length = 12 square inches / 3 inches = 4 inches

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

The answer is {4}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>6/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bernie has 4 dogs</fact1>. The first needs to walk 1 mile. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day</fact2>. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The second needs to walk 4 miles</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The third needs to walk 3 miles</fact4>. How many miles does the last dog need?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we need to use the information given:

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bernie has 4 dogs in total</fact1>.
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day</fact2>.

This means that the total miles walked by all dogs should be: 4 * 3 = 12 miles

We know the miles for three of the dogs:
1. First dog: 1 mile
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2. Second dog: 4 miles</fact3>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3. Third dog: 3 miles</fact4>

Total miles for these three dogs: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

To find the miles for the last dog, we subtract the known miles from the total:
12 - 8 = 4 miles

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

The answer is {4}.</div></div>

By the end of the day, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 of each of the fruity scents available</fact2>. They already have <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 vanilla scents</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8 fruity scents available</fact4> and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents:

1. Total vanilla scents sold: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 of each</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 vanilla scents</fact3> = 20 vanilla scents

2. Total fruity scents sold: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 of each</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8 fruity scents</fact4> = 16 fruity scents

3. Difference: 20 vanilla scents - 16 fruity scents = 4 more vanilla scents sold

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

The answer is {4}.</div></div>

If it doesn't get fixed, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car</fact1>. Ron will also have to <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25</fact2> to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance</fact3> if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to compare the cost of fixing it versus the cost of not fixing it.

Cost of not fixing:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$450 worth of damage to his car</fact1>

Cost of fixing:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each</fact2> = 3 * $25 = $75
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Fine for unauthorized road maintenance</fact3> = $120
Total cost of fixing = $75 + $120 = $195

Money saved by fixing:
$450 (cost of not fixing) - $195 (cost of fixing) = $255

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The answer is {255}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>9/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>. His contractor charges <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$4 per square foot to remove the old carpet</fact2>, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$34 per square foot to install the new carpet</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>. How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the area of the room
2. Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet
3. Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet
4. Calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding
5. Sum up all these costs

1. The area of the room is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet</fact1>

2. Cost of removing old carpet: 
   216 sq ft * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$4 per sq ft = $864</fact2>

3. Cost of installing new carpet: 
   216 sq ft * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$34 per sq ft = $7,344</fact3>

4. Cost of new carpet and padding:
   Carpet: 216 sq ft * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$12 per sq ft = $2,592</fact4>
   Padding: 216 sq ft * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$2 per sq ft = $432</fact5>
   Total: $2,592 + $432 = $3,024

5. Total cost:
   $864 + $7,344 + $3,024 = $11,232

Therefore, it will cost Michael $11,232 to replace the carpet in his bedroom.

The answer is {11232}.</div></div>

While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples</fact7>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Joanne's apples:
   - From tallest trees: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 apples</fact1>
   - From shortest trees: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30/2 = 15 apples</fact2>
   - From average trees: Let's call this 'x'

2. Joanne's sister's apples:
   - From tallest trees: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 * 30 = 60 apples</fact4>
   - From shortest trees: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">3 * 15 = 45 apples</fact5>
   - From average trees: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">0 apples</fact6>

3. Total apples gathered:
   <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500</fact7>

4. Solving the equation:
   150 + x = 500
   x = 500 - 150
   x = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

The answer is {350}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>11/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Pat has a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">flower bed that is 111 feet long</fact1>. Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Pat already owns 17 flowers</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide</fact3> so <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, we need to:
1. Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed
2. Subtract the plants Pat already has
3. Multiply the remaining plants needed by the cost per plant

First, let's calculate the space each plant occupies:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 inches (1 foot) for the plant</fact3> + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1.5 feet for spacing</fact4> = 2.5 feet per plant

Now, let's see how many plants can fit in the flower bed:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">111 feet</fact1> / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants (we'll round down to 44 since we can't have a partial plant)

Pat needs 44 plants in total, but <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">she already has 17</fact2>. So she needs to buy:
44 - 17 = 27 plants

Finally, we calculate the cost:
27 plants * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$6 per plant</fact5> = $162

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

The answer is {162}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>12/ Reformatted Question:</strong> John decides to do several activities while out on vacation. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">He spent 40% of his time sightseeing</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He spent 30% of the time with the following events</fact2>. He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">spends 6 hours boating</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">half that time swimming</fact4>. He also <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each</fact5>. How much time did he spend sightseeing?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time of his vacation first.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30% of his time</fact2> was spent on the following activities:
- <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 hours boating</fact3>
- <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 hours swimming</fact4> (half of boating time)
- <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">6 hours watching shows</fact5> (3 shows x 2 hours each)

Total time for these activities: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

If 15 hours represents 30% of his time, then 100% of his time (total vacation time) would be:
15 / 0.30 = 50 hours

Now that we know the total vacation time, we can calculate the time spent sightseeing:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">40% of his time was spent sightseeing</fact1>
40% of 50 hours = 0.40 x 50 = 20 hours

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

The answer is {20}.</div></div>

He calculates that <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">his total income each week will be $92</fact5>. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean</fact6>. These are his only expenses. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Lucas's weekly profit, we need to determine his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

Total number of clients: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 current clients</fact1> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5 potential clients</fact2> = 8 clients

Expenses per client:
- <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 bottles of bleach</fact6> at <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$2 each</fact3> = 2 * $2 = $4
- <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">1 pack of cloths</fact6> at <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$5 each</fact4> = $5
Total expense per client: $4 + $5 = $9

Total expenses for all clients: $9 * 8 clients = $72

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Total weekly income: $92</fact5>

Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Lucas will make a profit of $20 each week.

The answer is {20}.</div></div>

The choir decides to perform with <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">just its female members</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The choir's 3 teachers decides to sing with them</fact4>, because <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">on the day of the performance, half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down</fact5>. How many people sang in the performance?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many people sang in the performance, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of female members in the choir:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">52 total members</fact1> × <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">50% girls</fact2> = 26 female members

2. Consider that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">only female members</fact3> were supposed to perform: 26 female members

3. Account for <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">half of the performers not making it due to the bus breakdown</fact5>:
   26 ÷ 2 = 13 female members able to perform

4. Add <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the 3 teachers who decided to sing with them</fact4>:
   13 female members + 3 teachers = 16 people

Therefore, 16 people sang in the performance.

The answer is {16}.</div></div>

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches</fact2>. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day</fact3>. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day</fact4>. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. The chalk starts at <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 inches</fact1>.

2. After Monday, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">45% of the chalk was used</fact4>. This means 55% of the chalk remains.
   55% of 5 inches = 0.55 * 5 = 2.75 inches

3. The teacher needs to stop using the chalk <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">when it's smaller than 2 inches</fact2>.
   So, he can use 2.75 - 2 = 0.75 inches more before recycling.

4. Going forward, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the teacher will use 20% of the remaining chalk each day</fact3>.
   20% of 2.75 inches = 0.2 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches per day

5. To find how many days this will last, we divide the usable chalk by the daily usage:
   0.75 inches ÷ 0.55 inches per day ≈ 1.36 days

6. Since we can't have a partial day of teaching, we round down to 1 day.

Therefore, the teacher has 1 more day before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The answer is {1}.</div></div>

The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon</fact3>. How much will it cost to fill the pool?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the cost of filling the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet</fact1> = 1,400 cubic feet

2. Convert cubic feet to gallons:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1,400 cubic feet * 5.9</fact2> = 8,260 gallons

3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">8,260 gallons * $0.10 per gallon</fact3> = $826

Therefore, it will cost $826 to fill the pool.

They decide to do it on a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">football field that is 100 yards long</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Kelly runs back and forth once</fact2>, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Blake runs back and forth 15 times</fact4>. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the distance each person runs:

Kelly's distance:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Kelly runs back and forth once</fact2> on the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100-yard field</fact1>, which is 100 * 2 = 200 yards.
Then, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times</fact3>. Each time she runs 40 * 2 = 80 yards.
So, this part of her run is 80 * 34 = 2,720 yards.
Total distance for Kelly: 200 + 2,720 = 2,920 yards

Blake's distance:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Blake runs back and forth 15 times</fact4> on the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100-yard field</fact1>.
Each time he runs 100 * 2 = 200 yards.
Total distance for Blake: 200 * 15 = 3,000 yards

Blake is the winner, running 3,000 yards.
The difference is 3,000 - 2,920 = 80 yards.

The answer is {80}.</div></div>

How many cookies does Jenny eat?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to calculate the total number of cookies and subtract the cookies eaten by her husband and son.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The bag contains 36 cookies</fact3>.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days</fact2>, which totals 7 cookies.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week</fact4>, which equals 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Total cookies eaten by husband and son: 7 + 20 = 27 cookies.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Jenny eats the rest of the cookies</fact5>, which means:
Jenny's cookies = Total cookies - (Husband's cookies + Son's cookies)
Jenny's cookies = <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">36</fact3> - 27 = 9 cookies

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies per week.

The answer is {9}.</div></div>

Tony is painting a room with four walls. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet</fact4>. How much will it cost to paint the room?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the cost of painting the room, we need to:
1. Calculate the total area to be painted
2. Determine how many gallons of paint are needed
3. Calculate the total cost of paint

Let's start with the total area:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">North and south walls: 10 x 8 feet each</fact3>, so 2 * (10 * 8) = 160 square feet
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">East and west walls: 5 x 8 feet each</fact4>, so 2 * (5 * 8) = 80 square feet
Total area = 160 + 80 = 240 square feet

Now, let's determine the number of gallons needed:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">One gallon covers 20 square feet</fact1>
Gallons needed = 240 / 20 = 12 gallons

Finally, let's calculate the total cost:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each gallon costs $12</fact2>
Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

Therefore, it will cost $144 to paint the room.

The answer is {144}.</div></div>

How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. The hotel started with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100 guests</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">24 guests checked out early</fact2>, so we subtract: 100 - 24 = 76 guests.

3. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</fact5>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15 people opted for late checkout</fact3>, so 15 * 2 = 30 people checked in during the afternoon. 
   Adding these: 76 + 30 = 106 guests.

4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">7 more people checked in after dinner</fact4>.

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound</fact4>, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days between <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">December 31st</fact1> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">July 19th</fact3>, which is 200 days (including both start and end dates).

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.</fact2> in this time period. Since <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound</fact4>, he needs to create a total calorie deficit of:
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

To achieve this over 200 days, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of:
105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day

Therefore, Andy needs to create a calorie deficit of 525 calories each day to reach his goal of losing <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">30 lbs.</fact2> by <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">July 19th</fact3>.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Marigolds at $2.74</fact2> round to $3 per pot.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Petunias at $1.87</fact3> round to $2 per pot.
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Begonias at $2.12</fact4> round to $2 per pot.

Now, we can calculate the total:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">12 pots of marigolds</fact5> at $3 each: 12 × $3 = $36
<fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">9 pots of petunias</fact6> at $2 each: 9 × $2 = $18
<fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">17 pots of begonias</fact7> at $2 each: 17 × $2 = $34

Total earnings: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

Therefore, Artie will make $88 from selling these flowers.

After the practice time was over, he asked Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag. Coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls</fact4>, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Jason carried 2 balls</fact4>.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey</fact3>. So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball (half of Jason's 2).

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason</fact2>. So, Jordan carried 4 balls (twice Jason's 2).

4. Adding up the balls carried by each boy: 
   Jeffrey (1) + Jason (2) + Jordan (4) = 7 balls in total

5. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip</fact1>, which means the total number of balls they carried is equal to the number of balls the coach brought to practice.

Therefore, the coach brought 7 basketballs to practice.

On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to sum up all the birds he saw and divide by the number of days.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Days 1 and 2: 50 birds</fact5>
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Day 3: 0 birds</fact1>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Days 4 and 5: 120 birds</fact2>

How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he ordered and subtract the number he has already sold.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Dale initially ordered 100 candies, then ordered 100 more</fact1>. This means he has a total of 100 + 100 = 200 candies to sell.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Dale has already sold 150 butterscotch candies</fact2>.

To find out how many he still needs to sell, we subtract the number sold from the total:
200 total candies - 150 sold candies = 50 candies

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

How many math problems does he have left to complete on Thursday?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's work backwards from Wednesday to Monday:

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On Monday, Chris completed 12 problems</fact4>.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many as Monday</fact2>, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.

By Wednesday, Chris had completed 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Out of the total 100 problems</fact3>, 100 - 48 = 52 problems were remaining before Wednesday.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems</fact1>. That's 1/4 * 52 = 13 problems.

So, by the end of Wednesday, Chris had completed 48 + 13 = 61 problems.

He charges based on how high he has to climb. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, we need to determine the total number of branches climbed and then divide by the number of days in a week.

First, let's calculate the total number of branches climbed:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$105 earned in a week</fact1> / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$0.25 per branch</fact2> = 420 branches total

As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds</fact1>, but <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking</fact3>, then <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">three times that amount in the next 30 seconds</fact4>. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop</fact3>.

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount pop</fact4>. So that's 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.

3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">After 60 seconds, the rate increases to four times the initial rate</fact1>. The initial rate was 20 kernels per 30 seconds, so the new rate is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels per 30 seconds.

4. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">However, in the final 30 seconds, the rate slows to half of the previous 30 seconds</fact2>. So in this period, 80 / 2 = 40 kernels pop.

5. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">After taking the pan off the heat, an additional quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop</fact5>. That's 40 / 4 = 10 more kernels.

6. Now, let's sum up all the popped kernels:

What's the total amount of money he will spend if <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">each pepper costs 15$</fact6>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">each pepper costs $15</fact6>.

2. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs</fact5>. So, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost</fact1>. So, an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

4. Now, let's calculate the total cost:
   - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 watermelons</fact2> at $45 each: 4 * $45 = $180
   - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 peppers</fact3> at $15 each: 20 * $15 = $300
   - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 oranges</fact4> at $40 each: 10 * $40 = $400

5. The total amount Dillon will spend is: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Therefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880 at the store.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time</fact3>. So, if the first time was 4 rings, the second time would be 4 * 3 = 12 rings.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time</fact2>. The second time was 12 rings, so half of that would be 12 / 2 = 6 rings.

4. Now, we can add up all the rings:
   First time: 4 rings
   Second time: 12 rings
   Third time: 6 rings

   Total: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 rings

Therefore, the alarm rang 22 times in total.

The answer is {22}.</div></div>

He also <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister when she asks for some right before bed</fact2>. He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours</fact3>. He <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">chews 1 piece on the way home from school</fact4> and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1 stick after dinner</fact5>. How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim uses throughout the day:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">At school: 8 hours / 2 hours per piece = 4 pieces</fact3>
2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On the way home: 1 piece</fact4>
3. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">After dinner: 1 piece</fact5>

Total pieces used before bed: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jim starts with 20 pieces</fact1>, so before bed he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He then gives half of the remaining gum to his sister</fact2>. Half of 14 is 7.

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

The answer is {7}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>33/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable</fact1>. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">he buys twenty 65-pound sacks</fact2>. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he buys forty-two 75-pound bales</fact3>. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he buys four 12-pound bags</fact4>. If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total weight of all the feed:

Sugar cubes: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 boxes * 1 pound = 2 pounds</fact1>
Oats: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 sacks * 65 pounds = 1,300 pounds</fact2>
Hay: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">42 bales * 75 pounds = 3,150 pounds</fact3>
Carrots: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 bags * 12 pounds = 48 pounds</fact4>

Total weight: 2 + 1,300 + 3,150 + 48 = 4,500 pounds

Now, since <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">the farmer's truck can carry 2,250 pounds per trip</fact5>, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

4,500 ÷ 2,250 = 2

This means the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed.

The answer is {2}.</div></div>

Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. And <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Next to Affenpinscher sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher</fact3>. How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the Mastiff's weight, we need to calculate the weights of the other dogs first:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds</fact1>.
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher</fact3>, so it weighs 10 * 2 = 20 pounds.
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so it weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.
4. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon</fact2>, so its weight is 5 * 44 = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

The answer is {220}.</div></div>

He <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it</fact2>. He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</fact3>. How many slices of cheese did he use?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total slices of cheese Carl used, we need to add up the cheese used in sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, and omelets.

For sandwiches: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">He ate a sandwich every day this week (7 days) with 2 slices of cheese each</fact1>. So, 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

For macaroni and cheese: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He used 8 slices</fact2>.

For omelets: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He ate omelets for 3 days, using 3 slices each time (one more than the sandwich)</fact3>. So, 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

Total slices of cheese used: 14 + 8 + 9 = 31 slices.

The answer is {31}.</div></div>

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">In the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.</fact2>

2. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">In the second race, he won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race.</fact1>
   So, he won: (2 × $5) + $1 = $11

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">In the third race, he lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race.</fact3>
   So, he lost: 1.5 × $11 = $16.50

4. Now, let's calculate the total loss/gain:
   Race 1: -$5
   Race 2: +$11
   Race 3: -$16.50
   Total: -$5 + $11 - $16.50 = -$10.50

5. To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
   Average loss = $10.50 ÷ 3 = $3.50

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.50 per race that day.

The answer is {3.50}.</div></div>

He also buys <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">3 dress shirts per suit</fact6>. <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">The dress shirts were $60 each</fact7>. How much did everything cost?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. Suits: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 suits</fact2> at <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$750 each</fact4> = 10 * $750 = $7,500

2. Dress pants: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 dress pants</fact3> at <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1/5 the cost of a suit</fact5>
   Cost of one dress pant = $750 * 1/5 = $150
   Total cost of dress pants = 10 * $150 = $1,500

3. Dress shirts: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">3 dress shirts per suit</fact6>, and there are <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 suits</fact2>
   Total number of dress shirts = 3 * 10 = 30
   <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">Each dress shirt costs $60</fact7>
   Total cost of dress shirts = 30 * $60 = $1,800

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$7,500 (suits) + $1,500 (dress pants) + $1,800 (dress shirts) = $10,800

Therefore, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">James' new wardrobe</fact1> cost a total of $10,800.

The answer is {10800}.</div></div>

How many cookies does he have now?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of cookies Randy has now:

Starting cookies:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">9 oatmeal + 4 chocolate chip + 5 sugar = 18 total</fact1>

Subtractions:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 cookies eaten (1 of each) = -3</fact2>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 sugar cookies given away = -2</fact3>
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 oatmeal cookies eaten for lunch = -2</fact5>

Additions:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 of each flavor baked = +12</fact4>

Calculation:
18 (starting total) - 3 - 2 - 2 + 12 = 23 cookies

Therefore, Randy now has 23 cookies.

How much money is used?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Jack's play time: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jack uses 1 quarter for 20 minutes</fact1>. In <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 hours (240 minutes)</fact3>, Jack would use 240/20 = 12 quarters.

2. Two friends who play half as long: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">These friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter</fact2>. In 4 hours, each would use 240/10 = 24 quarters. For both friends, that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

3. The friend who plays 1.5 times longer: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">This friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter</fact4>. In 4 hours, they would use 240/30 = 8 quarters.

4. Total quarters used: 12 (Jack) + 48 (two friends) + 8 (skilled friend) = 68 quarters

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Movies in series: 1/3 of 600 = 200 movies</fact4>

3. Movies not in series: 600 - 200 = 400 movies

4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Older movies: 40% of 400 = 160 movies</fact3>

5. Remaining normal-priced movies: 400 - 160 = 240 movies

6. Cost calculation:

Out of the remaining class, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact3>. How many students are leaving early?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members.

First, let's calculate the number of football players:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20% of the class are football players</fact2>
20% of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 students</fact1> = 0.20 * 30 = 6 football players

Now, let's calculate the remaining students:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 students</fact1> - 6 football players = 24 remaining students

Next, let's calculate the number of cheerleaders and band members:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of band</fact3>
25% of 24 remaining students = 0.25 * 24 = 6 cheerleaders and band members

How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. First day:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank</fact1>, which is 1/4 * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">18000</fact5> = 4500 gallons
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Ms. B pumped 3/4 of Wanda's amount</fact2>, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons
   Total pumped on first day: 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons

2. Second day:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Wanda pumped 2/3 of her previous day's amount</fact3>: 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her previous day's amount</fact4>: 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons
   Total pumped on second day: 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons

3. Total amount pumped over two days:
   7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons

4. Remaining water to fill the tank:
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Tank capacity</fact5> - Total pumped = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons

Therefore, 6000 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full.

The answer is {6000}.</div></div>

How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total cost of the dental work:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 implants</fact1> at <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$2000 each</fact2>: 2 * $2000 = $4000
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">One crown</fact4> at <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$500</fact3>: $500
Total cost: $4000 + $500 = $4500

Now, let's subtract the deposit:
$4500 - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$600</fact5> = $3900

This is the amount George still needs to pay.

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide this amount by his hourly rate:
$3900 / <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$15 per hour</fact6> = 260 hours

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the remaining cost of his dental work.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Second week: 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars</fact2>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Third week: 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars</fact3>

Total for first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Monthly total: 50,000 bars</fact1>

Fourth week production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

The answer is {14000}.</div></div>

She noticed that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons</fact1>. Later, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia</fact2>. When she went to set the table, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">she had a total of 12 spoons</fact3>. Before that <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">when Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew</fact4>. How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many spoons were in the package Julia bought, we need to work backwards:

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Julia had a total of 12 spoons</fact3> when setting the table.
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Her husband bought 5 spoons</fact2>, so Julia's package had 12 - 5 = 7 spoons.
However, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew</fact4> before setting the table.
So, the original number of spoons in Julia's package was 7 + 3 = 10 spoons.

Therefore, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the package of spoons that Julia bought</fact1> contained 10 spoons.

The answer is {10}.</div></div>

When a UV light turned on, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 jellyfish changed color</fact3>. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. We know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 jellyfish changed color</fact3> when the UV light was turned on.
2. These 6 jellyfish represent <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">a third of the large jellyfish</fact2>.
3. So, if 6 is a third, the total number of large jellyfish must be 6 * 3 = 18.
4. We also know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">a fifth of the jellyfish are large</fact1>.
5. If 18 large jellyfish represent one-fifth of the total, then the total number of jellyfish must be 18 * 5 = 90.

Therefore, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

The answer is {90}.</div></div>

Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">In the end, the charge remaining was 28%</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours</fact4>. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the initial charge of the power bank, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The final charge was 28%</fact3>. 

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% per hour</fact4>. So we need to add back:
3 * 7% = 21%
28% + 21% = 49%

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% per hour</fact2>. So we need to add back:
5 * 9% = 45%
49% + 45% = 94%

Therefore, when Maria went out to the park, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the power bank wasn't fully charged</fact1>, but it was at 94% charge.

The answer is {94}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>51/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill. She starts off by <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each</fact1>. She then <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each</fact2>. She then <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each</fact3>. As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away</fact4>. Lastly <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each</fact5>. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">She also drops 1 of these flowers</fact6>. She puts the remaining flowers in the vase. How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of petals for each group of flowers:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 flowers with 5 petals each</fact1>: 3 * 5 = 15 petals
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 flowers with 6 petals each</fact2>: 4 * 6 = 24 petals
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 flowers with 4 petals each</fact3>: 5 * 4 = 20 petals
4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">6 flowers with 7 petals each</fact5>: 6 * 7 = 42 petals

Now, we need to subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">She drops 1 of each from the first three groups</fact4>, so we subtract:
5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals

<fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">She also drops 1 flower from the last group</fact6>, so we subtract:
7 petals

Total petals remaining:
(15 + 24 + 20 + 42) - (15 + 7) = 101 - 22 = 79 petals

Therefore, there are 79 petals in total on the flowers in the vase.

The answer is {79}.</div></div>

If they <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">already own 15 tables</fact4>, how many new tables do they need?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of boxes:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 people donating 5 boxes each</fact1> = 10 * 5 = 50 boxes
Plus <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 boxes they already have</fact3> = 50 + 10 = 60 total boxes

Now, let's determine how many tables are needed for all these boxes:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 boxes per table</fact2>, so 60 boxes / 2 = 30 tables needed

They <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">already own 15 tables</fact4>, so the number of new tables needed is:
30 tables needed - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">15 tables already owned</fact4> = 15 new tables needed

How many did each person get?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's start by determining how many seashells each person collected:

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Jim collected 27 seashells</fact2>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Carlos collected 5 less than Jim</fact3>, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey</fact4>, so Carrey collected 22 ÷ 2 = 11 seashells

Now we can calculate the total number of seashells:
27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells in total

Since they <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">divided them equally between themselves</fact1>, each person got:
60 ÷ 3 = 20 seashells

How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how many bees returned in the last 6 hours, we need to:
1. Find how many bees left initially: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 bees left in the first 6 hours</fact1>.
2. Calculate how many returned in the second 6 hours: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1/2 of 30 = 15 bees returned</fact2>.
3. Calculate how many hadn't returned yet: 30 - 15 = 15 bees.
4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">These 15 bees that hadn't returned yet will return in the last 6 hours</fact3>.

Therefore, Debra saw 15 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

How many checks does Buford write per year?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down:

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Gas bill: 1 check per month</fact2> = 12 checks per year
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Pest and lawn service: 1 check quarterly</fact3> = 4 checks per year
3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Electric bill: 1 check per month</fact4> = 12 checks per year
4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Church: 2 checks per month</fact5> = 24 checks per year

Adding these up: 12 + 4 + 12 + 24 = 52 checks per year

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Buford writes many checks every year</fact1>, and we've accounted for 52 of them. Since the question doesn't provide information about any other specific checks, we can conclude that Buford writes at least 52 checks per year.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3% of $400,000</fact1> = 0.03 × <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$400,000</fact3> = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fee:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5% of $400,000</fact2> = 0.05 × <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$400,000</fact3> = $20,000

3. Total fees:
   $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

4. Subtract fees and remaining loan amount from the selling price:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$400,000</fact3> - $32,000 - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$250,000</fact4> = $118,000

When <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Tobias howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds</fact3>. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Tobias howls for 20 seconds</fact3>.

2. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias</fact1>, so Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined</fact2>. This means Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

4. The total time of howling for all three wolves is:
   Tobias: 20 seconds
   Chikote: 40 seconds
   Igneous: 60 seconds
   Total: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds

5. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60:
   120 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 2 minutes

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The answer is {2}.</div></div>

1. Calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Original price of shirt: $25</fact2>
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Discount: 30%</fact3>
   Discount amount: $25 * 30% = $7.50
   Discounted price of shirt: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

2. Calculate the discounted price of the shorts:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Original price of shorts: $35</fact4>
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Discount: 30%</fact3>
   Discount amount: $35 * 30% = $10.50
   Discounted price of shorts: $35 - $10.50 = $24.50

3. Calculate the total cost of the outfit:
   Total cost = Discounted shirt + Discounted shorts
   Total cost = $17.50 + $24.50 = $42

4. Calculate how much money Joe has left:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Joe's initial amount: $50</fact1>
   Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
   Money left = $50 - $42 = $8

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Since sales tax is included</fact5>, we don't need to make any additional calculations.

Therefore, Joe will have $8 left after his purchase.

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she has 110 books</fact4>, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate how many books each bookcase can hold:
- Middle shelves: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each middle shelf holds 10 books</fact3>, and there are 2 middle shelves, so 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Bottom shelf: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Holds twice as many as a middle shelf</fact1>, so 2 * 10 = 20 books
- Top shelf: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Holds 5 fewer than the bottom shelf</fact2>, so 20 - 5 = 15 books

Total books per bookcase: 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">they are there for 3 days</fact4> how much did the trip cost?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Calculate the hotel cost per day:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Normal price: $1500</fact2>
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20% increase: $1500 * 0.20 = $300</fact1>
   Actual price per day: $1500 + $300 = $1800

2. Calculate the total hotel cost for the trip:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Number of days: 3</fact4>
   Total hotel cost: $1800 * 3 = $5400

3. Calculate the cost of plane tickets:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Cost per ticket: $5000</fact3>
   Number of tickets: 2 (Tom and his wife)
   Total ticket cost: $5000 * 2 = $10,000

4. Sum up the total cost:
   Total cost = Hotel cost + Plane ticket cost
   Total cost = $5400 + $10,000 = $15,400

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $15,400.</div></div>

How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Mark's weekly earnings, we need to:
1. Determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher
2. Calculate his earnings from Publisher A
3. Calculate his earnings from Publisher B
4. Sum up his total earnings

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher</fact5>, so he edits <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1000</fact2> / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher per week.

For Publisher A:
500 sentences * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 cents per sentence</fact3> = 2500 cents

For Publisher B:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays</fact4>, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence
500 sentences * 10 cents per sentence = 5000 cents

Total earnings:
2500 cents (Publisher A) + 5000 cents (Publisher B) = 7500 cents

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

The answer is {7500}.</div></div>

She wants to make sure <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">she and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts twice</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The Go-karts cost $10 a ride</fact4>. How many friends can she invite?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break down the costs for each person:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Mini-golf: $5</fact2>
Arcade tokens: $5
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Go-karts: $10 x 2 rides = $20</fact4>

Total cost per person: $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Now, we need to determine how many people (including Morgan) can be covered by the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$90 budget</fact1>:

$90 / $30 = 3 people

This means Morgan can invite 2 friends (3 people total, including herself).

To verify:
3 people x $30 each = $90, which matches the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">budget of $90</fact1>.

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.

The answer is {2}.</div></div>

If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">each pizza costs $15</fact5>, how many dollars will Maddy spend?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much Maddy will spend, we need to determine the total number of people and how many pizzas are needed.

Total people:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 team members</fact2> + (<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 guests</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 team members</fact2>) + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 coaches</fact3> = 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people

Number of pizzas needed:
39 people / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 people per pizza</fact4> = 13 pizzas (rounded up)

Total cost:
13 pizzas * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$15 per pizza</fact5> = $195

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizza for her cousin's soccer game.

The answer is {195}.</div></div>

Mrs. Cruz is looking for <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">a house that will not go beyond her $400,000 budget</fact4>. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total price of the house:
1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The selling price is $350,000</fact1>
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000</fact2> = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The transfer fee is 12% of $350,000</fact3> = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

The total price is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000</fact4>

The difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget is:
$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The answer is {9500}.</div></div>

Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. On Monday, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Meredith wrote 5 articles</fact3>.

2. For Tuesday, we need to calculate 2/5 more than Monday:
   5 + (5 * 2/5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</fact2>:
   7 * 2 = 14 articles on Wednesday

4. Total articles over three days:
   Monday (5) + Tuesday (7) + Wednesday (14) = 26 articles

5. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write</fact1>, so:
   26 articles * 4 hours per article = 104 hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over the three days.

The answer is {104}.</div></div>

1. Adam: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Adam has 50 points</fact1>.

2. Betty: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Betty collected 30% more than Adam</fact4>. 
   Betty's points = 50 + (50 * 30%) = 50 + 15 = 65 points

3. Tom: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Tom has 30 points less than Betty</fact3>.
   Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points

4. Martha: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom</fact2>.
   Martha's points = 35 * 3 = 105 points

Total points collected by the class:
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The minimum threshold is 400 points</fact5>.
Points missing = 400 - 255 = 145 points

Therefore, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.

He had <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish</fact2>. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white</fact4>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white</fact4>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He bought 17 new fish</fact2> from the pet store.

3. After adding the new fish, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he had twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact3>.

Let's say he bought 'x' white fish. Then:
- New total of white fish = 4 + x
- New total of orange fish = 3 + (17 - x)

Since <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the new total of orange fish is twice the new total of white fish</fact3>:
3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)

Solving this equation:
20 - x = 8 + 2x
20 - 8 = 3x
12 = 3x
x = 4

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

The answer is {4}.</div></div>

How many stickers does Leo have in his collection?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of stickers in Leo's collection, we need to add up all the stickers he has collected over the years:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Two years ago: 100 stickers</fact1>
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Last year: 50 stickers</fact3>
3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">This year: Twice the number of stickers as last year</fact2>, which is 2 * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50</fact3> = 100 stickers

Now, we can add them all together:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">50</fact3> + 100 = 250 stickers

Therefore, Leo currently has 250 stickers in his collection.

They all <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">work on the order during their 10-hour shift</fact3>, and by the end of their shift <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact5>, and <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact6>.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. The total number of toys produced during the shift is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">400</fact1> - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20</fact4> = 380 toys.

2. We know that <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 workers produce 6 toys per hour</fact5>, so in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 hours</fact3> they produce:
   2 * 6 * 10 = 120 toys

3. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Another 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour</fact6>, so in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 hours</fact3> they produce:
   2 * 4 * 10 = 80 toys

4. The total toys produced by these 4 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys

5. The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
   380 - 200 = 180 toys

6. Since the shift was <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10 hours</fact3> long, the fifth worker's hourly production is:
   180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.

The answer is {18}.</div></div>

After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The initial bill was $40.00</fact1>
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Stephen added a $4.00 tip</fact2>, so the subtotal becomes $40.00 + $4.00 = $44.00
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The delivery vendor added a 25% fee</fact3>. 25% of $44.00 is $11.00, so we add this: $44.00 + $11.00 = $55.00
4. Finally, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">they charged $3.00 in delivery fees</fact4>. Adding this to our total: $55.00 + $3.00 = $58.00

How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. First, let's calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">60% of 70 questions</fact2> = 0.6 * 70 = 42 questions

2. Now, let's calculate the total number of questions across both tests:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">70 questions</fact2> (first test) + <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">40 questions</fact1> (second test) = 110 questions total

3. To pass, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions correct</fact3>:
   70% of 110 = 0.7 * 110 = 77 questions

4. We know she got 42 correct on the first test, so we can calculate how many she needs on the second:
   77 (total needed) - 42 (correct on first test) = 35 questions

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move on to 7th grade.

How far off was his guess?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Tim's guess:
1. Volume of the jar: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 * 6 * 15</fact4> = 540 cubic inches
2. Effective volume with packing efficiency: 540 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">0.80</fact2> = 432 cubic inches
3. Number of total jelly beans: 432 / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">0.15</fact1> = 2,880 jelly beans
4. Number of red jelly beans: 2,880 * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">0.30</fact3> = 864 red jelly beans

Tim's guess would be 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number of red jelly beans is <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">900</fact5>.

The difference between Tim's guess and the actual number:

Sandra had ordered <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">four times as many red roses as white carnations</fact1>. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations</fact2>. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to calculate the number of white carnations first, as the number of red roses is based on this.

From <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">, we know that 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations. So we can calculate:
200 ÷ 5 = 40 white carnations

Now, using <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So the total number of red roses ordered is:
40 × 4 = 160 red roses

Therefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

The answer is {160}.</div></div>

So <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches</fact4>. How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, let's calculate how many sandwiches Sidney initially ordered:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches</fact1>

Now, let's determine how many sandwiches remained after Mark ate some:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 sandwiches</fact1> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 sandwiches eaten by Mark</fact3> = 3 sandwiches

Then, we add the additional sandwiches Sidney ordered:
3 remaining sandwiches + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 new sandwiches</fact4> = 6 sandwiches in total

Finally, we calculate the number of meatballs in these remaining sandwiches:
6 sandwiches × <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 meatballs per sandwich</fact2> = 24 meatballs

Therefore, there were 24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained.

How long did the trip take?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total trip time, we need to consider both the journey to the friend's house and the return trip.

For the trip to the friend's house:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The original distance is 200 miles</fact5>, but <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">a detour added 10 miles</fact2>. So the total distance to the friend's house is 210 miles.
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">John drives at 70 mph</fact1> for this part of the trip.
Time to friend's house = 210 miles / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">70 mph</fact1> = 3 hours

For the return trip:

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">John drives at 80 mph</fact4> for this part of the trip.
Time for return trip = <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">240 miles</fact3> / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">80 mph</fact4> = 3 hours

Total trip time = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

If <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans</fact4> and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">the rest from the tattered jeans</fact5>, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The tattered jeans cost $28</fact1>.
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans</fact2>, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The total savings was $6</fact3>.
4. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1/3 of the savings came from the jogger jeans</fact4>, which is $6 * 1/3 = $2.
5. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The rest of the savings (2/3) came from the tattered jeans</fact5>, which is $6 * 2/3 = $4.

Now, we can calculate the original prices:
- Tattered jeans: $28 + $4 = $32
- Jogger jeans: $22 + $2 = $24

The difference between the original prices is $32 - $24 = $8.

However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the jogger jeans actually cost less, we need to express this as a negative number.

The answer is {-8}.</div></div>

He <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">uses 60% of that to pay off his debts</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">His house is worth $250,000</fact3>. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much money John had leftover, we need to:
1. Calculate the loan amount:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">40%</fact1> of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$250,000</fact3> = 0.4 * $250,000 = $100,000

2. Calculate the amount used to pay off debts:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">60%</fact2> of $100,000 = 0.6 * $100,000 = $60,000

3. Calculate the remaining amount:
   $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, John had $40,000 leftover after paying his debts.

The answer is {40000}.</div></div>

How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the temperature change in each phase:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Low setting for 3 hours</fact1>: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 degrees per hour</fact4> * 3 hours = 6 degrees cooler

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">High setting for 4 hours</fact2>: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">3 degrees per hour</fact5> * 4 hours = 12 degrees cooler

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Turned off for 2 hours</fact3>: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 degrees warmer per hour</fact6> * 2 hours = 4 degrees warmer

Total temperature change:

He knows that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car</fact1>. He knows based on historical averages, that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">for every 25 telephone calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus</fact3>. Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would Jason need to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many calls Jason needs to make, we'll work backwards from the number of cars he needs to sell.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Jason needs to sell 15 cars</fact3>.

According to <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the ratio of customers to sales</fact1>, Jason needs twice as many customers as cars sold. So he needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers to come into the dealership.

Now, we know from <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the ratio of calls to customers</fact2> that Jason needs to make 25 calls for each customer who comes in. So he needs to make 30 * 25 = 750 calls.

Therefore, Jason would need to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, based on the average numbers provided.

The answer is {750}.</div></div>

She <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">sells each cup of lemonade for $1</fact3>. She <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">sells an average of 4 cups per hour</fact4> that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Millie's profit per hour, we need to determine her total revenue, total cost, and the time it takes to sell all the lemonade.

Total lemonade available: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 cups per pitcher</fact1> * 3 pitchers = 36 cups

Total revenue: 36 cups * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1 per cup</fact3> = $36

Total cost: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$18 for supplies</fact2>

Profit: $36 - $18 = $18

Time to sell all lemonade: 36 cups / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 cups per hour</fact4> = 9 hours

Profit per hour: $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.

For a gallon of lemonade, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">his recipe called for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice</fact2>. He figured <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he would need to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party</fact3>. His best friend Allen asked if Tim could <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons</fact4>. How many lemons will Tim need?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To make the 4 gallons for the party, Tim needs:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 gallons</fact3> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1 cup of juice per gallon</fact2> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 lemons per cup</fact1> = 24 lemons

For Allen's extra gallon that's twice as tart, Tim needs:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1 gallon</fact4> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1 cup of juice per gallon</fact2> * 2 (for twice as tart) * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 lemons per cup</fact1> = 12 lemons

What is their average guess?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate each friend's guess:

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The first friend's guess is 80</fact3>.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess</fact2>. 
Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend's guess is 40 + 20 = 60.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess</fact1>. 
25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend's guess is 80 + 20 = 100.

To find the average, we add all three guesses and divide by 3:
(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80.

The answer is {80}.</div></div>

How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes</fact3>.

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On Saturday, they sold double that number</fact4>. So, Saturday's sales were 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.

3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">On Sunday (the last day), they sold half of what they sold on Saturday</fact1>. So, Sunday's initial sales were 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

4. However, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">six people returned their pairs on Sunday</fact2>. So the final count for Sunday is 14 - 6 = 8 pairs.

5. To get the total number of shoes sold during the sale, we add up all three days:
   Friday: 14 pairs
   Saturday: 28 pairs
   Sunday: 8 pairs (after returns)

   Total: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs

Therefore, by the end of the sale, the store had sold 50 pairs of tennis shoes.

How much money does Madeline spend on her dog per year if <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">there are 4 weeks in a month</fact4>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Madeline's yearly expenses for her dog, we need to consider the monthly costs and multiply them by 12 (months in a year).

Monthly costs:
- Treats: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$20 per month</fact1>
- Medicine: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$100 per month</fact2>
- Food: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$25 per week</fact3> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 weeks</fact4> = $100 per month

Total monthly cost: $20 + $100 + $100 = $220

Yearly cost: $220 * 12 months = $2,640

Therefore, Madeline spends $2,640 on her dog per year.

The answer is {2640}.</div></div>

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night = 2 hours total</fact1>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Thursday: 1 hour episode + 30 minute show = 1.5 hours</fact3>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Friday: Two 1-hour episodes = 2 hours</fact4>

So far, we have 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours accounted for.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The total TV time for the week was 7 hours</fact5>, so the remaining time for Wednesday is:
7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On Wednesday, Frankie watched 30-minute episodes</fact2>. To find out how many, we divide the remaining time by 30 minutes:
1.5 hours = 90 minutes
90 minutes ÷ 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

1. The city's fireworks:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">15 boxes of 20 fireworks each</fact2> = 15 × 20 = 300 fireworks in total

2. Hannah's view of the city's fireworks:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks</fact4>
   40% of 300 = 0.4 × 300 = 120 fireworks from the city display

3. Hannah's own fireworks:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 boxes of 5 fireworks each</fact3> = 3 × 5 = 15 fireworks in her backyard

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of skeins needed, we'll multiply the number of skeins required for each item by the number of grandchildren:

Hats: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 skeins</fact2> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins
Scarves: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 skeins</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 12 skeins
Sweaters: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">12 skeins</fact4> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 36 skeins
Mittens: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1 skein</fact5> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 3 skeins
Socks: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 skeins</fact6> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 grandchildren</fact1> = 6 skeins

Now, we sum up all the skeins needed:
6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool to make <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren</fact7>.

1. Calculate the total amount raised by students:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Total raised</fact2> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Amount from organizations</fact3> = $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

2. Divide this amount by the number of students:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Amount raised by students</fact4> / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Number of students</fact1> = $125,000 / 20 = $6,250

How many 5 dollar bills does he have?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills</fact1>. This means he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills initially.

2. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">He lost 10 bills while getting home</fact5>, so now he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill</fact2>. Half of 40 is 20, so he uses 20 bills and has 20 bills left.

4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Thomas then triples his money</fact3>. He now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.

5. At this point, he has 60 * $20 = $1200.

6. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills</fact4>. 
   $1200 / $5 = 240 five-dollar bills.

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Wayne's drive time is 4 minutes</fact3>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Bernadette's drive time is 4 times Wayne's</fact2>, so her drive time is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.

3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne</fact1>, so we need to add 5 minutes to her lead time.

4. To calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we need to:
   - Take Bernadette's drive time (16 minutes)
   - Subtract Wayne's drive time (4 minutes)
   - Add the desired arrival difference (5 minutes)

   So: 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 minutes

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him at the theater.

   Total for both days: 60 + 80 = 140

Therefore, Mr. Julius planted a total of 140 trees in the two days.

The answer is {140}.</div></div>

On the first day, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">when Gunther wasn't looking, Arnold, the chimpanzee, stole half of the bananas from the pile</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas to his pile and began counting bananas</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On the second day, Gunther added another 25 bananas to his pile</fact4>, but <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">later that evening, Arnold stole another 12 of the bananas</fact5>. How many bananas did Gunther count to be in the pile?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Initially, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Gunther had 48 bananas</fact1>.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Arnold stole half of the bananas</fact2>, leaving 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On the second day, Gunther added 25 bananas</fact4>, bringing the total to 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Later on the second day, Arnold stole 12 more bananas</fact5>, leaving 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

5. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas and then began counting</fact3>. This brings the final total to 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

Therefore, when Gunther counted the bananas, he found 43 in the pile.

He <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">gets charged $2 per mile driven</fact5> and he also <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">gives his driver a $150 bonus per month</fact6>. How much does he pay a year for driving?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate John's yearly cost for driving, we need to consider both the mileage charges and the monthly bonus:

1. Mileage charges:
   - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Distance to work: 30 miles</fact3>
   - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Round trip: 30 * 2 = 60 miles per day</fact4>
   - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Workdays per year: 5 days * 50 weeks = 250 days</fact2>
   - Total miles per year: 60 * 250 = 15,000 miles
   - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Cost per mile: $2</fact5>
   - Yearly mileage cost: 15,000 * $2 = $30,000

2. Monthly bonus:
   - <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Monthly bonus: $150</fact6>
   - Yearly bonus: $150 * 12 months = $1,800

3. Total yearly cost:
   - $30,000 (mileage) + $1,800 (bonus) = $31,800

Therefore, John pays $31,800 per year for driving.

The answer is {31,800}.</div></div>

Originally, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year</fact4>. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work backwards from the information given.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Henry currently has 110 cookies</fact3>. We know that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">he dropped 5 cookies</fact2>, so before dropping them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to</fact1>, so his original intention was to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">He wanted to make twice as many as he did last year</fact4>. This means that last year's amount is half of what he intended to bake this year.

So, last year Henry baked 100 ÷ 2 = 50 cookies.

The answer is {50}.</div></div>

And <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals</fact4>. In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total ounces of meat consumed:

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The second player ate 8 beef tips, each weighing 1 ounce</fact1>. So that's 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The first player ate a 6-ounce steak</fact2>, which is 6 ounces.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The third player ate a one-pound steak</fact3>. We know that 1 pound equals 16 ounces, so this is 16 ounces.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals</fact4>, so they didn't consume any meat. Their contribution is 0 ounces.

Adding up all the meat consumed:
8 ounces (second player) + 6 ounces (first player) + 16 ounces (third player) + 0 ounces (fourth and fifth players) = 30 ounces

Therefore, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.

The answer is {30}.</div></div>

How much money would Cameron save?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much Cameron would save, we need to:
1. Calculate the duration of Cameron's stay:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">From 5 pm to 10 am the next day</fact1> is 17 hours.

2. Calculate the cost of his chosen option:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos</fact2>
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Additional 5 hours at 70 pesos per hour</fact3> = 5 * 70 = 350 pesos
   Total cost = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos

3. Compare with the 24-hour rate:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos</fact2>

4. Calculate the savings:
   Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos

Therefore, by <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">choosing the 12-hour rate plus additional hours</fact4>, Cameron would save 250 pesos compared to the 24-hour rate.

How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Ryan's total allowance: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 weeks</fact1> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$6 per week</fact4> = $18

2. Money spent on ice cream: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 ice cream cones</fact2> (himself and 3 friends) * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$1.25 each</fact2> = $5

3. Money left after buying ice cream: $18 - $5 = $13

4. Cost of each movie ticket: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$6.50</fact3>

5. Number of movie tickets Ryan can buy: $13 / <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$6.50</fact3> = 2

After pouring chamomile and mint tea, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups</fact5>. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Lana has a total of 27 cups</fact2>.
2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">15 of these cups are used for cinnamon tea</fact4>.
3. This leaves 27 - 15 = 12 cups for chamomile and mint tea.
4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">These 12 cups are divided into 3 rows</fact3>.
5. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Each row has an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups</fact5>.

Since there are 12 cups divided equally into 3 rows, each row has 12 / 3 = 4 cups total.

Given that <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">each row has an equal number of chamomile and mint tea cups</fact5>, half of the cups in each row are mint tea.

Therefore, there are 4 / 2 = 2 cups of mint tea in each row.

If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Becky ate 10 slices</fact5>, how many total slices did they eat?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>We know that <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Becky ate 10 slices</fact5>. Since <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake</fact2>, we can calculate that Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices. 

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake</fact3>, so Silvia ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we add up the slices eaten by each person:
Becky: 10 slices
Jake: 7 slices
Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices

We can verify this answer by checking against the total number of slices available. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">They shared 4 pizzas</fact4>, and <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">each pizza had 8 slices</fact1>. So the total number of slices available was 4 * 8 = 32 slices. Since they ate 31 slices out of 32 available, our calculation is correct.

With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of candles and flashlights:

Candles:
- For half the rooms (<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8</fact1>/2 = 4 rooms): <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 small candles each</fact3>
  4 rooms × 4 candles = 16 small candles
- For the other half (4 rooms): <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 medium candles each</fact4>
  4 rooms × 5 candles = 20 medium candles
Total candles: 16 + 20 = 36 candles

Flashlights:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">On Friday, there were 18 pink flamingos</fact1>.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On Saturday, one-third of these were taken, painted white, and put back</fact3>. 
   One-third of 18 is 6. So now there are 12 pink and 6 white flamingos.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On Sunday morning, 18 more pink flamingos were added</fact2>.
   Now there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and still 6 white flamingos.

4. At noon on Sunday, there are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

5. The difference between pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

Finally, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">one person actually came by on a unicycle</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</fact4>. How many dollars did she make that day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Shawnda's earnings for the day, we need to count the total number of tires inflated and multiply by the cost per tire.

For bicycles: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 bicycles</fact1> * 2 tires each = 10 tires
For tricycles: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 tricycles</fact2> * 3 tires each = 9 tires
For unicycles: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1 unicycle</fact3> * 1 tire = 1 tire

Total tires inflated: 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Revenue: 20 tires * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$0.25 per tire</fact4> = $5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day.

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to consider the total amount of feed required and subtract what has already been given.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day</fact2>. With <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20 chickens</fact5>, the total daily feed requirement is 3 * 20 = 60 cups.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">This is divided into three meals</fact1>. We know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15 cups are given in the morning</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">25 cups are given in the afternoon</fact4>. This means that 15 + 25 = 40 cups have already been given.

To find out how much is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total required:
60 cups (total required) - 40 cups (already given) = 20 cups

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much root beer was available for each person at the party, we need to determine how much was left after all the incidents:

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Initial amount: 24 gallons</fact1>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Minus children's consumption: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons</fact2>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Minus Barbie's spill: 20 - 7 = 13 gallons</fact4>
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Minus Ronnie's consumption: 13 - 5 = 8 gallons</fact5>

So, there were 8 gallons of root beer left for the party.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 people showed up for the party</fact3>, and we can assume Fred was there too, making it 4 people in total.

If they shared the remaining root beer equally, each person would get:
8 gallons ÷ 4 people = 2 gallons per person

1. First, we need to calculate the chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework:

   a) <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">There's a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher</fact2>, in which case he won't need to turn in homework.

   b) If it's not a substitute (50% chance), then:
      - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">There's a 40% chance the normal teacher gives an extension</fact1>
      - If there's no extension (60% chance), <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">there's still a 20% chance Marcus gets a personal extension</fact3>

2. Let's calculate the probability of not turning in homework:
   
   50% (substitute) + (50% * 40%) (normal teacher with extension) + (50% * 60% * 20%) (normal teacher, no class extension, but personal extension)
   = 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.06
   = 0.76 or 76%

3. Therefore, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
   100% - 76% = 24%

The answer is {24}.</div></div>

1. Large sticker trades:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Lorraine has 40 large stickers</fact4>.
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">She trades 50% (20) for large buttons</fact5>, so she gets 20 large buttons.
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">She trades the other 50% (20) for small buttons</fact5>. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each large sticker is worth three small buttons</fact1>, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

2. Small sticker trades:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers</fact4>.
   <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">She trades 90% (27) of her small stickers for large buttons</fact6>.
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">A large button is worth three small stickers</fact3>, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.
   She keeps 10% (3) of her small stickers.

3. Total buttons:
   Large buttons: 20 (from large stickers) + 9 (from small stickers) = 29 large buttons
   Small buttons: 60 (from large stickers) + 3 (remaining small stickers) = 63 small buttons

Therefore, Lorraine ends up with a total of 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons, which is 92 buttons in total.

1. Picture frames: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44 seniors</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$20 per frame</fact3> = $880

2. Etching cost: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20% additional cost</fact4> on each frame
   $880 * 0.20 = $176

3. Pins: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 seniors</fact2> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$5 per pin</fact2> = $10

4. Cords for officers: 
   Number of officers = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44 seniors</fact1> * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1/4</fact5> = 11 officers
   Cost of cords = 11 * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$12 per cord</fact5> = $132

Total cost:
$880 (frames) + $176 (etching) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1,198

He was a pen pal with 5 people. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">He stopped being penpals with 2 of them</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">He responds in kind</fact4>. How many hours does he spend writing a week?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to calculate how many pen pals Mike currently has:
   5 original pen pals - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 he stopped writing to</fact2> = 3 current pen pals

2. Now, let's calculate how many pages Mike writes per week:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 letters per week</fact3> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 pages per letter</fact3> * 3 pen pals = 30 pages per week

3. We know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Mike can write a page every 6 minutes</fact1>. So, to write 30 pages:
   30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes

4. To convert this to hours:
   180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours

Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters each week.

The answer is {3}.</div></div>

It <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">takes 10 minutes to get to the airport</fact4>. He <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">has to be at the airport in 60 minutes</fact5> and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. How many minutes early will Toby be?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, we need to calculate how long it will take Toby to read the book and compare it to the time he has available.

The book has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">45 pages</fact1> with <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">200 words per page</fact2>, so the total number of words is 45 * 200 = 9,000 words.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Toby reads 300 words per minute</fact3>, so it will take him 9,000 / 300 = 30 minutes to read the book.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport</fact4>, so the total time needed is 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport</fact5>, so he will be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

Calculate how much he got in refunds.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the refund amount, we need to determine:
1. The amount of expired milk
2. The cost of the expired milk

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date</fact1>. So, the amount of expired milk is:
2/5 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4000 gallons</fact2> = 1600 gallons

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The cost per gallon was $3.5</fact2>. So, the cost of the expired milk is:
1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk and ordered a refund</fact3>, so the refund amount would be equal to the cost of the expired milk.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got $5,600 in refunds.

(Round to the nearest integer.)<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Onion cost:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions</fact1>, but <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Antoine doubles that</fact2>, so he needs 4 pounds.
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Onions cost $2.00 per pound</fact3>, so 4 * $2.00 = $8.00 for onions.

2. Beef stock cost:
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">He needs 2 boxes of beef stock at $2.00 per box</fact5>, so 2 * $2.00 = $4.00 for beef stock.

3. Total cost:
   $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00 total

4. Cost per serving:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The soup serves 6 people</fact4>, so $12.00 / 6 = $2.00 per serving

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.

It also <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">takes 2 pounds of special honey</fact7>. How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the cost and revenue for 10 jars:

Cost per jar:
- Passion fruit: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 pounds</fact5> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$6 per pound</fact1> = $12
- Jackfruit: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">1.5 pounds</fact6> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$8 per pound</fact2> = $12
- Honey: <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">2 pounds</fact7> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$10 per pound</fact3> = $20
Total cost per jar: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Cost for 10 jars: $44 * 10 = $440

Revenue:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">He sells each jar for $50</fact4>
Revenue for 10 jars: $50 * 10 = $500

Profit:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $500 - $440 = $60

Therefore, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

The answer is {60}.</div></div>

How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 km per day</fact3>. So for 4 days: 4 * 200 = 800 km

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">For the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the first 4 days' distance</fact4>. 
   30% of 800 km = 0.3 * 800 = 240 km

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">On the 7th day, Tom didn't travel</fact2>. So 0 km for this day.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">For the second week (7 days), he traveled 300 km per day</fact5>. 
   So for 7 days: 7 * 300 = 2100 km

5. Total distance = First 4 days + Next 2 days + 7th day + Second week
                  = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100
                  = 3140 km

Therefore, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">during his two-week-long trip</fact1>, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>119/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Glue sticks come in packs of 8</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students</fact2>. He wants to <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">give each student 2 glue sticks</fact3>. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he can only buy whole packs</fact4> and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required:

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">27 students</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 glue sticks per student</fact3> = 54 glue sticks needed

Now, we need to find out how many packs of 8 this translates to:

54 glue sticks / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8 glue sticks per pack</fact1> = 6.75 packs

Since <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs</fact4>, he needs to round up to the next whole number:

7 packs

By buying 7 packs, Mr. Jackson will have:

7 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8 glue sticks per pack</fact1> = 56 glue sticks

This ensures that every student gets 2 glue sticks, with 2 extra glue sticks left over.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The answer is {7}.</div></div>

How many boys are in the third class?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of students in the school
2. Calculate the number of girls in the first two classes
3. Calculate the total number of girls in the school
4. Subtract the girls in the first two classes from the total girls to find girls in the third class
5. Subtract girls in the third class from the total students in a class

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">There are 3 classes</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each class has 20 students</fact2>, so the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60 students.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The first class has 15 girls</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the second class has 12 girls</fact4>, so there are 15 + 12 = 27 girls in the first two classes.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The school is 50% girls</fact5>, so there are 60 * 0.5 = 30 girls in total.

Girls in the third class = Total girls - Girls in first two classes
                         = 30 - 27 = 3 girls

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each class has 20 students</fact2>, so the number of boys in the third class is:
Boys in third class = 20 - 3 = 17 boys

How many slices of pizza were left?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">There were 5 pizzas in total</fact1> (Bryce and four friends).

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Three people (Bryce and two friends) ate 2/3 of their pizzas</fact2>. This means they each left 1/3 of their pizza.
   For these three pizzas: 1/3 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">12 slices</fact4> = 4 slices left per pizza
   Total slices left from these three pizzas: 3 * 4 = 12 slices

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas</fact3>. This means they each left 1/4 of their pizza.
   For these two pizzas: 1/4 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">12 slices</fact4> = 3 slices left per pizza
   Total slices left from these two pizzas: 2 * 3 = 6 slices

4. Total slices left: 12 + 6 = 18 slices

Therefore, 18 slices of pizza were left.

How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total cost for the first year, we need to consider the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for a year.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The initial cost of the plane is $150,000</fact3>.

Monthly expenses:
1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Hangar rental: $5,000 per month</fact1>
2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Fuel costs: Twice the hangar rental, so $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 per month</fact2>

Total monthly expenses: $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000 per month

For a year, the maintenance costs would be: $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000

Total cost for the first year:
Initial cost + Maintenance costs for a year
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$150,000</fact3> + $180,000 = $330,000

Therefore, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.</div></div>

How many toys in total does James need?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">James has 4 toys for 4 dogs</fact1>.

2. Then, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8 more dogs arrive</fact2>, so now there are 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The number of dogs doubles</fact3>, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.

4. Finally, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 dogs leave</fact4>, leaving 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

5. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Each dog needs one toy</fact5>, so James needs 21 toys in total.

How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to add up the purchases from each group of customers:

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each</fact2>, so that's 3 DVDs.
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each</fact4>, so that's 4 DVDs.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs</fact3>, so they contribute 0 DVDs.

Adding these up: 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 DVDs

How many trees does he have left?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of trees: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">50 trees</fact2>

2. Trees planted over 10 years: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 trees per year</fact1> × 10 years = 100 trees

3. Trees chopped down over 10 years: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 trees per year</fact4> × 10 years = 20 trees

4. Total trees before die-off: 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees

5. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">30% of trees die after 10 years</fact3>:
   30% of 130 = 39 trees die

How many goats are left in the two farms altogether?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many goats are left in the two farms, we need to:
1. Calculate how many goats were sold from Farm Y
2. Subtract the sold goats from the current number of goats in each farm

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Twice as many goats were sold from Farm Y</fact2> compared to Farm X. Since <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 goats were sold from Farm X</fact1>, 20 goats were sold from Farm Y.

For Farm X:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Current number of goats: 55</fact3>
Number of goats sold: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1>
Goats left in Farm X: 55 - 10 = 45

For Farm Y:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Current number of goats: 45</fact4>
Number of goats sold: 20
Goats left in Farm Y: 45 - 20 = 25

Total goats left in both farms: 45 + 25 = 70

How much does he make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much John makes, we need to determine the number of planks he can produce and multiply that by the selling price.

First, let's calculate how many logs John can make:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The tree is 80 feet long</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each log is 4 feet</fact2>. So, the total number of logs is 80 / 4 = 20 logs.

However, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he can only use 80% of the tree</fact4>, so the actual number of usable logs is:
20 * 0.80 = 16 logs

Now, <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">from each log, he can cut 5 planks</fact5>. So the total number of planks is:
16 logs * 5 planks per log = 80 planks

Finally, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">he sells each plank for $1.2</fact3>. So his total earnings are:
80 planks * $1.2 per plank = $96

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>128/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">would serve 4 people</fact2>. Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The meat cost $7.00 per pound</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the cheese cost $3.00 per pound</fact4>. There would be <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20 people in total watching the game</fact5>. How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how much money Tyson would spend, we need to calculate:
1. How many sandwiches are needed
2. How much meat and cheese is required
3. The total cost of the meat and cheese

First, to serve <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20 people</fact5>, and knowing that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each sandwich serves 4 people</fact2>, we need 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each sandwich requires 1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1>, so for 5 sandwiches, we need:
- 5 pounds of meat
- 5 pounds of cheese

Now, let's calculate the cost:
- Meat: 5 pounds * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$7.00 per pound</fact3> = $35.00
- Cheese: 5 pounds * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$3.00 per pound</fact4> = $15.00

Total cost: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

Therefore, Tyson would spend $50.00 on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

The answer is {50}.</div></div>

And <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Mei finds half as many as Charlie</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy</fact5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Cole hid 3 dozen eggs</fact1>. That's 3 * 12 = 36 eggs total.

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Lamar found 5 eggs</fact2>.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Stacy found twice as many as Lamar</fact4>, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.

4. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Charlie found 2 less than Stacy</fact5>, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Mei found half as many as Charlie</fact3>, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

6. Total eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

7. Eggs still hidden: 36 (total hidden) - 27 (total found) = 9 eggs.

Therefore, 9 eggs are still hidden in the yard.

The answer is {9}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>130/ Reformatted Question:</strong> <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Each crayon weighs 1 ounce</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Each pound is 16 ounces</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Nik has 200 crayons</fact3>. He wants to <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes</fact4>. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">each box weighs 8 ounces</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, let's calculate how many boxes Nik will need:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">200 crayons</fact3> ÷ <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8 crayons per box</fact4> = 25 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the crayons:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">200 crayons</fact3> × <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 ounce per crayon</fact1> = 200 ounces of crayons

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the boxes:
25 boxes × <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">8 ounces per box</fact5> = 200 ounces of boxes

Total weight in ounces:
200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Converting to pounds:
400 ounces ÷ <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">16 ounces per pound</fact2> = 25 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is 25 pounds.

The answer is {25}.</div></div>

He <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more</fact4> since his favorite brand was sold out. He also <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">decided to buy himself a donut for $2</fact5>. How much did everything cost?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the amount of coffee Roger bought and its price, then add the cost of the donut.

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Roger bought a week's worth of coffee</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">he uses 1 pound per day</fact2>. So, he bought 7 pounds of coffee.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The normal brand costs $5 per pound</fact3>, but <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more</fact4>. This means the new brand costs $5 * 1.20 = $6 per pound.

The total cost of coffee is 7 pounds * $6 per pound = $42.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">He also bought a donut for $2</fact5>.

Therefore, the total cost is $42 (for coffee) + $2 (for the donut) = $44.

The answer is {44}.</div></div>

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">11 students need size extra-small</fact2>.

2. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Twice as many students need size small as extra small</fact5>, so:
   Size small = 11 * 2 = 22 students

3. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Four less than the number of size small students need size medium</fact1>, so:
   Size medium = 22 - 4 = 18 students

4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Half as many students need size large as size medium</fact3>, so:
   Size large = 18 / 2 = 9 students

5. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Six more students need size extra-large than large</fact4>, so:
   Size extra-large = 9 + 6 = 15 students

6. Now, we can add up all the sizes:
   Extra-small: 11
   Small: 22
   Medium: 18
   Large: 9
   Extra-large: 15

   Total: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts

Therefore, Krissa ordered 75 shirts in total.

How many movies can he see if <fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies</fact11>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate how much Colby has already spent this month:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 movies on Friday/Saturday</fact1> at <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$10 each</fact5> = 5 * $10 = $50
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8 movies on other days</fact2> at <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$7 each</fact6> = 8 * $7 = $56
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 tubs of popcorn</fact3> at <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">$8 each</fact7> = 2 * $8 = $16
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 boxes of candy</fact4> at <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">$2 each</fact8> = 4 * $2 = $8

Total spent so far: $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130

<fact11 style="background-color: #3378FF;">Colby's monthly budget is $150</fact11>, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend.

For <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">the last day (a Friday)</fact9>, <fact10 style="background-color: #FF335E;">he wants to get popcorn and candy</fact10>:
<fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">Popcorn costs $8</fact7>
<fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">Candy costs $2</fact8>
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Friday ticket costs $10</fact5>

Total cost for one more movie with snacks: $8 + $2 + $10 = $20

How many ounces of oil does she use?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The total volume of the scrub is 10 ounces</fact3>.

2. Let's say the amount of zest (and fragrance) is x.
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The amount of salt (and sugar) is 2x</fact5>.
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The amount of oil is 4x</fact4> (twice the amount of salt).

3. We can set up an equation:
   x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces

4. Simplifying:
   10x = 10 ounces

5. Solving for x:
   x = 1 ounce

6. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The amount of oil is 4x</fact4>, so:
   Oil = 4 * 1 = 4 ounces

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil in her salt scrub.

How many total points did Sasha score during both games?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, we need to calculate her scores for each game and then add them together.

For the first game:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Sasha scored 14 points</fact1>

For the second game:
We need to find Julie's score in the first game to calculate Sasha's score in the second game.
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game</fact4>, so Julie's score was 14 - 4 = 10 points.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game</fact3>, so Sasha's score in the second game was 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Total points Sasha scored:

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the profit step by step:

1. Original cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 boards * $10 each = $100</fact2>

2. Original cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 boards * $16 each = $80</fact3>

3. Total original cost:
   $100 + $80 = $180

4. New selling price after <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">50% increase</fact1>:
   2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 * 1.5 = $15 each
   4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 * 1.5 = $24 each

5. Total selling price:
   (10 * $15) + (5 * $24) = $150 + $120 = $270

6. Profit:
   Selling price - Original cost = $270 - $180 = $90

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90 if she sells all the leftover lumber.

How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we need to consider the different water requirements for her plants:

1. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 plants need half a cup of water each</fact4>:
   4 * 0.5 = 2 cups

2. The remaining plants need a quarter cup each:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20 total plants</fact3> - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 plants</fact4> = 16 plants

And <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fact4>. How tall is the fourth child, in inches?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the height of the fourth child, we need to work through the heights of all children:

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The first child is 6 feet tall</fact2>. We need to convert this to inches: 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.

2. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The second child is two inches taller than the first child</fact1>. So the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact3>. So the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

On Friday, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the mechanic repairs 12 car tires</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">doesn't repair any truck tires</fact2>. For each <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60</fact3> and for each <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40</fact4>. On Thursday, <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires</fact5>. How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the revenue for each day:

Friday's revenue:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 car tires</fact1> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$40 per car tire</fact4> = $480

Thursday's revenue:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">6 truck tires</fact5> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$60 per truck tire</fact3> = $360
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4 car tires</fact5> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$40 per car tire</fact4> = $160
Total for Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

Thursday had the higher revenue at $520, while Friday's revenue was $480.

The difference in revenue is $520 - $480 = $40.

The answer is {40}.</div></div>

In one month, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes</fact1> among the types listed. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Half of them were Trekking bikes</fact2>, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15% were BMX bikes</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The price of one MTB is $500</fact5>, <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">BMX is half the price of an MTB</fact6>, and <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">a Trekking bike is $450</fact7>. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Marcel's earnings, we need to determine the number of each type of bike sold and their respective prices:

1. Number of bikes sold:
   - Trekking bikes: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Half of 300</fact2> = 150 bikes
   - BMX bikes: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15% of 300</fact3> = 45 bikes
   - MTB bikes: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The rest</fact4> = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">300</fact1> - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

2. Prices of bikes:
   - MTB: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$500</fact5>
   - BMX: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Half of $500</fact6> = $250
   - Trekking: <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">$450</fact7>

3. Earnings calculation:
   - MTB: 105 * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$500</fact5> = $52,500
   - BMX: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Trekking: 150 * <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">$450</fact7> = $67,500

Total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250

Therefore, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.</div></div>

How much money does Dean have left?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Dean started with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$28</fact1>.

2. He spent on toy cars: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$2</fact2> × <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6</fact4> = $12

3. He spent on teddy bears: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1</fact3> × <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5</fact4> = $5

4. Total spent: $12 + $5 = $17

5. Money left after shopping: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$28</fact1> - $17 = $11

How many medals have been given out for counting?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this question, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many medals Izzy has:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Ali has 22 medals</fact3>
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali</fact2>
   So, Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals

2. Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:
   Ali's medals + Izzy's medals = 22 + 17 = 39 medals

3. Use the information about the total medals given out:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting</fact4>
   This means the total medals given out is 10 times more than 39

4. Calculate the total medals given out:
   39 * 10 = 390 medals

Therefore, 390 medals have been given out for counting.

The answer is {390}.</div></div>

What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the price of each fruit:
- <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">One apple costs $0.5</fact3>
- <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">One banana costs twice as much as an apple</fact4>, so one banana costs $1
- <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Oranges cost three times as much as a banana</fact2>, so one orange costs $3

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 bananas</fact1> at $1 each: 5 × $1 = $5
- <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 apples</fact1> at <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$0.5</fact3> each: 12 × $0.5 = $6
- <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 oranges</fact1> at $3 each: 7 × $3 = $21

The total price for the crate is the sum of these amounts:
$5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit would be $32.

The shockingly loud sound startled Sally, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons</fact4>. What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of balloons Sally carried into the school:

1. Blue balloons: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">75% of 8 blue balloons</fact1> = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons

2. Red balloons: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Started with 25 red balloons</fact2>
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">40% burst</fact3>, so 60% remained = 0.60 * 25 = 15 red balloons

3. Green balloons: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">7 green balloons</fact2> (unchanged)

4. Yellow balloons: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Started with 12 yellow balloons</fact2>

How many hours a week does he spend learning, if <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">John has to take 2 extra classes a day</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Regular school week:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 periods</fact1> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 extra classes</fact5> = 8 classes per day
   8 classes * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40 minutes</fact2> = 320 minutes per day
   320 minutes * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 days</fact3> = 1600 minutes per week

2. Extra learning time on weekends:
   1600 minutes * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1/16</fact4> = 100 minutes on Saturday
   1600 minutes * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1/16</fact4> = 100 minutes on Sunday

3. Total learning time per week:
   1600 minutes (weekdays) + 100 minutes (Saturday) + 100 minutes (Sunday) = 1800 minutes

4. Convert minutes to hours:
   1800 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 30 hours

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

The answer is {30}.</div></div>

He bought <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps</fact2>. Max bought <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">16 snowflake stamps</fact3>. How many stamps did Max buy in all?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to calculate the number of each type of stamp and then add them together.

We know that Max bought <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">16 snowflake stamps</fact3>.

For truck stamps, he bought <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 more than snowflake stamps</fact1>. So, the number of truck stamps is:
16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps

For rose stamps, he bought <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">9 fewer than truck stamps</fact2>. So, the number of rose stamps is:
19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps

Now, we can add all the stamps together:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">16 snowflake stamps</fact3> + 19 truck stamps + 10 rose stamps = 45 stamps in total

Therefore, Max bought 45 stamps in all.

The answer is {45}.</div></div>

Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester</fact2>. If Brinley has scores of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests</fact3>, what score does she need on the sixth test to get <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">an average of 93</fact4>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to consider that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the lowest score will be removed</fact2>. From <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the given scores (89, 71, 92, 100, 86)</fact3>, the lowest score is 71. 

We'll remove 71 and calculate the sum of the remaining four scores:
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367

Now, we need to find what score (let's call it x) Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">an average of 93</fact4> for five tests. We can set up an equation:

(367 + x) / 5 = 93

Solving for x:
367 + x = 93 * 5
367 + x = 465
x = 465 - 367
x = 98

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 after removing her lowest score.

The answer is {98}.</div></div>

They had <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">78 bandages left at the end of the third day</fact5>. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's work backwards to determine how many bandages they started with on the first day:

1. On the third day, they <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">ordered two bulk packs (100 bandages) and used half a pack (25 bandages)</fact2>.
2. On the second day, they <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">used 10 fewer bandages than the first day</fact3>. Since <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">they used 38 on the first day</fact4>, they used 28 on the second day.
3. On the first day, <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack (50 bandages)</fact4>.
4. At the <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left</fact5>.

Total bandages used over three days: 38 + 28 + 25 = 91
Total bandages ordered over three days: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">50</fact4> + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">100</fact2> = 150

To have <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">78 left at the end</fact5>, they must have started with:
91 (used) + 78 (left) - 150 (ordered) = 19 bandages

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, we need to determine how far Julia rowed and how much water the boat took on during that distance.

First, let's calculate the distance Julia rowed:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">16 seconds = 20 feet</fact1>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">64 seconds</fact3> = (64/16) * 20 feet = 80 feet

Now, we know the rate at which the boat takes on water:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 liters per 10 feet</fact2>

For 80 feet, the boat will take on:
(80/10) * 2 liters = 16 liters

Therefore, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

The answer is {16}.</div></div>

1. Calculate Gordy's truck capacity using <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;"> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">:
   Gordy's truck capacity = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4,000</fact1> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">800</fact3> = 4,800 pounds

2. Sum up Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities:
   Gissela's and Gordy's combined capacity = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4,000</fact1> + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds

3. Subtract this sum from <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the total capacity of all three trucks</fact2>:
   Gary's truck capacity = <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">11,600</fact2> - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds

On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in</fact5>. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, let's first calculate the total number of holes at the end of the third day:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 holes (first day)</fact2> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">13 holes (second day)</fact3> + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8 holes (third day)</fact4> - <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 holes (filled in)</fact5> = 29 holes

Now, we know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">the number of holes at the end of the fourth day was four times the number at the end of the first day</fact1>. So:
4 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 (holes at end of first day)</fact2> = 40 holes at the end of the fourth day

To find how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the holes at the end of the third day from the total at the end of the fourth day:
40 - 29 = 11 holes

Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day</fact1>.
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The second monkey eats 4 more than the first</fact3>, so it eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.
3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">315 bananas last for a week (7 days) for all three monkeys</fact2>.
4. Total bananas eaten per day: 315 / 7 = 45 bananas.
5. The first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.
6. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The third monkey eats the rest</fact4>, which is 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

The answer is {21}.</div></div>

He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, but only a third of them are his lines</fact3>. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Sean's solo song has 54 lines</fact1>, all of which he needs to memorize.

2. For the second scene:
   - It has <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 more lines than the song</fact2>, so 54 + 6 = 60 lines total
   - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's</fact2>
   - So Sean's lines in this scene = 60 * 4/5 = 48 lines

3. For the first scene:
   - It has <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact3>, so 54 * 2 = 108 lines total
   - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Only a third of these lines are Sean's</fact3>
   - So Sean's lines in this scene = 108 * 1/3 = 36 lines

4. Total lines Sean needs to memorize:
   54 (song) + 48 (second scene) + 36 (first scene) = 138 lines

Therefore, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total.

The answer is {138}.</div></div>

There are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw</fact2>. The rats are kept in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 cages in equal groups</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">each rat is given 6 pieces of straw</fact4>. There is also <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</fact5>. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact6>, how many rats are in each cage?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. For the hamsters:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 cages</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5 pieces of straw</fact2> = 50 pieces of straw

2. For the rabbits:
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20 pieces of straw</fact5>

3. Total straw used for hamsters and rabbits:
   50 + 20 = 70 pieces of straw

4. Straw left for rats:
   <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">160 total pieces</fact6> - 70 pieces = 90 pieces of straw

5. Since <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">each rat gets 6 pieces of straw</fact4>, the total number of rats is:
   90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats

6. As the rats are in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 cages in equal groups</fact3>, the number of rats in each cage is:
   15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

The answer is {5}.</div></div>

And <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans</fact3>. How many small beans can Grandpa eat?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans</fact1>.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans</fact3>, so he can eat 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean</fact2>. Therefore, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we multiply the number of medium-sized beans by 3:

   150 * 3 = 450 small beans

Therefore, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.

The answer is {450}.</div></div>

She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The laptop Erika wants costs $600</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop</fact5>, how much money does she have in her purse?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has available and subtract it from the final cost of the laptop.

The final cost of the laptop is <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$600</fact4> minus the trade-in value of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$200</fact2>, which is $400.

Erika has the following funds available:
1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$80 from her mom</fact1>
2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$150 from her part-time job</fact3>
3. The unknown amount in her purse

We know that <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop</fact5>, which means her total available funds plus $50 should equal the final cost of the laptop ($400).

Let's call the amount in her purse 'x'.

So, we can set up the equation:
80 + 150 + x + 50 = 400

Solving for x:
280 + x = 400
x = 400 - 280
x = 120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The answer is {120}.</div></div>

What she finds out is that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car</fact3>. How fast does the faster car go?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to work step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car</fact3>
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The average car goes 120 Miles per hour</fact1>
   So, the 2nd fastest car's speed = 5 * 120 = 600 Miles per hour

2. Now, we can calculate the speed of the fastest car:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car</fact2>
   The fastest car's speed = 1.25 * 600 = 750 Miles per hour

Therefore, the fastest car goes 750 Miles per hour.

He <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">sold 10 cars</fact3> that <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">cost $25,000 each</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The company paid 30% of the price to acquire the cars</fact5>. How much did he make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much James made, we need to determine the profit per car and then his commission on that profit.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Each car was sold for $25,000</fact4>. 
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The company paid 30% of this price to acquire each car</fact5>, which is $25,000 * 30% = $7,500.
So the profit per car is $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">James sold 10 cars</fact3>, so the total profit is $17,500 * 10 = $175,000.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">James gets a 10% commission on the profits</fact2>, so his earnings are:
$175,000 * 10% = $17,500

Therefore, James made $17,500 from selling these cars.

1. Total number of jello cups needed:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">30 kids</fact3> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 cups per kid</fact4> = 120 cups

2. Number of boxes needed:
   120 cups / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 cups per box</fact2> = 12 boxes

3. Total cost:

How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total yards of yarn used, we need to:
1. Calculate how much yarn Mariah's grandma used:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1/2</fact2> of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">364 yards</fact1> = 364 * 0.5 = 182 yards

2. Calculate how much yarn Mariah used:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1/4</fact3> of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">364 yards</fact1> = 364 * 0.25 = 91 yards

3. Add the two amounts together:

1. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn</fact4>.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia</fact3>, so her time was 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia</fact2>. To be conservative, we'll assume it was exactly 4 hours longer. So Dior's time was 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do the laundry.

Adding these times together:
4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 8 hours (Dior) = 18 hours total

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether was 18 hours.

The answer is {18}.</div></div>

How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

Notebooks: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5</fact1> * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$1.50</fact6> = $7.50
Pens: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2</fact2> * <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">$0.25</fact7> = $0.50
Calculator: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1</fact3> * <fact8 style="background-color: #8D33FF;">$12</fact8> = $12.00
Geometry set: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1</fact4> * <fact9 style="background-color: #33FF8D;">$10</fact9> = $10.00

Total before discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Now, we apply the <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">10% discount</fact5>:
Discount amount: 10% of $30.00 = $3.00

Final price after discount: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend $27.00 on all the items he wants to buy.

The answer is {27.00}.</div></div>

In dollars, how much money does Annabelle still need to save?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate Annabelle's total earnings and savings:

From her first job, Annabelle earns: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$10 per hour * 20 hours = $200</fact1>

From her second job, she earns: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$5 per hour * 15 hours = $75</fact4>

Her total earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275

The phone she wants costs <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$400</fact3>

To find out how much more she needs to save:
$400 - $355 = $45

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45 to buy the phone.

Monday:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Lucy made $56 from selling apples on Monday</fact5>. Since <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">each apple costs $4</fact1>, we can calculate how many apples she sold:
$56 / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$4 per apple</fact1> = 14 apples
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">She sold all the apples she picked on Monday</fact2>, so she picked 14 apples on Monday.

Tuesday:
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples</fact4>.

Wednesday:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day</fact3>. The previous day was Tuesday, so:
12 apples * 2 = 24 apples picked on Wednesday

Total apples picked over the three days:
Monday: 14 apples

2. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's</fact2>, so:
   Carl's weight = 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's</fact3>, so:
   Christian's weight = 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg

4. Finally, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight</fact1>, so:

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>175/ Reformatted Question:</strong> There are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden</fact1>. Among those that are not indoor plants, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">two-thirds of them are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants</fact3>. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">one-fourth of the plants are indoor plants</fact3>. This means:
   Indoor plants = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1> * 1/4 = 25 plants

2. The remaining plants are not indoor:
   Non-indoor plants = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1> - 25 = 75 plants

3. Of these non-indoor plants, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">two-thirds are outdoor plants</fact2>:
   Outdoor plants = 75 * 2/3 = 50 plants

4. The rest of the non-indoor plants are flowering plants:
   Flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25 plants

5. To calculate the percentage of flowering plants:
   Percentage = (Number of flowering plants / Total number of plants) * 100
               = (25 / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">100</fact1>) * 100 = 25%

Therefore, 25% of the plants in Mrs. Smith's garden are flowering plants.

The answer is {25}.</div></div>

How much will this cost her?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. The base package costs <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$129.00</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">includes 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures</fact3>.

2. Angela needs <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures</fact1> installed.

3. Additional items needed:
   - Mirrors: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6</fact1> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4</fact3> = 2 extra mirrors
   - Chandeliers: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2</fact1> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1</fact3> = 1 extra chandelier
   - Pictures: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">10</fact3> = 10 extra pictures

4. Total extra items: 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items

5. Cost for extra items: 13 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$15.00</fact4> = $195.00

6. Total cost: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$129.00</fact2> (base package) + $195.00 (extra items) = $324.00

Therefore, the total cost for Angela will be $324.00.

What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total area of the house, we need to sum up the areas of all parts:

1. Bedrooms: 
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Each bedroom is 20 x 12 feet</fact4> = 240 square feet
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">There are 4 bedrooms</fact1>, so total bedroom area is 4 x 240 = 960 square feet

2. Living room:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom</fact2>
   One bedroom is 240 square feet, so the living room is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet

3. Rest of the house:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The rest of the house is 1000 square feet</fact3>

Total area = Bedrooms + Living room + Rest of the house
           = 960 + 1200 + 1000
           = 3160 square feet

The answer is {3160}.</div></div>

He gets <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">a 20% discount on them</fact3>. He also buys <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">a finale firework that costs $150</fact4>. How much did he spend in total?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate step by step:

1. The cost of the first package is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$400</fact1>.
2. The cost of the second package is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">twice that much</fact2>, so it's $400 * 2 = $800.
3. The total cost of both packages before discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.
4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The discount is 20%</fact3>, which is 0.2 * $1200 = $240.
5. After applying the discount, the cost of the packages is $1200 - $240 = $960.
6. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The finale firework costs $150</fact4>.
7. The total spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

What is the combined capacity of both schools?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school and add it to Ali's school capacity.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students</fact5>. 
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class</fact3>, so each of John's classes can hold 120 / 8 = 15 students.
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">John has two classes</fact2>, so the total capacity of John's school is 15 * 2 = 30 students.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Ali has one class</fact4> with <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">a capacity of 120 students</fact5>.

The combined capacity of both schools is therefore 30 (John's school) + 120 (Ali's school) = 150 students.

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The total cost of all gum packs was $7</fact3>.
2. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The grape gum pack cost $2</fact5>.
3. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">The green apple gum pack cost half of the grape gum</fact6>, which is $2 ÷ 2 = $1.

How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards</fact1>.

2. In the first month, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">she collected three times her initial number</fact2>. This means she collected 3 * 20 = 60 cards.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month</fact4>. So, she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards in the second month.

4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months</fact3>. The combined number from the first two months is 60 + 40 = 100. So in the third month, she collected 2 * 100 = 200 cards.

5. To get the total number of cards Elaine has now, we add up all the cards:
   Initial cards: 20
   First month: 60
   Second month: 40
   Third month: 200

   Total: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokemon cards in total.

If the rink has <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">75 cars in total</fact4> how many yellow cars do they have?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 red cars</fact1>.

2. The number of green cars is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 fewer than red cars</fact2>, so:
   Green cars = 12 - 2 = 10

3. The number of blue cars is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 times the number of green cars</fact3>:
   Blue cars = 3 * 10 = 30

4. Now we can calculate the number of yellow cars:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Total cars = 75</fact4>
   Yellow cars = Total cars - (Red + Green + Blue)
   Yellow cars = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 23

What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the 5 days
2. Divide that total by 5 (the number of days)

Let's start with calculating the total:
- Monday: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">39 Junebugs</fact2>
- Tuesday: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Twice as many as Monday</fact1>, so 2 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">39</fact2> = 78 Junebugs
- Wednesday: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Also twice as many as Monday</fact1>, so 78 Junebugs
- Thursday: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">48 Junebugs</fact3>
- Friday: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">57 Junebugs</fact4>

Total Junebugs removed: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Now, we divide the total by the number of days:

How many pets does Larry have?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's break this down step by step:

1. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Larry has 3 cats</fact2>.

2. Dogs: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">He has 3 times as many dogs as cats</fact3>. 
   So, he has 3 × 3 = 9 dogs.

3. Rabbits: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs</fact4>.
   So, he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.

4. Fish: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits</fact6>.
   So, he has 3 × 7 = 21 fish.

5. Gerbils: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has</fact5>.
   So, he has 21 ÷ 3 = 7 gerbils.

Melanie found a blueprint online for a toothpick sculpture she wanted to make. It <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">requires 200 toothpicks</fact3>. If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this, let's first calculate how many toothpicks Melanie has already collected:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 toothpicks per week</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 weeks</fact2> = 120 toothpicks

Now, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">200 toothpicks needed</fact3> - 120 toothpicks collected = 80 toothpicks still needed

To determine how many more weeks it will take, we divide the remaining toothpicks by the number she collects each week:
80 toothpicks needed / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 toothpicks per week</fact1> = 8 weeks

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect enough toothpicks for her sculpture if she continues saving at the same rate.

What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total amount Jake spends, we need to add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

For the T-shirts:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jake buys 2 T-shirts</fact1>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The original price of each T-shirt is $8</fact4>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal</fact2>
So, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt ($8) and half price for the second T-shirt ($4)
Total for T-shirts: $8 + $4 = $12

For the shoes:
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The original price of the shoes is $40</fact5>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The shoes are 40% off the original price</fact3>
40% of $40 is $16, so the discount is $16
Price of shoes after discount: $40 - $16 = $24

Total amount Jake spends:

2. He <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">eats 2 on the way to school</fact2>, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.
3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">At school, he gives away 14 lollipops</fact4>, so he now has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.
4. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">On the way home, he buys twice as many as he gave away</fact3>. He gave away 14, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 new lollipops.
5. Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.
6. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning</fact5>, which is a total of 5 lollipops.
7. Finally, he's left with 36 - 5 = 31 lollipops.

Therefore, Oscar has 31 lollipops.

The answer is {31}.</div></div>

The watch was <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">originally $2000</fact2>, but was put on sale so that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price</fact3>. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend, we need to:
1. Calculate how much Mr. Rogers paid for the watch
2. Calculate how much Mr. Rogers sold the watch for
3. Compare the selling price to the original price

Step 1: Mr. Rogers bought the watch at <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">75% of its original price</fact3>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Original price = $2000</fact2>
Purchase price = 75% of $2000 = 0.75 * $2000 = $1500

Step 2: Mr. Rogers sold the watch at <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">120% of the price that he bought it</fact1>
Selling price = 120% of $1500 = 1.2 * $1500 = $1800

Step 3: Compare the selling price to the original price
Discount = Original price - Selling price
Discount = <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$2000</fact2> - $1800 = $200

Percentage discount = (Discount / Original price) * 100
Percentage discount = ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%

Therefore, Mr. Roger's friend obtained a 10% discount from the original price.

The answer is {10}.</div></div>

After that, he <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time</fact4>. He then <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed</fact5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total time, let's break it down into parts:

1. First swim:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">60% of 20 miles</fact2> = 12 miles
   Time taken = 12 miles / <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 miles per hour</fact3> = 6 hours

2. Rest time:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Half of the swimming time</fact4> = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

3. Second swim:
   Remaining distance = <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 miles</fact1> - 12 miles = 8 miles
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Speed is half of the original</fact5> = <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2 miles per hour</fact3> / 2 = 1 mile per hour
   Time taken = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Total time = 6 hours (first swim) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (second swim) = 17 hours

The answer is {17}.</div></div>

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">For the taffy, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound costs $1.50 (half off)</fact1>. So <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">for 2 pounds</fact2>, she spent $3 + $1.50 = $4.50 on taffy.
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The mixed bag of seashells cost $1.50</fact3>.
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The 4 magnets cost $0.25 each, so 4 * $0.25 = $1.00</fact4> total for magnets.

Total spent: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">She started with $10</fact5>, so she has $10 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

The second venue charges $25 per person who attends</fact2>. However, <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends</fact3>. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the cost for each venue based on the number of guests (x):

First venue: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$200 flat fee</fact1> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$5 per person for food</fact3>
Total cost for first venue = 200 + 5x

Second venue: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$25 per person, including food</fact2>
Total cost for second venue = 25x

For the venues to be equal in cost, we set the equations equal to each other:
200 + 5x = 25x

Solving for x:
200 = 20x
x = 10

Therefore, when there are 10 guests, the cost for both venues will be equal:
First venue: 200 + (5 * 10) = $250
Second venue: 25 * 10 = $250

The answer is {10}.</div></div>

If <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day</fact3>, how many bales of hay are left in the field?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bales made and the total number of bales picked up.

<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The farmer makes 5 bales per hour</fact2>, so in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 hours</fact3>, they make:
5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The truck picks up 3 bales per hour</fact1>, so in <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">6 hours</fact3>, they pick up:
3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

The number of bales left in the field is the difference between the bales made and the bales picked up:

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Let's say x is the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
2. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</fact1>, so that would be x/2.
3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set</fact3>, so that would be x + 4.
4. We know that <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the total number of balls retrieved is 19</fact2>.

So we can set up the equation:
(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Solving this equation:
2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls.

<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">In the first set, he retrieved 4 more than in the second set</fact3>, so:
6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match.

How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had and then subtract the ones that were eaten:

1. Brownies Greta had:
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1 dozen (made by herself)</fact2> = 12 brownies
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 dozen (from surprise party)</fact3> = 48 brownies
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1/2 dozen (from office party)</fact5> = 6 brownies
   Total: 12 + 48 + 6 = 66 brownies

2. Brownies eaten:

How much did Jean pay?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Cost per day: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$250 per hour</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 hours</fact2> = $1,500 per day

2. Cost per week: $1,500 per day * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 times a week</fact3> = $6,000 per week

3. Total cost for the movie: $6,000 per week * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">5 weeks</fact5> = $30,000

4. Discount: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10% of $30,000</fact4> = $3,000

If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many groups of students will attempt the escape room and multiply that by the time each group takes.

First, let's calculate the total number of students who will try the escape room:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">There are 4 grades (4-7)</fact1>
<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">10 students from each grade get to try the escape room</fact4>
Total students = 4 * 10 = 40 students

Now, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students this makes:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">8 students can try the escape room at a time</fact2>
Number of groups = 40 / 8 = 5 groups

Finally, we calculate the total time:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each group has 45 minutes</fact3>
Total time = 5 groups * 45 minutes = 225 minutes

To convert this to hours and minutes:
225 minutes = 3 hours and 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take 3 hours and 45 minutes for everyone to try the escape room.

The answer is {225}.</div></div>

If <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">both Billy and Sally work 20 hours</fact5>, how much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to compare their current hourly rates and multiply by the hours worked.

Billy's current hourly rate:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$10</fact1> (starting salary) + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$0.50</fact3> (raise after 2 months) + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$1.00</fact4> (raise after 1 year) = $11.50 per hour

Sally's hourly rate:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$10</fact1> (Billy's starting salary) + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$0.50</fact2> (difference in starting salaries) = $10.50 per hour

For <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">20 hours of work</fact5>:
Billy: $11.50 * 20 = $230
Sally: $10.50 * 20 = $210

Difference: $230 - $210 = $20

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.

How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the yearly income and expenses:

Yearly income: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 lemons</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$1.5 per lemon</fact2> = $10.5
Yearly expenses: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$3 for water and feed</fact3>

Now, we need to determine how many years it will take to recover the <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">initial cost of $90</fact4>:

$90 / $7.5 per year = 12 years

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>207/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Julia and Nadine decided to combine their allowance to surprise their father on his birthday. They bought <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">a cake which costs $11</fact1>. They also bought <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1 dozen balloons which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each</fact3>. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The two girls were given the same amount of allowance by their mother</fact4>. How much did Julia and Nadine's mother give each one of them?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total amount spent:
<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Cake: $11</fact1>
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Balloons: 1 dozen = 6 pairs, 6 * $0.5 = $3</fact2>
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Ice cream: 2 tubs * $7 = $14</fact3>

Total spent: $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Since the two girls were given the same amount of allowance</fact4>, and they combined their allowance to buy these items, each girl must have contributed half of the total amount spent.

Half of $28 is $28 / 2 = $14

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14 as allowance.

The answer is {14}.</div></div>

Sara <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time she babysits them</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">If Sara already had $10 saved before she started babysitting</fact5>, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate how many times Sara must mow the lawn, we need to:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items:
   <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Jacket: $30</fact1>
   <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Shoes: $20 x 2 = $40</fact2>
   Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. Calculate Sara's current savings:
   <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Initial savings: $10</fact5>
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Babysitting earnings: 4 x $5 = $20</fact4>
   Total savings: $10 + $20 = $30

3. Calculate the remaining amount needed:
   $70 (total cost) - $30 (current savings) = $40

4. Calculate how many lawn mowings are needed:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each lawn mowing earns $4</fact3>
   Number of mowings needed: $40 / $4 = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total number of homes built over three years:

1. First year: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 homes</fact1>

2. Second year: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Three times the first year</fact3>
   3 × <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12</fact1> = 36 homes

3. After two years: 12 + 36 = 48 homes

4. Third year: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Double the total built so far</fact2>
   2 × 48 = 96 homes

Total homes built over three years:

She ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The cake is only half of the price of the bagel</fact1>. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The bagel cost $4</fact2>, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">the soup 25% more</fact3>. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to determine the price of each item:

1. Bagel: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The bagel costs $4</fact2>

2. Cake: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">The cake is half the price of the bagel</fact1>
   So, the cake costs $4 / 2 = $2

3. Soup: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">The soup costs 25% more than the bagel</fact3>
   25% of $4 is $1
   So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5

Now, we can add up the costs:
Bagel: $4
Cake: $2
Soup: $5

Total cost: $4 + $2 + $5 = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.

The answer is {11}.</div></div>

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">11 small shirts</fact4> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 square feet</fact2> = 33 square feet
<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">8 medium shirts</fact5> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 square feet</fact3> = 32 square feet
<fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">6 large shirts</fact6> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 square feet</fact1> = 36 square feet

Total square feet of the quilt = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet

How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's work through this step-by-step:

1. We know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour</fact1>.

2. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany</fact4>, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

3. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey</fact3>, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

4. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn</fact2>, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

5. Now we can compare Bethany and Quinn:
   Bethany: 10 laps
   Quinn: 5 laps

Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To determine the cheapest lumber, we need to compare the cost per stick:

For 2 x 4: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$4</fact1> / <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">200 sticks</fact3> = $0.02 per stick
For 2 x 8: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$6</fact2> / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400 sticks</fact4> = $0.015 per stick

The 2 x 8 is cheaper per stick, so Frederick should buy these.

With <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$24</fact5>, Frederick can buy:
$24 / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$6 per 2 x 8</fact2> = 4 pieces of 2 x 8

Each 2 x 8 yields <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400 sticks</fact4>, so:
4 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400</fact4> = 1,600 sticks

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with $24 by buying the cheapest lumber is 1,600 sticks.

By this point, <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Ellen had taken 1 unshaken soda for herself and left</fact5>. What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the likelihood, we need to determine how many sodas are left and how many of those are shaken.

Initially, there were <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">12 sodas</fact2>, of which <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">3 were shaken</fact3>.

<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Ellen's brother took 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas</fact4>, leaving 9 sodas, of which 2 are shaken.

<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Ellen took 1 unshaken soda</fact5>, leaving 8 sodas, of which 2 are still shaken.

So, when Ellen's friend arrives, there are 8 sodas left, and 2 of them are shaken.

The likelihood of Ellen's friend getting a shaken soda is 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25

To express this as a percentage: 0.25 * 100 = 25%

The answer is {25}.</div></div>

They each get one watermelon. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet</fact2>. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet</fact3>. What is the average total distance spat?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate the average total distance spat, we need to find the total distance for each contestant and then take the average.

For Zoey:
<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40 seeds * 10 feet</fact2> = 400 feet total

For Sydney:
<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">35 seeds * 12 feet</fact3> = 420 feet total

Total distance for both: 400 + 420 = 820 feet

Average total distance: 820 feet / 2 contestants = 410 feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat in the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">watermelon seed spitting contest</fact1> is 410 feet.

The answer is {410}.</div></div>

At least how many degrees is the second bottle?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. We know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">one mug is 33 degrees</fact1>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">the other mug's temperature is unknown</fact2>. Let's call the unknown temperature x degrees.

2. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug</fact3> into his water bottle.

3. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it</fact4>.

4. We can set up an equation based on the weighted average of the temperatures:
   (4 * 33 + 1 * x) / (4 + 1) ≥ 40

5. Solving this equation:
   (132 + x) / 5 ≥ 40
   132 + x ≥ 200
   x ≥ 68

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for the mixture to be drinkable for Donny.

1. Starting value: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$9000</fact1>

2. After the first year:
   <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">30% depreciation</fact3>
   Remaining value: $9000 * (1 - 0.30) = $6300

3. After the second year:
   <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">30% depreciation</fact4>
   Remaining value: $6300 * (1 - 0.30) = $4410

4. After the third year:

She <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.</fact3> How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To calculate Kim's sleep time, we need to consider her usual sleep schedule and the interruptions:

1. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.</fact3>, which is 8 hours or 480 minutes.

2. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">She was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am</fact1>, which is 23 minutes of interrupted sleep.

3. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual</fact2>, so her actual wake-up time was 5:55 a.m.

So, we need to subtract the sleepwalking time and the early wake-up time from her usual sleep duration:

480 minutes - 23 minutes (sleepwalking) - 5 minutes (early wake-up) = 452 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.
