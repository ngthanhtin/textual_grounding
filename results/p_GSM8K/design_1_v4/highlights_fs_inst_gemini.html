His parents get him a console along with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 games</fact1> for his birthday.  For the <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">third year</fact2> he buys <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 games a month</fact3> as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games for Christmas every year</fact4>.  He saves up enough money to buy <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1 game per month for a year</fact5>, and then the second year he starts buying <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 games a month</fact6>.  <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">How many games does Steve have after 3 years</fact7>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to break down the calculation of Steve's video game collection after 3 years:

* **Year 1:**
   - Starts with: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 games</fact1>
   - Buys throughout the year: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">1 game/month</fact5> * 12 months = 12 games
   - Gets for Christmas: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games</fact4>
   - Total after Year 1: 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games

* **Year 2:**
    - Starts Year 2 with: 22 games 
    - Buys throughout the year: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">2 games/month</fact6> * 12 months = 24 games
    - Gets for Christmas: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games</fact4>
    - Total after Year 2: 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games

* **Year 3:**
    - Starts Year 3 with: 51 games
    - Buys throughout the year: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 games/month</fact3> * 12 months = 48 games
    - Gets for Christmas: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">5 games</fact4>
    - Total after Year 3: 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games

**Therefore, Steve has 104 games after 3 years.**</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>2/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60 potatoes</fact1> to get through. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact2>, but <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">only about 5 seconds to cut it up</fact3>. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one</fact4>. <Question>How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?</Question><br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, figure out the total time Billy spends peeling by multiplying the time per potato by the number of potatoes: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">90 seconds per potato</fact2> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60 potatoes</fact1> = 5400 seconds
Then calculate the total time spent cutting: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 seconds per potato</fact3> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">60 potatoes</fact1> = 300 seconds
Now add the peeling and cutting time to find the total time: 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds
Finally, convert the total time from seconds to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes
The answer is {95}.</div></div>

He decides he doesn't like <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5</fact2> of them and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">sells them for 40</fact3>.  <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Each CD cost $15</fact4>.  <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">He gets them for 40% off</fact5>.  How much money was he out?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>If each CD cost <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$15</fact4>, and he got <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">40% off</fact5>, he paid 60/100 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">15</fact4> = $9 per CD
So he spent <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1> * 9 = $90 on CDs in total
He sold <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5</fact2> for <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$40</fact3>, and so he lost 90 - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">40</fact3> = $50

Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">three inches tall</fact2>. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic</fact3>. If he has <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">two bags of glass chips</fact4>, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

* **Calculate total chips:** Milo has <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips</fact4>.
* **Chips per inch of height:** Since <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 chips make a square inch</fact3>, and he wants it <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 inches tall</fact2>, he uses 12 chips/square inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length. 
* **Calculate the length:** Milo can make his mosaic 144 total chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

The answer is {4}.</div></div>

By the end of the day, they <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents</fact1> and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 of each of the fruity scents</fact2> available. They already have <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 vanilla scents</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8 fruity scents</fact4> available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The company sold a total of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 vanilla scents</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 vanilla scents available</fact3> = 20 vanilla scents.
They also sold <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 fruit scents</fact2> * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">8 fruit scents available</fact4> = 16 fruit scents.
Therefore, they sold 20 - 16 = 4 more vanilla scents than fruit scents.

If it doesn't get fixed, <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car</fact1>. Ron will also have to buy <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25</fact2> to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance</fact3> if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The asphalt costs 3*<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$25</fact2>=$75
So, fixing the pothole himself will cost Ron $75+<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$120</fact3> = $195
That means he saves <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$450</fact1>-$195 = $255 by fixing the pothole.
The answer is {255}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>9/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet</fact1>.  <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet</fact2>, and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$34 per square foot to install the new carpet</fact3>.  <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot</fact4>, plus <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$2 per square foot for padding underneath</fact5>.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First find the total area of the room by multiplying the length and width: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">18 feet</fact1> * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">12 feet</fact1> = 216 square feet
Then multiply that area by the cost to remove the old carpet to find the total removal cost: 216 square feet * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$4 per square foot</fact2> = $864
Then multiply the area by the cost to install the new carpet to find the total installation cost: 216 square feet * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$34 per square foot</fact3> = $7344
Then add the cost of the carpet per square foot and the padding to find the total material cost per square foot: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$12 per square foot</fact4> + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$2 per square foot</fact5> = $14 per square foot
Then multiply the total material cost per square foot by the area of the room to find the total cost of materials: $14 per square foot * 216 square feet = $3024
Then add the cost of removing the old carpet, installing the new carpet, and the materials to find the total cost of replacing the carpet: $864 + $7344 + $3024 = $11232
So the answer is {11232}</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>10/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Joanne gathers <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact4>. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">She doesn't take any from the average trees</fact5>. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples</fact6>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Joanne picked <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">half</fact2> of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 apples</fact1> from the shortest trees, a total of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30</fact1>/2 = 15 apples.
Her sister picked <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">twice</fact3> the amount Joanne did from the tallest trees, or 2 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30 apples</fact1> = 60 apples.
From the shortest trees, Joanne's sister picked 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
Together, the sisters picked <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">30</fact1> + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 apples from the short and tall trees.
Since they picked <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">500 apples</fact6> in total, and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Joanne's sister didn't pick any from the average trees</fact5>, this means that Joanne picked <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">500</fact6> - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.
The answer is {350}.</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>11/ Reformatted Question:</strong> Pat has a flower bed that is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">111 feet long</fact1>.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">17 flowers</fact2>.  <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide</fact3> so she needs to leave <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1.5 feet between every plant</fact4>.  <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store</fact5>,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, convert the width of the plants from inches to feet: <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12 inches</fact3> / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot.
Then add the space between plants to find the total width of each plant and its spacing: 1 foot + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1.5 feet</fact4> = 2.5 feet. 
Now, divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each plant needs to find how many plants can fit: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">111 feet</fact1> / 2.5 feet/plant = 44.4 plants. 
Since Pat can't plant 0.4 of a plant, round down to 44 plants.
Then, subtract the number of plants Pat already has from the number she needs to find how many more she has to buy: 44 plants - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">17 plants</fact2> = 27 plants.
Now multiply that number by the cost per plant to find out how much money she'll need to spend: 27 plants * <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$6/plant</fact5> = $162
The answer is {162}.</div></div>

He spends <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6 hours boating</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">half that time swimming</fact3>.  He also watched <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 different shows</fact4> which were <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2 hours each</fact5>.  <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">How much time did he spend sightseeing?</fact6><br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>He spent <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">6</fact2>/<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">2</fact3>=3 hours swimming.
He spent <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3</fact4>*<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2</fact5>=6 hours watching shows.
So in total, he spent 6+3+6=15 hours on these activities. 
Let X be the total amount of time spent on vacation. 
We know that 15 hours represents 30% of the total time spent on vacation so 0.3X=15 hours. 
Thus, X=15/0.3=50 hours.
So he spent a total of 50*.4=<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 hours sightseeing</fact1>.
The answer is {20}.</div></div>

He already has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3 clients</fact1>, but is talking to another <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5 potential clients</fact2> and feels confident enough to include them in his calculations. <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each</fact3> and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">packs of cloths will cost $5 each</fact4>. He calculates that his <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">total income each week will be $92</fact5>. <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Each client's home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean</fact6>. These are his only expenses. <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses</fact7>, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>In total, Kim has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3</fact1>+<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5</fact2>=8 clients.
Each client requires 2*<fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$2</fact3> = $4 worth of bleach.
So, in total, bleach will cost $4*8 = $32
Each client also requires <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$5</fact4> worth of cloths.
That means his total expenses for cloths will be $5*8 = $40
Therefore, his total expenses are $32 + $40 = $72
His profit will be <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$92</fact5> - $72 = $20, because <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">profit is income minus expenses</fact7>.
The answer is {20}.</div></div>

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>15/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A teacher uses a <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5-inch piece of chalk</fact1> to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches</fact2>. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20% of the chalk each day</fact3>. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">45% of the chalk by the end of the day</fact4>. If the teacher goes back to using only <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20% of the chalk each day</fact3>, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Calculate remaining usable chalk:** Since the teacher used <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">45%</fact4> of the chalk, he has 100% - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">45%</fact4> = 55% of the chalk remaining.
* **Calculate the length of usable chalk remaining:**  The remaining chalk is 0.55 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 inches</fact1> = 2.75 inches long.
* **Calculate how much chalk length is used up in a day:** The teacher uses <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">20%</fact3> of the chalk each day, which is 0.20 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 inches</fact1> = 1 inch.
* **Calculate how much usable chalk is left before recycling:**  The teacher recycles the chalk when it is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">less than 2 inches</fact2>.  Therefore, he has 2.75 inches - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 inches</fact2> = 0.75 inches of usable length left. 
* **Calculate the number of days before recycling:** Since the teacher uses 1 inch of chalk per day, he can use the chalk for another 0.75 inches / 1 inch/day = 0.75 days.

**Answer:** The teacher has enough chalk to last another 0.75 days before he has to recycle it.</div></div>

Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store.</fact1> <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.</fact2> What's the total amount of money he will spend if <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">each pepper costs 15$</fact3>?
Answer: Since each <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">pepper costs 15$</fact3> and a <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs</fact2>, each watermelon costs 3 * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15$</fact3> = 45$.
An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost, so each orange costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$.
So, 4 watermelons cost 4 * 45$ = 180$.
20 peppers cost 20 * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">15$</fact3> = 300$
And 10 oranges cost 10 * 40$ = 400$
Therefore, the total cost is 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$.

<div class='container'><div class='answer'><strong>33/ Reformatted Question:</strong> A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable.</fact1> <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks.</fact2> <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales.</fact3> <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags.</fact4> <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?</fact5> 

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Sugar Cubes:**  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 boxes * 1 pound/box</fact1> = 2 pounds
* **Oats:** <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack</fact2> = 1300 pounds
* **Hay:** <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">42 bales * 75 pounds/bale</fact3> = 3150 pounds
* **Carrots:** <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">4 bags * 12 pounds/bag </fact4>= 48 pounds

Now, let's add up the weight of all the feed: 2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48 = 4500 pounds

Finally, we can determine the number of trips: 4500 pounds / <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">2250 pounds/trip</fact5> = 2 trips

He ate <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor</fact4>. He <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends</fact5>. Then, he <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner</fact6>. He <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch</fact7>. <target>How many cookies does he have now?</target>

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Let's calculate the number of cookies Randy has left, flavor by flavor:

* **Oatmeal:** He starts with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">9 oatmeal cookies</fact1>. He eats <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1</fact4> and later another <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">2</fact7>, leaving him with 9 - 1 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies. Then he <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">bakes 4 more</fact6>, bringing the total to 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies.

* **Chocolate Chip:** He begins with <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 chocolate chip cookies</fact2>. After eating <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1</fact4>, he has 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies. After <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">baking 4 more</fact6>, he has 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies.

* **Sugar Cookies:** Randy starts with <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5 sugar cookies</fact3>. He eats <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">1</fact4> and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">gives away 2</fact5>, leaving him with 5 - 1 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies. He then <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">bakes 4 more</fact6>, bringing his total to 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies.

Finally, adding up all the flavors: 10 oatmeal + 7 chocolate chip + 6 sugar = 23 cookies.

**Therefore, Randy now has 23 cookies.**</div></div>

They play for <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 hours</fact2>.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">How much money is used?</fact3><br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, figure out how many quarters Jack uses in an hour: There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he plays 60/<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20</fact1> = 3 games an hour. Since each game costs 1 quarter, he uses 3*<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1</fact1>=3 quarters per hour.
Then multiply that number by the number of hours to find his total cost for the day: He plays for <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 hours</fact2> and uses 3 quarters per hour so he uses 3*<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4</fact2> = 12 quarters
Then calculate how many quarters each of his friends who isn't as good uses:  They play half as long so they each use 12/2 = 6 quarters.
Then multiply that number by 2 to find the total cost for both of those friends: That means they use 6*2 = 12 quarters
Then figure out how many quarters his friend who is better than him uses: His friend plays 1.5 times longer so he uses 12*1.5 = 18 quarters
Then add up the quarters to find the group's total: 12 + 12 + 18 + 12 = 54 quarters.
The answer is {54}.</div></div>

How much does replacing the movies cost if a <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">normal movie costs $10</fact5>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">A third of his movies are in a series</fact3> so that's <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">600</fact1>/3 = 200 movies.
That means <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">600</fact1>-200 = 400 movies are not in a series.
Of those, <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">40% are older movies</fact2>, which is .4*<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">400</fact2> = 160 movies
So 400-160 = 240 movies are full-priced
Those movies will cost him 240*<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$10</fact5> = $2400
The series are <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$6 instead of $10</fact4> so they cost <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">10</fact5>-<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6</fact4> = $4 less
That means he saves 200*<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$4</fact4> = $800 on the series
So the series cost him 200*<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$10</fact5>-800 = $1200
So in total, he pays $1200 + $2400 + 160*<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$5</fact2> = $4400
The answer is {4400}.</div></div>

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 * 18000</fact1> = 4500 gallons.

We are also told how many bars of chocolate Boris makes in week one, two, and three, but that information is irrelevant because the question only asks about week four and provides the total amount for the month. Therefore, to figure out how many bars of chocolate he makes in week four, we need to subtract the number of bars he makes in weeks one, two, and three from the total number of bars he makes each month.  However, we are only told <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">how many bars he makes in week one (8,000)</fact2>, and that in week two he makes half that amount, and in week three, three times the amount of week one. Half of the amount he makes in week one is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000. Three times the amount he makes in week one is 8,000 x 3 = 24,000. All together, in weeks one, two, and three, Boris makes 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars of chocolate. Therefore, in week four, Boris must make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars of chocolate.

Assuming that <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">sales tax is included</fact5>, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The discount on the shirt is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$25</fact2> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">0.30</fact3> = $7.50.
So, the price of the shirt after the discount is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$25</fact2> - $7.50 = $17.50.
Therefore, the total cost of the shirt and shorts is $17.50 + <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$35</fact4> = $52.50.
Since <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">sales tax is included</fact5>, Joe needs $52.50 to buy the outfit.
However, Joe only has <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$50</fact1>, which is not enough.
Therefore, Joe will not have any money left after the purchase. In fact, he will be short $52.50 - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$50</fact1> = $2.50.

After the voucher discount, Clara paid $400 - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$2</fact1> = $398.
On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$30</fact3> x <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">20</fact6> = $600.
A 10% discount on this amount is $600 x 10/100 = $60.

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First find the discount on the frying pan: $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00
Then subtract the discount to find the sale price of the frying pan: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
Then find the discount on the towels: $30.00 * .10 = $3.00
Then subtract the discount to find the sale price of the towels: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
Then add the price of the frying pan and the towels to find her total spending before the return: $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
Then add this amount to her previous balance to find her balance before the return: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$85.00</fact1> + $43.00 = $128.00
Then subtract the price of the returned item to find her <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">new balance</fact6>: $128.00 - <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$15.00</fact2> = $113.00

Because Mark edits an <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">equal number of sentences for each publisher</fact4>, and he edits a total of <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1000 sentences</fact1>, he must edit <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1000</fact1>/2 = 500 sentences for each Publisher.

How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The brokerage fee is <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">5%</fact2> * $<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">350,000</fact1> = $17,500.
The transfer fee is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">12%</fact3> * $<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">350,000</fact1> = $42,000
The total price of the house is $<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">350,000</fact1> + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500
So the total price of the house is $409,500 - $<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400,000</fact4> = $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

Calculate the total number of hours she spent <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">writing articles in the three days</fact5>.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>On Tuesday, Meredith wrote <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2/5 * 5</fact4> = 2 more articles than she did on Monday.
That means she wrote a total of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5</fact3> + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she wrote <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</fact2>, a total of 2 * 7 = 14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5</fact3> + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.
Given that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">each article takes 4 hours to write</fact1>, she spent a total of 26 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4</fact1> = 104 hours writing.

* Next, let's calculate Tom's points. We know that <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Tom has 30 points less than Betty</fact3>, who has 65 points. Therefore, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
* Now, we can find out how many points Marta has. <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom</fact2>, who has 35 points, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.
* Now, let's add up the points of all the students: 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.
* Finally, we can determine how many points the class is missing. <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points</fact5>, and they currently have 255 points. Therefore, they are missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

He also knows that they get about <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">80% efficiency in packing</fact2>. He estimates <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">30% of the jelly beans are red</fact3>. The jar has a square base and is <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 inches by 6 inches</fact4> and <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">15 inches tall</fact5>.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">900</fact6>.  How far off was his guess?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First find the volume of the jar: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 inches</fact4>*<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">6 inches</fact4>*<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">15 inches</fact5> = 540 cubic inches.
Then account for the packing efficiency: 540 cubic inches * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">0.8</fact2>= 432 cubic inches.
Then divide that volume by the volume of each jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">.15 cubic inches per jelly bean</fact1> = 2880 jelly beans.
Then multiply the total number of jelly beans by the percentage that are red to find the number of red jelly beans: 2880 jelly beans * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">.3</fact3> = 864 red jelly beans.
Finally, subtract his estimated number of red jelly beans from the actual number to find how far off he was: <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">900</fact6> red jelly beans - 864 red jelly beans = 36 jelly beans.

Because <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">each gallon needs 1 cup of lemon juice</fact2>, he'll need 5 * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">1</fact2> = 5 cups of juice.

Thomas withdraws <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$1000 in 20 dollar bills</fact1> from the bank account.  After getting home, he uses <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">half of the remaining bills</fact2> to pay for a bill.  Thomas then <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">triples his money</fact3>.  He then <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills</fact4>.  He <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">lost 10 bills</fact5> while getting home.  How many <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">5 dollar bills</fact6> does he have? 

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**

* **Step 1: Calculate the initial number of bills.** Thomas starts with <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills</fact1>.

* **Step 2: Account for lost bills.** He loses <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">10 bills</fact5>, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

* **Step 3: Calculate bills remaining after paying the bill.** Thomas uses <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">half of the remaining bills</fact2>, leaving him with 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

* **Step 4: Calculate the number of bills after tripling his money.**  Thomas <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">triples his money</fact3>, which means he triples his bills: 20 x 3 = 60 bills.

* **Step 5: Calculate the final number of $5 bills.** Since each $20 bill converts to four <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$5 bills</fact6>, he has 60 x 4 =  240 five-dollar bills. 

**Therefore, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.**</div></div>

Since there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, there are 4 chamomile and mint tea cups / 2 types of tea = <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">2 cups of mint tea in each row</fact4>. 

The answer is {2}.</div></div>

How many dollars did she make that day?

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>* **Bicycle Customers:** <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">5 bicycle riders</fact1> * 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires 
* **Tricycle Customers:** <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">3 tricycle riders</fact2> * 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires
* **Unicycle Customer:** <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1 unicycle rider</fact3> * 1 tire/unicycle = 1 tire
* **Total Tires:** 10 tires + 9 tires + 1 tire = 20 tires
* **Total Earnings (in cents):** 20 tires * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">25 cents/tire</fact4> = 500 cents

That leaves her with <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">40</fact4> - 20 = 20 large stickers to trade for small buttons.
She gets 20 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">3</fact1> = 60 small buttons for those stickers.

The etching for each picture frame costs <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$20</fact3> * 0.<fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">20</fact4> = $4.
Thus, each picture frame costs <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$20</fact3> + $4 = $24.
So, the picture frames cost a total of $24 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44</fact1> = $1056
There are <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">44</fact1>/<fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4</fact5> = 11 officers.

This means he receives 3*<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2</fact2> = 6 letters from penpals every week
Because <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">he responds in kind</fact4>, he also writes 6 letters.

Each letter takes him <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">5</fact3>*<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6</fact1> = 30 minutes to write
That means he spends 12*30 = 360 minutes a week writing.

Bryce and four of his friends each ordered their own pizzas after football practice. <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.</fact1> <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas.</fact2> <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Each pizza had 12 slices.</fact3> How many slices of pizza were left?

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**

* **Step 1: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the first group.**
   - Bryce and two friends make a total of 3 people. 
   - They ate 2/3 of each pizza, so they ate (2/3) * 12 slices/pizza = 8 slices per pizza.
   - Since there were 3 of them, they ate a total of 8 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices.

* **Step 2: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the second group.**
   - The two remaining friends ate ¾ of each pizza, so they ate (3/4) * 12 slices/pizza = 9 slices per pizza.
   - Since there were 2 of them, they ate a total of 9 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices.

* **Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices eaten.**
   - Together, both groups ate 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices.

* **Step 4: Calculate the total number of slices ordered.**
   - Bryce and his four friends make a total of 5 people.
   - Since they each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, they ordered 5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

* **Step 5: Calculate the number of slices remaining.**
    - They started with 60 slices and ate 42 slices, leaving 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices. 

**Therefore, there were 18 slices of pizza left.**</div></div>

How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>James spends <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger</fact2>, meaning he spends 2 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$5000</fact1> = $10000 on fuel per month
So he spends $10000 + <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$5000</fact1> = $15000 on fuel and the hanger every month
So, in a year, he spends $15000 * 12 = $180000 on the hanger and fuel
So in total, he spends <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$150,000</fact3> + $180000 = $330000 on the plane, fuel, and the hanger in the first year

So, he has a total of <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">50 trees</fact2> + 100 trees = 150 trees
Then 30% of the trees die, which equals to 150 trees * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">30%</fact4> = 45 trees

How much does he make?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Here's how to break down the problem:

* **Usable Wood:** John can use <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">80%</fact4> of the <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">80-foot</fact1> tree, which is 0.80 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">80</fact1> = 64 feet of wood.
* **Number of Logs:** He cuts the usable wood into <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4-foot</fact2> logs, so he gets 64 / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4</fact2> = 16 logs.

Since each sandwich needs <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 pound each of meat and cheese</fact1>, he needs 5 sandwiches * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 pound of meat per sandwich</fact1> = 5 pounds of meat.
He'll also need 5 sandwiches * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1 pound of cheese per sandwich</fact1> = 5 pounds of cheese.
The meat will cost <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$7.00 per pound</fact3> * 5 pounds = $35.00.
The cheese will cost <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$3.00 per pound</fact4> * 5 pounds = $15.00.

Now let's add up the total ounces in the scrub: x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces (total)

Combining like terms: 10x = 10 ounces

To find the amount of oil (4x), we need to solve for x: x = 1 ounce

Finally, calculate the amount of oil: 4 * 1 ounce = 4 ounces

<fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">Therefore, she uses 4 ounces of oil.</fact6> 
The answer is {4}.</div></div>

Crista has <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">20 plants</fact2> and we know that <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8 need a full cup</fact1> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 need half a cup</fact3>. That means 20 - 8 - 4 = 8 plants need a quarter cup of water. 
- Next, we know <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">8 plants need 1 cup</fact1> of water, so that's 8 * 1 = 8 cups.
- <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 plants need half</fact3> a cup of water, which is equal to 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.
- <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">The remaining 8 plants need a quarter</fact4> cup of water, which equals 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert allows the students to <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">remove the lowest score</fact2> from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">89, 71, 92, 100 and 86</fact3> on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">average of 93</fact4>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Since Mr. Bert drops the lowest test score, only <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">6 tests</fact1> - 1 test = 5 tests are used to calculate the average.
To get an <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">average of 93</fact4> across 5 tests, Brinley needs a total of <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">93</fact4> * 5 = 465 points.
On her first five tests, Brinley has scored a total of <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">89</fact3> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">71</fact3> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">92</fact3> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">100</fact3> + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">86</fact3> = 438 points
Because her lowest score of 71 is dropped, to reach 465 points total, Brinley needs to score 465 - 438 = 27 points.

What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The leather seats cost <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$7,500</fact2> / 3 = $2,500.
The running boards cost $2,500 - <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$500</fact4> = $2,000.
Altogether, the upgrades cost <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$7,500</fact2> + $2,500 + $2,000 + <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$1,500</fact5> = $13,500.

How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First figure out how many 16-second intervals are in 64 seconds:  <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">64 seconds</fact3> / <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">16 seconds per interval</fact1> = 4 intervals
Then multiply that number by 20 feet to find the total distance Julia traveled: 4 intervals * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">20 feet per interval</fact1> = 80 feet. 
Now divide that distance by 10 feet to determine how many 10-foot segments Julia rowed: 80 feet / <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 feet per segment</fact2> = 8 segments. 
Finally, multiply that number by 2 liters to find the total amount of water taken on by the boat: 8 segments * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">2 liters of water</fact2> = 16 liters.

How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck</fact3>, who can haul <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4,000 pounds</fact1>, so Gordy's truck can haul <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">800</fact3>+<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4,000</fact1>=4,800 pounds.
Together, Gissela and Gordy can haul 4,800 + <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">4,000</fact1> = 8,800 pounds.
Since <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">all three drivers together can haul 11,600 pounds</fact2>, Gary must be able to haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The first monkey eats <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10 bananas per day</fact1>, so in a week, it eats 7 * <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1> = 70 bananas.
The second monkey eats <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4 more bananas than the first monkey</fact3>, who eats <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1>, so the second monkey eats <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">4</fact3> + <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10</fact1> = 14 bananas each day.
That means the second monkey eats 14 * 7 = 98 bananas each week.

Since <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas for all three monkeys to eat for the whole week</fact2>, the third monkey eats <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">315</fact2> - 168 = 147 bananas each week.

* **Calculate the price after the trade-in:** <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">The laptop originally costs $600</fact5>, and <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200</fact2>, so the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
* **Calculate how much money Erika has:** Since <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">she only needs $50 more</fact6>, this means she has $400 - $50 = $350.
* **Calculate Erika's savings:**  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Her mom gave her $80</fact1>, and <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">she earned $150 from her job</fact4>, totaling $80 + $150 = $230. 
* **Calculate the money in her purse:**  <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">She already had some money in her purse</fact3>.  Since she has a total of $350 and we've accounted for $230, she must have $350 - $230 = $120 in her purse.

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**

* **Cost of cars:** The company bought each car for <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">30%</fact4> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$25,000</fact3> = $7,500.

* **Revenue per car:**  Since each car cost <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$25,000</fact3>, the company made a profit of $25,000 - $7,500 = $17,500 per car.
* **Total Revenue:** The company made a total profit of $17,500/car * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">10 cars</fact2> = $175,000
* **Commission:** James' commission is <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10%</fact1> of the total profits, so he made <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">10%</fact1> * $175,000 = $17,500.

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Daniel wants to buy five notebooks</fact1> at <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$1.50 each</fact3>, so the total cost for notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50

Next, the pens will cost him: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">He wants two pens</fact1> at <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$0.25 each</fact3>, making the total cost for pens 2 * $0.25 = $0.50

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items before the discount: The notebooks cost $7.50, the pens cost $0.50, the calculator is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$12</fact3>, and the geometry set is <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$10</fact3>, for a total of $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.00

Finally, let's calculate the discount and final price: <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">The shop gives a 10% discount</fact2> on the total price of $30.00, which means the discount is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00
Therefore, Daniel has to pay $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for all the items.

The answer is {27}.</div></div>

She makes <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">15 hours</fact5> * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$5 an hour</fact6> = $75 from her second job.
In total, she has $200 + $75 + <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$80</fact3> = $355.

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**

* **Capacity of one of John's classes:**  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">One of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class</fact1>, which translates to (<fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">1/8</fact1>) * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">120 students</fact2> = 15 students.
* **Capacity of both of John's classes:** Since John has two classes, their combined capacity is 15 students/class * 2 classes = 30 students.
* **Combined capacity of both schools:**  The total capacity of both schools is 30 students (John's classes) + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">120 students (Ali's class)</fact2> = 150 students.

Let 'x' be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
-  <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">Third set</fact1>: Rory retrieved x/2 balls.
- <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">Total</fact3>: x (second set) + x/2 (third set) + x + 4 (first set) = <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">19</fact3>

Each year it will grow <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 lemons</fact1>, which he can sell for <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$1.5 each</fact2>. It costs <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$3 a year</fact3> to water and feed the tree. The tree will cost <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$90 to plant</fact4>. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree? 

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, find out how much money Carlos makes per year from lemons: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">7 lemons</fact1> * <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$1.50/lemon</fact2> = $10.50.
Then, subtract the cost of water and feed to find his yearly profit: $10.50 - <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$3.00</fact3> = $7.50.
Then, divide the initial cost of the tree by the yearly profit to find how many years until he breaks even: <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$90</fact4> / $7.50/year = 12 years.

**Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.**</div></div>

If <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">Sara already had $10 saved</fact7> before she started babysitting, how many times must she mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes? 

##<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First find the total cost of the shoes: <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">2 pairs of shoes</fact1> * <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">$20 per pair</fact3> = $40.
Then add the cost of the jacket to find the total cost: $40 + <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$30</fact2> = $70.
Then multiply the number of times Sara babysat by her earnings per babysitting job to find her total babysitting earnings: <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">4 times</fact5> * <fact6 style="background-color: #33FFF3;">$5 per time</fact6> = $20.
Then add her babysitting money to her savings to find her total savings: $20 + <fact7 style="background-color: #FFDD33;">$10</fact7> = $30.
Then subtract her current savings from the total cost of the jacket and shoes to find out how much more money she needs: $70 - $30 = $40.
Then divide that amount by her earnings per lawn mowed to find out how many lawns she needs to mow: $40 / <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">$4 per lawn</fact4> = 10 lawns.

What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>To figure out the cheapest way to get the most sticks, let's look at how many sticks he can get per dollar with each type of wood:

* **2 x 4s:** 
    *  He gets <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">200 sticks per 2 x 4</fact3>.
    *  A 2 x 4 costs <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">$4</fact1>.

* **2 x 8s:**
    * He gets <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400 sticks per 2 x 8</fact4>.
    * A 2 x 8 costs <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$6</fact2>.
    * That means he gets <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400</fact4>/<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$6</fact2> = 66.67 sticks per dollar (approximately).

Since he gets more sticks per dollar with the 2 x 8s, he should buy as many of those as possible.

* With <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$24</fact5>, he can buy <fact5 style="background-color: #FFA533;">$24</fact5>/<fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">$6</fact2> = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 lumber. 
* Since each 2 x 8 makes <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400 sticks</fact4>, he can make 4 * <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">400</fact4> = 1600 popsicle sticks.

If he pours <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">one ounce from the other bottle</fact3>, he is now able to drink the water. <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.</fact4>  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

**<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>**

Since the water is drinkable after mixing, we know the mixture's temperature is at least <fact4 style="background-color: #FF33A1;">40 degrees</fact4>.  Let's assume the second bottle's temperature is 'x' degrees.

The mixture contains <fact2 style="background-color: #33FF57;">4 ounces of 33-degree water</fact2> and <fact3 style="background-color: #3357FF;">1 ounce of x-degree water</fact3>, totaling 5 ounces.  To have a 40-degree mixture, the heat contributed by the x-degree water must raise the overall temperature by at least 7 degrees (40 degrees - <fact1 style="background-color: #FF5733;">33 degrees</fact1> = 7 degrees).

Since the x-degree water contributes 1/5 of the total volume, it needs to be at least 35 degrees hotter than the desired 40-degree mixture (7 degrees / (1/5) = 35 degrees). 

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 75 degrees (40 degrees + 35 degrees = 75 degrees).</div></div>

This means she was in bed from 10 p.m. to 5:55 which is 7 hours and 55 minutes. 7 hours and 55 minutes is the same as 475 minutes.  Taking away the 23 minutes of sleepwalking, she slept 475-23=452 minutes in her bed.
