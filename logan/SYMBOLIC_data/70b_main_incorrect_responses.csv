1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 354 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>. If <fact2>the city is 81 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the time it takes to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance covered in the given time and then multiply by the given time. 
The distance covered in the given time is <fact1>3 miles</fact1> and the given time is <fact1>354 minutes</fact1>. 
The total distance across the city is <fact2>81 miles</fact2>. 
So, the time it takes to cover the whole city is (<fact2>81 miles</fact2> / <fact1>3 miles</fact1>) * <fact1>354 minutes</fact1> = 27 * 354 = 9546 minutes.

If <fact2>the city is 76 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the time it takes to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many 2-mile sections the city has. We can do this by dividing the total distance across the city (<fact2>76 miles</fact2>) by the distance covered in each time period (<fact1>2 miles</fact1>). This gives us <fact2>76</fact2>/<fact1>2</fact1> = 38 sections. Since it takes <fact1>337 minutes</fact1> to cover each section, the total time it takes to cover the whole city is <fact1>337</fact1> * 38 = 12826 minutes.",12806,0,1,p2,72,810

If <fact2>the city is 60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the time it takes to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance covered in the given time and then multiply by the given time. The distance covered in the given time is <fact1>3 miles</fact1> and the given time is <fact1>438 minutes</fact1>. The total distance across the city is <fact2>60 miles</fact2>. So, the time it takes to cover the whole city is (<fact2>60 miles</fact2> / <fact1>3 miles</fact1>) * <fact1>438 minutes</fact1> = 20 * 438 minutes = 8780 minutes.",8760,0,1,p2,84,846
1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 241 minutes to cover every 5 miles of the city</fact1>. If <fact2>the city is 85 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance covered in the given time and then multiply by the given time. The total distance across the city is <fact2>85 miles</fact2> and the distance covered in the given time is <fact1>5 miles</fact1>. So, the number of times the given distance fits into the total distance is <fact2>85</fact2>/<fact1>5</fact1> = 17. Now, we multiply this by the given time, which is <fact1>241 minutes</fact1>. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is 17 * <fact1>241 minutes</fact1> = 4100 minutes, but since 85 is not perfectly divisible by 5, we should calculate the remaining distance and add the time it takes to cover that distance. The remaining distance is 85 - (17 * 5) = 0 miles, so we don't need to add any extra time.",4097,0,1,p2,99,1218

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d10 die</fact1> is 7/10, since there are 7 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100, since there are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an odd number twice in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: (7/10) - (25/100) = (70/100) - (25/100) = 45/100.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is 2/4 = 1/2, since there are two numbers greater than 2 (3 and 4) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 1/2 (there are two odd numbers, 1 and 3, out of a total of 4 possible outcomes), and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> is 19/20, since there are 19 numbers greater than 1 out of a total of 20 numbers.

To roll <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>, Leon must first roll an even number, which has a probability of 1/2, and then roll another even number, which also has a probability of 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 19/20 - 1/4 = 0.95 - 0.25 = 0.7.

To express this difference as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.7 × 100 = 70%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we note that there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. 
To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we note that there are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we note that 25% is 25/25 = 1 times 25%, so it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a d20 die is 14/20, since there are 14 numbers greater than 5 on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4, since there are 10 even numbers on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total, and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, we need to convert both probabilities to a common format. We can convert 14/20 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 14/20 = 0.7. We can convert 1/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1/4 = 0.25.

The difference in probability is 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.45. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: 0.45 * 100 = 45%.

Therefore, it is 45% more likely that Jin rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> on a <fact1>10-sided die</fact1> is 9/10, since there are 9 numbers greater than 1 (2-10) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes.

To roll <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>, Ali must first roll an even number, which has a probability of 5/10 (since there are 5 even numbers out of 10 possible outcomes). If he succeeds, he must then roll another even number, which again has a probability of 5/10. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (5/10) × (5/10) = 25/100 = 1/4.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 9/10 - 1/4 = 36/40 - 10/40 = 26/40 = 13/20.

To express this as a percentage, we divide 13 by 20 and multiply by 100: (13 ÷ 20) × 100 = 65%.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 4</fact2> on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> is 3/8, since there are 3 numbers (5, 6, 7, 8) greater than 4 out of a total of 8 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> is (4/8) * (4/8) = 16/64 = 1/4, since there are 4 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an odd number twice in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 4: 3/8 - 1/4 = 3/8 - 2/8 = 1/8.

To express this difference as a percentage, divide by the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 and multiply by 100: (1/8) / (3/8) * 100 = (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.

Therefore, it is 33.33% more likely that Pavel rolls a <fact2>number greater than 4</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>.",25,0,1,p2,146,1262

Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a die. Of these, <fact2>7</fact2> are greater than 2. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact2>7</fact2>/<fact1>10</fact1>=0.7. There are <fact1>5</fact1> even numbers on a die, so the probability of rolling an even number is <fact1>5</fact1>/<fact1>10</fact1>=0.5. The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> is 0.5*0.5=0.25. The difference between these probabilities is 0.7-0.25=0.45. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.45*100=45%.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> is 2/4 = 1/2, since there are two numbers greater than 2 on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1> (namely, 3 and 4). The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since there is a 1/2 chance of rolling an even number on each roll, and the rolls are independent. To find the difference in these probabilities, we calculate 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. To express this as a percentage, we calculate (1/4) * 100% = 25%. Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Tariq rolls a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>.",25,0,1,p2,148,904

Answer: Let's start by adding the parts of the ratio together: <fact1>38 + 5 = 43</fact1>. This means that for every 43 ""units"" of the mixture, 38 of those units are teaspoons of sugar. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, we need to find out how many ""units"" of the mixture Winnie used, and then multiply that by the fraction of the mixture that is sugar. We know that Winnie used a total of <fact2>473 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, so we can set up the following proportion: 43 units / 473 total = 38 units / x, where x is the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar.

The last complex is <fact3>55% bigger than the other 6 combined</fact3>, so it has 1800 + 0.55 * 1800 = 2780 apartments. In total, Andre collects garbage from 1800 + 2780 = 4580 apartments. Since Andre collects garbage <fact4>2 times a week</fact4> from each place, he collects garbage 4580 * 2 = 9160 times per week. He gets paid <fact5>€0.25 per collection for each apartment</fact5>, so he makes 9160 * €0.25 = €2290 per week.

Answer: The total weight of the SUV is <fact1>1200 kilograms</fact1> + <fact2>150 kilograms</fact2> + (<fact3>4 teammates</fact3> * <fact3>50 kilograms per teammate</fact3>) = 1200 + 150 + 200 = 1550 kilograms. The force to move the SUV is <fact4>2% of the weight</fact4>, which is 0.02 * 1550 kilograms = 31 kilograms. Since force is typically measured in Newtons, and 1 kilogram-force is equal to 9.8 Newtons, the force required to move the SUV is 31 kilograms * 9.8 Newtons/kilogram = 303.8 Newtons, which is approximately 304 Newtons.",31,0,1,p2,3377,891

Answer: The plumber works <fact2>6 days every week</fact2> and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so he works <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact1>3</fact1> * 4 = 72 days in a 4-week month. However, since the question asks about a year, we should use 52 weeks in a year. So, he works <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact1>3</fact1> * 52/4 = 6 * 3 * 13 = 234 days in a year. He earns <fact3>$110 every day</fact3>, so he earns <fact3>$110</fact3> * 234 = $25,740 in a year.

Answer: Leon's uncle was <fact2>31 years old</fact2> when he saw the Comet. Since <fact1>Comet Hyakutake orbits the sun every 70 years</fact1>, Leon's uncle would have been 31 + 70 = 101 years old when Leon saw the Comet for the second time. According to <fact3>Leon saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his uncle was when he saw the Comet</fact3>, Leon was 3 * 31 = 93 years old when he saw the Comet for the second time.
