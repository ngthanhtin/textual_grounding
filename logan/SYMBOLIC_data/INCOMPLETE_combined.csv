Answer: Since the carpenter works for <fact1>3 weeks every month</fact1> and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, he works for approximately 3/4 of the month. Since he works for <fact2>6 days every week</fact2> and there are 7 days in a week, he works for 6/7 of the week. Since there are 52 weeks in <fact4>a year</fact4>, he works for approximately (3/4) * (6/7) * 52 = 3 * 6 * 52 / (4 * 7) = 3 * 6 * 13 * 4 / 7 = 936 / 7 * 3 = 36 * 13 * 3 / 7 * 3 = 36 * 13 = 468 days in a year. Since he gets paid <fact3>¥50 every day</fact3>, he earns 468 * <fact3>50</fact3> = ¥23400 in a year.

Answer: Since the plumber works for <fact1>3 weeks every month</fact1> and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, he works for approximately 3/4 of the month. Since he works for <fact2>6 days every week</fact2> and there are 7 days in a week, he works for 6/7 of the week. Since there are 52 weeks in <fact4>a year</fact4>, the plumber works for approximately (3/4) * (6/7) * 52 = 3 * 6 * 13/7 = 234/7 * 6 = 1404/7 = 200.57 weeks, or approximately 200.57 * (6/7) * 7 = 200.57 * 6 = 1203.42 days, in a year. Since he gets paid <fact3>$180 every day</fact3>, he earns approximately 1203.42 * 180 = 216,615.6 or $216,616 per year (rounding up from 216,615.6 to 216,616).",38880.0,0,1,p2,3543,900

If <fact2>the city is 85 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance covered in the given time and then multiply by the given time. The total distance across the city is <fact2>85 miles</fact2> and the distance covered in the given time is <fact1>5 miles</fact1>. So, the number of times the given distance fits into the total distance is <fact2>85</fact2>/<fact1>5</fact1> = 17. Now, we multiply this by the given time, which is <fact1>241 minutes</fact1>. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is 17 * <fact1>241 minutes</fact1> = 4100 minutes, but since 85 is not perfectly divisible by 5, we should calculate the remaining distance and add the time it takes to cover that distance.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d10 die</fact1> is 7/10, since there are 7 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100, since there are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an odd number twice in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: (7/10) - (25/100) = (70/100) - (25/100) = 45/100.

Answer: Let's denote the number of orange tiles as <fact2>7x</fact2>, where x is a positive integer. The total number of tiles in the stack is the sum of the green tiles, orange tiles, and black tiles. We can write an equation to represent this: <fact1>2</fact1> + <fact2>7x</fact2> + <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>46</fact4>. Since we don't know the number of black tiles, we can represent it as <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>46</fact4> - <fact1>2</fact1> - <fact2>7x</fact2>. We can simplify this expression to <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>44</fact4> - <fact2>7x</fact2>. Since the number of black tiles must be a non-negative integer, we can set up the inequality <fact4>44</fact4> - <fact2>7x</fact2> ≥ 0. Solving for x, we get x ≤ <fact4>44</fact4> / <fact2>7</fact2> ≈ 6.29. Since x must be a positive integer, the largest possible value of x is 6.

To do this, we need to find 40% of the normal brand's price and add it to the normal brand's price. 40% of <fact1>€5</fact1> is <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>€5</fact1> = <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>€5</fact1> / <fact5>100%</fact5> = €2. So, the more expensive brand of rice costs <fact1>€5</fact1> + <fact2>€2</fact2> = €7 per kg. Arash needs <fact3>2 kg of rice per day</fact3> for a week, so he needs <fact3>2 kg</fact3> * <fact4>7 days</fact4> = 14 kg of rice. The normal brand of rice would cost <fact1>€5</fact1> * <fact6>14 kg</fact6> = €70. The more expensive brand of rice would cost <fact2>€7</fact2> * <fact6>14 kg</fact6> = €98. So, the total cost of the rice is €70 + €98 = €168. Finally, Arash also bought a bagel for <fact4>€2</fact4>, so the total cost of everything is €168 + €2 = €170.",100.0,0,1,p2,2126,1307
44,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>44 girls in the field</fact1>. If there are <fact2>1/4 the number of boys in the field</fact2>, how many kids are in the field?
Answer: Since there are <fact2>1/4 the number of boys in the field</fact2> as there are girls, there must be <fact1>44</fact1> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 176 boys in the field. To find the total number of kids, we need to add the number of girls and the number of boys. So, the total number of kids is <fact1>44</fact1> + <fact2>176</fact2> = 220 kids.",55.0,0,1,p2,2237,513
7,"Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys <fact1>eight 3-pound boxes of apples</fact1> for the whole stable. He buys <fact2>fourteen 9-pound bags of cucumbers</fact2>. He buys <fact3>thirty-three 36-pound packs of wheats</fact3>. He buys <fact4>seventeen 16-pound sacks of oats</fact4>.  <fact5>His farm truck can carry 230 pounds at a time</fact5>. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Apples:** <fact1>eight 3-pound boxes</fact1> = 8 * 3 = 24 pounds
* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>fourteen 9-pound bags</fact2> = 14 * 9 = 126 pounds
* **Wheats:** <fact3>thirty-three 36-pound packs</fact3> = 33 * 36 = 1188 pounds
* **Oats:** <fact4>seventeen 16-pound sacks</fact4> = 17 * 16 = 272 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 24 + 126 + 1188 + 272 = 1610 pounds.

Since <fact5>his farm truck can carry 230 pounds at a time</fact5>, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to determine the number of trips: 1610 pounds / 230 pounds/trip = 7.0 trips.

Because we can't make a partial trip, the farmer needs to make a total of 8 trips to transport all the feed.

Therefore, the answer is {8}.
