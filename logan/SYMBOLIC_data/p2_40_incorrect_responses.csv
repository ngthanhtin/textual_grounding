Each day costs <fact2>₣250 for hotel</fact2>, <fact3>₣40 for food</fact3>, and <fact4>₣30 for transportation</fact4>. Ibrahim only has <fact5>₣110</fact5>. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the conference</fact3>. Ibrahim has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/4 of the remaining cost of the conference</fact6>. How much money is Ibrahim still missing?

Answer: The total cost of the conference is (<fact2>₣250</fact2> + <fact3>₣40</fact3> + <fact4>₣30</fact4>) * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = ₣640. Since Ibrahim's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the conference</fact3>, which is <fact3>₣40</fact3> * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = ₣80, Ibrahim will only need to cover ₣640 - ₣80 = ₣560. Since Ibrahim already has <fact5>₣110</fact5>, he will need to cover ₣560 - ₣110 = ₣450. The local charity will cover <fact6>1/4 of the remaining cost of the conference</fact6>, which is ₣450 * <fact6>1/4</fact6> = ₣112.50. Therefore, Ibrahim is still missing ₣450 - ₣112.50 = ₣337.50.

She already has <fact2>12 potted plants on each of the 51 window ledges</fact2> of her large country home. She also purchased <fact3>200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount</fact3>. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>4 potted plants from each ledge</fact4> to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mia remain with?

Answer: Mia originally had <fact2>12 potted plants on each of the 51 window ledges</fact2>, so she had <fact2>12</fact2> * 51 = 612 potted plants. She received <fact1>22 new potted plants</fact1> last week, so she had 612 + <fact1>22</fact1> = 634 potted plants. She purchased <fact3>200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount</fact3>, so she got 200 * 0.5 = 100 new plants. Now she has 634 + 100 = 734 potted plants. She will give <fact4>4 potted plants from each ledge</fact4> to friends and family tomorrow, so she will give <fact4>4</fact4> * 51 = 204 potted plants. Therefore, Mia will remain with 734 - 204 = 530 potted plants.

32,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a new townhouse that will not go beyond her <fact1>$440000 budget</fact1>. She saw a property that has a <fact2>selling price of $400000</fact2>. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 7% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>5% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>5%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $400000</fact2>, which is 0.05 * <fact2>$400000</fact2> = $20000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$400000</fact2> - $20000 = $380000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 7% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.07 * <fact2>$400000</fact2> = $28000. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 * <fact2>$400000</fact2> = $48000.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $380000 + $28000 + $48000 = $456000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's <fact1>$440000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $456000 - <fact1>$440000</fact1> = $16000.

He paid the registration fees that amounted to <fact2>3% of the selling price</fact2> and also paid a agent fee that is <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3>. He also paid <fact4>$570000 for the remaining loan amount on the house</fact4>, and <fact5>$25000 for closing costs</fact5>. Prof. Smith used the net proceeds from selling the house to invest in stocks. The stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Smith's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: Prof. Smith paid registration fees of <fact2>3%</fact2> * <fact1>$790000</fact1> = $23700 and agent fees of <fact3>4%</fact3> * <fact1>$790000</fact1> = $31600. So, the total fees paid were $23700 + $31600 = $55300. 
Adding this to the remaining loan amount of <fact4>$570000</fact4> and the closing costs of <fact5>$25000</fact5>, we get the total amount Prof. Smith paid as $55300 + <fact4>$570000</fact4> + <fact5>$25000</fact5> = $650300. 
So, the net proceeds from the sale of the house were <fact1>$790000</fact1> - $650300 = $139700. 
Since the stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>, the net proceeds after two years will be $139700 * (1 + <fact6>10%</fact6>)^2 = $139700 * (1 + 0.1)^2 = $139700 * (1.1)^2 = $139700 * 1.21 = $168937.

Answer: To get to the grocery store, it takes Valeria and Luis <fact2>12 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>12 minutes</fact3> = 24 minutes. 
Since they have to return home and then go back to the grocery store, they spend 24 * 2 = 48 minutes to get to the grocery store and back home and then get back to the grocery store again. 
So far, they have spent 48 minutes, and they have <fact1>182 minutes</fact1> - 48 minutes = 134 minutes left to get to the library without being late.

She also uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's assume Valeria used x sets of the ratio of <fact1>51:30 for teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact1>. Then she used 51x teaspoons of sugar and 30x cups of water. Since she uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, she used (7/10)*30x = 21x tablespoons of milk. Since she uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, she used 2*51x = 102x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk she used is 51x + 30x + 21x + 102x = 204x. Since this total is equal to <fact4>240</fact4>, we can solve for x: 204x = 240, x = 240/204 = 10/17. Now we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar she used: 51x = 51*(10/17) = 30.

Andre has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>. How much money is Andre still missing?

Answer: The total cost of the seminar is (<fact2>¥200</fact2> + <fact3>¥30</fact3> + <fact4>¥10</fact4>) * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥720. Since Andre's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3>, which is <fact3>¥30</fact3> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥90, Andre only needs to pay ¥720 - ¥90 = ¥630.

If the <fact6>brownie cost $9</fact6> and the <fact7>pear pie cost $22</fact7>, what was Oscar's average daily earning?

Answer: On Friday, Oscar sold <fact1>27 boxes of brownie</fact1> and <fact4>26</fact4> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 10 boxes of pear pie. On Saturday, he sold <fact1>27</fact1> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 40 boxes of brownie and <fact4>26 boxes of pear pie</fact4>. On Sunday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, so he sold (27 + 10) + (40 + 26) = 103 boxes. This means he sold 37 boxes of brownie and 36 boxes of pear pie on Sunday. Over the three days, Oscar sold a total of 104 boxes of brownie and 72 boxes of pear pie. This means he earned a total of 104 * <fact6>$9</fact6> + 72 * <fact7>$22</fact7> = $936 + $1584 = $2520. His average daily earning is $2520 / 3 = $840.

Answer: The number of occupied beds is <fact1>1700</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 212.5 beds. Since we can't have a fraction of a bed, we'll round down to 212 beds.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of questions for each subject. The number of history questions is <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact2>35%</fact2> = 28 questions. The number of biology questions is <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact3>15%</fact3> = 12 questions.

Now, let's calculate the number of questions Nadia is sure to get correctly. For biology, she will get <fact4>25%</fact4> of 12 questions, which is 0.25 * 12 = 3 questions. For history, she will get <fact5>75%</fact5> of 28 questions, which is 0.75 * 28 = 21 questions. For algebra and geography, she will get <fact6>an eighth</fact6> of 20 questions each, which is 20 / 8 = 2.5 questions for each subject. Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we will round down to 2 questions for each subject.

In total, Nadia is sure to get 3 + 21 + 2 + 2 = 28 questions correctly.

Each day costs <fact2>€250 for hotel</fact2>, <fact3>€40 for food</fact3>, and <fact4>€10 for transportation</fact4>. Yuki only has <fact5>€25</fact5>. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the music festival</fact3>. Yuki has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/10 of the remaining cost of the music festival</fact6>. How much money is Yuki still missing?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the music festival. The cost of the hotel for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>€250 per day</fact2> = €750. The cost of food for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>€40 per day</fact3> = €120. The cost of transportation for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>€10 per day</fact4> = €30. So, the total cost of the music festival is €750 + €120 + €30 = €900.

Since Yuki's friends will cover the cost of all the food, Yuki only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is €750 + €30 = €780.

Yuki has <fact5>€25</fact5>, so he still needs €780 - €25 = €755.

The community center will cover <fact6>1/10 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is €755 * 1/10 = €75.5.

So, Yuki still needs €755 - €75.5 = €679.5.

On <fact2>Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 60-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 2-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Sunday, he watched four episodes, each 15 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 22 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Andre watched on the days other than Thursday. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched <fact1>4 hours * 2 nights = 8 hours</fact1>. On Friday, he watched <fact3>3 hours + 1 hour = 4 hours</fact3>. On Saturday, he watched <fact4>2 hours * 4 episodes = 8 hours</fact4>. On Sunday, he watched <fact5>15 minutes * 4 episodes = 60 minutes = 1 hour</fact5>. So, the total hours of TV he watched on the days other than Thursday is 8 + 4 + 8 + 1 = 21 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 22 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 22 - 21 = 1 hour of TV on Thursday. Since each episode on Thursday is 60 minutes, he watched 1 hour / 1 hour per episode = 1 episode on Thursday.",1.0,0,1,p2,967,1348

She used a total of <fact4>240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's assume that Roya used x teaspoons of sugar. According to the given ratio, she used <fact1>7/49</fact1>x cups of water. Since she uses <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 6 cups of water</fact2>, she used (<fact2>6/6</fact2>)*(<fact1>7/49</fact1>x) = <fact1>7/49</fact1>x tablespoons of milk. Also, since she uses <fact3>3 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, she used <fact3>3</fact3>x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as <fact4>240</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + <fact1>7/49</fact1>x + <fact1>7/49</fact1>x + <fact3>3</fact3>x = <fact4>240</fact4>. Solving for x, we get x = 35.

Answer: The total cost of the <fact1>2-day field trip</fact1> is (<fact2>$200</fact2> + <fact3>$20</fact3> + <fact4>$10</fact4>) * 2 = $460. Since Esteban's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the field trip</fact3>, which is <fact3>$20</fact3> * 2 = $40, Esteban only needs to pay $460 - $40 = $420.

Answer: A <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> has 4 possible outcomes, with 2 of them being odd and 2 of them being greater than 1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 2/4 = 0.5. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. The probability of rolling an odd number is 2/4 = 0.5. The probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3> is 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.0625. The difference in probability is 0.25 - 0.0625 = 0.1875.

Hiroshi has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Hiroshi still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day workshop</fact1> is <fact2>₣250</fact2> * 3 = ₣750. The cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3> is <fact3>₣40</fact3> * 3 = ₣120, but this is covered by Hiroshi's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of the <fact4>transportation for the workshop</fact4> is <fact4>₣20</fact4> * 3 = ₣60. Therefore, the total cost of the workshop is ₣750 + ₣60 = ₣810.

Since Hiroshi's friends are covering the cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3>, Hiroshi only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is ₣810. He has <fact5>₣190</fact5>, so he still needs ₣810 - ₣190 = ₣620.

However, the local charity is covering <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>, which is 1/6 * ₣620 = ₣103.33. Therefore, Hiroshi still needs ₣620 - ₣103.33 = ₣516.67.

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's assume that Elena used x sets of the ratio of <fact1>44:11</fact1> for teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Then, she used 44x teaspoons of sugar and 11x cups of water. Since she uses <fact2>10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, she used 11x * (10/10) = 11x tablespoons of milk. Since she uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, she used 44x * 2 = 88x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is <fact4>210</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 44x + 11x + 88x + 11x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 154x = 210. Dividing both sides by 154, we get x = 1.36 (round down to 1 since we can't have a fraction of a set). Since x represents the number of sets of the ratio, we multiply x by 44 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 1 * 44 = 44.

Answer: The total cost of the hotel for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>$250 per day</fact2> = $750. The total cost of the food for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>$20 per day</fact3> = $60. The total cost of transportation for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>$10 per day</fact4> = $30. So the total cost of the music festival is $750 + $60 + $30 = $840. Since Mateo's friends will cover the cost of the food, Mateo only needs to pay $840 - $60 = $780. Mateo has <fact5>$105</fact5>, so he still needs $780 - $105 = $675. However, the school will cover <fact6>1/4 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is $675 / 4 = $168.75. So Mateo still needs $675 - $168.75 = $506.25.

14,"Reformatted Question: Andre and Keisha have <fact1>268 minutes to walk to the mall together starting from their home</fact1>. It takes them <fact2>29 minutes to get to the corner where the park is</fact2>. It takes them <fact3>another 49 minutes to get to the bank</fact3>. When they reach the bank, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the bank again. Once they reach the bank for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?

Answer: The time it takes to get to the bank is <fact2>29 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>49 minutes</fact3> = 78 minutes. 
Since they have to return home and then go back to the bank, they spend 78 * 2 = 156 minutes to get to the bank and back home and then to the bank again. 
So they have <fact1>268 minutes</fact1> - 156 minutes = 112 minutes to get to the mall from the bank without being late.
The answer is {112}.",34.0,0,1,p2,632,975

Each day costs <fact2>€150 for hotel</fact2>, <fact3>€40 for food</fact3>, and <fact4>€10 for transportation</fact4>. Alejandro only has <fact5>€155</fact5>. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3>. Alejandro has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>an eighth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Alejandro still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day workshop</fact1> is <fact2>€150</fact2> * 3 = €450. The cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3> is <fact3>€40</fact3> * 3 = €120, but this is covered by Alejandro's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of the <fact4>transportation for the workshop</fact4> is <fact4>€10</fact4> * 3 = €30. Therefore, the total cost of the workshop is €450 + €30 = €480.

Alejandro has <fact5>€155</fact5>, so he still needs €480 - €155 = €325. However, the community center will cover <fact6>an eighth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>, which is €325 / 8 = €40.65. Therefore, Alejandro still needs €325 - €40.65 = €284.35.

Each day costs <fact2>¥250 for hotel</fact2>, <fact3>¥30 for food</fact3>, and <fact4>¥30 for transportation</fact4>. Kai only has <fact5>¥180</fact5>. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3>. Kai has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>. How much money is Kai still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the seminar. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>¥250</fact2> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥750. The cost of food is <fact3>¥30</fact3> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥90, but this is covered by Kai's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of transportation is <fact4>¥30</fact4> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥90. Therefore, the total cost of the seminar is ¥750 + ¥90 = ¥840. 

Kai has <fact5>¥180</fact5>, so he still needs ¥840 - ¥180 = ¥660. However, the youth club will cover <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is ¥660 * 1/6 = ¥110. Therefore, Kai still needs ¥660 - ¥110 = ¥550.
