Answer: First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. There are <fact2>7</fact2> remoras, each <fact2>72</fact2> inches long. To find the total length, we multiply the number of remoras by the length of each remora: <fact2>7</fact2> * <fact2>72</fact2> = <fact2>504</fact2> inches. Since we want the percentage of the whale's body length, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length of the remoras by 12: <fact2>504</fact2> / <fact5>12</fact5> = <fact2>42</fact2> feet. Now, we can find the percentage of the whale's body length that the remoras make up by dividing the length of the remoras by the length of the whale and multiplying by 100: (<fact2>42</fact2> / <fact1>210</fact1>) * <fact6>100</fact6> = <fact2>20</fact2>%.",20,1,1,p2,0,1049

Answer: To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by their length. The length of each remora is <fact2>66 inches</fact2>, and there are <fact2>8</fact2> of them. So the combined length of the remoras is <fact2>8</fact2> * <fact2>66</fact2> = 528 inches. To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot), giving us <fact2>528</fact2> / <fact3>12</fact3> = 44 feet. The whale is <fact1>440 feet</fact1> long, so the percentage of the whale's body length that the remoras make up is <fact4>44 feet</fact4> / <fact1>440 feet</fact1> * <fact3>100%</fact3> = 10%.

If the city is <fact2>60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the time it takes to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many 30-mile segments the city is divided into. This can be done by dividing the total distance across the city by the distance covered in each segment. The total distance across the city is <fact2>60 miles</fact2>, and the distance covered in each segment is <fact1>30 miles</fact1>. Therefore, the number of segments is <fact2>60 miles</fact2> / <fact1>30 miles</fact1> = 2 segments. Since it takes <fact1>68 minutes</fact1> to cover each segment, the total time to cover the whole city is <fact1>68 minutes</fact1> * <fact2>2 segments</fact2> = 136 minutes.",136,1,1,p2,90,956

If the city is <fact2>60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the time it takes to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many 15-mile sections are in the city.

Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling a 4-sided die. The possible outcomes are <fact1>1</fact1>, <fact2>2</fact2>, <fact3>3</fact3>, and <fact4>4</fact4>. Out of these outcomes, only <fact2>3</fact2> and <fact4>4</fact4> are greater than 2. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling two 4-sided dice. The possible outcomes are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4). Out of these outcomes, only (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3) are two odd numbers in a row. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2. This is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the probability of rolling a 3 or a 4. There are 4 possible outcomes when rolling a d4, and 2 of them are 3 or 4. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50% (see <fact1>d4 die</fact1>).
To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll and an odd number on the second roll. There are 4 possible outcomes when rolling a d4, and 2 of them are odd (1 and 3). So the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 2/4 = 0.5. Then, the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 2/4 = 0.5. So the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25% (see <fact1>d4 die</fact1>).
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we need to multiply by 100. So the difference in probability is 25% * 100/100 = 25%.

Answer: There are <fact2>1</fact2> number less than or equal to 1 and <fact4>19</fact4> numbers greater than 1 on a 20-sided die. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is <fact4>19</fact4>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.95. 
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are <fact3>10</fact3> odd numbers on a 20-sided die. So the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact3>10</fact3>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Noah is rolling a d6 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: A standard die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. Since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and a total of 6 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number twice. Since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and a total of 6 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number twice is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.
To convert the difference in probability to a percentage, multiply by 100. 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 6 on a 12-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 6 numbers greater than 6 (<fact4>7</fact4>, <fact4>8</fact4>, <fact4>9</fact4>, <fact4>10</fact4>, <fact4>11</fact4>, and <fact4>12</fact4>), the probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is <fact5>6/12</fact5> = 1/2 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is also the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 6 even numbers (<fact6>2</fact6>, <fact6>4</fact6>, <fact6>6</fact6>, <fact6>8</fact6>, <fact6>10</fact6>, and <fact6>12</fact6>), the probability of rolling an even number is <fact7>6/12</fact7> = 1/2 or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number, which is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 6: 50% - 25% = 25%.

Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 10-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is the number of outcomes where the number is greater than 1 divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 9 numbers greater than 1 on a 10-sided die, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 9/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.9.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. Since there are 5 even numbers on a 10-sided die, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 1 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.9 - 0.25 = 0.65. To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.65 * 100 = 65%.

Answer: There are <fact1>6</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of outcomes where this occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact1>3</fact1> outcomes where the number rolled is greater than 3, namely 4, 5, and 6.

Answer: First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 10. Since the die is fair, each number from 1 to 20 is equally likely to be rolled. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is the number of favorable outcomes (11 to 20) divided by the total number of outcomes (1 to 20). This is <fact4>10/20</fact4> = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, let's consider the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is <fact5>10/20</fact5> = 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each roll, which is <fact6>0.5*0.5</fact6> = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, let's calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 10 and rolling two odd numbers in a row. This is <fact7>0.5 - 0.25</fact7> = 0.25 or 25%. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us <fact8>25%</fact8>. Therefore, Santiago is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

Answer: There are <fact1>20 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a d20 die. To roll a number greater than 4, James must roll a number between 5 and 20, which means there are <fact1>20 - 5 + 1 = 16</fact1> possible outcomes. This makes the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 <fact1>16/20 = 4/5 = 0.8</fact1>. To roll two even numbers in a row, James must roll an even number on his first roll and then another even number on his second roll. There are <fact2>10 even numbers</fact2> between 1 and 20. This makes the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll <fact2>10/20 = 1/2</fact2>. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact2>1/2</fact2>. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact2>1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 = 0.25</fact2>. The difference in probability is <fact1>0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55</fact1>.

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a twenty-sided die, and <fact2>10</fact2> of them are greater than 10. Thus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is <fact2>10/20</fact2> = 1/2 = 50%.
There are <fact3>5</fact3> even numbers on a twenty-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20). Thus, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 1/2 = 50%.
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 1/2 = 50%.

Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 6, we need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. Since the die has 12 sides, there are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes. The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 6 are the numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, which is a total of <fact2>6</fact2> favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is <fact2>6</fact2>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. Since there are 6 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) out of the 12 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact3>6</fact3>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2 or 50%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to consider the possible outcomes of a d4 die roll. A d4 die has 4 faces, numbered 1 through 4. The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (4). This probability is 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%.

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the possible outcomes of two consecutive d4 die rolls. The probability of rolling an even number on a single d4 die roll is 2/4 = 1/2. Since the two rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

Answer: A twenty-sided die has 20 faces, numbered from 1 to 20. <fact1>There are 10 numbers greater than 10</fact1> on the die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
<fact2>There are 10 odd numbers</fact2> on the die, so the probability of rolling an odd number is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
To roll two odd numbers in a row, Pavel must roll an odd number on his first roll and then roll an odd number on his second roll. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 10 and rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.
Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Pavel rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

Answer: A ten-sided die has <fact1>10</fact1> sides. The numbers on a standard ten-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Of these numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are odd and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are even.
There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a ten-sided die.
There are <fact1>5</fact1> odd numbers on the die, and <fact1>5</fact1> even numbers.
Thus, the probability of rolling an odd number on a ten-sided die is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1> and the probability of rolling an even number is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1>.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number and then rolling another odd number. This probability is <fact1>1/2</fact1> * <fact1>1/2</fact1> = <fact1>1/4</fact1>.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the probability of rolling a number that is greater than 5, which is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1>.
To find the difference in probabilities, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5. This difference is <fact1>1/2</fact1> - <fact1>1/4</fact1> = <fact1>1/4</fact1>.
To convert this to a percentage, we need to multiply by 100. This is <fact1>1/4</fact1> * 100 = 25.
Therefore, Ravi is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than he is to roll two odd numbers in a row.

Answer: There are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 12-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>6</fact2> is the number of outcomes greater than <fact2>6</fact2> divided by the total number of outcomes, which is <fact2>6</fact2>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is the probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the second roll. There are <fact4>6</fact4> odd numbers on a 12-sided die, so the probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the first roll is <fact4>6</fact4>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2. The probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the second roll is also <fact4>6</fact4>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. There are <fact5>10</fact5> even numbers and <fact6>20</fact6> total numbers on the die, so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact5>10</fact5>/<fact6>20</fact6> = 1/2 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact5>10</fact5>/<fact6>20</fact6> = 1/2 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100, which gives us 25% * 100/100 = 25%.

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10) divided by the total number of outcomes (10). Since there are 9 favorable outcomes, the probability is 9/10. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (5 possibilities out of 10) multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (5 possibilities out of 10), which is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100. The difference between the two probabilities is (9/10) - (25/100) = (90/100) - (25/100) = 65/100. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: (65/100) * 100 = 65%.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Benjamin is rolling a four-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: A four-sided die has four possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since Benjamin is rolling the die, we need to consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 and the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row. 

Rolling a number greater than 2 can be done in two ways: rolling a 3 or a 4. There are two favorable outcomes (3 and 4) out of four possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>2/4</fact1> = 1/2 or 50%.

Rolling two odd numbers in a row can be done in two ways: rolling a 1 followed by a 3 or a 1 followed by a 1. However, since the die only has four sides, there is no possibility of rolling a 1 followed by a 1. Therefore, the only favorable outcome is rolling a 1 followed by a 3. There is one favorable outcome (1 followed by 3) out of four possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 50% - 25% = 25%.",25,1,1,p2,139,1318
2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Tariq is rolling a 10-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: Since the die is 10-sided, there are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling the die.
A number is greater than 5 if it is either 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. There are <fact1>5</fact1> possible outcomes that meet this condition.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is therefore <fact1>5</fact1>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll.
There are <fact2>5</fact2> even numbers on a 10-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact2>5</fact2>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5.
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact2>5</fact2>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is therefore <fact3>0.5</fact3> * <fact4>0.5</fact4> = 0.25.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 and rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact5>0.5</fact5> - <fact6>0.25</fact6> = 0.25.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: <fact7>0.25</fact7> * 100 = 25%.

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a twenty-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the number of outcomes where the number is greater than 5 divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact1>20</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> = 15 outcomes where the number is greater than 5. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 15/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.75.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are <fact3>10</fact3> odd numbers on a twenty-sided die. So the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 10/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is <fact1>3</fact1>/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll.

Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes. There are 8 numbers greater than 2 on a ten-sided die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>8/10</fact1> = 0.8. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll.

Answer: A d8 die has 8 sides, numbered 1 through 8. When rolling the die, Pavel has a <fact1>1/8</fact1> chance of rolling any specific number. To find the chance that he rolls a number greater than 4, we need to find the chance that he rolls a 5, 6, 7, or 8. There are 4 favorable outcomes, so the chance that he rolls a number greater than 4 is <fact2>4/8</fact2> = 1/2 or 50%. To find the chance that he rolls two odd numbers in a row, we need to find the chance that he rolls an odd number on the first roll and another odd number on the second roll. There are 4 odd numbers on the die, so the chance that he rolls an odd number on the first roll is <fact3>4/8</fact3> = 1/2. If he rolls an odd number on the first roll, there are 3 odd numbers remaining on the die, so the chance that he rolls an odd number on the second roll is <fact4>3/8</fact4>.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 4) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. There are <fact1>2 favorable outcomes</fact1> (rolling a 3 or a 4) out of <fact2>4 possible outcomes</fact2> (rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%.

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes (rolling an even number followed by another even number) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling a four-sided die. There are 4 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is the number of favorable outcomes (2, 3, and 4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 3/4.
To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling two four-sided dice. The possible outcomes for the first die are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The possible outcomes for the second die are also 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since the two dice are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is 4 * 4 = 16. The favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers in a row are 2, 2; 2, 4; 4, 2; and 4, 4. There are 4 favorable outcomes. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 4/16 = 1/4.
Now, we need to find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The difference is (3/4) - (1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2.
To express this as a percentage, we need to multiply by 100. So, the difference is (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

How many like to <fact4>paint</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>play video games</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to play music or basketball is <fact2>71</fact2> + <fact3>23</fact3> = 94.
Since there are <fact1>148</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to paint or play video games is 148 - 94 = 54.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play basketball as x. Then, the number of students who like to play video games is 2x (according to <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>).
The number of students who like to paint is the difference between the total number of students who like to paint or play video games and the number of students who like to play video games: 54 - 2x.
However, we know that the number of students who like to play basketball is x, and the number of students who like to play video games is 2x. We also know that the total number of students who like to paint or play video games is 54.
Therefore, the number of students who like to paint is 54 - 2x, and the number of students who like to play basketball is x.
We also know that the number of students who like to play basketball is 23 (<fact3>23 like to play basketball</fact3>), so we can set up the equation x = 23.
Now we can find the number of students who like to paint: 54 - 2x = 54 - 2(23) = 54 - 46 = 8.

Answer: In the first 30 seconds, <fact1>40</fact1> kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, <fact2>2</fact2> times that amount popped, so <fact2>2</fact2>*<fact1>40</fact1> = 80 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels increased to <fact3>4</fact3> times the initial popping rate, so <fact3>4</fact3>*<fact1>40</fact1> = 160 kernels popped. In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to <fact4>half the rate</fact4> of the past 30 seconds, so <fact4>half the rate</fact4> is <fact4>160/2</fact4> = 80 kernels popped. After Camila takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. This is <fact4>80/4</fact4> = 20 kernels. So in total, <fact1>40</fact1> + <fact2>80</fact2> + <fact3>160</fact3> + <fact4>80</fact4> + <fact4>20</fact4> = 380 kernels popped. The answer is {380}.",380,1,1,p2,208,1546

The kernels increase to <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3> in the next 18 seconds, but in the final 18 seconds, the popping slows down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact4>. After Carlos takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Carlos have to eat?

Answer: The initial popping rate was <fact1>60 kernels per 18 seconds</fact1>. In the second 18 seconds, this rate increased to <fact2>3 times that amount</fact2>, which is <fact2>3</fact2>*<fact1>60</fact1> = 180 kernels.
In the third 18 seconds, the rate increased to <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, which is <fact3>4</fact3>*<fact1>60</fact1> = 240 kernels.
In the final 18 seconds, the popping slowed down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact4>, which is <fact4>1/2</fact4>*<fact3>240</fact3> = 120 kernels.
Thus, the total number of kernels that popped in the 72 seconds of cooking is 60 + 180 + 240 + 120 = 600 kernels.
However, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. The number of kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds is <fact4>120</fact4> kernels, and a quarter of that is <fact4>120/4</fact4> = 30 kernels.
Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 600 + 30 = 630 kernels.

Answer: Let's use the ratio of sugar to water to set up an equation. The ratio is 135:21, which can be written as 135x:21x, where x is a common multiplier. Since the total amount of sugar and water is 468, we can set up the equation 135x + 21x = 468. Combining like terms, we get 156x = 468. Dividing both sides by 156, we get x = 3. Now that we know x, we can find the amount of sugar by multiplying 135 and x, which gives us 135 * 3 = 405. Therefore, Xena used 405 teaspoonfuls of sugar.",405,1,1,p2,252,744

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact4>S</fact4> and the number of cups of water as <fact5>W</fact5>. According to the given ratio, <fact6>S/W = 140/70</fact6>. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 70. This gives us <fact7>S/W = 2/1</fact7>. Since <fact8>S/W = 2/1</fact8>, we can say that for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there is 1 cup of water. Now, we are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 210. We can express this as <fact9>S + W = 210</fact9>. We can also express <fact10>W</fact10> in terms of <fact11>S</fact11> using the ratio <fact7>S/W = 2/1</fact7>.

Answer: Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar is <fact4>x</fact4> and the number of cups of water is <fact5>y</fact5>. According to the given ratio, we can set up the following equation: <fact1>155/x = 39/y</fact1>. Since we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 970, we can set up another equation: <fact2>x + y = 970</fact2>. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of x. First, we can cross-multiply the first equation to get: <fact3>155y = 39x</fact3>. Now, we can substitute <fact4>y = (39x/155)</fact4> into the second equation: <fact5>x + (39x/155) = 970</fact5>.

Answer: Let's start by using the ratio of sugar to water, which is <fact1>112:43</fact1>. We can let the number of teaspoons of sugar be <fact3>112x</fact3> and the number of cups of water be <fact4>43x</fact4>, where x is a constant. We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is <fact2>1240</fact2>, so we can set up the equation <fact3>112x + 43x = 1240</fact3>.

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact4>s</fact4> and the number of cups of water as <fact5>w</fact5>. According to the given ratio, we have <fact1>32:s = 18:w</fact1>. This means that for every 32 teaspoons of sugar, there are 18 cups of water. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us <fact2>16:s = 9:w</fact2>. Now, we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact3>900</fact3>. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 16:9, we can set up the following equation: <fact4>s + w = 900</fact4>. We can also express <fact5>w</fact5> in terms of <fact4>s</fact4> using the ratio: <fact6>w = (9/16)s</fact6>. Substituting this expression for <fact5>w</fact5> into the equation <fact4>s + w = 900</fact4>, we get <fact7>s + (9/16)s = 900</fact7>. Combining like terms, we have <fact8>(16/16 + 9/16)s = 900</fact8>, which simplifies to <fact9>(25/16)s = 900</fact9>. To solve for <fact4>s</fact4>, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of <fact10>(25/16)</fact10>, which is <fact11>(16/25)</fact11>. This gives us <fact12>s = 900 * (16/25)</fact12>.

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact4>S</fact4> and the number of cups of water as <fact5>W</fact5>. According to the ratio, we have <fact1>35</fact1> : <fact2>42</fact2> = <fact4>S</fact4> : <fact5>W</fact5>. This can be rewritten as <fact6>(35/42) = (S/W)</fact6>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is <fact2>616</fact2>, we have <fact7>S + W = 616</fact7>. Now we have two equations: <fact8>(35/42) = (S/W)</fact8> and <fact9>S + W = 616</fact9>. We can solve these equations to find the value of <fact4>S</fact4>. First, we can rewrite the first equation as <fact10>S = (35/42) * W</fact10>. Substituting this into the second equation, we get <fact11>(35/42) * W + W = 616</fact11>.

If she used a total of <fact4>1272 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact5>S</fact5> and the number of cups of water as <fact2>W</fact2>. We are given that the ratio of <fact5>S</fact5> to <fact2>W</fact2> is <fact3>196:16</fact3>, which can be expressed as <fact5>S/W = 196/16</fact5>. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. This gives us <fact5>S/W = 49/4</fact5>. 

We are also given that the total number of <fact5>S</fact5> and <fact2>W</fact2> is <fact4>1272</fact4>. We can express this as an equation: <fact5>S + W = 1272</fact5>. 

Now, we can substitute the expression for <fact5>S</fact5> from the ratio into the equation: <fact2>W * 49/4 + W = 1272</fact2>. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: <fact2>49W + 4W = 5088</fact2>. Combining like terms, we get <fact2>53W = 5088</fact2>. Dividing both sides by 53, we get <fact2>W = 96</fact2>.

If she used a total of <fact4>473 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact6>S</fact6> and the number of cups of water as <fact7>W</fact7>. We know that the ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> to <fact2>cups of water</fact2> is <fact3>38:5</fact3>, so we can write the equation <fact6>S/W = 38/5</fact6>. We are also given that the total number of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> and <fact2>cups of water</fact2> used is <fact4>473</fact4>, so we can write the equation <fact6>S + W = 473</fact6>. We can use these two equations to solve for <fact5>S</fact5>, the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> used. First, we can multiply both sides of the first equation by <fact7>W</fact7> to get <fact6>S = (38/5)W</fact6>. Then, we can substitute this expression for <fact6>S</fact6> into the second equation to get <fact7>(38/5)W + W = 473</fact7>. Combining like terms, we get <fact7>(43/5)W = 473</fact7>. Multiplying both sides by <fact8>5/43</fact8>, we get <fact7>W = 473 * (5/43) = 55</fact7>. Now that we know <fact7>W</fact7>, we can substitute this value back into the expression for <fact6>S</fact6> to get <fact6>S = (38/5)(55) = 418</fact6>. Therefore, Winnie used <fact5>418 teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5>.",418,1,1,p2,299,1523

Answer: Since <fact1>Oliver can harvest his kiwis every 6 months</fact1>, he can harvest his kiwis <fact3>2 times within a year</fact3> (because 12 months / 6 months = 2).
In total, <fact2>there are 45 kiwis per hectare</fact2> and <fact1>Oliver has 30 hectares of kiwi field</fact1>, so he has <fact2>45</fact2> * <fact1>30</fact1> = 1350 kiwis.

Answer: To find out how many watermelons Ravi can harvest within a year, we first need to find out how many watermelons he can harvest per hectare. We are given that <fact2>there are 67 watermelons per hectare</fact2>, so Ravi can harvest 67 watermelons per hectare. Since Ravi has <fact1>80 hectares of watermelon field</fact1>, he can harvest 80 * 67 = 5360 watermelons. However, we are also given that Ravi can harvest his watermelons every 2 months. Since there are 12 months in a year, Ravi can harvest his watermelons 12/2 = 6 times within a year. Therefore, Ravi can harvest 5360 * 6 = 32160 watermelons within a year.

Since <fact4>oats</fact4> are a rare treat, he only buys <fact5>five 3-kg boxes</fact5> of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough <fact3>cucumbers</fact3> to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact6>thirteen 6-kg bags</fact6>. <fact1>Apples</fact1> are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys <fact7>thirty one 42-kg packs</fact7>. <fact2>Wheats</fact2> are a staple to supplement the <fact1>apples</fact1>, so he buys <fact8> fifteen 15-kg sacks</fact8>. If his farm truck can carry <fact9>180 kgs at a time</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed. The total weight of <fact4>oats</fact4> is <fact5>5</fact5> * <fact5>3-kg</fact5> = 15 kg.
The total weight of <fact3>cucumbers</fact3> is <fact6>13</fact6> * <fact6>6-kg</fact6> = 78 kg.
The total weight of <fact1>apples</fact1> is <fact7>31</fact7> * <fact7>42-kg</fact7> = 1298 kg.
The total weight of <fact2>wheats</fact2> is <fact8>15</fact8> * <fact8>15-kg</fact8> = 225 kg.
The total weight of all the feed is 15 + 78 + 1298 + 225 = 1616 kg.
To find the number of trips, we need to divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 1616 / <fact9>180 kgs</fact9> = 8.98. Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make <fact10>9</fact10> trips to transport all the feed.

He only wants enough <fact7>beets to feed the sheep while the vegetables are fresh</fact7>, so he buys <fact8>15 9-pound bags</fact8>. <fact9>Corns are the main diet of his sheep</fact9>, so he buys <fact10>31 42-pound packs</fact10>. <fact11>Apples are a staple to supplement the corns</fact11>, so he buys <fact12>16 18-pound sacks</fact12>. If his farm truck can carry <fact13>160 pounds at a time</fact13>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed. The total weight of the <fact6>wheats</fact6> is <fact6>7</fact6> * <fact6>5</fact6> = 35 pounds. The total weight of the <fact8>beets</fact8> is <fact8>15</fact8> * <fact8>9</fact8> = 135 pounds. The total weight of the <fact10>corns</fact10> is <fact10>31</fact10> * <fact10>42</fact10> = 1302 pounds. The total weight of the <fact12>apples</fact12> is <fact12>16</fact12> * <fact12>18</fact12> = 288 pounds. The total weight of all the feed is 35 + 135 + 1302 + 288 = 1660 pounds. Since the farmer's truck can carry <fact13>160 pounds at a time</fact13>, he will need to make <fact13>1660/160</fact13> = 10.375 trips. Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make <fact13>11</fact13> trips to transport all the feed.",11,1,1,p2,387,1595

How many <fact10>bouncy balls</fact10> came in the tube?
Answer: To find the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube, we need to subtract the total number of toys that Mia already had from the total number of toys she has now. The total number of toys she already had is the sum of the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings. So, the total number of toys she already had is <fact3>70 blocks</fact3> + <fact5>46 stuffed animals</fact5> + <fact7>28 multicolored rings</fact7> = 144 toys. Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is <fact9>203</fact9> - <fact11>144</fact11> = 59 bouncy balls.

Answer: To find out how many ounces of water Kai has left, we need to first find out how many ounces of water he used to make the giant, medium, and small cubes. 

The <fact2>giant cubes</fact2> use <fact2>13 ounces per cube</fact2> and Kai made <fact5>8 giant cubes</fact5>. So, the total amount of water used for the giant cubes is <fact5>8</fact5> * <fact2>13</fact2> = 104 ounces.

The <fact3>medium cubes</fact3> use <fact3>12 ounces per cube</fact3> and Kai made <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7>. So, the total amount of water used for the medium cubes is <fact7>12</fact7> * <fact3>12</fact3> = 144 ounces.

If he makes <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5>, <fact6>14 small cubes</fact6>, and <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7>, how many grams of water does he have left?
Answer: First, let's find out how much water Gabriel used to make the giant cubes. The amount of water used for the giant cubes is <fact2>13 grams per cube</fact2> * <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5> = 117 grams.
Next, let's find out how much water Gabriel used to make the medium cubes. The amount of water used for the medium cubes is <fact3>12 grams per cube</fact3> * <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7> = 144 grams.
Finally, let's find out how much water Gabriel used to make the small cubes. The amount of water used for the small cubes is <fact4>2/4 of a gram</fact4> * <fact6>14 small cubes</fact6>. To simplify the fraction, <fact4>2/4 of a gram</fact4> can be rewritten as <fact8>1/2 of a gram</fact8>. The amount of water used for the small cubes is <fact8>1/2 of a gram</fact8> * <fact6>14 small cubes</fact6> = 7 grams.
Now, let's add up the amount of water used for each type of cube. The total amount of water used is 117 + 144 + 7 = 268 grams.
Since Gabriel started with 348 grams of water, the amount of water he has left is 348 - 268 = 80 grams.

The amount of water used for the <fact3>medium cubes</fact3> is <fact3>11 grams per cube</fact3> * <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7> = 132 grams.
The amount of water used for the <fact4>small cubes</fact4> is <fact4>1/5 of a gram per cube</fact4> * <fact6>15 small cubes</fact6> = 3 grams.
The total amount of water used is 117 + 132 + 3 = 252 grams.
Since Luis started with <fact1>330 grams of water</fact1>, he has 330 - 252 = 78 grams of water left.

Answer: Since each plate can hold <fact2>35 olives</fact2>, the total number of olives that can be placed on the <fact4>8 plates</fact4> is <fact2>35</fact2> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 280 olives.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of almonds that can be placed on all the tables. Since each table can hold <fact1>34 almonds</fact1> and there are <fact3>7 tables</fact3>, the total number of almonds that can be placed is <fact1>34</fact1> * <fact3>7</fact3> = 238 almonds.
Now, let's compare this to the total number of almonds that Bodhi has, which is <fact2>326 almonds</fact2>. Since he has more almonds than the tables can hold, he won't be able to place all of them on the tables.
The number of almonds that he won't be able to place is the difference between the total number of almonds he has and the total number of almonds that can be placed on the tables. This is <fact2>326</fact2> - <fact1>238</fact1> = 88 almonds.

Answer: First, let's find out how many bananas can be placed on the <fact4>7 baskets</fact4> in total. Since each basket can hold <fact2>21 bananas</fact2>, we can multiply the number of baskets by the number of bananas each basket can hold. So, the total number of bananas that can be placed on the 7 baskets is <fact4>7</fact4> * <fact2>21</fact2> = 147 bananas.
Since Ibrahim has <fact3>245 bananas</fact3> and the 7 baskets can only hold 147 bananas, he won't be able to place <fact3>245</fact3> - <fact4>147</fact4> = 98 bananas on the baskets.",98,1,1,p2,637,799

Answer: Esteban has <fact3>327</fact3> crackers in total. Each tray can hold <fact2>34</fact2> crackers. So, the total number of crackers that Esteban can place on the trays is <fact3>327</fact3> / <fact2>34</fact2> = 9.62. Since Esteban can't place a fraction of a cracker on a tray, he can place crackers on <fact4>8</fact4> trays, which is the number of trays he has. This means he can place crackers on 8 trays, which can hold a total of <fact2>34</fact2> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 272 crackers. Therefore, Esteban won't be able to place <fact3>327</fact3> - <fact5>272</fact5> = 55 crackers on the tray.",55,1,1,p2,638,849

Answer: Tariq can place <fact3>23 olives</fact3> on each plate. Therefore, he can place <fact3>23 olives</fact3> * <fact3>11 plates</fact3> = 253 olives on the plates. Since he has <fact2>256 olives</fact2> and can only place 253 on the plates, he won't be able to place <fact2>256 olives</fact2> - 253 olives = 3 olives on the plate.

Answer: To find the number of olives that James won't be able to place on the plate, we need to first find the total number of olives that he can place on the plates. We can do this by multiplying the number of plates by the number of olives each plate can hold: <fact3>11 plates</fact3> * <fact1>22 olives per plate</fact1> = 242 olives. Since James has <fact2>345 olives</fact2> and he can only place 242 olives on the plates, the number of olives that he won't be able to place on the plate is <fact2>345 olives</fact2> - 242 olives = 103 olives.",103,1,1,p2,642,775

Answer: To find out how many olives Gabriel won't be able to place on the plates, we need to first find out how many olives he can place on the plates. The number of olives he can place on the plates is the product of the number of plates and the number of olives each plate can hold.

Since Gabriel has <fact2>342</fact2> olives and he can only place <fact4>319</fact4> olives on the plates, the number of olives he won't be able to place on the plate is <fact2>342</fact2> - <fact4>319</fact4> = 23 olives.

On <fact5>Monday</fact5>, he sold <fact3>24 + 14 = 38</fact3> boxes of cookie and <fact8>28</fact8> boxes of apricot pie.
So, on <fact2>Sunday</fact2>, he earned <fact3>24</fact3> * <fact9>₣9</fact9> = ₣216 from cookie and <fact4>14</fact4> * <fact10>₣28</fact10> = ₣392 from apricot pie, for a total of ₣216 + ₣392 = ₣608.
On <fact5>Monday</fact5>, he earned <fact7>38</fact7> * <fact9>₣9</fact9> = ₣342 from cookie and <fact8>28</fact8> * <fact10>₣28</fact10> = ₣784 from apricot pie, for a total of ₣342 + ₣784 = ₣1126.
Therefore, Yuki earned a total of ₣608 + ₣1126 = ₣1734 for two days.

On <fact5>Friday</fact5>, he <fact6>sold 14 more boxes of cookies than on Thursday</fact6> and <fact7>23 boxes of apple pie</fact7>. If the <fact8>cookie cost $10</fact8> and the <fact9>apple pie cost $22</fact9>, how much did <fact10>Esteban earn for two days</fact10>?

Answer: On <fact2>Thursday</fact2>, Esteban sold <fact3>29 boxes of cookie</fact3>. On <fact5>Friday</fact5>, he sold <fact6>14 more boxes of cookies than on Thursday</fact6>, so he sold <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact6>14</fact6> = 43 boxes of cookie. In total, Esteban sold <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact6>43</fact6> = 72 boxes of cookie. On <fact2>Thursday</fact2>, Esteban sold <fact4>17 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Friday</fact4>, so he sold <fact7>23</fact7> - <fact4>17</fact4> = 6 boxes of apple pie on Thursday. On <fact5>Friday</fact5>, he sold <fact7>23 boxes of apple pie</fact7>. In total, Esteban sold <fact7>6</fact7> + <fact7>23</fact7> = 29 boxes of apple pie. The total number of boxes of cookie and apple pie sold is <fact3>72</fact3> + <fact7>29</fact7> = 101 boxes. Since each cookie costs <fact8>$10</fact8> and each apple pie costs <fact9>$22</fact9>, the total amount earned is <fact3>72</fact3> * <fact8>$10</fact8> + <fact7>29</fact7> * <fact9>$22</fact9> = $720 + $638 = $1358.

If the <fact5>cupcake cost €11</fact5> and the <fact6>apple pie cost €20</fact6>, how much did Oscar earn for two days?
Answer: We know that Oscar sold <fact1>11 fewer boxes of apple pie</fact1> on Tuesday than on Wednesday. Since he sold <fact4>23 boxes of apple pie</fact4> on Wednesday, he sold <fact2>23-11=12</fact2> boxes of apple pie on Tuesday.
We also know that Oscar sold <fact3>14 more boxes of cupcakes</fact3> on Wednesday than on Tuesday. Since he sold <fact1>22 boxes of cupcake</fact1> on Tuesday, he sold <fact4>22+14=36</fact4> boxes of cupcakes on Wednesday.
Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes of cupcakes and apple pies sold over the two days: <fact1>22+36=58</fact1> boxes of cupcakes and <fact2>12+23=35</fact2> boxes of apple pies.
We know that the <fact5>cupcake cost €11</fact5> and the <fact6>apple pie cost €20</fact6>. Therefore, the total amount of money earned from the cupcakes is <fact5>€11</fact5>*<fact1>58</fact1> = €638 and the total amount of money earned from the apple pies is <fact6>€20</fact6>*<fact2>35</fact2> = €700.

If the <fact5>brownie cost ₣7</fact5> and the <fact6>plum pie cost ₣23</fact6>, how much did Qasim earn for two days?
Answer: Let's start by figuring out how many boxes of brownies Qasim sold on Friday. Since he sold <fact3>12 more boxes of brownies than on Thursday</fact3> and <fact1>21 boxes of brownie on Thursday</fact1>, he sold 21 + 12 = 33 boxes of brownies on Friday.
Since Qasim sold <fact2>17 fewer boxes of plum pie, than on Friday</fact2> on Thursday, and <fact4>28 boxes of plum pie on Friday</fact4>, he sold 28 - 17 = 11 boxes of plum pie on Thursday.
Now we can calculate the total amount Qasim earned on Thursday. He sold 21 boxes of brownies at <fact5>₣7 each</fact5>, so he earned 21 * 7 = ₣147 from brownies on Thursday. He sold 11 boxes of plum pie at <fact6>₣23 each</fact6>, so he earned 11 * 23 = ₣253 from plum pie on Thursday. In total, Qasim earned ₣147 + ₣253 = ₣400 on Thursday.

He sold <fact4>12 fewer boxes of grape pie, than on Wednesday</fact4>. This means he sold <fact7>25 - 12 = 13 boxes of grape pie</fact7> on Tuesday. Therefore, he earned <fact7>13 boxes of grape pie</fact7> * <fact9>₺27 per box</fact9> = ₺351 for grape pies on Tuesday. 
So, on Tuesday, Diego earned ₺184 + ₺351 = ₺535 in total.

On the sidewalk, <fact4>Nadia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>26-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Nadia spends on the beach as t minutes. Since she walks at a constant speed on the beach, the distance she covers on the beach is directly proportional to the time she spends there. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, we can set up the equation 10 = kt, where k is Nadia's speed on the beach. We are given that t = 60 minutes, so we can solve for k: k = 10/60 = 1/6 km/min. Now, we can find Nadia's speed on the sidewalk. Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 4k = 4(1/6) = 2/3 km/min. The time she spends on the sidewalk is 26 - 10 = 16 kilometers / (2/3 km/min) = 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time Nadia takes to complete the entire 26-kilometer walk is 60 + 24 = 84 minutes.",84,1,1,p2,852,1292

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>32-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: We know that Valeria walks <fact2>15 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. Let's denote the speed of Valeria on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, the time she spends on the beach is <fact2>15/x</fact2> minutes. Since <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can write the equation <fact2>15/x</fact2> = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 15/60 = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Now, we know that Valeria walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2*0.25 = 0.5 kilometers per minute. The time she spends on the sidewalk is <fact3>17/0.5</fact3> = 34 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk is <fact5>60</fact5> + <fact3>34</fact3> = 94 minutes.",94,1,1,p2,856,1349

On the sidewalk, Sophia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>68 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>34-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Sophia spends on the beach as t1 and the time she spends on the sidewalk as t2. We know that t1 + t2 = 60 minutes (since the total time is 60 minutes), and t1 = 68 minutes. We can substitute t1 into the first equation to get 68 + t2 = 60, which implies t2 = -8 minutes. However, since time cannot be negative, we know that the previous equation is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the information. We know that Sophia walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. This means that she covers the same distance in half the time on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Therefore, the time she spends on the sidewalk is half the time she spends on the beach. Since t1 = 68 minutes, t2 = 68/2 = 34 minutes. Now we can find the total time by adding t1 and t2: 68 + 34 = 102 minutes.",102,1,1,p2,859,1319

If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed of Fatima on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute. Since Fatima walks 12 miles on the beach, it will take her 12/x minutes to walk on the beach. We know that this time is equal to 48 minutes, so we can write the equation: 12/x = 48. Solving for x, we get x = 12/48 = 1/4 miles per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes for Fatima to walk 13 miles on the sidewalk: 13/(2x) = 13/(2*(1/4)) = 13/0.5 = 26 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for Fatima to complete the entire 25-mile walk is 48 + 26 = 74 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Zahra walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>30-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Zahra walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, the speed at which she walks on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.
Since Zahra walks <fact2>15 miles of the beach</fact2> at a speed of x miles per minute, it takes her <fact2>15</fact2> / x minutes to walk on the beach. We are given that <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so we can set up the equation:
<fact2>15</fact2> / x = <fact5>60</fact5>
Solving for x, we get:
x = <fact2>15</fact2> / <fact5>60</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute.
Now, we know that Zahra walks on the sidewalk at a speed of 2x = 2(0.25) = 0.5 miles per minute. The distance she walks on the sidewalk is <fact3>15 miles</fact3>, so it takes her <fact3>15</fact3> / 0.5 = 30 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.
The total time it takes for Zahra to complete the entire 30-mile walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
<fact2>15</fact2> / x + <fact3>15</fact3> / 0.5
Substituting the value of x, we get:
<fact2>15</fact2> / 0.25 + <fact3>15</fact3> / 0.5

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Since Priya walks <fact2>10 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can determine her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>10/60</fact2> miles per minute. 
Since Priya walks at three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>3 * (10/60)</fact4> miles per minute = <fact4>3/6</fact4> miles per minute = <fact4>1/2</fact4> miles per minute. 
We can now calculate the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>13 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> by dividing the distance by her speed: <fact3>13 miles</fact3> / <fact4>1/2 miles per minute</fact4> = <fact3>13 * 2</fact3> minutes = <fact3>26 minutes</fact3>. 
Since Priya walks <fact1>23 miles every day</fact1> and we have already calculated that she spends <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> walking on the beach and <fact3>26 minutes</fact3> walking on the sidewalk, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-mile walk</fact1> is <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> + <fact3>26 minutes</fact3> = <fact6>86 minutes</fact6>.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Ananya walks on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x kilometers per minute.
The time it takes for Ananya to walk 11 kilometers on the beach is <fact2>11</fact2> / <fact4>x</fact4> minutes.
The time it takes for Ananya to walk 15 kilometers on the sidewalk is <fact3>15</fact3> / <fact4>2x</fact4> minutes.
We are given that the time spent walking on the beach is <fact5>44</fact5> minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
<fact2>11</fact2> / <fact4>x</fact4> = <fact5>44</fact5>
Solving for x, we get:
x = <fact2>11</fact2> / <fact5>44</fact5> = 0.25 kilometers per minute
Now, we can find the time it takes for Ananya to walk 15 kilometers on the sidewalk:
<fact3>15</fact3> / <fact4>2x</fact4> = <fact3>15</fact3> / <fact4>2(0.25)</fact4> = <fact3>15</fact3> / <fact4>0.5</fact4> = 30 minutes
The total time it takes for Ananya to complete the entire 26-kilometer walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk:

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>34-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Since Kimia walks <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and spends <fact5>60 minutes of her walk on the beach</fact5>, her rate of speed on the beach is <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>0.25 miles per minute</fact2> on the beach.
On the sidewalk, Kimia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach, which is <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact2>0.25 miles per minute</fact2> = <fact4>0.5 miles per minute</fact4> on the sidewalk.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Leilani walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, the speed at which she walks on the sidewalk is 3x miles per minute. We know that she spends 60 minutes on the beach, so she covers <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> in 60 minutes. This means that her speed on the beach is 15/60 = 0.25 miles per minute. Therefore, x = 0.25. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk 12 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 3x = 3*0.25 = 0.75 miles per minute. This is given by 12/0.75 = 16 minutes. The total time it takes for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach (60 minutes) and the time spent on the sidewalk (16 minutes), which is 60 + 16 = 76 minutes.",76,1,1,p2,882,1243

If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>29-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> of her walk, the rate at which Kimia walks on the beach is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>11/44</fact2> miles per minute.
Since <fact4>Kimia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the rate at which Kimia walks on the sidewalk is 2 * <fact2>11/44</fact2> = <fact7>22/44</fact7> miles per minute.
The time it takes for Kimia to walk <fact3>18 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> is <fact3>18 miles</fact3> / <fact7>22/44</fact7> miles per minute = <fact3>18 * 44 / 22</fact3> = 36 minutes.
The time it takes for Kimia to walk <fact2>11 miles on the beach</fact2> is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact2>11/44</fact2> miles per minute = 44 minutes.

If <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>34-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed of Zahra on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 3x miles per minute. Since Zahra walks <fact2>16 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> at a speed of x miles per minute, it will take her <fact2>16/x</fact2> minutes to walk on the beach. Since Zahra walks <fact3>18 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 3x miles per minute, it will take her <fact3>18/(3x)</fact3> = 6/x minutes to walk on the sidewalk. According to the question, <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so we can set up the equation: <fact2>16/x</fact2> = <fact5>64</fact5>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact2>16/64</fact2> = 0.25 miles per minute. Since Zahra's speed on the sidewalk is 3x = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 miles per minute, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is <fact3>18/(3x)</fact3> = 18/0.75 = 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes Zahra to complete the entire <fact6>34-mile walk</fact6> is <fact2>16/x</fact2> + <fact3>18/(3x)</fact3> = 64 + 24 = 88 minutes.",88,1,1,p2,886,1532

If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Tara walks on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, the speed at which she walks on the sidewalk is 3x kilometers per minute.
Since Tara walks <fact2>11 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> at a speed of x kilometers per minute, the time she spends on the beach is <fact2>11</fact2>/x minutes.
We are given that this time is equal to <fact5>66 minutes</fact5>, so we can write the equation:
11/x = 66
Solving for x, we get:
x = 11/66 ≈ 0.1667 kilometers per minute
Now, we can find the time it takes for Tara to walk on the sidewalk. Since she walks <fact3>14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 3x kilometers per minute, the time she spends on the sidewalk is <fact3>14</fact3>/3x minutes.
Substituting the value of x, we get:

On the sidewalk, Chen walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time Chen spends walking on the beach as <fact7>t minutes</fact7>. Since she walks at a constant speed, the distance she covers on the beach is directly proportional to the time she spends walking on the beach. Therefore, the distance she covers on the beach is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> = <fact7>t</fact7> * speed on the beach. Since we don't know the speed on the beach, we'll denote it as <fact8>s</fact8>. Therefore, we have <fact2>12 = ts</fact2>. We also know that Chen spends <fact5>48 minutes</fact5> on the beach, so we can substitute <fact7>t = 48</fact7> into the equation to get <fact2>12 = 48s</fact2>. Solving for <fact8>s</fact8>, we get <fact8>s = 12/48 = 0.25 miles per minute</fact8>.

Now, let's consider the sidewalk. Chen walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is <fact8>2s = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 miles per minute</fact8>. The time she spends walking on the sidewalk is <fact6>31 - 12 = 19 miles</fact6> / <fact8>0.5 miles per minute</fact8> = <fact9>38 minutes</fact9>. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-mile walk</fact6> is <fact7>t</fact7> + <fact9>38</fact9> = <fact5>48</fact5> + <fact9>38</fact9> = <fact10>86 minutes</fact10>.

Answer: Let's denote the time Elena spends on the beach as <fact5>66 minutes</fact5>. Since Elena walks <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact5>66 minutes</fact5> = <fact7>0.1667 miles per minute</fact7> (approximately). 
Since Elena walks on the sidewalk at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact7>0.1667 miles per minute</fact7> * 3 = <fact8>0.5 miles per minute</fact8> (approximately).

If <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>27-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Winnie walks <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can calculate her rate of speed on the beach as follows: <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>45 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>15/45</fact2> miles per minute. This is equal to <fact2>1/3</fact2> miles per minute.

Since Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2 * 1/3</fact4> = <fact4>2/3</fact4> miles per minute.

The total distance Winnie walks on the sidewalk is <fact3>12 miles</fact3>. Since she walks at a rate of <fact4>2/3</fact4> miles per minute, the time it takes her to walk the sidewalk is <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / <fact4>2/3 miles per minute</fact4> = <fact3>12 * 3/2</fact3> = <fact3>18</fact3> minutes.

If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>30-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's first find out Winnie's speed on the beach. Since she walks 13 miles on the beach in <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>, her speed on the beach is <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute.
Since Winnie walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 miles per minute.
The total time Winnie spends on the sidewalk is <fact3>17 miles</fact3> / <fact4>0.5 miles per minute</fact4> = 34 minutes.

Answer: To find the total amount Sanjay spent, we need to find the cost of the colored pencils, the cost of the pencils, and the cost of the rim of bond paper. We can then add these costs together to find the total amount spent. 

First, we find the cost of the colored pencils. <fact1>He bought 12 colored pencils</fact1> which cost <fact2>₣9.25 each</fact2>. So the cost of the colored pencils is <fact1>12</fact1> * <fact2>₣9.25</fact2> = <fact1>12 * 9.25</fact1> = <fact1>111</fact1>. 

Next, we find the cost of the pencils. <fact3>He bought 10 pencils</fact3> which cost <fact4>₣16.0 each</fact4>. So the cost of the pencils is <fact3>10</fact3> * <fact4>₣16.0</fact4> = <fact3>10 * 16.0</fact3> = <fact3>160</fact3>. 

Finally, we find the cost of the rim of bond paper. <fact5>He bought a rim of bond paper</fact5> which cost <fact6>₣14</fact6>. 

We can now add these costs together to find the total amount spent. <fact1>111</fact1> + <fact3>160</fact3> + <fact6>14</fact6> = <fact7>285</fact7>.

Therefore, the hours he watched on Tuesday is <fact8>28 hours</fact8> - 8 hours - 4.25 hours - 15 hours = 0.75 hours. Since each episode of the 15-minute show is 0.25 hours long, we can find the number of episodes he watched on Tuesday by dividing the total hours he watched on Tuesday by the length of each episode. Therefore, the number of 15-minute episodes he watched on Tuesday is <fact8>0.75 hours</fact8> / <fact5>0.25 hours</fact5> = 3 episodes.

If he watched <fact11>22 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>30-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact13>Thursday</fact13>?
Answer: Viktor watched <fact3>3 hours</fact3> of TV each night on <fact2>Tuesday</fact2> and <fact2>Wednesday</fact2>, so he watched a total of 2 * <fact3>3</fact3> = 6 hours on those nights. On <fact6>Friday</fact6>, he watched a <fact7>5-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>30-minute episode</fact8>. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the <fact8>30-minute episode</fact8> is equal to 0.5 hours. Therefore, he watched a total of <fact7>5</fact7> + 0.5 = 5.5 hours on <fact6>Friday</fact6>. On <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, he watched two <fact10>5-hour episodes</fact10>, so he watched a total of 2 * <fact10>5</fact10> = 10 hours on that night.

If he watched <fact5>18 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>45-minute episodes did he watch on Friday</fact6>?
Answer: Noah watched a 3-hour episode on <fact1>Wednesday</fact1> and <fact1>Thursday</fact1>. So he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV on these two days. 
On <fact3>Saturday</fact3>, he watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show. We need to convert the 15-minute show to hours, which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So he watched 4 + 0.25 = 4.25 hours of TV on Saturday. 
On <fact4>Sunday</fact4>, he watched two 2-hour episodes. So he watched 2 * 2 = 4 hours of TV on Sunday. 
Therefore, he watched 6 + 4.25 + 4 = 14.25 hours of TV on these three days. 
This means he watched <fact5>18</fact5> - <fact7>14.25</fact7> = 3.75 hours of TV on <fact2>Friday</fact2>. 
We know that he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show on Friday. Let's call the number of episodes x. 
Each episode is 45 minutes, which is 45/60 = 0.75 hours. 
So he watched x * 0.75 = 3.75 hours of TV on Friday. 
To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75. 
x = 3.75 / 0.75 = 5. 
Therefore, Noah watched 5 episodes of a 45-minute show on Friday.

If he watched <fact10>25 hours of TV in all</fact10>, how many <fact11>15-minute episodes</fact11> did he watch on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>?
Answer: First, we need to find the total amount of time Diego spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 4-hour episode each night, so he watched 2 * <fact2>4 hours</fact2> = 8 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 5-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60/45 = 4/3 hours in a 45-minute show. Therefore, he watched 5 + 4/3 = 19/3 hours on Thursday. On Friday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so he watched 2 * <fact9>5 hours</fact9> = 10 hours. Therefore, he watched 8 + 19/3 + 10 = 8 + 19/3 = 43/3 + 10 = 43/3 + 30/3 = 73/3 hours on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. We know that he watched 25 hours in all, so he must have watched 25 - 73/3 = 25 - 73/3 = (75 - 73)/3 = 2/3 hours on Wednesday. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 60/15 = 4 minutes in a 15-minute show. Therefore, he watched 2/3 * 60 = 40 minutes on Wednesday. Since each 15-minute show is 15 minutes long, he watched 40/15 = 8/3 = 2 and 2/3 15-minute shows on Wednesday.",5,1,1,p2,1073,1761

Answer: First, we need to find out how many hours James watched TV on Thursday and Friday. Since he watched a 4-hour episode each night, he watched <fact1>4</fact1> * 2 = 8 hours of TV on Thursday and Friday. On Sunday, he watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since 45 minutes is equal to 0.75 hours, he watched 4 + 0.75 = 4.75 hours of TV on Sunday. On Monday, he watched three 3-hour episodes, so he watched 3 * 3 = 9 hours of TV on Monday. So, in total, he watched 8 + 4.75 + 9 = 21.75 hours of TV on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday. Since he watched 23 hours of TV in all, he watched 23 - 21.75 = 1.25 hours of TV on Saturday.

Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Emma bought as x. Since her husband bought a package of 18 new spoons, the total number of spoons that Emma had after her husband gave her the new spoons is x + 18. After Emma used 10 spoons to sample her stuffed peppers, the total number of spoons she had left is x + 18 - 10 = x + 8. According to the information in the question, at this point, Emma had a total of 30 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 8 = 30 to solve for x. Solving for x, we get x = 30 - 8 = 22.

How many plates were in the package that <fact6>Beatriz bought</fact6>?
Answer: Let's call the number of plates in the package that Beatriz bought as <fact6>X</fact6>. Since her husband gave her a package of 5 new plates, the total number of plates Beatriz had before using any of them is <fact6>X</fact6> + 5. After using 8 plates, she had <fact6>X</fact6> + 5 - 8 = <fact6>X</fact6> - 3 plates left. We know that this number is equal to 24, so we can write the equation: <fact6>X</fact6> - 3 = 24.

Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Jasmine bought as x. We know that Jasmine's husband gave her a package of 17 new spoons, and she used 6 spoons to sample her vegetable lasagna. So, the total number of spoons that Jasmine had after her husband gave her the new package is x + 17. After she used 6 spoons, she had (x + 17) - 6 spoons left. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 28 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation (x + 17) - 6 = 28. Solving for x, we get x + 11 = 28, x = 17. However, this is the number of spoons Jasmine's husband gave her. We need to find the number of spoons in the package that Jasmine bought. Since Jasmine's husband gave her 17 spoons, the number of spoons in the package that Jasmine bought is 28 - 17 = 11.

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins Kayla needs, we need to calculate the total number of skeins for each item and then multiply by the number of grandchildren. For a hat, it takes <fact4>14 skeins</fact4> for each of the <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, so the total number of skeins for hats is <fact4>14</fact4> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 56 skeins.

Answer: To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total skeins needed for each item and then add them up. 
The total skeins needed for a vest is <fact8>6 skeins</fact8> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 18 skeins.
The total skeins needed for a cardigan is <fact9>11 skeins</fact9> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 33 skeins.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?
Answer: To determine how many skeins of wool Haruka needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of clothing and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren. 

For each grandchild, Haruka needs <fact4>18 skeins</fact4> for a tunic, <fact5>7 skeins</fact5> for a vest, <fact6>8 skeins</fact6> for a poncho, <fact7>3 skeins</fact7> for a pair of leg warmers, and <fact8>12 skeins</fact8> for a pair of booties. 

The total number of skeins required for each grandchild is <fact4>18</fact4> + <fact5>7</fact5> + <fact6>8</fact6> + <fact7>3</fact7> + <fact8>12</fact8> = 48 skeins.

Since Haruka has 4 grandchildren, she needs to multiply the total number of skeins required for each grandchild by 4. 

The total number of skeins Haruka needs to buy is <fact9>48 skeins</fact9> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 192 skeins.

So, she will need to make <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact3>1 sweater</fact3> = <fact1>4</fact1> sweaters.

How many <fact13>skeins of wool</fact13> will she need to buy?
Answer: To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to multiply the number of grandchildren by the number of items each one needs. Since they're quintuplets, they all need the same items. So, the total number of items needed is 5 * <fact3>1 cardigan</fact3> + 5 * <fact4>1 shawl</fact4> + 5 * <fact5>1 tunic</fact5> + 5 * <fact6>1 pair of mittens</fact6> + 5 * <fact7>1 pair of gloves</fact7>.

Answer: To determine how many ounces you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can find the total calories in the bag by multiplying the calories per serving by the number of servings: <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> * <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 2375 calories. 

Since you have already consumed <fact5>1350 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>2395</fact4> - <fact5>1350</fact5> = 1045 calories. 

To find out how many ounces you can eat, we can divide the remaining calories you need to consume by the calories per serving: <fact4>1045 calories</fact4> / <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 2.2 servings. 

Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can find the total ounces in the bag by dividing the total ounces by the number of servings: <fact2>275 ounces</fact2> / <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 55 ounces per serving.

Answer: First, let's find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving to get the total calories in the bag. This is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 2375 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>1775 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>1965</fact4> - <fact5>1775</fact5> = 190 calories.
Now, we know that the entire bag of cookies has 2375 calories. To find out how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we need to divide the remaining calories you need to consume by the calories per serving, and then multiply the result by the ounces per serving. Since we don't know the ounces per serving, we need to find the ounces per serving first. We can do this by dividing the total ounces in the bag by the number of servings. This is <fact2>100 oz</fact2> / <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 20 oz per serving.
Now that we know the ounces per serving, we can find out how many ounces of cookies you can eat by dividing the remaining calories you need to consume by the calories per serving, and then multiplying the result by the ounces per serving. This is <fact6>190 calories</fact6> / <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 0.4 servings, and 0.4 servings * 20 oz per serving = 8 oz.

Answer: To determine how many oz of cookies you can eat, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily calorie target. This can be calculated by subtracting the calories you have already consumed from your daily calorie target: <fact5>1925</fact5> - <fact6>1575</fact6> = <fact5>1925</fact5> - <fact6>1575</fact6> = 350 calories.
Since each serving of cookies has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, we can calculate how many servings you can eat by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: <fact5>350</fact5> / <fact1>175</fact1> = <fact5>350</fact5> / <fact1>175</fact1> = 2 servings.

Answer: First, let's find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>250 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>250</fact1> = 1250 calories.
We know that the bag has <fact2>150 oz</fact2> and we want to find out how many oz we can eat. To do this, we need to find out how many oz are in each serving. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, the total number of oz in the bag is <fact2>150 oz</fact2>. Therefore, the number of oz in each serving is <fact2>150 oz</fact2> / <fact3>5</fact3> = 30 oz per serving.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>1750 calories</fact5> and your daily calorie target is <fact4>2000</fact4>, you can consume <fact4>2000</fact4> - <fact5>1750</fact5> = 250 calories. We know that each serving has <fact1>250 calories</fact1>, so you can eat <fact6>1 serving</fact6> of cookies.
Since each serving is <fact7>30 oz</fact7>, you can eat <fact6>1 serving</fact6> = <fact7>30 oz</fact7> of cookies.

Out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>40% of the students are robotics club members or part of dancers</fact4>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are swimmers. To do this, we need to calculate <fact2>36%</fact2> of <fact1>125 students</fact1>. This can be done by multiplying <fact2>0.36</fact2> by <fact1>125</fact1>, which is <fact2>0.36</fact2> * <fact1>125</fact1> = <fact2>45</fact2> students. This means that there are <fact2>45</fact2> students who are swimmers.
Now, we need to find out how many students are not swimmers. This can be done by subtracting <fact2>45</fact2> from <fact1>125</fact1>, which is <fact1>125</fact1> - <fact2>45</fact2> = <fact3>80</fact3> students.

Finally, we need to find out how many students are leaving early. This can be done by adding the number of swimmers (<fact2>45</fact2>), the number of robotics club members or part of dancers (<fact5>32</fact5>), and assuming that the swimmers and the robotics club members or part of dancers are the only two groups that are leaving early. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is <fact2>45</fact2> + <fact5>32</fact5> = <fact6>77</fact6> students.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails Arash doesn't respond to in a day. Since <fact2>10% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, we can find this number by multiplying the total number of emails Arash receives in a day by <fact2>10%</fact2>. This is equivalent to multiplying <fact1>70</fact1> by <fact4>0.1</fact4>, which is <fact1>70</fact1> * <fact4>0.1</fact4> = <fact5>7</fact5> emails. Therefore, Arash doesn't respond to <fact5>7</fact5> emails in a day. Since Arash responds to the rest of the emails, we can find the number of emails Arash responds to in a day by subtracting the number of emails he doesn't respond to from the total number of emails he receives in a day.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails Kayla receives in a 6-day work week. Since Kayla receives <fact1>95 emails a day</fact1>, she receives 95 * 6 = 570 emails in a 6-day work week.
Next, we need to find out how many emails don't require any response. Since <fact2>20% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, we need to find 20% of 570. 20% is the same as 0.2, so we need to find 0.2 * 570. 0.2 * 570 = 114. Therefore, 114 emails don't require any response.
Since Kayla responds to the rest of the emails, we need to subtract 114 from 570. 570 - 114 = 456. Therefore, Kayla responds to 456 emails in a 6-day work week.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the number of occupied rooms. Since <fact2>1/4 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, we can find the number of occupied rooms by multiplying the total capacity by <fact2>1/4</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 450 occupied rooms. 
Since there are <fact1>1800</fact1> total rooms and <fact2>450</fact2> are occupied, the number of unoccupied rooms is <fact1>1800</fact1> - <fact2>450</fact2> = 1350.

Due to the pandemic, <fact3>80 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.
Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms in the care facility. The care facility has a capacity of <fact1>1900 rooms</fact1> and <fact2>2/5</fact2> of them are occupied. To find the number of occupied rooms, we can multiply the capacity by the fraction that is occupied: <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>2/5</fact2> = <fact2>760</fact2> rooms. 

Next, we need to find the number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility. We can subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total capacity: <fact1>1900</fact1> - <fact2>760</fact2> = <fact3>1140</fact3> rooms.

Since the question asks for the number of unoccupied rooms after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted into the care facility during this time. There are <fact3>80 patients</fact3> admitted each day, so in <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, the number of patients admitted is <fact3>80</fact3> * <fact5>14</fact5> = <fact6>1120</fact6> patients.

Due to the major accident, <fact3>25 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the medical center after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.
Answer: First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied in the medical center. Since <fact2>1/3 of the beds are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate the number of occupied beds by multiplying the total capacity of the medical center by <fact2>1/3</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>1500</fact1> * <fact2>1/3</fact2> = 500 occupied beds.
The total number of unoccupied beds is the difference between the total capacity of the medical center and the number of occupied beds. This is <fact1>1500</fact1> - <fact2>500</fact2> = 1000 unoccupied beds.
Since <fact3>25 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, we need to calculate how many patients are admitted in <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 * 4 = 28 days in 4 weeks. Therefore, the total number of patients admitted in 4 weeks is <fact3>25</fact3> * 28 = 700 patients.
Since the medical center starts with 1000 unoccupied beds, and 700 patients are admitted in 4 weeks, the number of unoccupied beds after 4 weeks is 1000 - 700 = 300 beds.

Answer: Since the hospital has a capacity of <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> and <fact2>1/9 occupied</fact2>, this means that <fact2>1/9</fact2> of the beds are occupied, so <fact2>8/9</fact2> of the beds are unoccupied. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>8/9</fact2> = 1600 beds.
Each week has 7 days, so after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, there are 4 * 7 = 28 days. In these 28 days, <fact3>30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, so the total number of patients admitted is 30 * 28 = 840.
Since there were initially <fact2>1/9 occupied</fact2> beds, the number of occupied beds is <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/9</fact2> = 200 beds.

Due to the pandemic, <fact3>40 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.
Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied beds in the care facility. The care facility has a capacity of <fact1>1500 beds</fact1> and is currently <fact2>1/6 occupied</fact2>. To find the number of occupied beds, we multiply the capacity by the fraction occupied: <fact1>1500</fact1> * <fact2>1/6</fact2> = <fact1>1500</fact1> / <fact2>6</fact2> = 250 beds.
Next, we need to find the total number of beds occupied after 4 weeks. Since <fact3>40 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>, we need to multiply the number of patients admitted per day by the number of days in 4 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 7 * 4 = 28 days in 4 weeks. The total number of patients admitted in 4 weeks is <fact3>40 patients/day</fact3> * <fact4>28 days</fact4> = 1120 patients.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many wards are occupied initially. Since <fact2>1/10</fact2> of the wards are occupied, this means <fact1>1700</fact1> * <fact2>1/10</fact2> = 170 wards are occupied initially. So, the number of unoccupied wards is <fact1>1700</fact1> - 170 = 1530 wards.

Since <fact3>70 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in 2 weeks.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many rooms are occupied in the care facility. Since <fact2>4/5 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate the number of occupied rooms by multiplying the total capacity by <fact2>4/5</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>4/5</fact2> = 1520 occupied rooms. 

To find the number of unoccupied rooms, we subtract the number of occupied rooms from the total capacity. This gives us <fact1>1900</fact1> - <fact2>1520</fact2> = 380 unoccupied rooms.

Now, we need to calculate the number of new patients admitted into the care facility over <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>. Since there are <fact3>25 patients admitted each day</fact3>, we can calculate the total number of patients admitted over 14 days (2 weeks) by multiplying the number of patients admitted per day by 14.

Since <fact3>25 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, the number of patients admitted in a week is <fact3>25</fact3> * 7 = 175 patients. Therefore, the number of patients admitted in <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> is <fact3>25</fact3> * 4 * 7 = 700 patients. 

Since there are already <fact5>160</fact5> occupied rooms, the number of occupied rooms after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> is <fact5>160</fact5> + 700 = 860 rooms. 

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms in the medical center after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> is <fact1>1600</fact1> - 860 = 740 rooms.",740,1,1,p2,1421,1170

Due to the major accident, <fact3>50 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the medical center after <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.
Answer: First, we need to find out how many wards are occupied at the beginning. Since <fact2>1/6</fact2> of the wards are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied wards by multiplying the total capacity by <fact2>1/6</fact2>. The number of occupied wards is <fact1>1500</fact1> * <fact2>1/6</fact2> = 250 wards.
The total number of unoccupied wards is the difference between the total capacity and the number of occupied wards, which is <fact1>1500</fact1> - <fact2>250</fact2> = 1250 wards.
Since <fact3>50 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 3 * 7 = 21 days in 3 weeks. The total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is <fact3>50</fact3> * 21 = 1050 patients.
The total number of occupied wards after 3 weeks is the sum of the initial occupied wards and the newly admitted patients, which is <fact2>250</fact2> + <fact3>1050</fact3> = 1300 wards.
The total number of unoccupied wards after 3 weeks is the difference between the total capacity and the total number of occupied wards, which is <fact1>1500</fact1> - <fact2>1300</fact2> = 200 wards.

Answer: Since <fact2>1/8</fact2> of the wards are occupied, the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1400</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 175 wards.
The number of unoccupied wards is <fact1>1400</fact1> - <fact2>175</fact2> = 1225 wards.
Since <fact3>30 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, the number of patients admitted in a week is <fact3>30</fact3> * 7 = 210 patients.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms in the clinic.

This gives us <fact1>1700</fact1> * <fact2>2/5</fact2> = <fact1>680</fact1> occupied rooms.

Next, we need to find the number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic. We can do this by subtracting the number of occupied rooms from the total number of rooms. This gives us <fact1>1700</fact1> - <fact1>680</fact1> = <fact1>1020</fact1> unoccupied rooms.

Since <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the clinic each day</fact3>, we need to find out how many patients are admitted in <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Since the clinic starts with <fact1>1020</fact1> unoccupied rooms, and <fact3>280 patients</fact3> are admitted into the clinic in 2 weeks, we need to subtract the number of patients admitted from the number of unoccupied rooms. However, since the patients are admitted into the clinic, they will occupy the rooms, so we need to subtract the number of patients from the number of unoccupied rooms.

Answer: There are <fact1>1800</fact1> beds in the hospital, but <fact2>1/4</fact2> of them are occupied. This means that <fact2>1/4</fact2> * <fact1>1800</fact1> = 450 beds are occupied. So, there are 1800 - 450 = 1350 unoccupied beds. 

Since 85 patients are admitted each day, the number of occupied beds will increase. To find the number of occupied beds after 2 weeks, we need to calculate the number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so there are 2 * 7 = 14 days in 2 weeks. In 14 days, <fact3>85 patients</fact3> are admitted into the hospital each day, so the total number of patients admitted is 85 * 14 = 1190 patients.

Due to the major accident, <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the medical center after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.
Answer: First, we need to find out how many rooms are occupied at the beginning. Since <fact2>1/4 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, the number of occupied rooms is <fact1>1000</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 250 rooms.
So, the number of unoccupied rooms at the beginning is <fact1>1000</fact1> - <fact2>250</fact2> = 750 rooms.
Since <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, in <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, <fact4>4</fact4> * <fact5>7</fact5> = 28 days will pass.
So, <fact3>20</fact3> * <fact6>28</fact6> = 560 patients will be admitted into the medical center.
Therefore, the total number of occupied rooms will be <fact2>250</fact2> + <fact3>560</fact3> = 810 rooms.
The number of unoccupied rooms will be <fact1>1000</fact1> - <fact3>810</fact3> = 190 rooms.

Answer: Since the clinic is <fact2>3/4 occupied</fact2>, it means that <fact2>3/4</fact2> * <fact1>1500</fact1> = 1125 rooms are occupied, and the remaining <fact1>1500</fact1> - <fact2>1125</fact2> = 375 rooms are unoccupied.

Answer: Since <fact2>1/5 of the beds are occupied</fact2>, the number of occupied beds is <fact1>1400</fact1> * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 280 beds.
The number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1400</fact1> - 280 = 1120 beds.
There are 7 days in a week, so <fact4>3 weeks</fact4> is 21 days.
In 21 days, <fact3>30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, so the total number of new patients is 30 * 21 = 630 patients.

If he also paid <fact7>$520000</fact7> for the <fact8>remaining loan amount</fact8> of the condo, how much is Mr. Williams's <fact9>net proceeds</fact9> from selling the condo?

Answer: The <fact2>transfer fees</fact2> amount to <fact3>4%</fact3> of the <fact4>selling price</fact4>, which is <fact1>$620000</fact1>. So, the transfer fees are <fact3>4%</fact3> * <fact1>$620000</fact1> = <fact3>4%</fact3> * <fact1>$620000</fact1> = 0.04 * <fact1>$620000</fact1> = <fact10>$24800</fact10>.
The <fact5>brokerage fee</fact5> is <fact6>3%</fact6> of the <fact4>selling price</fact4>, which is <fact1>$620000</fact1>. So, the brokerage fee is <fact6>3%</fact6> * <fact1>$620000</fact1> = <fact6>3%</fact6> * <fact1>$620000</fact1> = 0.03 * <fact1>$620000</fact1> = <fact11>$18600</fact11>.
The <fact9>net proceeds</fact9> from the sale of the condo is the <fact1>$620000</fact1> minus the <fact2>transfer fees</fact2> and the <fact5>brokerage fee</fact5>.

This means that Jamal still needs to cover <fact3>₺980</fact3> - <fact1>245</fact1> = <fact3>₺735</fact3> to cover the remaining cost of the science fair.
Since Jamal has <fact2>₺190</fact2>, he is missing <fact3>₺735</fact3> - <fact2>₺190</fact2> = <fact3>₺545</fact3> to cover the remaining cost of the science fair.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes the maintenance worker works each day. There are <fact4>16 hours</fact4> in a day, and each hour has <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>. Therefore, the maintenance worker works <fact4>16</fact4> * <fact5>60</fact5> = 960 minutes each day.
Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes the maintenance worker to clean all the rooms. It takes them <fact3>20 minutes per room</fact3> to clean one room, and there are <fact1>120 rooms</fact1> to clean. Therefore, it takes them <fact3>20</fact3> * <fact1>120</fact1> = 2400 minutes to clean all the rooms.
Since the maintenance worker has <fact2>5 days</fact2> to get it done, we need to find out how many minutes they have to clean the rooms each day. Therefore, they have <fact2>5</fact2> * 960 = 4800 minutes to clean the rooms.

It takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>. If they work <fact4>13 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer: The total number of minutes in a day is <fact4>13 hours</fact4> * 60 minutes per hour = 780 minutes.
The maintenance worker needs to clean <fact1>130 rooms</fact1> and it takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>, so they need to spend 130 * 15 = 1950 minutes cleaning rooms.
However, they only have <fact2>5 days</fact2> to do this, which is a total of 5 * 780 = 3900 minutes.
So, they will spend 1950 minutes cleaning rooms out of 3900 minutes available.

If they work <fact4>15 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer: First, let's find the total number of minutes the cleaner works per day. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so they work <fact4>15 hours</fact4> * 60 minutes per hour = 900 minutes per day.

Next, let's find the total number of minutes it takes to clean all the rooms. It takes them <fact3>10 minutes per room</fact3> to clean one room, and they have to clean <fact1>135 rooms</fact1>, so it takes them 10 * 135 = 1350 minutes to clean all the rooms.

Since they have <fact2>3 days</fact2> to clean the hospital, we can divide the total number of minutes it takes to clean all the rooms by 3 to find the number of minutes they have to clean per day. This is 1350 minutes / 3 = 450 minutes per day.

Now, we can find the percentage of their day that is spent cleaning rooms by dividing the number of minutes they spend cleaning per day by the total number of minutes they work per day, and then multiplying by 100. This is (450 minutes / 900 minutes) * 100 = 50%.

How much did everything cost?
Answer: To find the cost of the rice, we need to find out how many kilograms of rice Esteban bought. Since he uses <fact5>2 kg of rice per day</fact5> and he wants to buy a week's worth of rice, he will buy <fact4>7 days</fact4> * <fact5>2 kg/day</fact5> = 14 kg of rice. 

The normal brand of rice costs <fact2>₣20 per kg</fact2>, so it would cost <fact2>₣20</fact2> * <fact7>14 kg</fact7> = ₣280 for 14 kg of rice. However, since the normal brand was sold out, Esteban had to buy the more expensive brand. The more expensive brand costs <fact3>30% more</fact3> than the normal brand, which means it costs <fact2>₣20</fact2> + <fact2>₣20</fact2> * <fact3>30%</fact3> = ₣20 + ₣20 * 0.3 = ₣20 + ₣6 = ₣26 per kg.

Answer: Since <fact4>Theo decides to buy a week's worth of rice</fact4>, he needs to buy <fact4>7 days</fact4> * <fact4>2 kg/day</fact4> = 14 kg of rice.
The normal brand of rice costs <fact2>₺20 per kg</fact2>, so 14 kg of normal rice would cost <fact2>₺20 per kg</fact2> * 14 kg = <fact2>₺280</fact2>.

He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses <fact3>1 kg of rice per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a <fact4>bagel for ¥3</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. This brand costs <fact2>15%</fact2> more than the normal brand, which costs <fact1>¥20 per kg</fact1>. So, the more expensive brand costs <fact1>¥20</fact1> + <fact1>¥20</fact1> * <fact2>15%</fact2> = <fact1>¥20</fact1> + <fact1>¥20</fact1> * <fact2>0.15</fact2> = <fact1>¥20</fact1> + <fact1>¥3</fact1> = <fact1>¥23</fact1> per kg.
Since Luis buys a week's worth of rice and he uses <fact3>1 kg of rice per day</fact3>, he buys <fact3>1 kg</fact3> * <fact3>7 days</fact3> = <fact3>7 kg</fact3> of rice.

To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate <fact2>30% of ₺10</fact2> and add it to the cost of the normal brand. <fact2>30% of ₺10</fact2> is <fact2>0.3 * ₺10</fact2> = <fact2>₺3</fact2>. So, the more expensive brand of flour costs ₺10 + ₺3 = ₺13 per kilogram. Since Oscar needs a week's worth of flour, he needs to buy <fact3>1 kilogram of flour per day</fact3> * <fact3>7 days</fact3> = <fact3>7 kilograms</fact3> of flour. The cost of the flour is <fact3>7 kilograms</fact3> * <fact4>₺13 per kilogram</fact4> = ₺91. Oscar also bought a muffin for <fact4>₺4</fact4>. Therefore, the total cost is ₺91 + ₺4 = ₺95.

He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses <fact3>1 kilogram of tea per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for <fact4>€4</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: Since Benjamin uses <fact3>1 kilogram of tea per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of tea, he will need <fact3>1</fact3> * <fact5>7</fact5> = 7 kilograms of tea. The normal brand of tea costs <fact1>€20 per kilogram</fact1>, so 7 kilograms of normal tea would cost 7 * <fact1>€20</fact1> = €140. However, the more expensive brand of tea costs <fact2>10% more</fact2> than the normal brand, so the cost of the more expensive brand is 1.1 * <fact1>€20</fact1> = €22 per kilogram.

Answer: To find the cost of the rice, we first need to find the cost of the more expensive brand. The normal brand costs <fact2>€12 per kg</fact2>. Since the more expensive brand costs <fact3>25% more</fact3>, we need to find 25% of <fact2>€12</fact2> and add it to <fact2>€12</fact2>. 25% of <fact2>€12</fact2> is <fact3>25%</fact3> * <fact2>€12</fact2> = <fact3>25%</fact3> * <fact2>€12</fact2> = 0.25 * 12 = 3. So the more expensive brand costs <fact2>€12</fact2> + <fact3>€3</fact3> = <fact3>€15</fact3> per kg. Since Mohammed uses <fact4>1 kg of rice per day</fact4> and he buys a week's worth of rice, he buys <fact4>1 kg</fact4> * <fact4>7 days</fact4> = <fact4>7 kg</fact4> of rice. Therefore, the cost of the rice is <fact3>€15</fact3> * <fact4>7 kg</fact4> = <fact3>€105</fact3>. Finally, we need to add the cost of the muffin, which is <fact5>€3</fact5>.

Answer: Oliver buys a week's worth of sugar, which is <fact4>2 kg of sugar per day</fact4> * 7 days = 14 kg of sugar.
The normal brand of sugar costs <fact2>$20 per kg</fact2>, so the normal brand would cost 14 * <fact2>$20</fact2> = $280.

How much did everything cost?
Answer: To find out how much everything cost, we need to calculate the total cost of the flour and the muffin, and then add them together. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the flour. <fact4>He decides to buy a week's worth of flour</fact4>, so he will need <fact5>2 kilogram of flour per day</fact5> * 7 days = 14 kilogram of flour. The normal brand of flour costs <fact2>¥5 per kilogram</fact2>, so the total cost of the normal brand of flour would be 14 * <fact2>¥5</fact2> = ¥70. However, <fact3>he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more</fact3>, so the cost of the more expensive brand is <fact2>¥5</fact2> + <fact2>¥5</fact2> * <fact3>40%</fact3> = <fact2>¥5</fact2> + <fact2>¥5</fact2> * <fact3>0.4</fact3> = <fact2>¥5</fact2> + ¥2 = ¥7 per kilogram. Therefore, the total cost of the more expensive brand of flour is 14 * <fact3>¥7</fact3> = ¥98.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the muffin. <fact6>He also decided to buy himself a muffin for ¥3</fact6>.

Finally, let's add the cost of the flour and the muffin together. The total cost is ¥98 + ¥3 = ¥101.

He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses <fact4>2 kg of sugar per day</fact4>. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for <fact5>$3</fact5>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to find out how much the more expensive brand of sugar costs. We know that it costs <fact3>10% more</fact3> than the normal brand, which costs <fact2>$20 per kg</fact2>. So, the more expensive brand costs <fact2>$20</fact2> + <fact2>$20</fact2> * <fact3>10%</fact3> = <fact2>$20</fact2> + <fact2>$20</fact2> * <fact3>0.1</fact3> = <fact2>$20</fact2> + <fact6>$2</fact6> = <fact7>$22</fact7> per kg.

Since Esteban uses <fact4>2 kg of sugar per day</fact4> and he wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, he needs to buy <fact4>2 kg</fact4> * <fact8>7 days</fact8> = <fact9>14 kg</fact9> of sugar.

The normal brand of sugar costs <fact2>$20 per kg</fact2>, so it would cost <fact2>$20</fact2> * <fact9>14 kg</fact9> = <fact10>$280</fact10> for a week's worth of sugar.

The more expensive brand of sugar costs <fact7>$22 per kg</fact7>, so it would cost <fact7>$22</fact7> * <fact9>14 kg</fact9> = <fact11>$308</fact11> for a week's worth of sugar.

Esteban also decided to buy himself a cookie for <fact5>$3</fact5>. Therefore, the total cost of everything is <fact11>$308</fact11> + <fact5>$3</fact5> = <fact12>$311</fact12>.

How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to determine how much flour Liam bought. Since he uses 1 kilogram of flour per day and he buys a week's worth of flour, he bought <fact5>1 kilogram/day</fact5> * <fact6>7 days</fact6> = 7 kilograms of flour.
The normal brand of flour costs <fact2>₣5 per kilogram</fact2>, so the normal brand would have cost <fact2>₣5</fact2> * 7 = ₣35.
However, Liam had to buy the more expensive brand, which costs 20% more than the normal brand. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to find 20% of the cost of the normal brand and add it to the cost of the normal brand. 20% of <fact2>₣5</fact2> is <fact2>₣5</fact2> * <fact3>0.20</fact3> = ₣1. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs <fact2>₣5</fact2> + <fact3>₣1</fact3> = ₣6 per kilogram.
The more expensive brand costs ₣6 per kilogram, so Liam spent <fact3>₣6</fact3> * 7 = ₣42 on flour.
In addition to the flour, Liam also bought a muffin for <fact7>₣4</fact7>. Therefore, the total cost of everything Liam bought is <fact3>₣42</fact3> + <fact7>₣4</fact7> = ₣46.

He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses <fact3>2 kg of sugar per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for <fact4>€3</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to calculate how much the normal brand of sugar costs for a week. Luis uses <fact3>2 kg of sugar per day</fact3>, so he uses <fact3>2 kg/day</fact3> * 7 days = 14 kg of sugar for a week. The normal brand of sugar costs <fact1>€15 per kg</fact1>, so the normal brand of sugar costs 14 kg * <fact1>€15/kg</fact1> = €210 for a week. However, Luis had to buy the more expensive brand of sugar, which costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand. To calculate the price of the more expensive brand, we need to find 40% of <fact1>€15</fact1> and add it to <fact1>€15</fact1>. 40% of <fact1>€15</fact1> is 0.4 * <fact1>€15</fact1> = €6.

Since <fact4>he decides to buy a week's worth of flour</fact4> and <fact5>he uses 1 kilogram of flour per day</fact5>, he needs 7 kilograms of flour. Therefore, the cost of the flour will be <fact2>$27 per kilogram</fact2> * 7 kilograms = $189. In addition to the flour, <fact6>he also decided to buy himself a bagel for $3</fact6>.

Answer: <fact4>A week's worth of rice is 7 days</fact4>, and <fact5>he uses 2 kg of rice per day</fact5>, so he needs <fact4>7</fact4> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 14 kg of rice.

Answer: Since his favorite brand was sold out, Yuki had to buy a more expensive brand that costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand. This means the expensive brand costs ¥15 + (20% of ¥15) = ¥15 + ¥3 = ¥18 per kg.

Answer: <fact2>The normal brand of rice he buys costs ₺10 per kg</fact2>. <fact3>He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more</fact3>. To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we need to calculate 20% of <fact2>₺10</fact2> and add it to <fact2>₺10</fact2>. 20% of <fact2>₺10</fact2> is <fact2>₺10</fact2> * <fact4>20/100</fact4> = <fact2>₺2</fact2>. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs <fact2>₺10</fact2> + <fact5>₺2</fact5> = <fact6>₺12</fact6> per kg. <fact4>He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 1 kg of rice per day</fact4>. So he needs to buy <fact4>1 kg</fact4> * <fact7>7 days</fact7> = <fact8>7 kg</fact8> of rice. <fact3>The more expensive brand costs ₺12 per kg</fact3>, so the total cost of the rice is <fact8>7 kg</fact8> * <fact9>₺12/kg</fact9> = <fact10>₺84</fact10>. <fact5>He also decided to buy himself a muffin for ₺2</fact5>.

He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses <fact3>1 kilogram of tea per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for <fact4>₺4</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: Since Yusuf uses <fact3>1 kilogram of tea per day</fact3> and a week has <fact5>7</fact5> days, he needs <fact5>7</fact5> kilograms of tea. The normal brand of tea costs <fact1>₺10 per kilogram</fact1>, so it would cost <fact5>7</fact5> * <fact1>₺10</fact1> = <fact6>₺70</fact6> for a week's worth of normal tea.

He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses <fact4>2 kg of sugar per day</fact4>. He also decided to buy himself a <fact5>bagel for $3</fact5>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to find out how much the more expensive brand of sugar costs. To do this, we need to find 15% of the normal brand of sugar, which is <fact2>$20</fact2> * <fact3>15%</fact3> = <fact2>$20</fact2> * 0.15 = <fact2>$3</fact2>. This means that the more expensive brand of sugar costs <fact2>$20</fact2> + <fact2>$3</fact2> = <fact2>$23</fact2> per kg. Since Ravi uses <fact4>2 kg of sugar per day</fact4> and there are <fact6>7 days</fact6> in a week, he will need <fact4>2 kg</fact4> * <fact6>7 days</fact6> = <fact4>14 kg</fact4> of sugar.

How much did everything cost?
Answer: To find the cost of the rice, we first need to find the cost of the more expensive brand. This is a 20% increase on the normal brand, which costs <fact2>€15 per kg</fact2>. So the more expensive brand costs <fact2>€15</fact2> + <fact2>€15</fact2> * <fact3>20%</fact3> = <fact2>€15</fact2> + <fact2>€15</fact2> * <fact3>0.2</fact3> = <fact2>€15</fact2> + <fact2>€3</fact2> = <fact2>€18</fact2> per kg.
Since Xavier buys a week's worth of rice, and he uses <fact4>1 kg of rice per day</fact4>, he buys <fact4>1 kg</fact4> * <fact4>7 days</fact4> = <fact4>7 kg</fact4> of rice. This costs <fact3>€18 per kg</fact3> * <fact4>7 kg</fact4> = <fact3>€126</fact3>.

Answer: To find the cost of the flour, we first need to find out how many kilograms of flour Diego buys. Since he uses <fact3>2 kilogram of flour per day</fact3> and he buys a week's worth of flour, he buys <fact3>2 kilogram</fact3> * 7 days = 14 kilograms of flour.
The normal brand of flour costs <fact1>₺10 per kilogram</fact1>, so the normal brand of flour would cost 14 * <fact1>₺10</fact1> = ₺140. However, since the normal brand was sold out, he had to buy the more expensive brand, which costs <fact2>10% more</fact2> than the normal brand. The price increase is <fact2>10%</fact2> * <fact1>₺10</fact1> = ₺1. Therefore, the price of the more expensive brand is <fact1>₺10</fact1> + <fact2>₺1</fact2> = ₺11 per kilogram.

He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses <fact3>2 kg of rice per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a <fact4>bagel for $4</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: Pavel buys rice for <fact1>7 days</fact1>, so he needs <fact3>2 kg of rice per day</fact3> * <fact1>7 days</fact1> = 14 kg of rice.
The normal brand of rice costs <fact1>$15 per kg</fact1>, so Pavel would pay <fact1>$15 per kg</fact1> * 14 kg = $210 for the normal brand of rice.
However, the more expensive brand of rice costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand of rice, which means it costs <fact1>$15 per kg</fact1> + <fact1>$15 per kg</fact1> * <fact2>20% more</fact2> = $15 per kg + $15 per kg * 0.20 = $15 per kg + $3 per kg = $18 per kg.
So Pavel pays <fact4>$18 per kg</fact4> * 14 kg = $252 for the more expensive brand of rice.

Answer: To find the cost of the more expensive brand of rice, we need to calculate <fact3>15% more</fact3> than the normal brand. <fact2>The normal brand of rice he buys costs ₣20 per kg</fact2>, so 15% of 20 is 20 * 0.15 = 3.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. The normal brand of flour costs <fact1>₺4 per kilogram</fact1>, so the more expensive brand costs <fact1>₺4 per kilogram</fact1> + <fact2>25% of ₺4 per kilogram</fact2>. To calculate <fact2>25% of ₺4 per kilogram</fact2>, we can multiply <fact1>₺4 per kilogram</fact1> by <fact2>25%</fact2>, which is the same as multiplying <fact1>₺4 per kilogram</fact1> by <fact3>0.25</fact3>. So, the more expensive brand costs <fact1>₺4 per kilogram</fact1> + <fact1>₺4 per kilogram</fact1>*<fact3>0.25</fact3> = <fact1>₺4 per kilogram</fact1> + <fact4>₺1 per kilogram</fact4> = <fact5>₺5 per kilogram</fact5>.

How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to find out how much the more expensive brand of sugar costs. Since it costs 40% more than the normal brand, we can calculate this by multiplying the normal price by 1.4 (1 + 0.4). So, the more expensive brand costs <fact2>₣10</fact2> * 1.4 = <fact2>₣14</fact2> per kg.
Next, we need to find out how much sugar Faisal needs to buy for a week. Since he uses 1 kg of sugar per day, he will need <fact4>1 kg/day</fact4> * 7 days = 7 kg of sugar.
The cost of the more expensive brand of sugar for a week will be <fact3>₣14/kg</fact3> * 7 kg = <fact3>₣98</fact3>.

To calculate 25% of <fact1>$24</fact1>, we multiply <fact1>$24</fact1> by <fact5>0.25</fact5> (since 25% is the same as 0.25). This gives us <fact1>$24</fact1> * <fact5>0.25</fact5> = <fact6>$6</fact6>. Therefore, the more expensive brand costs <fact1>$24</fact1> + <fact6>$6</fact6> = <fact7>$30</fact7> per kilogram.
