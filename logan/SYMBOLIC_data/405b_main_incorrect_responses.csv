2,"Reformatted Question: Gabriel is rolling a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are 19 numbers greater than 1 on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 19/20. 
To roll <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, Gabriel must roll an odd number on the first roll (10/20 probability) and then roll an odd number on the second roll (10/20 probability). So the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4. 
The difference in probabilities is 19/20 - 1/4 = 16/20 = 4/5 = 0.8. 
Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.8 * 100% = 80%.

2,"Reformatted Question: Leon is rolling a <fact1>d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1>, we first note that there are 20 possible outcomes, and 19 of them are greater than 1. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 19/20.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>, we note that the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20, since half of the numbers on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> are even. The probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2> is then (10/20) * (10/20) = 1/4.

The difference in probabilities is (19/20) - (1/4) = 11/20. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (11/20) * 100 = 55%.

2,"Reformatted Question: Kai is rolling a <fact1>d4 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: A <fact1>d4 die</fact1> has 4 sides, numbered 1 through 4. There are 3 numbers greater than 2 on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 3/4. To roll <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>, the first roll must be even (probability 2/4 = 1/2) and the second roll must also be even (probability 1/2). The probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. The difference in probabilities is 3/4 - 1/4 = 1/2. Expressed as a percentage, this is 50%.

2,"Reformatted Question: Tariq is rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two <fact2>even numbers</fact2> in a row?

Answer: There are <fact1>4 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Two of these outcomes are <fact2>even numbers</fact2> (2 and 4), and two are odd numbers (1 and 3). Three of these outcomes are greater than 2 (3 and 4). 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is therefore 3/4 or 0.75, since there are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.

To roll two <fact2>even numbers</fact2> in a row, Tariq must roll an <fact2>even number</fact2> on the first roll (with a probability of 2/4 or 0.5), and then roll another <fact2>even number</fact2> on the second roll (also with a probability of 2/4 or 0.5). Since these two events are independent, the probability of rolling two <fact2>even numbers</fact2> in a row is (0.5) x (0.5) = 0.25.

The difference in probabilities is 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.5 x 100% = 50%.

Answer: Let's start by identifying the total number of parts in the ratio, which is <fact1>83 + 25 = 108</fact1>. Since Valentina used a <fact2>total of 1188 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used. 

Let x be the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar. We can set up the proportion: 
x / <fact2>1188</fact2> = <fact1>83</fact1> / <fact1>108</fact1>

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
x = (<fact2>1188</fact2> * <fact1>83</fact1>) / <fact1>108</fact1>
x = 918

Therefore, Valentina used 918 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

If Zahra is sure to get <fact3>25% of the chemistry questions</fact3>, and <fact4>1/6 of the biology and algebra questions</fact4> correctly, how many points is she sure to get?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of chemistry questions. Since <fact2>40% of the questions are chemistry</fact2>, we can calculate this as <fact2>0.4</fact2> * <fact1>110</fact1> = 44 chemistry questions. Zahra is sure to get <fact3>25% of the chemistry questions</fact3> correct, which is <fact3>0.25</fact3> * 44 = 11 chemistry questions correct.

The rest of the questions are equally divided as biology and algebra questions. Since there are <fact1>110</fact1> questions in total, and 44 are chemistry questions, there are <fact1>110</fact1> - 44 = 66 biology and algebra questions. Since they are equally divided, there are 66 / 2 = 33 biology questions and 33 algebra questions.

Zahra is sure to get <fact4>1/6 of the biology and algebra questions</fact4> correct. This means she will get <fact4>1/6</fact4> * 33 = 5.5 biology questions correct, and <fact4>1/6</fact4> * 33 = 5.5 algebra questions correct. Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we will round down to 5 correct questions for both biology and algebra.

If a <fact2>100 oz bag has 4 servings</fact2>, how many oz can you eat if your <fact3>daily calorie target is 2000</fact3> and you have already consumed <fact4>750 calories</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories you can still consume for the day. This is <fact3>2000</fact3> - <fact4>750</fact4> = 1250 calories. Since each serving has <fact1>250 calories</fact1>, you can eat 1250 / <fact1>250</fact1> = 5 servings. Since a <fact2>100 oz bag has 4 servings</fact2>, each serving is <fact2>100 oz</fact2> / 4 = 25 oz. Therefore, you can eat 5 servings * 25 oz per serving = 125 oz.

However, since the question asks how many oz you can eat and you can only eat a maximum of the bag's capacity, the answer is the minimum between the calculated amount (125 oz) and the bag's capacity (<fact2>100 oz</fact2>). Therefore, the answer is 100 oz.",125,0,1,p2,1225,983

Answer: To determine how long it will take Nia to peel 80 clams, we can divide the total number of clams by her peeling rate: 80 clams / <fact1>4 clams per minute</fact1> = 20 minutes. To determine how long it will take Nia to saute 80 clams, we can divide the total number of clams by her sauteing rate: 80 clams / (<fact2>20 clams in 6 minutes</fact2> = 20/6 = 3.33 clams per minute) = 80 / 3.33 = 24 minutes. So, the total time it will take Nia to peel and saute 80 clams is 20 + 24 = 44 minutes, but we can simplify this problem by finding the time it takes to saute and peel at the same time. We can find the time it takes to saute 80 clams which is 24 minutes, and then find how many clams Nia can peel in that time: <fact1>4 clams per minute</fact1> * 24 minutes = 96 clams. Since 96 > 80, we know that Nia will be done peeling the clams before she is done sauteing the clams. Therefore, the total time it will take Nia to <fact3>peel and saute 80 clams</fact3> is 24 minutes.

Answer: To determine how long it will take Mia to <fact3>peel and saute 100 shrimps</fact3>, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel 100 shrimps and the time it takes to saute 100 shrimps. 

Mia can <fact1>peel 5 shrimps a minute</fact1>, so to peel 100 shrimps, it will take her 100 / <fact1>5</fact1> = 20 minutes.

To saute 100 shrimps, we need to determine how many sets of <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2> are in 100 shrimps. 100 / <fact2>20</fact2> = 5 sets of <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2>. Since it takes <fact2>13 minutes</fact2> to saute <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2>, it will take 5 x <fact2>13 minutes</fact2> = 65 minutes to saute 100 shrimps.

However, Mia can saute and peel at the same time, so we can't simply add the times together. But we can peel the shrimps while we are waiting for other shrimps to saute, so the total time will be the time it takes to saute 100 shrimps, which is 65 minutes, and the time we spend peeling while we aren't sauteing. We spend 20 minutes peeling, but we can peel for 13 minutes while we are waiting for the first set of shrimps to saute, so we only have to add 20 - 13 = 7 minutes to the total time.

Therefore, the total time it will take Mia to <fact3>peel and saute 100 shrimps</fact3> is 65 + 7 = 72 minutes.

How many kgs of ore can <fact4>24 trolls with titanium pickaxes</fact4> mine in a <fact5>month with 29 days</fact5>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much ore a troll can mine with a nickel pickaxe. Since a troll can mine <fact2>two times as much with a nickel pickaxe</fact2> as with bare hands, and <fact1>a troll can mine 5 kgs of ore per day with bare hands</fact1>, then with a nickel pickaxe, a troll can mine 2 * <fact1>5 kgs</fact1> = 10 kgs of ore per day.

Next, we need to find out how much ore a troll can mine with a titanium pickaxe. Since a troll can mine <fact3>40% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a nickel pickaxe</fact3>, and a troll can mine 10 kgs of ore per day with a nickel pickaxe, then with a titanium pickaxe, a troll can mine 10 + (10 * 0.4) = 10 + 4 = 14 kgs of ore per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore <fact4>24 trolls with titanium pickaxes</fact4> can mine in a day. Since one troll can mine 14 kgs of ore per day with a titanium pickaxe, then 24 trolls can mine 24 * 14 = 336 kgs of ore per day.

Finally, we need to find out how much ore <fact4>24 trolls with titanium pickaxes</fact4> can mine in a <fact5>month with 29 days</fact5>. Since 24 trolls can mine 336 kgs of ore per day, then in 29 days, they can mine 336 * 29 = 9734 kgs of ore.

How many pounds of ore can <fact4>21 miners with steel pickaxes</fact4> mine in a <fact5>month with 29 days</fact5>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much ore a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe. Since he can mine <fact2>twice as much with a bronze pickaxe</fact2> as with a basic shovel, he can mine <fact1>5 pounds</fact1> * 2 = 10 pounds of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe.

Next, we need to find out how much ore a miner can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine <fact3>40% more with a steel pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe</fact3>, he can mine 10 pounds * 1.4 = 14 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we need to find out how much ore <fact4>21 miners with steel pickaxes</fact4> can mine in a day. Since each miner can mine 14 pounds of ore per day, <fact4>21 miners</fact4> can mine 14 pounds * 21 = 294 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, we need to find out how much ore <fact4>21 miners with steel pickaxes</fact4> can mine in a <fact5>month with 29 days</fact5>. Since they can mine 294 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 294 pounds * <fact5>29 days</fact5> = 8536 pounds of ore in a month.

How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Answer: Leon is now penpals with <fact1>8 people</fact1> - <fact2>4 of them</fact2> = 4 people. Since each of them sends <fact3>4 letters a week</fact3> and he responds in kind, he writes 4 * <fact3>4 letters a week</fact3> * 2 (for him and the other person) = 32 letters a week. Each letter is <fact4>9 pages long</fact4>, so he writes 32 * <fact4>9 pages long</fact4> = 288 pages a week. Since he can write a <fact5>page every 10 minutes</fact5>, he spends 288 * <fact5>10 minutes</fact5> = 2880 minutes a week writing.

Answer: Ravi finished <fact1>4/5 of a 395 piece puzzle</fact1>, which is (4/5) * 395 = 316 pieces. Then he finished a <fact2>521 piece puzzle</fact2>. So in total, he placed 316 + 521 = 837 pieces.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the party. We know that there were <fact1>67 artists</fact1> and <fact2>32 doctors</fact2>, so the total number of people is <fact1>67</fact1> + <fact2>32</fact2> = 99.

Since <fact3>1/3 of the total number of people left</fact3>, the number of people who left is 99 * <fact3>1/3</fact3> = 33.

We are given that <fact4>30 artists stayed at the party</fact4>, so the number of artists who left is <fact1>67</fact1> - <fact4>30</fact4> = 37.

However, we know that a total of 33 people left, and 37 artists left is not possible since it exceeds the total number of people who left. This means that all 33 people who left cannot be artists, and some must be doctors.

Since 37 artists left is not possible, we know that 33 people left, and 37 - 33 = 4 of those ""extra"" artists did not actually leave. Instead, 4 doctors left.

So, the number of doctors who left is 4, and the number of doctors who stayed is <fact2>32</fact2> - 4 = 28.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the celebration. This is the sum of the number of nurses and doctors: <fact1>66 nurses</fact1> + <fact2>42 doctors</fact2> = 108 people. 
Then, we need to find out how many people left after <fact3>45 minutes</fact3>. Since <fact4>1/9 of the total number of people left</fact4>, the number of people who left is (1/9) * 108 = 12. 
We also know that <fact5>33 nurses stayed</fact5> at the celebration. This means that the number of nurses who left is <fact1>66 nurses</fact1> - <fact5>33 nurses</fact5> = 33. 
Since the total number of people who left is 12, the number of doctors who left is 12 - 33 (nurses who left, but we know 33 is too many, so we know some doctors must have stayed, so we know 33 is not the number of nurses who left, but we do know 33 nurses stayed) + x (number of nurses who left) = 12,  x = 12 - (33 - 33), x = 12, x = 12 - 33 + 33, x is the number of nurses who left, we know 33 nurses stayed so we know 66 - 33 = 33 nurses left, so we know x = 33, so we know 12 - 33 + x = 12 - 33 + 33, so we know 12 = 12, so we know 0 doctors left, so we know 12 people left, all nurses, so we know 33 nurses left, so we know 0 doctors left, so we know all doctors stayed, so we know the answer is 42 doctors, so we know there are 42 doctors left, so we know the answer is 42.

The total cost of laser tag will be <fact5>€6 per person</fact5> * number of people, where the number of people is Keisha plus the number of friends she invites.
The total cost of the party must be less than or equal to <fact1>€180</fact1>.
So, the equation for the total cost is: €6 * number of people + €32 + €7 ≤ €180.
Simplifying the equation gives: €6 * number of people ≤ €141.
Dividing both sides by €6 gives: number of people ≤ 23.5.
Since Keisha must be one of the people, the number of friends she can invite is 23.5 - 1 = 22.5.
Since she can't invite a fraction of a person, she can invite 22 friends.

The bumper cars cost <fact6>₣11 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Tara's aunt has <fact1>₣190</fact1> to spend on the party. Tara wants to ride the bumper cars <fact4>eight times</fact4> at <fact6>₣11 per ride</fact6>, which will cost 8 * <fact6>11</fact6> = ₣88. She also wants <fact3>₣3 in game room tokens</fact3>, so that's an additional <fact3>₣3</fact3>. This leaves <fact1>₣190</fact1> - ₣88 - <fact3>₣3</fact3> = ₣99 for bowling. Since <fact5>a round of bowling is ₣4</fact5>, Tara can afford ₣99 / <fact5>₣4</fact5> = 24.75 rounds of bowling. Since Tara wants to play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> with her friends, and she can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 24 friends (not including herself).

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>₣9 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster two times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of laser tag is ₣9</fact5>. <fact6>The roller coaster cost ₣7 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Ava's mom has budgeted <fact1>₣160</fact1> for the party. Ava wants to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2> with her friends, which costs <fact5>₣9</fact5> per person. She also wants to ride <fact4>the roller coaster two times</fact4>, which costs <fact6>₣7</fact6> per ride, so 2 x <fact6>₣7</fact6> = ₣14 per person. Additionally, she wants <fact3>₣9 in pinball tokens</fact3>, but this is a fixed cost and does not depend on the number of friends. Let's denote the number of friends Ava can invite as x. Then, the total cost of the party will be (<fact5>₣9</fact5> + 2 x <fact6>₣7</fact6>) x (x + 1) + <fact3>₣9</fact3>, since Ava will also participate in the activities. This expression should be less than or equal to <fact1>₣160</fact1>. We can set up the inequality and solve for x.

Let's calculate: 
(₣9 + ₣14) x (x + 1) + ₣9 ≤ ₣160
₣23 x (x + 1) + ₣9 ≤ ₣160
₣23x + ₣23 + ₣9 ≤ ₣160
₣23x + ₣32 ≤ ₣160
₣23x ≤ ₣128
x ≤ ₣128 / ₣23
x ≤ 5.57

Since Ava can't invite a fraction of a friend, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Ava can invite 5 friends.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2>, have <fact3>₺8 in game room tokens</fact3>, and get to ride the bumper cars <fact4>nine times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of bowling is ₺8</fact5>. The bumper cars cost <fact6>₺6 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Amelia wants to do. The cost of <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> for Amelia and her friends is <fact5>₺8</fact5> per person. The cost of the bumper cars is <fact6>₺6 a ride</fact6>, and they want to ride <fact4>nine times</fact4>, so the total cost of the bumper cars is <fact6>₺6</fact6> * <fact4>9</fact4> = ₺54. Additionally, Amelia wants <fact3>₺8 in game room tokens</fact3> for each person. Let's denote the number of friends Amelia can invite as x. Then, the total cost of the activities is (<fact5>₺8</fact5> + <fact3>₺8</fact3>) * (x + 1) + <fact6>₺54</fact6>. This total cost should not exceed <fact1>₺210</fact1>. We can set up the inequality (<fact5>₺8</fact5> + <fact3>₺8</fact3>) * (x + 1) + <fact6>₺54</fact6> ≤ <fact1>₺210</fact1> and solve for x. 

We have: 
(₺8 + ₺8) * (x + 1) + ₺54 ≤ ₺210
₺16 * (x + 1) + ₺54 ≤ ₺210
₺16x + ₺16 + ₺54 ≤ ₺210
₺16x + ₺70 ≤ ₺210
₺16x ≤ ₺140
x ≤ ₺140 / ₺16
x ≤ 8.75

Since x must be an integer (Amelia can't invite a fraction of a friend), the maximum number of friends Amelia can invite is 8.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>₣5 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster eight times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of laser tag is ₣4</fact5>. <fact6>The roller coaster cost ₣12 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: The total cost of the roller coaster rides will be <fact6>₣12 per ride</fact6> * 8 rides = ₣96. 
The cost of pinball tokens is <fact3>₣5</fact3>. 
The cost of laser tag for Mei is <fact5>₣4</fact5>. 
The remaining budget for her friends' laser tag is <fact1>₣210</fact1> - ₣96 - <fact3>₣5</fact3> - <fact5>₣4</fact5> = ₣105. 
The number of friends Mei can invite is ₣105 / <fact5>₣4</fact5> = 26.25, which we round down to 26.
However, since Mei also plays a round of laser tag, we need to include her in the total number of people playing laser tag. 
So the number of friends Mei can invite is 26.

96,"Reformatted Question: Kayla's dad said that she had <fact1>$130 budgeted for her birthday party</fact1>. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2>, have <fact3>$8 in game room tokens</fact3>, and get to ride the <fact4>bumper cars five times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of bowling is $7</fact5>. The <fact6>bumper cars cost $10 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities that Kayla wants to do. The cost of <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> for Kayla and her friends will be <fact5>$7</fact5> times the number of friends plus one (for Kayla). The cost of the <fact4>bumper cars five times</fact4> will be <fact6>$10</fact6> times 5, which is $50. Additionally, Kayla wants <fact3>$8 in game room tokens</fact3> for each of her friends and herself.

Let's denote the number of friends as x. Then the total cost of the activities will be <fact5>$7</fact5> * (x + 1) + $50 + <fact3>$8</fact3> * (x + 1).

We know that the total cost cannot exceed <fact1>$130</fact1>. So we can set up the inequality: <fact5>$7</fact5> * (x + 1) + $50 + <fact3>$8</fact3> * (x + 1) ≤ <fact1>$130</fact1>.

Simplifying the inequality, we get: 7x + 7 + 50 + 8x + 8 ≤ 130.

Combine like terms: 15x + 65 ≤ 130.

Subtract 65 from both sides: 15x ≤ 65.

Divide both sides by 15: x ≤ 4.33.

Since x must be an integer (you can't invite a fraction of a friend), the maximum number of friends Kayla can invite is 4.

The <fact6>bumper cars cost $12 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Elena wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2>, which costs <fact5>$8</fact5> per person, have <fact3>$3 in game room tokens</fact3> per person, and get to ride the <fact4>bumper cars seven times</fact4>, which costs <fact6>$12</fact6> * 7 = $84 total. The cost per person for bowling and game room tokens is <fact5>$8</fact5> + <fact3>$3</fact3> = $11. Let x be the number of friends Elena invites. Then the total cost for the party is $11 * (x + 1) + $84. This total must be less than or equal to <fact1>$190</fact1>. So $11 * (x + 1) + $84 ≤ <fact1>$190</fact1>. Subtracting $84 from both sides gives $11 * (x + 1) ≤ $106. Dividing both sides by $11 gives x + 1 ≤ 9.66. Since x must be an integer, x + 1 ≤ 9. So x ≤ 8. Therefore, Elena can invite up to 8 friends.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2>, have <fact3>$6 in game room tokens</fact3>, and get to ride the <fact4>bumper cars six times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of bowling is $6</fact5>. The <fact6>bumper cars cost $13 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Nadia wants to do. The cost of <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> for Nadia and her friends is <fact5>$6</fact5> per person. The cost of the <fact4>bumper cars six times</fact4> is <fact6>$13</fact6> per ride, so the total cost is 6 x <fact6>$13</fact6> = $78. Additionally, Nadia wants to give each of her friends <fact3>$6 in game room tokens</fact3>, which is <fact3>$6</fact3> per person. Let's denote the number of friends Nadia can invite as x. Then, the total cost of the activities is (<fact5>$6</fact5> + <fact3>$6</fact3>) x (x + 1) + $78, since Nadia also participates in the activities. This total cost should not exceed <fact1>$180</fact1>. So, we can set up the inequality: (<fact5>$6</fact5> + <fact3>$6</fact3>) x (x + 1) + $78 ≤ <fact1>$180</fact1>. Solving this inequality, we get 12x^2 + 12x - 102 ≤ 0. Dividing both sides by 6, we get 2x^2 + 2x - 17 ≤ 0. Using the quadratic formula, we find that x is between -3.5 and 2.5. Since x must be a non-negative integer, the maximum number of friends Nadia can invite is 2.

Answer: On the first day, the <fact1>8 people</fact1> who are initially infected will infect <fact1>8</fact1> * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 32 people. So, at the end of the first day, there will be <fact1>8</fact1> + 32 = 40 people infected. On the second day, these 40 people will infect 40 * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 160 people. So, at the end of the second day, there will be 40 + 160 = 200 people infected. On the third day, these 200 people will infect 200 * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 800 people. So, at the end of the third day, there will be 200 + 800 = 1000 people infected. On the fourth day, these 1000 people will infect 1000 * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 4000 people. So, at the end of the <fact3>4 days</fact3>, there will be 1000 + 4000 = 5000 people infected, but we also need to add the <fact1>8 people</fact1> initially infected to the 40 people infected at the end of the first day, which were already included in the 1000 people, to correctly calculate the infected people after 4 days, we only need to add the 8 to the 40 which were already included.
