Then, a <fact4>third of the remoras swam away</fact4>. Later, Luis saw another <fact5>10-foot dolphin</fact5> with <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches long</fact7>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total length of remoras on the first dolphin.  Initially, there were <fact2>24 remoras</fact2>, each <fact3>18 inches long</fact3>, totaling 24 * 18 = 432 inches.  After a <fact4>third swam away</fact4>, 24/3 = 8 remoras left, representing a total length of 8 * 18 = 144 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the 144 inches is equivalent to 144/12 = 12 feet.

The percentage of the <fact1>48-foot dolphin's</fact1> body length covered by remoras is (12 feet / 48 feet) * 100% = 25%.

Next, let's consider the second dolphin. It had <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches long</fact7>, totaling 6 * 8 = 48 inches.  This is equivalent to 48/12 = 4 feet.

The percentage of the <fact5>10-foot dolphin's</fact5> body length covered by remoras is (4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 40%) / 2 = 32.5%.

Therefore, on average, 32.5% of each dolphin's body length is covered by remoras.  The answer is {32.5}.

2,"Reformatted Question: Tariq is rolling a <fact1>four-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he <fact2>rolls a number greater than 2 twice in a row</fact2>, than that he <fact3>rolls four even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer:  A four-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Let's analyze the probabilities:

* **Fact 2: Rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:** The numbers greater than 2 on the <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> are 3 and 4.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2 = 50%. The probability of this happening twice in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25% or 0.25.

* **Fact 3: Rolling four even numbers in a row:** The only even number on the <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> is 2.  Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number (a 2) on a single roll is 1/4 = 25%. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/256 ≈ 0.39% or 0.0039.

To find the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:

25% - 0.39% = 24.61%

Therefore, Tariq is 24.61 percentage points more likely to roll a number greater than 2 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.

The answer is {24.61}.

7,"Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of hay, wheat, carrots and apples.  He buys <fact1>five 7-pound boxes of apples</fact1>. He buys <fact2>fourteen 5-pound bags of carrots</fact2>. He buys <fact3>thirty-five 44-pound packs of hay</fact3>. He buys <fact4>nineteen 15-pound sacks of wheat</fact4>. Finally, he buys <fact5>43 pounds of groceries</fact5>, <fact6>27 pounds of tools</fact6>, and <fact7>100 pounds of wood</fact7>. A farm truck can carry <fact8>100 pounds at a time</fact8>. If the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each item:

* **Apples:** <fact1>5 boxes * 7 pounds/box = 35 pounds</fact1>
* **Carrots:** <fact2>14 bags * 5 pounds/bag = 70 pounds</fact2>
* **Hay:** <fact3>35 packs * 44 pounds/pack = 1540 pounds</fact3>
* **Wheat:** <fact4>19 sacks * 15 pounds/sack = 285 pounds</fact4>
* **Groceries:** <fact5>43 pounds</fact5>
* **Tools:** <fact6>27 pounds</fact6>
* **Wood:** <fact7>100 pounds</fact7>

Now, let's find the total weight of all the items: 35 + 70 + 1540 + 285 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 2100 pounds

Since each truck can carry <fact8>100 pounds</fact8>, the total number of trips needed with one truck would be 2100 pounds / 100 pounds/trip = 21 trips.

However, the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, so the number of trips per truck is 21 trips / 3 trucks = 7 trips per truck.

Therefore, the farmer needs a total of 21 trips to transport all the purchased items.  Each of the three trucks will make 7 trips.
The answer is {21}.

12,"Reformatted Question: Benjamin places crackers on bowls and plates. Each bowl can hold <fact1>21 crackers</fact1> while each plate can hold two times that. Benjamin has <fact2>720 crackers</fact2>, <fact3>9 bowls</fact3> and <fact4>3 plates</fact4>. Unfortunately, <fact5>2 plates break</fact5>. Benjamin then eats <fact6>one-eighth of all the crackers</fact6>. How many more bowls does Benjamin need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, let's determine the capacity of each plate.  Since each plate holds twice the number of crackers as a bowl (<fact1>21 crackers per bowl</fact1>), each plate can hold 21 * 2 = 42 crackers.

Next, calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates before the breakage.  Benjamin has <fact3>9 bowls</fact3>, each holding <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, for a total of 9 * 21 = 189 crackers. He initially has <fact4>3 plates</fact4>, each holding 42 crackers, for a total of 3 * 42 = 126 crackers.  Combined, the bowls and plates could hold 189 + 126 = 315 crackers.

After <fact5>2 plates break</fact5>, the total capacity is reduced by 2 * 42 = 84 crackers. The new capacity is 315 - 84 = 231 crackers.

Benjamin starts with <fact2>720 crackers</fact2> and eats <fact6>one-eighth</fact6> of them, which is 720 / 8 = 90 crackers.  This leaves him with 720 - 90 = 630 crackers.

To determine how many more bowls are needed, we find out how many bowls would be required to hold all 630 remaining crackers.  Each bowl holds <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, so the number of bowls needed is 630 / 21 = 30 bowls.

Finally, subtract the number of bowls Benjamin already has (<fact3>9 bowls</fact3>) from the number of bowls needed (30 bowls): 30 - 9 = 21.  Therefore, Benjamin needs 21 more bowls.

The answer is {21}.

It takes them <fact2>24 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the gym is. It takes them another <fact3>27 minutes</fact3> to get to the mall. When they reach the mall, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the mall again. Once they reach the mall for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the grocery store without being late?

Answer:  The total time it takes to initially reach the mall is the sum of the time to reach the gym and the time to reach the mall from the gym: <fact2>24 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>27 minutes</fact3> = 51 minutes.

Returning home from the mall and then going back to the mall takes twice the initial travel time to the mall: 51 minutes * 2 = 102 minutes.

The total time spent going to the mall, returning home, and then returning to the mall is 102 minutes.

The time remaining after these trips is the initial time allotted minus the time spent: <fact1>261 minutes</fact1> - 102 minutes = 159 minutes.

Therefore, they have 159 minutes remaining to reach the grocery store.  The question asks how much *longer* they have; this is already accounted for in the 159 minutes.

It takes them <fact2>21 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the bank is. It takes them another <fact3>28 minutes</fact3> to get to the cinema. When they reach the cinema, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the cinema again. Once they reach the cinema for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the gym without being late?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total time it takes to get to the cinema the first time.  This is the time to the bank (<fact2>21 minutes</fact2>) plus the time from the bank to the cinema (<fact3>28 minutes</fact3>), which equals 21 + 28 = 49 minutes.

The return trip from the cinema to home takes the same amount of time as the trip from home to the cinema, so that is another 49 minutes.  

Therefore, the total time spent going to the cinema, returning home, and then going back to the cinema a second time is 49 + 49 = 98 minutes.

Subtracting this time from the total time available (<fact1>163 minutes</fact1>), we find the remaining time: 163 - 98 = 65 minutes.  This is how much time they have left to get to the gym.

Therefore, they have 65 minutes to get to the gym without being late.

When they reach the mall, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the mall again. Once they reach the mall for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the grocery store without being late?

Answer:  The total time it takes to initially reach the mall is the time to the library plus the time from the library to the mall: <fact2>16 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>29 minutes</fact3> = 45 minutes.

Returning home from the mall and then going back to the mall takes twice the initial journey time to the mall: 45 minutes * 2 = 90 minutes.

The total time spent going to the mall, returning home, and then going back to the mall is 90 minutes.

The time remaining before they are late is the total time minus the time spent going to and from the mall: <fact1>163 minutes</fact1> - 90 minutes = 73 minutes.

Therefore, they have 73 minutes left to get to the grocery store.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Emma's speed has decreased by half <fact5>both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>32-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Emma walks 14 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 56 minutes.  Therefore, her speed on the beach *before* her injury was (14 kilometers / 56 minutes) = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or 0.25/2 = 0.125 kilometers per minute.

Emma walks 18 kilometers on the sidewalk. Before her injury, she walked three times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach (<fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4>), meaning her sidewalk speed was 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 kilometers per minute.  After her injury, her sidewalk speed is halved (<fact5>speed has decreased by half</fact5>), so it's now 0.75/2 = 0.375 kilometers per minute.


It takes her 18 kilometers / 0.375 kilometers/minute = 48 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

Therefore, her total walking time is the time spent on the beach plus the time spent on the sidewalk: 56 minutes + 48 minutes = 104 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half <fact5>both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Olivia walks 13 miles on the beach and it takes her 65 minutes.  Therefore, her speed on the beach before her injury was 13 miles / 65 minutes = 0.2 miles/minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that,  0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles/minute <fact5>(speed decreased by half on the beach)</fact5>.

Since she walks at four times the speed on the sidewalk as on the beach <fact4>(four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk)</fact4>, her sidewalk speed before the injury was 4 * 0.2 miles/minute = 0.8 miles/minute. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is half that: 0.8 miles/minute / 2 = 0.4 miles/minute <fact5>(speed decreased by half on the sidewalk)</fact5>.

Now we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk.  Olivia walks 16 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.4 miles/minute. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 0.4 miles/minute = 40 minutes.

Finally, to find the total time for the walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 65 minutes (beach) + 40 minutes (sidewalk) = 105 minutes.

If <fact5>42 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Rania walks <fact2>14 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and it takes her <fact5>42 minutes</fact5>.  This means her speed on the beach, before her injury, would have been 14 km / 42 min = 1/3 km/min. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or (1/3)/2 = 1/6 km/min.  Therefore, her current walking time on the beach remains 42 minutes.

Rania walks <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Before her injury, her speed on the sidewalk was <fact4>twice her beach speed</fact4>, so it would have been 2 * (1/3 km/min) = 2/3 km/min.  After her injury, her sidewalk speed is half of that, or (2/3)/2 = 1/3 km/min.

To find her current sidewalk walking time, we divide the distance by her reduced speed: 14 km / (1/3 km/min) = 42 minutes.

Therefore, her total walking time is the sum of her beach and sidewalk times: 42 minutes (beach) + 42 minutes (sidewalk) = 84 minutes.

If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Before her injury, her sidewalk speed was <fact4>twice her beach speed</fact4>, or 2s. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now s/2, and her speed on the sidewalk is now 2s/2 = s.

We know she spends <fact5>51 minutes on the beach</fact5> and covers <fact2>17 miles</fact2>. Therefore, her current beach speed is 17 miles / 51 minutes = 1/3 mile per minute.

Since her sidewalk speed is the same as her original speed on the beach, her current sidewalk speed is also 1/3 mile per minute.  The time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance on the sidewalk (<fact3>16 miles</fact3>) divided by her sidewalk speed (1/3 mile/minute), which is 16 miles / (1/3 mile/minute) = 48 minutes.

To find the total walking time, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 51 minutes (beach) + 48 minutes (sidewalk) = 99 minutes.

* Crayons: <fact1>8 crayons * ¥7.0/crayon = ¥56</fact1>
* Notebooks: <fact2>8 notebooks * ¥13.75/notebook = ¥110</fact2>
* Bond paper: <fact3>¥10</fact3>
* Folders: <fact4>4 folders * ¥11/folder = ¥44</fact4>

Total cost before discount: ¥56 + ¥110 + ¥10 + ¥44 = ¥220

Now let's calculate the cost with each discount option:

If he watched <fact7>28 hours</fact7> of TV in all, how many <fact2>30-minute</fact2> episodes did he watch on Friday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Wednesday to Monday excluding Friday:

* **Wednesday:** 4 hours
* **Thursday:** 4 hours
* **Saturday:** 5 hours + (15 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 5.25 hours
* **Sunday:** 4 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 12 hours
* **Monday:** 3 episodes * (45 minutes/episode / 60 minutes/hour) = 2.25 hours

Total time (excluding Friday): 4 + 4 + 5.25 + 12 + 2.25 = 27.5 hours

Now, subtract this from the total TV time for the week (<fact7>28 hours</fact7>): 28 hours - 27.5 hours = 0.5 hours.

This 0.5 hours is the time spent watching the 30-minute show on Friday.  Since each episode is <fact2>30 minutes</fact2> (or 0.5 hours), Faisal watched 0.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 1 episode on Friday. The answer is {1}.

If he watched <fact12>28 hours of TV in all</fact12>, how many <fact4>30-minute episodes</fact4> did he watch on <fact3>Monday</fact3>?

Answer: Let's calculate the total TV time from the information given, excluding Monday:

* **Saturday and Sunday:** 2 days * 2 episodes/day * 5 hours/episode = 20 hours
* **Tuesday:** 4 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours
* **Wednesday:** 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours
* **Thursday:** 5 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 2.5 hours

Total TV time (excluding Monday): 20 + 5 + 9 + 2.5 = 36.5 hours.  This is incorrect; the question states he watched 28 hours total.

Let's recalculate, considering the total TV time is 28 hours:

Total time on Saturday and Sunday:  2 days * 2 episodes/day * 5 hours/episode = 20 hours.
Total time on Tuesday: 4 hours + 1 hour = 5 hours
Total time on Wednesday: 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours
Total time on Thursday: 5 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 2.5 hours

There's an error in the problem statement.  He watched 28 hours of TV, but the time spent watching TV on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday totals to 36.5 hours, which is impossible given the constraints of the problem.  The problem needs correction.  We can't accurately determine how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Monday without a consistent total TV time.

On <fact4>Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 4-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Sunday, he watched two episodes, each 15 minutes</fact5>. If he watched <fact6>31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on <fact2>Thursday</fact2>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Tuesday through Sunday, excluding Thursday's 30-minute episodes:

* **Tuesday and Wednesday:**  <fact1>He watched two 5-hour episodes each night, so 2 nights * 2 episodes/night * 5 hours/episode = 20 hours</fact1>.
* **Friday:** <fact3>He watched one 5-hour episode and one 30-minute episode, totaling 5.5 hours</fact3>.
* **Saturday:** <fact4>He watched three 4-hour episodes, totaling 12 hours</fact4>.
* **Sunday:** <fact5>He watched two 15-minute episodes, totaling 0.5 hours</fact5>.

Adding these together: 20 hours + 5.5 hours + 12 hours + 0.5 hours = 38 hours.

This total (38 hours) is how much TV Thiago watched *excluding* his Thursday viewing. Since <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 38 hours - 31 hours = 7 hours less than the calculated total. This 7-hour difference represents the time he spent watching Thursday's 30-minute shows.  To find out how many 30-minute episodes this is, we simply convert the hours to minutes (7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes) and divide by the length of each episode (420 minutes / 30 minutes/episode = 14 episodes).

Therefore, he watched 14 episodes of the 30-minute show on Thursday.  The answer is {14}.

If he watched <fact13>26 hours of TV in all</fact13>, how many <fact4>45-minute episodes</fact4> did he watch on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>?

Answer: Let's calculate the total TV time from the information provided, excluding Tuesday:

* **Sunday and Monday:** 2 days * 2 episodes/day * 4 hours/episode = 16 hours
* **Wednesday:** 2 hours + 15 minutes = 2.25 hours
* **Thursday:** 5 episodes * 2 hours/episode = 10 hours
* **Friday:** 4 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 2 hours

Total time from Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday: 16 + 2.25 + 10 + 2 = 30.25 hours.  This is more than the total time reported. There seems to be an error in the question's premise because Arash watched 26 hours of TV according to the prompt, which is impossible given that time from other days totals to 30.25 hours.  We will proceed assuming the provided total viewing time (26 hours) is correct and that there is an error in the information about other viewing times. 

Let x be the number of 45-minute episodes watched on Tuesday.  The total time spent watching TV on Tuesday is (45/60)x hours or 0.75x hours.

The total time watched (excluding Tuesday) is: 16 hours (Sunday/Monday) + 2.25 hours (Wednesday) + 10 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 30.25 hours.

However, the problem states the total viewing time was 26 hours. This implies there's an error in the given data, possibly in the times for the other days. Because we cannot resolve the discrepancy, we cannot find a valid answer for the number of 45-minute episodes watched on Tuesday.  The problem needs correction to provide a consistent and solvable scenario.

She wants to make a shawl, hat, cardigan, leg warmers, and socks for each of them. It takes <fact2>5 skeins of wool to make a shawl</fact2>, <fact3>3 for a hat</fact3>, <fact4>12 for a cardigan</fact4>, <fact5>11 for a pair of leg warmers</fact5>, and <fact6>15 for a pair of socks</fact6>. Uma wants to make <fact7>two warm jackets for herself</fact7>, each needing <fact8>10 skeins of wool</fact8>. <fact9>Each dozen skeins of wool costs $9</fact9>. The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Uma pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the wool needed for each grandchild.  Each grandchild requires: <fact2>5 (shawl)</fact2> + <fact3>3 (hat)</fact3> + <fact4>12 (cardigan)</fact4> + <fact5>11 (leg warmers)</fact5> + <fact6>15 (socks)</fact6> = 46 skeins. Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total for the grandchildren is 46 skeins/grandchild * <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1> = 184 skeins.

Next, calculate the wool needed for Uma's jackets. She needs <fact8>10 skeins/jacket</fact8> * <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> = 20 skeins.

The total number of skeins Uma needs is 184 + 20 = 204 skeins.

To find the cost, we need to determine how many dozens of skeins she needs: 204 skeins / 12 skeins/dozen = 17 dozens.

At <fact9>$9 per dozen</fact9>, the total cost before the discount would be 17 dozens * $9/dozen = $153.

Since $153 is not over $100, the <fact10>$20 discount</fact10> does not apply.  Therefore, Uma should pay $153 for all the skeins of wool she needs.

The answer is {153}.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact9>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact9>. How much should Roya pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the wool needed for each grandchild.  Each grandchild requires 5 + 3 + 8 + 10 + 14 = 40 skeins of wool  (<fact2>, <fact3>, <fact4>, <fact5>, <fact6>). Since Roya has <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs a total of 40 skeins/grandchild * 5 grandchildren = 200 skeins for her grandchildren.  She also needs 8 skeins/jacket * 2 jackets = 16 skeins for her own jackets (<fact7>).  Therefore, Roya needs a total of 200 + 16 = 216 skeins of wool.

Next, let's determine the cost.  Since each <fact8>dozen (12) skeins costs $8</fact8>, the cost per skein is $8/12 = $0.67 (approximately). The total cost for 216 skeins would be 216 * $0.67 = $144.72.

Finally, let's consider the store promotion. Since Roya's total cost ($144.72) is <fact9>over $100</fact9>, she'll receive a $20 discount.  Therefore, Roya should pay $144.72 - $20 = $124.72.  Rounding to the nearest cent, Roya should pay approximately $124.72 for all the wool.

How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura?

Answer: First, let's calculate Theo's and Sakura's calorie needs.  Theo's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact4>250 lbs</fact4> = 3750 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, so his net calorie consumption is 1100 - 150 = 950 calories. Therefore, Theo needs 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.  Sakura's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories.  She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 1075 calories. Thus, Sakura needs 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Next, let's determine the calorie content per ounce of cookies.  Each serving contains <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a <fact2>125 oz bag</fact2> has 5 servings.  Therefore, one ounce of cookies contains 175 calories / 5 servings / (125 oz / 5 servings) = 2.8 calories/oz.


Now we can find out how many ounces of cookies each person needs. Theo needs 2800 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 1000 oz of cookies. Sakura needs 875 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 312.5 oz of cookies.


Finally, let's find the difference in the amount of cookies needed. Theo needs 1000 oz - 312.5 oz = 687.5 more ounces of cookies than Sakura.

From the rest, Carlos can only respond to <fact3>4 less than the half of them</fact3>. How many emails does Carlos respond to in a <fact4>4 day work week</fact4>? Carlos work overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>75% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer:

First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day.  Since <fact2>25% of the 32 emails don't require a response</fact2>, that means 32 * 0.25 = 8 emails don't need a response.  Therefore, Carlos receives 32 - 8 = 24 emails that require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many of those emails Carlos can actually respond to.  <fact3>He responds to 4 less than half</fact3>, so he responds to (24 / 2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 emails daily.

Now, let's calculate the number of emails Carlos responds to during a regular <fact4>4-day work week</fact4>.  That's 8 emails/day * 4 days = 32 emails.

Finally, let's account for the overtime on the last day. On that day, due to <fact5>responding to 75% more emails than usual</fact5>, Carlos responds to 8 emails * 1.75 = 14 emails.  Therefore, the total number of emails responded to during the work week is 32 (regular days) + 14 (overtime) = 46 emails.

Therefore, Carlos responds to 46 emails in his 4-day work week.

Due to the flu season, <fact4>30 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of occupied beds: (1/6) * <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> = 216.67 beds. Since we cannot have a fraction of a bed, we round this down to 216 occupied beds.

Next, let's calculate the number of beds out of service: (2/6) * <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> = 433.33 beds.  Again, rounding down to the nearest whole number, we have 433 beds out of service.

The total number of beds unavailable is the sum of occupied and out-of-service beds: 216 + 433 = 649 beds.

The number of available beds is the total capacity minus the unavailable beds: <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> - 649 beds = 651 beds.

Over <fact5>2 weeks (14 days)</fact5>, the number of additional patients admitted is <fact4>30 patients/day</fact4> * <fact5>14 days</fact5> = 420 patients.

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we subtract the newly admitted patients from the initially available beds: 651 beds - 420 patients = 231 beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 231.

The store offers a <fact12>10% discount on paint for members</fact12>.  Arash is a member. How much more money does Gabrielle have left than Arash after they leave the store?

Answer: Let's calculate Gabrielle's spending first.

* **Nails:** <fact2>15 nails</fact2> * <fact3>€0.21/nail</fact3> = €3.15
* **Washers:** <fact4>8 washers</fact4> * <fact5>€0.64/washer</fact5> = €5.12
* **Paint:** <fact6>8 gallons</fact6> *  (we don't know the price of paint for non-members yet)


Arash's spending:

* **Paint:** <fact8>12 gallons</fact8> * <fact9>€7.5/gallon</fact9> * (1 - <fact12>0.10</fact12>) = 12 * 7.5 * 0.9 = €81
* **Pencils:** <fact10>3 pencils</fact10> * <fact11>€3/pencil</fact11> = €9
* **Arash's total spending:** €81 + €9 = €90

We need to find the cost of paint for Gabrielle.  Since the question doesn't state a price for non-member paint, we can assume it's the same as the non-discounted member price.  Therefore, Gabrielle's paint cost is:

* **Gabrielle's paint:** <fact6>8 gallons</fact6> * <fact9>€7.5/gallon</fact9> = €60

* **Gabrielle's total spending:** €3.15 + €5.12 + €60 = €68.27
* **Gabrielle's money left:** <fact1>€92.27</fact1> - €68.27 = €24
* **Arash's money left:** <fact7>€100</fact7> - €90 = €10

* **Difference:** €24 - €10 = €14

The store offers a <fact12>10% discount on paint for members</fact12>, and Liam is a member. How much more money does Valentina have left than Liam after they leave the store?

Answer: Let's calculate Valentina's expenses first.

* **Screws:** <fact2>17 screws</fact2> * <fact3>¥0.3/screw</fact3> = ¥5.10
* **Washers:** <fact4>9 washers</fact4> * <fact5>¥0.59/washer</fact5> = ¥5.31
* **Paint:**  The cost of Valentina's paint is 8 gallons * the price per gallon (which is not given but is irrelevant since we only need the final amount).

Valentina's total spending is ¥5.10 + ¥5.31 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint) =  ¥10.41 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint).  We don't need to know the exact price per gallon of paint since it will subtract equally from both total amounts.


Now let's calculate Liam's expenses.

* **Paint:** <fact8>10 gallons</fact8> * <fact9>¥8.0/gallon</fact9> = ¥80.00.  With a <fact12>10% discount</fact12>, Liam pays ¥80.00 * 0.90 = ¥72.00
* **Pencils:** <fact10>3 pencils</fact10> * <fact11>¥2/pencil</fact11> = ¥6.00

Liam's total spending is ¥72.00 + ¥6.00 = ¥78.00

To find the difference in remaining money, we calculate:

Valentina's remaining money: <fact1>¥99.41</fact1> - ¥10.41 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)  = ¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)
Liam's remaining money: <fact7>¥90</fact7> - ¥78.00 = ¥12.00

The difference is (¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)) - ¥12.00 = ¥77 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint).  As long as the price per gallon for paint is the same for both, the cost of paint cancels out, and Valentina has ¥77 more left than Liam.


Therefore, Valentina has ¥77 more money left than Liam after they leave the store. Note that we don't need the price per gallon of paint to solve this problem.

How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Uma and Zahra have a combined total of <fact2>29</fact2> + <fact3>37</fact3> = 66 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>130 signatures</fact5> by the end of spring break.  This means they need to collect an additional 130 - 66 = 64 signatures in the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Uma's collection rate will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6> due to collecting only on weekends. Over <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, this means she will collect 4 * (her current average - 5) signatures.  We don't know Uma's current average weekly collection rate, but it can be calculated by dividing the number of signatures she has by the number of weeks: 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week. So she will collect approximately 4 * (4.83 - 5) = -0.68 signatures (we can round this to 0 because you can't collect a negative number of signatures).

They have <fact4>3 more weeks</fact4> of break.  Therefore, they need to collect <fact5>120</fact5> - 48 = 72 more signatures in total.

Daphne's collection will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so over the <fact4>3 weeks</fact4> she will collect 5 * <fact4>3</fact4> = 15 fewer signatures than her current rate.  Currently, Daphne is collecting signatures every day. In the next 3 weeks, Daphne will collect 17 + (17/3)*3 = 34 signatures. However, with her reduced rate, she will collect 34 -15 = 19 signatures.

Therefore, Olivia needs to collect the remaining signatures: 72 - 19 = 53 signatures. Since there are <fact4>3 weeks</fact4> left, Olivia needs to collect 53 / <fact4>3</fact4> ≈ 17.67 signatures per week.

This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 75 = 60 signatures in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.

Mei's current weekly collection rate is implied by the fact that she has collected <fact2>24 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, or an average of 24/5 = 4.8 signatures per week.  Because she'll only collect signatures on weekends during the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>, her weekly collection will be reduced by <fact6>5</fact6>, to 4.8 - 5 = -0.2 signatures per week.

Their goal is to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> by the end of the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> remaining.  This means they need to collect 140 - 84 = 56 more signatures.

During the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Uma's weekly collection is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>.  Therefore, over the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Uma will collect 2 * (Uma's current weekly collection - <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>).  We don't know Uma's current weekly collection, but we know that after <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, she has <fact2>25 signatures</fact2>. We will need to assume that Uma collected roughly the same number of signatures each week thus far. Therefore, Uma's current weekly collection can be estimated as 25/3 ≈ 8.33 signatures per week.  Over the next two weeks she will collect approximately 2 * (8.33 - 5) = 6.66 signatures. We will round this down to 6 signatures since Uma can only collect signatures on weekends.

Olga needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach the goal.  Therefore, Olga needs to collect 56 (total needed) - 6 (Uma's contribution) = 50 signatures in the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.  To achieve this, Olga needs to collect 50 / <fact4>2</fact4> = 25 signatures per week.

Chen has <fact2>36 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Tara has <fact3>32 signatures</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>4 more weeks</fact4> of winter break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Chen and Tara have a combined total of <fact2>36</fact2> + <fact3>32</fact3> = 68 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> by the end of the <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> of winter break. This means they need to collect an additional 140 - 68 = 72 signatures.

During the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen's weekly collection is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures</fact6>.  Therefore, over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen will collect 4 weeks * (her current weekly rate - 5) signatures = an unknown number of signatures.  We don't know Chen's current weekly rate, but we can work out how many signatures Chen will add to her total:

Let's say Chen's current weekly average is 'x' signatures. Then her new weekly rate is (x-5) signatures. After 4 weeks she will have collected 4(x-5) signatures in total.

Tara needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach their goal.  Let's say Tara collects 'y' signatures per week.  Over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Tara will collect 4y signatures.

The total number of signatures collected by Chen and Tara in the remaining 4 weeks must equal 72.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4(x-5) + 4y = 72

We don't know 'x', but we know that over 5 weeks Chen collected 36 signatures. Therefore we can estimate x to be approximately 36/5 = 7.2. Thus 4(7.2-5) = 8.8


Solving for 'y' (Tara's weekly collection):

4(7.2 - 5) + 4y = 72
8.8 + 4y = 72
4y = 72 - 8.8
4y = 63.2
y = 15.8

Since Tara cannot collect parts of signatures, she needs to collect at least 16 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 140 signatures.

Therefore, Tara will need to collect at least  {16} signatures per week.

He paid legal fees of <fact2>1% of the selling price</fact2> and realtor fees of <fact3>5% of the selling price</fact3>. He also paid <fact4>$390,000</fact4> for the remaining loan and <fact5>$10,000</fact5> for closing costs. Dr. Miller used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Dr. Miller's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: First, we calculate the legal fees: <fact2>1%</fact2> of <fact1>$490,000</fact1> is $4,900.  Next, we calculate the realtor fees: <fact3>5%</fact3> of <fact1>$490,000</fact1> is $24,500.  The total fees and loan payments are $4,900 + $24,500 + <fact4>$390,000</fact4> + <fact5>$10,000</fact5> = $430,000.  Therefore, Dr. Miller's net proceeds from the sale were <fact1>$490,000</fact1> - $430,000 = $60,000.

Now, we calculate the return on the stocks.  In the first year, the stocks gained 10%, so the value increased by $60,000 * 0.10 = $6,000.  At the end of the first year, the value of the investment was $60,000 + $6,000 = $66,000.  In the second year, the stocks gained another 10%, so the value increased by $66,000 * 0.10 = $6,600.  At the end of the second year, the value of the investment was $66,000 + $6,600 = $72,600.  Therefore, Dr. Miller's net proceeds after two years were <fact6>$72,600</fact6>.

He paid transfer fees that amounted to <fact2>3%</fact2> of the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is <fact3>6%</fact3> of the selling price. He also paid <fact4>$590000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount on the cottage, and <fact5>$5000</fact5> for closing costs. Mr. Martinez used the net proceeds from selling the cottage to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10%</fact6> each year for two years. How much were Mr. Martinez's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: First, we calculate the transfer fees: <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$690000</fact1> is 0.03 * $690000 = $20700.  Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: <fact3>6%</fact3> of <fact1>$690000</fact1> is 0.06 * $690000 = $41400.  The total of these fees and the other costs is $20700 + $41400 + <fact4>$590000</fact4> + <fact5>$5000</fact5> = $667100.  This is subtracted from the selling price to find the net proceeds from the sale: <fact1>$690000</fact1> - $667100 = $22900.  This amount is invested in stocks. After the first year, the stocks gain <fact6>10%</fact6>, increasing the investment to $22900 + (0.10 * $22900) = $25190.  After the second year, the stocks gain another <fact6>10%</fact6>, so the investment becomes $25190 + (0.10 * $25190) = $27709. Therefore, Mr. Martinez's net proceeds after two years were $27709.

She bought <fact1>60 donuts at $14 per dozen</fact1>, <fact2>60 mini cupcakes at $25 per dozen</fact2>, and <fact3>24 mini cheesecakes</fact3>. After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1540</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Nadia bought <fact1>60 donuts at $14 per dozen</fact1>, which means she bought 60/12 = 5 dozen donuts. The cost of the donuts is 5 dozen * $14/dozen = $70.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. She bought <fact2>60 mini cupcakes at $25 per dozen</fact2>, which means she bought 60/12 = 5 dozen mini cupcakes. The cost of the mini cupcakes is 5 dozen * $25/dozen = $125.

Before the discount, the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes was $70 + $125 = $195.  Let's denote the cost of the mini cheesecakes before discount as 'x'. The total cost before the discount was $195 + x.

After the <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, Nadia paid <fact5>$1540</fact5>. This means that 80% of the original price is $1540.  We can set up an equation:

0.80 * ($195 + x) = $1540

Divide both sides by 0.80:

$195 + x = $1540 / 0.80 = $1925

Subtract $195 from both sides:

x = $1925 - $195 = $1730

So the total cost of the <fact3>24 mini cheesecakes</fact3> before discount was $1730.  To find the cost per dozen, we need to convert the number of cheesecakes into dozens: 24 cheesecakes / 12 cheesecakes/dozen = 2 dozens.

Finally, to find the cost per dozen of mini cheesecakes, we divide the total cost by the number of dozens:

$1730 / 2 dozens = $865 per dozen.

Therefore, the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen was $865.

She bought <fact1>36 eclairs at $13 per dozen</fact1>, <fact2>60 cookies at $26 per dozen</fact2>, and <fact3>24 muffins</fact3>. After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$980</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>muffins per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the eclairs. Ava bought <fact1>36 eclairs at $13 per dozen</fact1>, which means she bought 36/12 = 3 dozen eclairs.  The cost of the eclairs is therefore 3 dozen * $13/dozen = $39.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the cookies. Ava bought <fact2>60 cookies at $26 per dozen</fact2>, meaning she bought 60/12 = 5 dozen cookies. The cost of the cookies is 5 dozen * $26/dozen = $130.

Now, let's find the total cost before the discount.  Let 'x' be the cost of a dozen muffins. Ava bought <fact3>24 muffins</fact3>, which is 24/12 = 2 dozen muffins. The total cost before the discount was $39 (eclairs) + $130 (cookies) + 2x (muffins) = 169 + 2x.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, Ava paid <fact5>$980</fact5>. This means that 80% of the original price is $980.  So, we can set up the equation: 0.80 * (169 + 2x) = 980.

Solving for x:
169 + 2x = 980 / 0.80
169 + 2x = 1225
2x = 1225 - 169
2x = 1056
x = 1056 / 2
x = 528

Therefore, the cost of the muffins per dozen is $528.  However, this answer seems unreasonable given the context. Let's re-examine our calculations.

**Corrected Calculation:**

The total cost *before* discount is 169 + 2x.  After a 20% discount, the amount paid is 80% of the original cost.  Thus:

0.8(169 + 2x) = 980
135.2 + 1.6x = 980
1.6x = 980 - 135.2
1.6x = 844.8
x = 844.8 / 1.6
x = 528

There must be a mistake in the problem statement. The calculated cost of muffins per dozen ($528) is unrealistically high compared to the cost of eclairs and cookies.  There's likely an error in the given total cost ($980).

She bought <fact1>24 croissants at $12 per dozen</fact1>, <fact2>48 macarons at $20 per dozen</fact2>, and <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>. After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants.  Aisha bought <fact1>24 croissants at $12 per dozen</fact1>, which means she bought 2 dozen croissants (24 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 2 dozen).  The cost of the croissants was 2 dozen * $12/dozen = $24.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Aisha bought <fact2>48 macarons at $20 per dozen</fact2>, which means she bought 4 dozen macarons (48 macarons / 12 macarons/dozen = 4 dozen). The cost of the macarons was 4 dozen * $20/dozen = $80.

Now, let's find the pre-discount total cost. Before the discount, the total cost was the cost of the croissants plus the cost of the macarons plus the cost of the brownies (which we'll call 'x').  So, the pre-discount total was $24 + $80 + x.

Aisha received a <fact4>20% discount</fact4> and paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. This means that 80% of the original price was $1520.  We can set up an equation: 0.80 * ($24 + $80 + x) = $1520.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.80 * (104 + x) = 1520.  Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get: 104 + x = 1900.  Subtracting 104 from both sides, we find x = $1800.  Therefore, the total cost of the brownies was $1800.

Finally, since Aisha bought <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>, which is 2 dozen (24 brownies / 12 brownies/dozen = 2 dozen), the cost per dozen brownies was $1800 / 2 dozen = $900 per dozen.

The answer is {900}.

Sakura then donated <fact8>€5</fact8> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Sakura have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy.  Sakura bought <fact4>22 kgs</fact4>. The offer was for <fact2>16 kgs at €22 per kg</fact2>, so that's 16 * €22 = €352.  The discount applied to the additional <fact4>22-16=6 kgs</fact4>. The discount is <fact3>1/4 off</fact3>, which is €22 * 0.25 = €5.50 per kg. So the discount on the extra 6 kgs is 6 * €5.50 = €33.  Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is €352 + (6 * €22) - €33 = €352 + €132 - €33 = €451.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the keychains:  She bought <fact6>12 keychains</fact6> at <fact7>€20.0 each</fact7>, costing 12 * €20 = €240.

The total spent on gifts is the cost of the taffy (€451), starfish (€<fact5>11.0</fact5>), and keychains (€240): €451 + €11 + €240 = €702.

Adding the charity donation (€<fact8>5</fact8>), Sakura's total spending is €702 + €5 = €707.

Finally, subtracting her total spending from the initial amount given by her parents (€<fact1>1300</fact1>), we find out how much money she has left: €1300 - €707 = €593.

Therefore, Sakura has €593 left.

First, the taffy: She bought <fact4>23 kgs</fact4> of taffy.  The deal was <fact2>16 kgs at $22/kg</fact2>, so that's 16 kgs * $22/kg = $352.  The additional <fact4>23-16=7 kgs</fact4> received a <fact3>1/4 discount</fact3>, meaning each kg cost $22 - ($22 * 0.25) = $16.50.  The cost of those 7 kgs is 7 kgs * $16.50/kg = $115.50.  Her total taffy cost is $352 + $115.50 = $467.50.

Next, the starfish and keychains: The starfish cost <fact5>$11.0</fact5>, and the keychains cost <fact6>11</fact6> * <fact7>$21.0</fact7> = $231.

Finally, the donation: Chen donated <fact8>$5</fact8>.

The discount applied to the additional <fact4>23-16=7 kgs</fact4>.  The discount is 1/3 off, meaning each kg costs ₣20 - (1/3 * ₣20) = ₣13.33 (approximately). So the extra 7 kgs cost approximately 7 * ₣13.33 = ₣93.31. Therefore, the total cost of the rock candy is approximately ₣320 + ₣93.31 = ₣413.31.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the stickers: <fact6>13 stickers</fact6> at <fact7>₣20.0 each</fact7> cost 13 * ₣20 = ₣260.

Answer: The question asks for the percentage of animals that were rabbits.  We are given that Gabrielle found <fact2>38 white animals</fact2>, and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>. This means that there were 38 / 2 = 19 rabbits.  The other information—the number of wasps (<fact1>two-fifths the number of bees</fact1>), caterpillars (<fact4>41</fact4>), and bees (<fact5>15</fact5>)—is irrelevant to determining the percentage of rabbits.  Therefore, the percentage of white animals that were rabbits is (19 rabbits / 38 total white animals) * 100% = 50%.

How much money will Gabrielle spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many plants Gabrielle can fit in her flower bed.  Each plant, including the spacing, takes up <fact2>3 meters</fact2> + <fact3>15 meters</fact3> = <fact8>18 meters</fact8>. The flower bed is <fact1>150 meters long</fact1>, so she can fit 150 meters / <fact8>18 meters/plant</fact8> = 8.33 plants. Since she can't plant parts of plants, she can fit 8 plants.

Gabrielle already owns <fact4>7 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy 8 - 7 = 1 additional plant. Since she's buying more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6> (even though in this case it is only 1), she will receive the $<fact7>8 discount</fact7>.

However, if the discount applies only if she buys more than 2 new plants, and it is a discount on the *total* purchase price before the discount, and the wording is ambiguous with regard to whether the discount is subtracted from the cost of each plant or from the total, the answer is 0.  To be safe, assuming she needs more than 2 and is therefore receiving the $8 discount and this is a discount off the total purchase cost, she would pay $3.00 - $8.00 = -$5.00 which means she would get a $5.00 rebate.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute <fact3>180 clams</fact3> if it takes <fact4>19 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it</fact4>? Note that Olga can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>11-minute break</fact5> after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them.


Answer: First, let's determine how long it takes Olga to peel 180 clams.  She peels <fact1>12 clams per minute</fact1>, so it will take her 180 clams / 12 clams/minute = 15 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, consider the clam washing time.  Washing each clam takes <fact4>19 seconds</fact4>, which is 19 seconds/clam * 1 minute/60 seconds = 0.3167 minutes/clam.  For 180 clams, this amounts to 0.3167 minutes/clam * 180 clams = 57 minutes of washing.

Therefore, the total time spent peeling and washing is 15 minutes + 57 minutes = 72 minutes.

Now, let's figure out the sautéing time. Olga can sauté <fact2>30 clams in 9 minutes</fact2>, which means her sautéing rate is 30 clams / 9 minutes = 3.33 clams per minute. To sauté 180 clams, she'll need 180 clams / 3.33 clams/minute = 54 minutes.

Finally, we need to account for the <fact5>11-minute break</fact5> Olga takes between peeling and sautéing.  Therefore, the total time required is 72 minutes (peeling and washing) + 11 minutes (break) + 54 minutes (sautéing) = 137 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Olga 137 minutes to peel and sauté 180 clams.

On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer:

First, let's calculate the total length of the remoras on the first dolphin.  Initially, there were <fact2>24 remoras</fact2>, each <fact3>12 inches long</fact3>, for a total length of 24 * 12 = 288 inches. After <fact4>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, there were 24 - (24/3) = 16 remoras remaining.  These 16 remoras have a total length of 16 * 12 = 192 inches.

Now, let's convert the dolphin's length to inches: <fact1>32 feet</fact1> * 12 inches/foot = 384 inches.

The percentage of the first dolphin's body length covered by remoras is (192 inches / 384 inches) * 100% = 50%.

Next, let's consider the second dolphin.  It has <fact6>4 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, for a total length of 4 * 6 = 24 inches.  The dolphin's length is <fact5>8 feet</fact5> * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches.

The percentage of the second dolphin's body length covered by remoras is (24 inches / 96 inches) * 100% = 25%.

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for both dolphins and divide by 2: (50% + 25%) / 2 = 37.5%.

Therefore, on average, 37.5% of each dolphin's body length is covered by remoras.  The answer is {37.5}.

First, let's calculate the total length of remoras on the first whale.  There were initially <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, each <fact3>12 inches long</fact3>, for a total length of 18 * 12 = 216 inches. After <fact4>half swam away</fact4>, there were 18 / 2 = 9 remoras left.  These 9 remoras have a total length of 9 * 12 = 108 inches.  Converting the whale's length to inches (1 foot = 12 inches), the <fact1>45-foot whale</fact1> is 45 * 12 = 540 inches long. The percentage of the first whale's body length covered by remoras is (108 inches / 540 inches) * 100% = 20%.

The percentage of the second whale's body length covered by remoras is (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%.

Finally, to find the average percentage, we add the percentages for each whale and divide by 2: (20% + 10%) / 2 = 15%.

Therefore, on average, 15% of each whale's body length is covered by remoras. The answer is {15}.

Answer:

First, let's calculate the total length of the remoras on the first shark.  There were initially <fact2>12 remoras</fact2>, each <fact3>22 inches long</fact3>, so their total length was 12 * 22 = 264 inches. A quarter of the remoras swam away, leaving 12 - (12/4) = 9 remoras.  The remaining remoras have a total length of 9 * 22 = 198 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first shark is 33 feet * 12 inches/foot = 396 inches long. The percentage of the first shark's body length covered by remoras is (198 inches / 396 inches) * 100% = 50%.

Next, let's consider the second shark. This <fact4>8-foot shark</fact4> has <fact5>6 remoras</fact5>, each <fact6>4 inches long</fact6>, for a total remora length of 6 * 4 = 24 inches. The shark is 8 feet * 12 inches/foot = 96 inches long. The percentage of the second shark's body length covered by remoras is (24 inches / 96 inches) * 100% = 25%.

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for both sharks and divide by 2: (50% + 25%) / 2 = 37.5%.

Therefore, on average, 37.5% of each shark's body length is covered by remoras. The answer is {37.5}.

If the city is <fact3>72 miles</fact3> across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact4>a quarter of the city</fact4>?

Answer: The fog bank's initial speed is 3 miles / 30 minutes = 0.1 miles per minute.  A quarter of the city's 72-mile width is (72 miles) / 4 = 18 miles.

At the initial speed, it would take the fog bank 18 miles / 0.1 miles/minute = 180 minutes to cover a quarter of the city.

However, the wind speed is halved after 60 minutes.  This means the fog bank's speed will remain at 0.1 miles per minute for the first 60 minutes.

The remaining distance to cover a quarter of the city (18 miles) is 18 miles - 6 miles = 12 miles.

After 60 minutes, the speed is halved to 0.1 miles/minute / 2 = 0.05 miles/minute.

Answer: The fog bank covers 3 miles in 60 minutes.  Therefore, its initial speed is 3 miles / 60 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

One-third of the city's 54-mile width, as stated in <fact3>, is (1/3) * 54 miles = 18 miles.

Answer: The fog bank covers 6 miles in 60 minutes.  Therefore, its initial speed is 6 miles / 60 minutes = 0.1 miles per minute.

One-third of the city's 72-mile width is (1/3) * 72 miles = 24 miles.

If the city is <fact3>54 miles</fact3> across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact4>1/2 of the city (27 miles)</fact4>?

Answer: The fog bank covers 5 miles in 25 minutes.  Therefore, its speed is (5 miles)/(25 minutes) = 0.2 miles per minute.

To cover half the city, the fog needs to travel <fact4>27 miles</fact4>.  At a constant speed of 0.2 miles per minute, this would take (27 miles) / (0.2 miles/minute) = 135 minutes.

However, the question states that the wind speed will be halved after <fact2>60 minutes</fact2>. Since it takes 135 minutes to cover half the city at the initial speed, the wind speed reduction will affect the process.  The first 60 minutes will proceed at the initial speed.  In that time, the fog will cover 0.2 miles/minute * 60 minutes = 12 miles.

After 60 minutes, the remaining distance to cover half the city is 27 miles - 12 miles = 15 miles.  The speed is now halved, meaning it's 0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles/minute.

The time it takes to cover the remaining 15 miles at the reduced speed is (15 miles) / (0.1 miles/minute) = 150 minutes.

1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>90 minutes to cover every 3 miles</fact1> of the city. However, we know that the <fact2>wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If the <fact3>city is 78 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a third of the city?

Answer: First, we need to determine the fog bank's initial speed.  According to <fact1>the given information</fact1>, the fog bank covers 3 miles in 90 minutes.  Therefore, its initial speed is (3 miles) / (90 minutes) = 1/30 miles per minute.

Next, we calculate one-third of the city's width.  <fact3>The city is 78 miles wide</fact3>, so one-third of the city is (1/3) * 78 miles = 26 miles.

The wind speed is halved after one hour (60 minutes).  This means the fog's coverage rate will also be halved.  For the first 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover (1/30 miles/minute) * 60 minutes = 2 miles.

After 60 minutes, the fog bank's speed is halved, becoming (1/30 miles/minute) / 2 = 1/60 miles per minute.

The remaining distance the fog needs to cover to reach one-third of the city is 26 miles - 2 miles = 24 miles.

At the reduced speed, the time it takes to cover the remaining 24 miles is 24 miles / (1/60 miles/minute) = 1440 minutes.

Therefore, the total time to cover a third of the city is 60 minutes (initial speed) + 1440 minutes (halved speed) = 1500 minutes.

Answer: A d4 die has four sides, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For <fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>:  There are three numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, and 4). The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4. To roll it twice in a row, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.  Expressed as a percentage, this is (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%.

For <fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>: There are two odd numbers on a d4 die (1 and 3). The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2. To roll four odd numbers in a row, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%.

The difference in likelihood is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points.

Answer:

Let's analyze each scenario separately:

**Scenario 1: Rolling a number greater than 10 twice in a row.**

A 20-sided die has numbers 1 through 20.  The numbers greater than 10 are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. There are 10 such numbers.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 on a single roll is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 twice in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 0.25 or 25%.


**Scenario 2: Rolling four even numbers in a row.**

On a 20-sided die, there are 10 even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20).

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 = 0.5 or 50%.

The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) * (10/20) = 0.0625 or 6.25%.


**Comparison:**

The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 twice in a row (<fact2>Scenario 1</fact2>) is 25%, while the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row (<fact3>Scenario 2</fact3>) is 6.25%.

The difference is 25% - 6.25% = 18.75 percentage points.


Therefore, rolling a number greater than 10 twice in a row is 18.75 percentage points more likely than rolling four even numbers in a row.

Answer:

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll of the <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. There are 18 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, ..., 20), so the probability is 18/20 = 9/10 = 0.9.  The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2> is (0.9) * (0.9) = 0.81 or 81%.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll. There are 10 even numbers (2, 4, ..., 20), so the probability is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number <fact3>four times in a row</fact3> is (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.0625 or 6.25%.

Answer: A d10 die has 10 sides, numbered 1-10.

For <fact2>rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row</fact2>:
There are 5 numbers greater than 5 (6, 7, 8, 9, 10).  The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is 5/10 = 0.5 or 50%.  To roll a number greater than 5 twice in a row, the probability is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100 = 0.25 or 25%.

For <fact3>rolling four even numbers in a row</fact3>:
There are 5 even numbers on a d10 die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10). The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 5/10 = 0.5 or 50%. To roll four even numbers in a row, the probability is (5/10) * (5/10) * (5/10) * (5/10) = 625/10000 = 0.0625 or 6.25%.

Answer:  A d6 die has six sides, numbered 1 through 6.

First, let's consider the probability of <fact2>rolling a number greater than 3 twice in a row</fact2>. The numbers greater than 3 on a d6 die are 4, 5, and 6.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%. To roll this twice in a row, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

Next, let's calculate the probability of <fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>. The odd numbers on a d6 die are 1, 3, and 5. The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.  To roll four odd numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 = 6.25%.

Finally, we find the difference in percentage points between these two probabilities: 25% - 6.25% = 18.75 percentage points.  Therefore, rolling a number greater than 3 twice in a row is 18.75 percentage points more likely than rolling four odd numbers in a row.

The kernels increase to <fact3>5 times the initial popping rate in the next 16 seconds</fact3>. In the final 16 seconds, the popping slows down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 16 seconds</fact4>. After Oscar takes the pan off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 16 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>. Oscar gives <fact6>two-fifths of the made popcorn to his brother Benjamin</fact6>. How many more pieces of popcorn does Oscar have to eat than his brother?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the popcorn popped in each 16-second interval.

* **Interval 1:** <fact1>80 kernels popped</fact1>.
* **Interval 2:** <fact2>3 * 80 = 240 kernels popped</fact2>.
* **Interval 3:** <fact3>5 * 80 = 400 kernels popped</fact3>.
* **Interval 4:** <fact4>400 / 2 = 200 kernels popped</fact4>.

After the heat is removed, <fact5>a quarter of the kernels popped in the final interval also pop</fact5>, which is 200/4 = 50 kernels.

The total number of popped kernels is 80 + 240 + 400 + 200 + 50 = 970.

Oscar gives <fact6>two-fifths of the popcorn to his brother</fact6>, so Benjamin receives (2/5) * 970 = 388 kernels.

This means Oscar has 970 - 388 = 582 kernels.

The difference in the number of kernels is 582 - 388 = 194.

Therefore, Oscar has 194 more pieces of popcorn to eat than his brother.  The answer is {194}.

She also uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 5 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let 'x' be the number of teaspoons of sugar Olivia used.  From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (51:5)</fact1>, we know that for every 51 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 5 cups of water.  Therefore, the number of cups of water used is (5/51)x.

From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (7 tablespoons milk : 5 cups water)</fact2>, the number of tablespoons of milk used is (7/5) * (5/51)x = (7/51)x.

From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons cream : 1 teaspoon sugar)</fact3>, the number of tablespoons of cream used is 2x.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as <fact4>220</fact4>.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (5/51)x + 2x + (7/51)x = 220

Combining like terms:

x(1 + 5/51 + 2 + 7/51) = 220
x(3 + 12/51) = 220
x(3 + 4/17) = 220
x(51/17 + 4/17) = 220
x(55/17) = 220
x = 220 * (17/55)
x = 4 * 17
x = 68

Therefore, Olivia used 68 teaspoons of sugar. The answer is {68}.

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 's', the number of cups of water as 'w', the number of tablespoons of milk as 'm', and the number of tablespoons of cream as 'c'.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water is 48:10</fact1>, we can write the relationship as:  w = (10/48)s

From <fact2>the relationship between milk and water</fact2>, we have: m = (6/10)w = (6/10) * (10/48)s = (6/48)s = (1/8)s

From <fact3>the relationship between cream and sugar</fact3>, we have: c = 2s

The total amount of ingredients used is given by <fact4>210</fact4>: s + w + m + c = 210

Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get:

s + (10/48)s + (1/8)s + 2s = 210

To solve for s, we find a common denominator (which is 48):

(48/48)s + (10/48)s + (6/48)s + (96/48)s = 210

(160/48)s = 210

s = (210 * 48) / 160

s = 63

Therefore, Olga used 63 teaspoons of sugar.  The answer is {63}.

She also uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 2 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 's' and the number of cups of water as 'w'.  From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (54:12)</fact1>, we can simplify this to a ratio of 9:2.  This means that for every 9 teaspoons of sugar, there are 2 cups of water. So we can write this as: s/w = 9/2.

The amount of milk used is determined by <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 2 cups of water</fact2>. Since s/w = 9/2, we can find the amount of milk in terms of 's'. If 2 cups of water require 7 tablespoons of milk, then 1 cup needs 3.5 tablespoons. Therefore, the amount of milk (m) is given by m = 3.5w = 3.5 * (2/9)s = (7/9)s.

The amount of cream is determined by <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. Therefore, the amount of cream (c) is given by c = 2s.

The total amount of ingredients is given by <fact4>240 = s + w + m + c</fact4>.  Substituting the expressions we derived for w, m, and c in terms of s:

240 = s + (2/9)s + (7/9)s + 2s

Now we solve for s:

240 = s + (2s + 7s + 18s) / 9

240 = s + 27s/9

240 = s + 3s

240 = 4s

s = 60

Therefore, Gabrielle used 60 teaspoons of sugar.

She used a total of <fact4>170 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let 'x' be the number of 48:7 ratios Mia used.  From <fact1>the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 48:7</fact1>, we know that for every 7 cups of water, she uses 48 teaspoons of sugar. This means that the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 48x and the number of cups of water used is 7x.

From <fact2>the information that she uses 9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water</fact2>, we know the amount of milk used is 9x.  And from <fact3>the information that she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, we know the amount of cream used is 2 * 48x = 96x.

The total amount of ingredients used is the sum of sugar, water (in units of 7-cup ratios), milk, and cream:  48x + 7x + 9x + 96x.  According to <fact4>the problem, this total equals 170</fact4>.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

48x + 7x + 9x + 96x = 170

Combining like terms:

160x = 170

Solving for x:

x = 170 / 160 = 17/16

Since the number of ratios must be a whole number, there appears to be an error in the problem statement.  The total number of ingredients given (170) does not align with the provided ratios.  However, if we assume the total is incorrect and solve for the number of teaspoons of sugar using the given ratios, we proceed as follows:

The number of teaspoons of sugar is 48x = 48 * (17/16) = 51

Therefore, Mia used 51 teaspoons of sugar.  However, it's important to note that this solution assumes there's an error in the total ingredient amount provided in the problem.  A correct answer requires consistent ratios and a total amount that matches.
The answer is {51} (with the caveat of a potential error in the problem statement).

She used a total of <fact4>240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as 's', the number of cups of water as 'w', the number of tablespoons of milk as 'm', and the number of tablespoons of cream as 'c'.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (55:44)</fact1>, we can write: s/w = 55/44  This simplifies to s = (5/4)w

From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (6:24)</fact2>, we have: m/w = 6/24. This simplifies to m = (1/4)w

From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2:1)</fact3>, we get: c/s = 2/1,  which means c = 2s

We know from <fact4>the total amount used is 240</fact4>: s + w + c + m = 240

Now we can substitute the expressions for w, c, and m in terms of s into the total equation:

s + (4/5)s + 2s + (1/4)(4/5)s = 240

Simplifying this equation:

s + (4/5)s + 2s + (1/5)s = 240

Combining the terms with 's':

(5/5)s + (4/5)s + (10/5)s + (1/5)s = 240

(20/5)s = 240

The grapes can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apricots does Hiroshi harvest than grapes?

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of apricots per hectare.  From <fact2>“28 apricots per two-fourths of a hectare,”</fact2> we know there are 28 apricots per 0.5 hectares.  Therefore, there are 28 apricots / 0.5 hectares = 56 apricots per hectare.

Given that Hiroshi has <fact1>20 hectares of apricot field</fact1>, he harvests 56 apricots/hectare * 20 hectares = 1120 apricots per harvest.

Since he harvests every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he harvests 24 months / 6 months/harvest = 4 times in two years.

Therefore, Hiroshi harvests a total of 1120 apricots/harvest * 4 harvests = 4480 apricots in two years.


Now let's calculate the number of grapes Hiroshi harvests.  His <fact4>12-hectare grape field</fact4> produces <fact5>14 grapes per hectare</fact5>, so he harvests 12 hectares * 14 grapes/hectare = 168 grapes per harvest.

He harvests grapes every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, so in <fact7>two years (24 months)</fact7>, he harvests 24 months / 4 months/harvest = 6 times.

Therefore, Hiroshi harvests a total of 168 grapes/harvest * 6 harvests = 1008 grapes in two years.


Finally, to find how many more apricots Hiroshi harvests than grapes in two years, we subtract the number of grapes harvested from the number of apricots harvested: 4480 apricots - 1008 grapes = 3472.

Therefore, Hiroshi harvests 3472 more apricots than grapes in two years.  The answer is {3472}.

In the span of two years, how many more grapes does Oliver harvest than apples?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total number of grapes Oliver harvests per harvest.  There are 15 grapes per 1/3 hectare (<fact2>15 grapes per 1/3 of a hectare</fact2>).  To find the number of grapes per hectare, we multiply by 3: 15 grapes/hectare * 3 = 45 grapes per hectare. Since Oliver has 15 hectares of grape field (<fact1>15 hectares of grape field</fact1>), he harvests 45 grapes/hectare * 15 hectares = 675 grapes per harvest.

Two years is equivalent to 24 months (2 years * 12 months/year = 24 months).  Since Oliver harvests grapes every 4 months (<fact3>every 4 months</fact3>), he harvests 24 months / 4 months/harvest = 6 times in two years.  Therefore, over two years, he harvests 675 grapes/harvest * 6 harvests = 4050 grapes.

Next, let's calculate the number of apples Oliver harvests. He has a 9-hectare apple field (<fact4>9-hectare apple field</fact4>) that produces 16 apples per hectare (<fact5>16 apples per hectare</fact5>).  This means he harvests 9 hectares * 16 apples/hectare = 144 apples per harvest.  Like the grapes, he harvests every 4 months (<fact3>every 4 months</fact3>), so in two years (24 months), he harvests 6 times.  Thus, he harvests 144 apples/harvest * 6 harvests = 864 apples in two years.

Finally, to find how many more grapes than apples Oliver harvests in two years, we subtract the number of apples from the number of grapes: 4050 grapes - 864 apples = 3186.  Therefore, Oliver harvests 3186 more grapes than apples in two years.

The apricots can be harvested <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>. In the span of two years, how many more grapes does Mohammed harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of grapes per square meter:  Since there are <fact2>12 grapes per 2/3 of a square meter</fact2>, there are (12 grapes) / (2/3 square meters) = 18 grapes per square meter.

Next, let's find the total number of grapes harvested in one harvest: Mohammed's grape field is <fact1>35 square meters</fact1>, so he harvests 18 grapes/square meter * 35 square meters = 630 grapes per harvest.

Now, let's determine how many grape harvests occur in two years:  Two years is 24 months, and Mohammed harvests <fact3>every 6 months</fact3>, so he has 24 months / 6 months/harvest = 4 grape harvests in two years.

Therefore, in two years, Mohammed harvests 630 grapes/harvest * 4 harvests = 2520 grapes.

Now, let's calculate the apricot harvest: Mohammed's apricot field is <fact4>11 square meters</fact4>, and it produces <fact5>18 apricots per square meter</fact5>, resulting in a total of 11 square meters * 18 apricots/square meter = 198 apricots per harvest.

Next, let's find the number of apricot harvests in two years:  Two years is 24 months, and apricots are harvested <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>, leading to 24 months / 4 months/harvest = 6 apricot harvests in two years.

Thus, in two years, Mohammed harvests 198 apricots/harvest * 6 harvests = 1188 apricots.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of watermelons per square yard.  Since there are <fact2>19 watermelons per two-sixths (or one-third) of a square yard</fact2>, there are 19 * 3 = 57 watermelons per square yard.

Next, let's find the total number of watermelons Yusuf has.  He has <fact1>10 square yards</fact1> * 57 watermelons/square yard = 570 watermelons.

Now let's determine how many times Yusuf can harvest watermelons in two years.  There are 12 months in a year, so two years have 24 months. Since he harvests every <fact3>2 months</fact3>, he harvests 24 months / 2 months/harvest = 12 times in two years.

Therefore, in two years, Yusuf harvests 570 watermelons/harvest * 12 harvests = 6840 watermelons.

Next, let's calculate the total number of grapes Yusuf harvests in two years. His grape field is <fact4>9 square yards</fact4>, and it produces <fact5>14 grapes per square yard</fact5>, so it produces 9 * 14 = 126 grapes per harvest.  

In two years (24 months), given that the grapes are harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, he harvests 24 months / 4 months/harvest = 6 times.

So, in two years, Yusuf harvests 126 grapes/harvest * 6 harvests = 756 grapes.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of oranges in Thiago's orange field.  Since there are 23 oranges per one-fourth of a square yard (<fact2>23 oranges per one-fourth of a square yard</fact2>), there are 23 * 4 = 92 oranges per square yard.  With <fact1>25 square yards of orange field</fact1>, Thiago has a total of 92 oranges/square yard * 25 square yards = 2300 oranges.

Thiago harvests his oranges <fact3>every 12 months</fact3>, and <fact7>two years</fact7> is 24 months.  Therefore, in two years, he harvests 2300 oranges * (24 months / 12 months) = 4600 oranges.

If the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total weight of each item the farmer bought:

* **Corn:** <fact1>4 boxes * 6 pounds/box</fact1> = 24 pounds
* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>14 bags * 8 pounds/bag</fact2> = 112 pounds
* **Apples:** <fact3>35 packs * 42 pounds/pack</fact3> = 1470 pounds
* **Hay:** <fact4>18 sacks * 18 pounds/sack</fact4> = 324 pounds
* **Groceries:** <fact5>43 pounds</fact5>

He buys a variety of wheat, oats, carrots and corn. <fact1>He buys seven 5-kg boxes of corn</fact1>. <fact2>He buys eleven 7-kg bags of carrots</fact2>. <fact3>He buys thirty four 39-kg packs of wheat</fact3>. <fact4>He buys nineteen 18-kg sacks of oats</fact4>. <fact5>He buys 43 kgs of groceries</fact5>, <fact6>27 kgs of tools</fact6>, and <fact7>100 kgs of wood</fact7>. A farm truck can carry <fact8>130 kgs at a time</fact8>. If the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each item:

* **Corn:** <fact1>7 boxes * 5 kg/box = 35 kg</fact1>
* **Carrots:** <fact2>11 bags * 7 kg/bag = 77 kg</fact2>
* **Wheat:** <fact3>34 packs * 39 kg/pack = 1326 kg</fact3>
* **Oats:** <fact4>19 sacks * 18 kg/sack = 342 kg</fact4>
* **Groceries:** <fact5>43 kg</fact5>
* **Tools:** <fact6>27 kg</fact6>
* **Wood:** <fact7>100 kg</fact7>

Now, let's find the total weight of all purchased items: 35 kg + 77 kg + 1326 kg + 342 kg + 43 kg + 27 kg + 100 kg = 1950 kg

Since each truck can carry <fact8>130 kg</fact8>, the number of trips needed per truck is 1950 kg / 130 kg/trip = 15 trips.

With <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, the total number of trips needed is 15 trips / 3 trucks = 5 trips per truck.  Therefore, the farmer needs a total of 5 trips to transport all the items.
The answer is {5}.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer:

First, let's find the number of golf balls.  According to <fact2>, a tenth of the 480 balls are golf balls, so there are (1/10) * <fact1>480</fact1> = 48 golf balls.

Next, let's determine the number of purple golf balls.  <fact3>Half of the golf balls are purple</fact3>, which is (1/2) * 48 = 24 purple golf balls.

Now, let's calculate the number of marked purple golf balls.  <fact4>One-sixth of the purple golf balls are marked</fact4>, so there are (1/6) * 24 = 4 marked purple golf balls.

Next, we need to find the number of tennis balls. Since the rest of the balls are tennis balls after accounting for the golf balls, there are <fact1>480</fact1> - 48 = 432 tennis balls.

Now let's find the number of indigo tennis balls.  According to <fact5>, (1/9) of the tennis balls are indigo, so there are (1/9) * 432 = 48 indigo tennis balls.

Finally, let's determine the number of marked indigo tennis balls. <fact6>All except a third of the indigo tennis balls are marked</fact6>, meaning (2/3) of them are marked.  Therefore, there are (2/3) * 48 = 32 marked indigo tennis balls.

To find the total number of marked balls, we add the number of marked purple golf balls and the number of marked indigo tennis balls: 4 + 32 = 36 marked balls.

Therefore, there are a total of 36 marked balls. The answer is {36}.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer:  The total number of balls is <fact1>360</fact1>.

Since <fact2>half of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, there are 360/2 = 180 tennis balls.

<fact3>A third of the tennis balls are teal</fact3>, so there are 180/3 = 60 teal tennis balls.

Of those teal tennis balls, <fact4>1/4 are marked</fact4>, meaning there are 60/4 = 15 marked teal tennis balls.


The number of golf balls is also 180 (360 - 180 = 180).

<fact5>1/3 of the golf balls are pink</fact5>, so there are 180/3 = 60 pink golf balls.

All except <fact6>a fifth of those pink balls are marked</fact6>, meaning 60/5 = 12 pink golf balls are unmarked.  Therefore, there are 60 - 12 = 48 marked pink golf balls.

In total, there are 15 marked teal tennis balls + 48 marked pink golf balls = 63 marked balls.

The answer is {63}.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, let's find the number of golf balls.  According to <fact2>a tenth of the balls are golf balls</fact2>, there are (1/10) * <fact1>360 balls</fact1> = 36 golf balls.

Next, let's determine the number of white golf balls.  <fact3>One-third of the golf balls are white</fact3>, so there are (1/3) * 36 golf balls = 12 white golf balls.

Now, let's calculate the number of marked white golf balls.  <fact4>One-fourth of the white golf balls are marked</fact4>, meaning there are (1/4) * 12 white golf balls = 3 marked white golf balls.

Next, let's find the number of tennis balls. Since the rest of the balls are tennis balls and there are 36 golf balls, there are <fact1>360 balls</fact1> - 36 golf balls = 324 tennis balls.

Now, let's find the number of magenta tennis balls.  <fact5>Half of the tennis balls are magenta</fact5>, which is (1/2) * 324 tennis balls = 162 magenta tennis balls.

Finally, let's find the number of marked magenta tennis balls.  <fact6>All except half of the magenta tennis balls are marked</fact6>, meaning there are 162 magenta tennis balls - (1/2) * 162 magenta tennis balls = 162 - 81 = 81 marked magenta tennis balls.

To find the total number of marked balls, we add the marked white golf balls and the marked magenta tennis balls: 3 marked white golf balls + 81 marked magenta tennis balls = 84 marked balls.

Therefore, there are a total of 84 marked balls. The answer is {84}.

Answer:  First, let's find the number of tennis balls.  Since <fact2>1/4 of the 240 balls are tennis balls</fact2>, there are (1/4) * <fact1>240</fact1> = 60 tennis balls.

Next, let's determine the number of black tennis balls.  <fact3>1/3 of the tennis balls are black</fact3>, so there are (1/3) * 60 = 20 black tennis balls.

Now, we find the number of marked black tennis balls. <fact4>1/5 of the black tennis balls are marked</fact4>, meaning there are (1/5) * 20 = 4 marked black tennis balls.

Let's move on to the golf balls. The number of golf balls is the total number of balls minus the number of tennis balls: <fact1>240</fact1> - 60 = 180 golf balls.

Next, we calculate the number of cyan golf balls.  <fact5>A third of the golf balls are cyan</fact5>, which is (1/3) * 180 = 60 cyan golf balls.

Now, let's find out how many of the cyan golf balls are marked. <fact6>All except half of the cyan golf balls are marked</fact6>, so half of the 60 cyan golf balls are unmarked (60/2 = 30).  Therefore, there are 60 - 30 = 30 marked cyan golf balls.

Finally, to find the total number of marked balls, we add the marked tennis balls and the marked golf balls: 4 + 30 = 34 marked balls.

Therefore, there are a total of 34 marked balls. The answer is {34}.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer:  First, let's find the number of tennis balls.  According to <fact2>, a tenth of the 300 balls are tennis balls, so there are (1/10) * <fact1>300</fact1> = 30 tennis balls.

Next, we determine the number of magenta tennis balls.  From <fact3>, a fifth of the tennis balls are magenta, meaning there are (1/5) * 30 = 6 magenta tennis balls.

Now, let's find the number of marked magenta tennis balls.  <fact4> states that a third of the magenta tennis balls are marked, so there are (1/3) * 6 = 2 marked magenta tennis balls.

Now, let's look at the golf balls.  The total number of golf balls is <fact1>300</fact1> (total balls) - 30 (tennis balls) = 270 golf balls.

According to <fact5>, 1/3 of the golf balls are purple, giving us (1/3) * 270 = 90 purple golf balls.

Finally, we calculate the number of marked purple golf balls. <fact6> tells us that all but half of the purple golf balls are marked.  This means half of the purple golf balls are marked: (1/2) * 90 = 45 marked purple golf balls.

Therefore, the total number of marked balls is the sum of the marked magenta tennis balls and the marked purple golf balls: 2 + 45 = 47 marked balls.

Answer:  First, let's find the number of tennis balls.  Since <fact2>a quarter of the 160 balls are tennis balls</fact2>, there are 160 * (1/4) = 40 tennis balls.

Next, let's determine the number of purple tennis balls.  <fact3>1/5 of the tennis balls are purple</fact3>, so there are 40 * (1/5) = 8 purple tennis balls.

Now, let's find the number of marked purple tennis balls. <fact4>1/4 of the purple tennis balls are marked</fact4>, meaning there are 8 * (1/4) = 2 marked purple tennis balls.

Now let's consider the golf balls.  Since there are 40 tennis balls, there are 160 - 40 = 120 golf balls.

Next, we find the number of indigo golf balls. <fact5>1/8 of the golf balls are indigo</fact5>, so there are 120 * (1/8) = 15 indigo golf balls.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total ounces used for each size of ice cube.

* **Giant cubes:** <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>14 ounces/giant cube</fact2> = 126 ounces
* **Medium cubes:** <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>3 ounces/medium cube</fact3> = 36 ounces
* **Small cubes:** <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>0.5 ounces/small cube</fact4> = 7 ounces
* **Tiny cubes:**  Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes (<fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>), they use 0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces per cube.  To find the number of tiny cubes, we subtract the number of other cubes from the total: <fact6>47 total cubes</fact6> - <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes.

Now, let's find the total ounces used: 126 ounces + 36 ounces + 7 ounces + 3 ounces = 172 ounces.

Finally, subtract the total ounces used from the initial amount of water to find how much is left: <fact1>337 ounces</fact1> - 172 ounces = 165 ounces.

Therefore, Luca has 165 ounces of water left.  The answer is {165}.

How many ounces of water does DeShawn have left?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total ounces of water used in the giant, medium, and small cubes.

* **Giant cubes:** <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>15 ounces/giant cube</fact2> = 120 ounces
* **Medium cubes:** <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>5 ounces/medium cube</fact3> = 60 ounces
* **Small cubes:** <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>0.5 ounces/small cube</fact4> = 7 ounces
* **Tiny cubes:**  Since tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes (<fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>), and there are a total of <fact6>46 cubes</fact6>, and we know the number of giant, medium and small cubes, the number of tiny cubes is 46 - 8 - 12 - 14 = 12 tiny cubes.  Each tiny cube uses 0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces. Therefore, tiny cubes use 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces/tiny cube = 3 ounces.

The total amount of water used is 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 ounces.

Deshawn started with <fact1>312 ounces of water</fact1> and used 190 ounces.  Therefore, he has 312 - 190 = 122 ounces of water left.

The answer is {122}.

How many ounces of water does Noah have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant, medium, and small ice cubes.
* Giant cubes: <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>15 ounces/giant cube</fact2> = 120 ounces
* Medium cubes: <fact9>15 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>4 ounces/medium cube</fact3> = 60 ounces
* Small cubes: <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>0.5 ounces/small cube</fact4> = 7 ounces
* Tiny cubes:  Since Noah made a total of <fact6>49 cubes</fact6>, and we know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes: 49 - 8 - 15 - 14 = 12 tiny cubes.  Each tiny cube uses half the amount of water as a small cube, so each tiny cube uses 0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces.  The total water used for tiny cubes is 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces/tiny cube = 3 ounces

Now, let's add up the total amount of water used for all the ice cubes: 120 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 190 ounces.

Finally, subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water to find out how much water Noah has left: <fact1>336 ounces</fact1> - 190 ounces = 146 ounces.

How many ounces of water does Viktor have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each ice cube size. Viktor makes <fact7>12 giant cubes</fact7>, each using <fact2>12 ounces</fact2> of water. So, the giant cubes use 12 * 12 = 144 ounces.  He makes <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9>, each using <fact3>4 ounces</fact3>, so the medium cubes use 12 * 4 = 48 ounces. He makes <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8>, each using <fact4>1/2 ounce</fact4>, using a total of 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.  Tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes (<fact5>half of 1/2 ounce</fact5>), so each tiny cube uses 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 ounces.

The total number of giant, medium, and small cubes is 12 + 12 + 14 = 38 cubes. Since Viktor made <fact6>50 total ice cubes</fact6>, the number of tiny cubes is 50 - 38 = 12 cubes. The 12 tiny cubes use 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces of water.

The total amount of water used is 144 + 48 + 7 + 3 = 202 ounces.

Viktor started with <fact1>313 ounces of water</fact1> and used 202 ounces. Therefore, Viktor has 313 - 202 = 111 ounces of water left.

How many ounces of water does Alejandro have left?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total ounces used for the giant, medium, and small cubes.

* **Giant cubes:**  Alejandro made <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7>, each using <fact2>14 ounces</fact2>, so that's 9 * 14 = 126 ounces.
* **Medium cubes:** He made <fact9>15 medium cubes</fact9>, each using <fact3>6 ounces</fact3>, totaling 15 * 6 = 90 ounces.
* **Small cubes:** He made <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8>, each using <fact4>1/2 ounce</fact4>, for a total of 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces.

The number of tiny cubes can be found by subtracting the number of other cubes from the total: <fact6>50 total cubes</fact6> - <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>15 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes.

* **Tiny cubes:** Each tiny cube uses half the amount of water as a small cube (<fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>), meaning each uses 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 ounces.  Therefore, 12 tiny cubes use 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces.

Now, let's find the total ounces of water used: 126 + 90 + 7 + 3 = 226 ounces.

Finally, subtract the total ounces used from the initial amount to find how many ounces are left: <fact1>309 ounces</fact1> - 226 ounces = 83 ounces.

Therefore, Alejandro has 83 ounces of water left. The answer is {83}.

How many ounces of water does Oliver have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the amount of water used for each type of ice cube.  Oliver used <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>14 ounces/giant cube</fact2> = 140 ounces of water for giant cubes.  He used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>4 ounces/medium cube</fact3> = 48 ounces of water for medium cubes.  For <fact4>small cubes</fact4>, he used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * (2/4 ounces/small cube) = 7 ounces of water.  Since <fact5>tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes</fact5>, each tiny cube uses (2/4)/2 = 1/4 ounce of water.

The total number of tiny cubes is <fact6>48 total cubes</fact6> - <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. Therefore, the amount of water used for tiny cubes is 12 tiny cubes * (1/4 ounce/tiny cube) = 3 ounces.

The total amount of water used is 140 ounces + 48 ounces + 7 ounces + 3 ounces = 198 ounces.

Finally, to find out how much water Oliver has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount: <fact1>326 ounces</fact1> - 198 ounces = 128 ounces.

Therefore, Oliver has 128 ounces of water left. The answer is {128}.

How many more bowls does Ali need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, let's calculate the capacity of each plate. Since each plate holds twice the number of crackers a bowl holds, each plate holds 2 * <fact1>40 crackers</fact1> = 80 crackers.

Next, let's find the total number of crackers that can be held by the available bowls and plates.  Ali has <fact4>8 bowls</fact4>, each holding <fact1>40 crackers</fact1>, for a total of 8 * 40 = 320 crackers.  Initially, he has <fact5>5 plates</fact5>, each holding 80 crackers, for a total of 5 * 80 = 400 crackers. However, <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, leaving him with only 3 plates, which can hold 3 * 80 = 240 crackers.  Therefore, the combined capacity of the bowls and plates is 320 + 240 = 560 crackers.

Ali starts with <fact3>675 crackers</fact3>. After <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, he has 675 crackers that need to be placed in bowls and plates,  with a total capacity of 560. 

Then, <fact7>Ali eats one-ninth of all the crackers</fact7>, meaning he eats (1/9) * 675 = 75 crackers.  This leaves him with 675 - 75 = 600 crackers.

To determine how many more bowls he needs, we must find how many crackers are left to be placed: 600 crackers - 560 cracker capacity = 40 crackers

Since each bowl holds <fact1>40 crackers</fact1>, Ali needs 40 crackers / 40 crackers/bowl = 1 more bowl.

Therefore, Ali needs 1 more bowl. The answer is {1}.

How many more <fact5>bowls</fact5> does Sanjay need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, let's calculate the capacity of each plate.  Each plate holds three times the number of almonds a bowl holds, so each plate holds 3 * <fact2>30 almonds</fact2> = 90 almonds.

Next, let's determine the total capacity of the plates before they broke. Sanjay initially had <fact6>3 plates</fact6>, each holding 90 almonds, for a total plate capacity of 3 * 90 = 270 almonds.

After <fact7>2 plates broke</fact7>, the remaining plate capacity is 90 almonds.

The total initial capacity of bowls is <fact5>12 bowls</fact5> * <fact2>30 almonds/bowl</fact2> = 360 almonds.

Combining the bowl and plate capacities, before any almonds are eaten or plates break, the total capacity is 360 + 270 = 630 almonds.  Since Sanjay has <fact4>675 almonds</fact4>, he has enough to fill all the bowls and plates.

After the plates break, the total capacity is now 360 + 90 = 450 almonds.

Sanjay then <fact8>eats one-ninth of his almonds</fact8>, which is (1/9) * <fact4>675 almonds</fact4> = 75 almonds.  This leaves him with 675 - 75 = 600 almonds.

To determine how many more bowls Sanjay needs, we first find out how many almonds need to be placed in bowls: 600 almonds - 90 almonds (plate capacity) = 510 almonds.

Finally, we divide the number of almonds that need to be put into bowls by the capacity of each bowl: 510 almonds / <fact2>30 almonds/bowl</fact2> = 17 bowls.

Since Sanjay already has <fact5>12 bowls</fact5>, he needs 17 - 12 = 5 more bowls.

Carlos then <fact7>eats one-fifth of all the crackers</fact7>. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, let's determine the cracker capacity of the tables. Each table can hold three times the number of crackers a bowl can hold, which is 3 * <fact1>20 crackers/bowl</fact1> = 60 crackers/table.

Carlos initially had <fact5>4 tables</fact5>, but <fact6>2 tables broke</fact6>, leaving him with 4 - 2 = 2 tables.  These 2 tables can hold 2 tables * 60 crackers/table = 120 crackers.

His <fact4>13 bowls</fact4> can hold 13 bowls * <fact1>20 crackers/bowl</fact1> = 260 crackers.

In total, Carlos' bowls and tables can hold 120 crackers + 260 crackers = 380 crackers.

It takes them <fact2>16 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the park is. It takes them another <fact3>22 minutes</fact3> to get to the mall. When they reach the mall, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the mall again. Once they reach the mall for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the gym without being late?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total time taken to reach the mall the first time. This involves the time to reach the park (<fact2>16 minutes</fact2>) plus the time to get from the park to the mall (<fact3>22 minutes</fact3>), which is 16 + 22 = 38 minutes.

Returning home from the mall takes the same amount of time as going to the mall from home, so that's another 38 minutes.

Going back to the mall from home adds another 38 minutes.

Therefore, the total time spent traveling to the mall and back is 38 + 38 + 38 = 114 minutes.

To determine how much time remains before they are late for the gym, we subtract the total time spent going to and from the mall from the total time available: <fact1>137 minutes</fact1> - 114 minutes = 23 minutes.  

So, once they reach the mall for the second time, they have 23 minutes to get to the gym without being late. The answer is {23}.

Ibrahim has <fact5>54 dogs</fact5>, each having <fact6>13 puppies with spots</fact6>. After a visit to the vet, Mateo discovered that <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7> that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Answer: First, let's find the number of unspotted puppies Mateo initially had.  Mateo had a total of <fact1>149 puppies</fact1>, and <fact2>25 had spots</fact2>, so he had 149 - 25 = 124 unspotted puppies.  After the vet visit, half of these gained spots: 124 / 2 = 62 puppies.  So Mateo now has 25 + 62 = 87 spotted puppies.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies from all the dog owners.  Mateo has 149 puppies. Mohammed has <fact3>49 puppies</fact3>. Ibrahim has <fact5>54 dogs</fact5> * <fact6>13 spotted puppies per dog</fact6> = 702 spotted puppies.  The total number of puppies is 149 + 49 + 702 = 900.

Now let's find the total number of puppies with spots.  This is Mateo's 87 spotted puppies + Mohammed's <fact4>12 spotted puppies</fact4> + Ibrahim's 702 spotted puppies = 87 + 12 + 702 = 801.

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots. This is (total number of spotted puppies / total number of puppies) * 100% = (801 / 900) * 100% = 89%.

Therefore, 89% of all the puppies have spots. The answer is {89}.

After a visit to the vet, Oscar discovered that <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7> that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Answer: First, let's find the number of Oscar's unspotted puppies. Oscar has a total of <fact1>130 puppies</fact1>, and <fact2>28 have spots</fact2>, so 130 - 28 = 102 puppies do not have spots initially.  After the vet visit, half of these unspotted puppies, 102/2 = 51 puppies, are discovered to have spots.  Therefore, Oscar now has 28 + 51 = 79 puppies with spots.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies. Oscar has 130 puppies, Andre has <fact3>44 puppies</fact3>, and Jin has <fact5>66 dogs</fact5> * <fact6>11 puppies/dog</fact6> = 726 puppies.  The total number of puppies is 130 + 44 + 726 = 900 puppies.

Andre has <fact4>14 puppies with spots</fact4>.

The total number of puppies with spots is 79 (Oscar) + 14 (Andre) + 726 (Jin) = 819 puppies.

Finally, let's calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.  The percentage is (total puppies with spots / total number of puppies) * 100% = (819 / 900) * 100% = 91%.

Therefore, 91% of all the puppies have spots. The answer is {91}.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of unspotted puppies Leon initially had.  Leon had a total of <fact1>99 puppies</fact1>, and <fact2>23 had spots</fact2>, so he had 99 - 23 = 76 unspotted puppies.  After the vet visit, half of these, or 76 / 2 = 38, were found to have spots. So Leon now has 23 + 38 = 61 puppies with spots.

Next, let's find the total number of puppies James has with spots:  <fact4>12 puppies</fact4>.

Now let's calculate the total number of puppies Hiroshi has with spots: <fact5>58 dogs</fact5> * <fact6>11 puppies/dog</fact6> = 638 puppies.

Let's find the total number of puppies: Leon's puppies (<fact1>99</fact1>) + James's puppies (<fact3>53</fact3>) + Hiroshi's puppies (638) = 790 puppies.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of puppies with spots:  Leon's spotted puppies (61) + James's spotted puppies (12) + Hiroshi's spotted puppies (638) = 711 puppies.

The percentage of puppies with spots is (711 / 790) * 100% = 90%.

After a visit to the vet, Pavel discovered that <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7> that were not visible before. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Answer: First, let's find the number of unspotted puppies Pavel initially had.  Pavel had a total of <fact1>100 puppies</fact1>, and <fact2>22 had spots</fact2>, so he had 100 - 22 = 78 unspotted puppies.  <fact7>Half of these unspotted puppies were later discovered to have spots</fact7>, so an additional 78 / 2 = 39 puppies were added to the spotted count.

Next, let's calculate the total number of spotted puppies from each dog owner:

* Pavel: Initially 22 + 39 = 61 spotted puppies
* Hiroshi: <fact4>15 spotted puppies</fact4>
* Santiago: <fact5>55 dogs</fact5> * <fact6>12 puppies/dog</fact6> = 660 spotted puppies

Answer: First, let's find the number of unspotted puppies Kai initially had.  From <fact1>, Kai started with 135 puppies, and 17 had spots, meaning 135 - 17 = 118 puppies did not have visible spots.  Then, according to <fact4>, half of these unspotted puppies (118/2 = 59 puppies) were found to actually have spots. So, Kai now has 17 + 59 = 76 puppies with spots.

Next, let's calculate the total number of puppies from Arash: <fact2>Arash has 43 puppies with 14 having spots.</fact2>

Now let's calculate the total number of puppies from Carlos: <fact3>Carlos has 54 dogs * 13 puppies/dog = 702 puppies with spots.</fact3>

On <fact9>Thursday</fact9>, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined. What was Ali's <fact10>average daily earning</fact10>?

Answer:

First, let's determine the number of boxes of orange pies and muffins sold each day:

* **Wednesday:** Ali sold 23 boxes of orange pies (<fact8>23 boxes of orange pie</fact8>) and 22 + 13 = 35 boxes of muffins (<fact7>13 more boxes of muffins than on Tuesday</fact7>).

* **Tuesday:** Ali sold 22 boxes of muffins (<fact4>22 boxes of muffin</fact4>) and 23 - 13 = 10 boxes of orange pies (<fact5>13 fewer boxes of orange pie than on Wednesday</fact5>).

* **Thursday:** Ali sold 35 + 23 + 22 + 10 = 90 total boxes of items across Tuesday and Wednesday.  Therefore, he sold 90 boxes on Thursday (<fact9>Thursday</fact9>, he sold as much as he did in the past two days combined).

Now let's calculate the earnings for each day:

* **Tuesday:** (22 muffins * €9) + (10 pies * €32) = €198 + €320 = €518
* **Wednesday:** (35 muffins * €9) + (23 pies * €32) = €315 + €736 = €1051
* **Thursday:** €518 + €1051 = €1569

Finally, let's calculate Ali's average daily earning:

* **Total Earnings:** €518 + €1051 + €1569 = €3138
* **Average Daily Earnings:** €3138 / 3 days = €1046

Therefore, Ali's average daily earning was €1046.  The answer is {1046}.

On the sidewalk, Fatima walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Fatima's speed has decreased by half <fact5>both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Fatima's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Due to her injury, her current speed on the beach is s/2.  Since she walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 44 minutes doing so, her current speed on the beach is:

Speed_beach = Distance_beach / Time_beach = <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles/minute

Her original speed on the beach was therefore 2 * 0.25 miles/minute = 0.5 miles/minute.

According to <fact4>the problem</fact4>, her original speed on the sidewalk was three times her beach speed, which is 3 * 0.5 miles/minute = 1.5 miles/minute.  Due to the injury, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles/minute / 2 = 0.75 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is:

Time_sidewalk = Distance_sidewalk / Speed_sidewalk = <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 0.75 miles/minute = 20 minutes

Therefore, the total time to complete her walk is the sum of her time on the beach and her time on the sidewalk:

The answer is {64}.

If <fact6>40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Ananya's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Because of <fact4>her walking speed on the sidewalk being twice her beach speed</fact4>, her original sidewalk speed was 2s. Due to <fact5>her injury reducing her speed by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is s/2, and her current speed on the sidewalk is (2s)/2 = s.

We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles on the beach</fact2>, and it takes her <fact6>40 minutes</fact6>.  Therefore, her current beach speed (s/2) can be calculated as:

Speed = Distance / Time 
s/2 = 10 miles / 40 minutes = 0.25 miles/minute

Since her sidewalk speed is 's', her current sidewalk speed is 2 * 0.25 miles/minute = 0.5 miles/minute.

She walks <fact3>10 miles on the sidewalk</fact3>, so the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 miles / 0.5 miles/minute = 20 minutes

Therefore, her total walking time is the beach time plus the sidewalk time: 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.  It takes Ananya 60 minutes to complete her entire <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1>.

On Tuesday, Luis is going to sell grapes in <fact5>boxes of 15 grapes each</fact5>. He is going to sell <fact6>each box for $10</fact6>. How much is Luis going to make?

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of grapes Luis picked on Sunday.  He picked quintuple the amount he picked on Friday, which was <fact1>55 grapes</fact1>, so on Sunday he picked 55 * 5 = 275 grapes.

Next, let's find the total number of grapes picked from Friday to Sunday: <fact1>55 grapes (Friday)</fact1> + <fact2>170 grapes (Saturday)</fact2> + 275 grapes (Sunday) = 500 grapes.

Now we calculate how many grapes Luis picked on Monday. He picked half the amount from the previous three days, which is 500 / 2 = 250 grapes.

Therefore, the total number of grapes Luis picked over the four days is 500 + 250 = 750 grapes.

Finally, to determine how much money Luis will make, we need to calculate the number of boxes.  Since each box contains <fact5>15 grapes</fact5>, he can make 750 / 15 = 50 boxes.

With <fact6>each box selling for $10</fact6>, Luis will make 50 boxes * $10/box = $500.

If he watched <fact12>24 hours of TV in all</fact12>, how many <fact4>30-minute episodes</fact4> did he watch on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Sunday through Friday, excluding Tuesday.

* **Sunday and Monday:**  He watched 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours of TV.
* **Wednesday:** He watched a 2-hour episode + a 1-hour episode = 3 hours of TV.
* **Thursday:** He watched 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours of TV.
* **Friday:** He watched 3 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 1.5 hours of TV.

Total TV time excluding Tuesday: 8 + 3 + 9 + 1.5 = 21.5 hours.

Since he watched a total of <fact12>24 hours of TV</fact12>, the time spent watching TV on Tuesday was 24 hours - 21.5 hours = 2.5 hours.  Each episode on Tuesday was <fact4>30 minutes</fact4> or 0.5 hours long. Therefore, he watched 2.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 5 episodes on Tuesday. The answer is {5}.

If he watched <fact6>31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many <fact2>60-minute episodes</fact2> did he watch on Friday?

Answer: Let's calculate Bodhi's total TV watching time excluding Friday:

* **Wednesday and Thursday:** He watched two nights of 3-hour episodes each, totaling 2 nights * 3 hours/night = 6 hours.
* **Saturday:** He watched one 5-hour episode and one 60-minute (1-hour) episode, totaling 5 + 1 = 6 hours.
* **Sunday:** He watched four 4-hour episodes, totaling 4 episodes * 4 hours/episode = 16 hours.
* **Monday:** He watched four 30-minute episodes, totaling 4 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 2 hours.

His total viewing time on these days was 6 + 6 + 16 + 2 = 30 hours.

Since he watched a total of <fact6>31 hours</fact6> of TV, his Friday viewing time must have been 31 hours - 30 hours = 1 hour.  Because each episode on Friday was <fact2>60 minutes (1 hour)</fact2> long, he watched 1 hour / 1 hour/episode = 1 episode on Friday.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins of wool needed for each grandchild.  For each grandchild, Sakura needs:

* Vest: <fact3>5 skeins</fact3>
* Cardigan: <fact4>4 skeins</fact4>
* Shawl: <fact5>10 skeins</fact5>
* Gloves: <fact6>12 skeins</fact6>
* Mittens: <fact7>9 skeins</fact7>

Total per grandchild: 5 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 9 = 40 skeins

Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 40 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 160 skeins for her grandchildren.

Next, let's calculate the wool needed for her jackets. She needs <fact9>4 skeins</fact9>/jacket * <fact8>2 jackets</fact8> = 8 skeins for herself.

Therefore, the total number of skeins Sakura needs is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins.

Now, let's calculate the cost.  Since each <fact10>dozen (12) skeins costs $9</fact10>, the cost of 168 skeins is (168/12) * $9 = 14 * $9 = $126.

Finally, let's apply the discount. Since the total cost ($126) is <fact11>over $100</fact11>, Sakura receives a <fact11>$20 discount</fact11>.  So, the final amount Sakura should pay is $126 - $20 = $106.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Valeria pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins needed for the grandchildren's winter wear.  For each grandchild, Valeria needs <fact2>6 (tunic)</fact2> + <fact3>6 (hat)</fact3> + <fact4>12 (shawl)</fact4> + <fact5>12 (booties)</fact5> + <fact6>13 (gloves)</fact6> = 49 skeins. Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs a total of 49 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 196 skeins for the grandchildren.

Next, Valeria needs <fact8>4 skeins/jacket</fact8> * <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> = 8 skeins for her jackets.

Therefore, the total number of skeins Valeria needs is 196 + 8 = 204 skeins.

To find the cost, we divide the total number of skeins by 12 (since each <fact9>dozen costs $9</fact9>) to find the number of dozens: 204 skeins / 12 skeins/dozen = 17 dozens.

The cost before the discount is 17 dozens * <fact9>$9/dozen</fact9> = $153.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins needed for each grandchild.  For each grandchild, Valentina needs: <fact3>5 (shawl)</fact3> + <fact4>3 (tunic)</fact4> + <fact5>9 (cardigan)</fact5> + <fact6>10 (booties)</fact6> + <fact7>11 (gloves)</fact7> = 38 skeins.

Since she has <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, the total for the grandchildren is 38 skeins/grandchild * 5 grandchildren = 190 skeins.

Valentina also needs <fact8>two jackets</fact8> for herself, each requiring <fact9>7 skeins</fact9>, for a total of 7 skeins/jacket * 2 jackets = 14 skeins.

Therefore, the total number of skeins Valentina needs is 190 + 14 = 204 skeins.

To find the cost, we divide the total skeins by 12 (since <fact10>a dozen skeins cost $7</fact10>)  204 skeins / 12 skeins/dozen = 17 dozens.

The cost before discount is 17 dozens * $7/dozen = $119.

Since the total cost ($119) is <fact11>over $100</fact11>, Valentina receives a <fact11>$20 discount</fact11>.

Therefore, Valentina should pay $119 - $20 = $99.

She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>225 calories</fact9> = 1125 calories.  Therefore, she needs 2250 - 1125 = 1125 more calories.

Now, let's figure out how many calories are in one ounce of bread.  A <fact2>300-ounce bag</fact2> has 5 servings, so each serving is 300/5 = 60 ounces.  Since each serving has <fact1>225 calories</fact1>, one ounce of bread contains 225/60 = 3.75 calories.

Carlos needs 2250 more calories, so he needs 2250 / 3.75 = 600 ounces of bread.  Zahra needs 1125 more calories, so she needs 1125 / 3.75 = 300 ounces of bread.

Finally, the difference in the amount of bread Carlos and Zahra need is 600 - 300 = 300 ounces.

The answer is {300}.

The healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3>. <fact4>Ibrahim weighs 190 lbs</fact4>, and he has already consumed <fact5>950 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>200 calories</fact6> through exercise. <fact7>Priya weighs 170 lbs</fact7>, and she has already consumed <fact8>1100 in food</fact8> and <fact9>250 calories in ice cream</fact9>. How many more grams of popcorn does Ibrahim need to consume than Priya?

Answer: First, let's calculate Ibrahim's calorie needs.  His healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>190 lbs</fact4> = 2850 calories. He's already consumed <fact5>950 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>200 calories</fact6>, so his net calorie consumption is 950 - 200 = 750 calories.  Therefore, he needs 2850 - 750 = 2100 more calories.

Next, let's calculate Priya's calorie needs. Her healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>170 lbs</fact7> = 2550 calories. She's consumed <fact8>1100 calories in food</fact8> and <fact9>250 calories in ice cream</fact9>, for a total of 1100 + 250 = 1350 calories.  Therefore, she needs 2550 - 1350 = 1200 more calories.

Now, let's figure out how many grams of popcorn each person needs.  One serving of popcorn has <fact1>300 calories</fact1>, and a bag has <fact2>5 servings</fact2>, meaning one bag contains 300 * 5 = 1500 calories.

Ibrahim needs 2100 calories, so he needs 2100 / 1500 = 1.4 bags of popcorn.
Priya needs 1200 calories, so she needs 1200 / 1500 = 0.8 bags of popcorn.

Since one bag of popcorn weighs 325 grams, Ibrahim needs 1.4 * 325 = 455 grams, and Priya needs 0.8 * 325 = 260 grams.

Therefore, Ibrahim needs 455 - 260 = 195 more grams of popcorn than Priya.

How many more ounces of breads does Yuki need to consume than Jasmine?

Answer:  First, let's determine Yuki's calorie needs.  Yuki's healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>210 lbs</fact4> = 3150 calories.  He's already consumed <fact5>1050 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, so his net calorie consumption is 1050 - 150 = 900 calories. Therefore, Yuki needs 3150 - 900 = 2250 more calories.

Next, let's calculate Jasmine's calorie needs. Jasmine's healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>140 lbs</fact7> = 2100 calories.  She's consumed <fact8>900 calories in food</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1100 calories.  Therefore, Jasmine needs 2100 - 1100 = 1000 more calories.

Now, let's figure out how many servings of bread each person needs.  Each serving of bread contains <fact1>250 calories</fact1>.  Yuki needs 2250 calories / 250 calories/serving = 9 servings. Jasmine needs 1000 calories / 250 calories/serving = 4 servings.

Since a <fact2>350-ounce bag has 5 servings</fact2>,  Yuki needs 9 servings / 5 servings/bag * 350 ounces/bag = 630 ounces of bread. Jasmine needs 4 servings / 5 servings/bag * 350 ounces/bag = 280 ounces of bread.

Finally, the difference in the amount of bread Yuki and Jasmine need is 630 ounces - 280 ounces = 350 ounces.


Therefore, Yuki needs 350 more ounces of bread than Jasmine.  The answer is {350}.

How many more grams of popcorn does Arash need to consume than Mei?

Answer: First, let's calculate Arash's and Mei's daily calorie needs based on their weight and the <fact3>15 calories per pound target</fact3>.

Arash: <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> * <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> = 3000 calories

Mei: <fact7>180 lbs</fact7> * <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> = 2700 calories

Next, let's determine how many calories Arash and Mei have remaining to consume:

Arash: 3000 calories - (<fact5>1200 calories consumed</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories burned</fact6>) = 3000 - 1050 = 1950 calories

Mei: 2700 calories - (<fact8>900 calories consumed</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories consumed</fact9>) = 2700 - 1075 = 1625 calories

Now, we need to find out how many servings of popcorn each person needs:

Arash: 1950 calories / <fact1>325 calories/serving</fact1> = 6 servings

Mei: 1625 calories / <fact1>325 calories/serving</fact1> ≈ 5 servings

Finally, we'll calculate how many grams of popcorn each needs and then determine the difference:

Since a <fact2>100-gram bag contains 4 servings</fact2>:

Arash: 6 servings * (100 grams / 4 servings) = 150 grams

Mei: 5 servings * (100 grams / 4 servings) = 125 grams

How many more grams of popcorn does Arjun need to consume than Elena?

Answer:  First, let's calculate Arjun's and Elena's daily calorie needs based on their weights and the <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> target:

* **Arjun:** <fact4>210 lbs</fact4> * <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> = 3150 calories
* **Elena:** <fact7>180 lbs</fact7> * <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> = 2700 calories

Next, let's determine how many calories each person has remaining to consume:

* **Arjun:** 3150 calories (needed) - <fact5>1000 calories (consumed)</fact5> + <fact6>100 calories (burned)</fact6> = 2250 calories remaining
* **Elena:** 2700 calories (needed) - <fact8>900 calories (consumed)</fact8> - <fact9>150 calories (ice cream)</fact9> = 1650 calories remaining

Now, let's figure out how many servings of popcorn each person needs:

* **Arjun:** 2250 calories / <fact1>150 calories/serving</fact1> = 15 servings
* **Elena:** 1650 calories / <fact1>150 calories/serving</fact1> = 11 servings

Finally, let's convert servings to grams using the information that a <fact2>300-gram bag has 5 servings</fact2>:

* **Arjun:** 15 servings * (300 grams / 5 servings) = 900 grams
* **Elena:** 11 servings * (300 grams / 5 servings) = 660 grams

The difference in popcorn consumption is: 900 grams - 660 grams = 240 grams.  Therefore, Arjun needs to consume 240 more grams of popcorn than Elena.

How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the daily pizza consumption of the family. The uncle and spouse together eat <fact1>16</fact1> + <fact2>16</fact2> = 32 pizzas per day.  The grandchild eats half of this, which is 32 / 2 = <fact3>16 pizzas per day</fact3>.  Therefore, the family's total daily consumption is 32 + 16 = 48 pizzas per day.

Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 48 pizzas/day * 30 days/month = 1440 pizzas in the first month.

In the second month, they reduce their consumption. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by <fact4>25%</fact4>.  This means they eat 48 pizzas/day * 0.75 = 36 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 36 pizzas/day * 15 days = 540 pizzas.

How many hamburgers does this family eat in two months?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the daily hamburger consumption of the family before the diet. The uncle and spouse together eat <fact1>24</fact1> + <fact2>24</fact2> = 48 hamburgers per day. The grandchild eats half of this, which is 48/2 = 24 hamburgers per day.  Therefore, the family's total daily consumption before the diet is 48 + 24 = 72 hamburgers per day.

Assuming a 30-day month, in the first month, the family eats 72 hamburgers/day * 30 days/month = 2160 hamburgers.

In the second month, they reduce their consumption.  For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce consumption by <fact3>75%</fact3>. This means they eat 25% (100% - 75%) of their original consumption: 0.25 * 72 hamburgers/day = 18 hamburgers/day. Over 15 days, this is 18 hamburgers/day * 15 days = 270 hamburgers.

For the second half of the month (another 15 days), they reduce consumption by an additional <fact4>50%</fact4> from the already reduced rate of 18 hamburgers/day.  A 50% reduction from 18 means they eat 9 hamburgers/day (18 * 0.5 = 9). Over 15 days, they eat 9 hamburgers/day * 15 days = 135 hamburgers.

In total, during the second month, they eat 270 + 135 = 405 hamburgers.

Over the two months, the family eats 2160 (month 1) + 405 (month 2) = 2565 hamburgers.

How many burritos does this family eat in two months?


Answer:

First, let's calculate the daily burrito consumption of the family before the diet.  The father and wife eat a combined <fact1>5</fact1> + <fact2>25</fact2> = 30 burritos per day.  Their daughter eats one-third of this amount, which is 30/<fact3>3</fact3> = 10 burritos per day.  Therefore, the family's total daily consumption is 30 + 10 = 40 burritos per day.

In the first month (30 days), the family consumes 40 burritos/day * 30 days = 1200 burritos.

For the second month, the family is on a diet.  In the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by <fact4>60%</fact4>. This means they eat 40 burritos/day * (1 - 0.60) = 16 burritos per day.  Their total consumption for the first half is 16 burritos/day * 15 days = 240 burritos.

In the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an additional <fact5>50%</fact5> from the already reduced amount.  So, they eat 16 burritos/day * (1 - 0.50) = 8 burritos per day. Their total consumption for the second half is 8 burritos/day * 15 days = 120 burritos.

The total consumption for the second month is 240 + 120 = 360 burritos.

Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed in two months is 1200 (first month) + 360 (second month) = 1560 burritos.

How many sushi rolls does this family eat in two months?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the daily sushi consumption of the grandfather and his partner: <fact1>10 rolls/day</fact1> + <fact2>15 rolls/day</fact2> = 25 rolls/day.

Next, we determine the son's daily consumption:  <fact3>four-fifths</fact3> of 25 rolls/day is (4/5) * 25 = 20 rolls/day.

Therefore, the family's total daily consumption before the diet is 10 + 15 + 20 = 45 rolls/day.

In the first month (assuming 30 days), they consume 45 rolls/day * 30 days = 1350 sushi rolls.

During the second month, they reduce their consumption.  In the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by <fact4>20%</fact4>.  This means they eat 45 rolls/day * (1 - 0.20) = 36 rolls/day.  Over 15 days, this is 36 rolls/day * 15 days = 540 sushi rolls.

In the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an additional <fact5>25%</fact5> from the already reduced amount. So they eat 36 rolls/day * (1 - 0.25) = 27 rolls/day.  Over 15 days, this is 27 rolls/day * 15 days = 405 sushi rolls.

The total consumption for the second month is 540 + 405 = 945 sushi rolls.

Therefore, the total sushi rolls eaten in two months is 1350 + 945 = 2295 sushi rolls.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by <fact4>20% for the first half of the month</fact4>, and then by an <fact5>additional 75%</fact5> for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, let's calculate the daily pizza consumption of the family. The father eats <fact1>20 pizzas</fact1>, the wife eats <fact2>5 pizzas</fact2>, for a combined total of 25 pizzas per day. The daughter eats one-fifth of this amount, which is 25/5 = 5 pizzas per day.  Therefore, the family consumes a total of 20 + 5 + 5 = 30 pizzas per day.

A month has approximately 30 days. In the first month, the family consumes 30 pizzas/day * 30 days/month = 900 pizzas.

In the second month, the family starts a diet. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by <fact4>20%</fact4>.  This means they eat 30 pizzas/day * 0.8 = 24 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 24 pizzas/day * 15 days = 360 pizzas.

For the second half of the month (another 15 days), they reduce their consumption by an <fact5>additional 75%</fact5> from the already reduced amount of 24 pizzas per day.  This is a 75% reduction from 24 pizzas, or 24 * 0.25 = 6 pizzas per day. Over 15 days, they consume 6 pizzas/day * 15 days = 90 pizzas.

Therefore, in the second month the family eats 360 + 90 = 450 pizzas.

Over the two months, the family consumes 900 + 450 = 1350 pizzas.  The answer is {1350}.

How many hamburgers does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, let's calculate the daily hamburger consumption of the family. The father and wife eat a combined <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact2>20</fact2> = 45 hamburgers per day.  Their daughter eats (2/3) * 45 = 30 hamburgers per day.  Therefore, the family eats a total of 45 + 30 = 75 hamburgers per day.

Assuming a 30-day month, in the first month, the family consumes 75 hamburgers/day * 30 days/month = 2250 hamburgers.

In the second month, they reduce consumption.  The first half of the month (15 days) sees a <fact4>20%</fact4> reduction, meaning they consume 75 * (1 - 0.20) = 60 hamburgers per day.  Over 15 days, this is 60 * 15 = 900 hamburgers.

The second half of the month (15 days) sees an additional <fact5>25%</fact5> reduction from the already reduced amount.  This means they consume 60 * (1 - 0.25) = 45 hamburgers per day. Over 15 days, this is 45 * 15 = 675 hamburgers.

In total for the second month, they eat 900 + 675 = 1575 hamburgers.

Over the two months, the family consumes 2250 + 1575 = 3825 hamburgers.  Therefore, the answer is {3825}.

Sanjay works overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>20% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day.  <fact2>25% of 32 emails don't need a response</fact2>, which is 0.25 * 32 = 8 emails.  This means 32 - 8 = 24 emails require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many emails Sanjay responds to daily. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails that require a response. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

Now, let's calculate the number of emails Sanjay responds to during the first three days of the work week. For three days, he responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails.

On the last day, <fact5>Sanjay responds to 20% more emails than usual</fact5>.  This is an increase of 0.20 * 10 = 2 emails. So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails.

Answer:  First, let's find the number of emails requiring a response each day.  <fact2>25% of 32 emails don't need a response</fact2>, which is 0.25 * 32 = 8 emails.  This means that 32 - 8 = 24 emails require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many of these Hiroshi responds to. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails requiring a response. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

So, for a normal day, Hiroshi responds to 10 emails.  For a <fact4>5-day work week</fact4>, he'd normally respond to 10 emails/day * 5 days = 50 emails.

However, on the last day, <fact5>he responds to 30% more emails</fact5>.  30% of 10 is 0.30 * 10 = 3 emails. Therefore, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 3 = 13 emails.

The store offers a <fact12>10% discount on paint for members</fact12>. How much more money does Valeria have left than Viktor after they leave the store?


Answer: Let's calculate Valeria's expenses first.

* **Anchors:** <fact2>15 anchors</fact2> * <fact3>₣0.35/anchor</fact3> = ₣5.25
* **Nails:** <fact4>8 nails</fact4> * <fact5>₣0.64/nail</fact5> = ₣5.12
* **Paint:**  <fact6>8 gallons</fact6> * (assuming the price per gallon of paint is the same as Viktor's, this is not specified, so we must make an assumption. if the question specified different prices, the answer would change.) <fact9>₣7.0/gallon</fact9> = ₣56

Valeria's total expenses: ₣5.25 + ₣5.12 + ₣56 = ₣66.37

Valeria's money left: <fact1>₣97.37</fact1> - ₣66.37 = ₣31.00

Now let's calculate Viktor's expenses. Since Viktor is a member, he gets a discount on paint.

* **Paint:** <fact8>10 gallons</fact8> * <fact9>₣7.0/gallon</fact9> * (1 - <fact12>0.10</fact12>) = 10 * 7 * 0.9 = ₣63
* **Pencils:** <fact10>4 pencils</fact10> * <fact11>₣2/pencil</fact11> = ₣8

Viktor's total expenses: ₣63 + ₣8 = ₣71

Viktor's money left: <fact7>₣90</fact7> - ₣71 = ₣19

The difference in money left: ₣31.00 - ₣19 = ₣12.00

Therefore, Valeria has ₣12.00 more left than Viktor.  The answer is {12}.

The store offers a <fact10>10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Kimia have left than Yusuf after they leave the store?

Answer: Let's calculate Kimia's spending first.

* **Nails:** <fact3>16 nails</fact3> * <fact5>¥0.4/nail</fact5> = ¥6.40
* **Washers:** <fact4>9 washers</fact4> * ¥0.65/washer = ¥5.85
* **Paint:**  Kimia is not a member, so she pays full price for paint.  The cost of paint is not explicitly given but is implied by Yusuf's purchase.  We assume the price is ¥7/gallon.  Therefore, <fact6>8 gallons</fact6> * ¥7/gallon = ¥56.00
* **Kimia's Total Spending:** ¥6.40 + ¥5.85 + ¥56.00 = ¥68.25
* **Kimia's Money Left:** <fact2>¥91.25</fact2> - ¥68.25 = ¥23.00

Now let's calculate Yusuf's spending.

* **Paint:** Yusuf is a member, so he gets a 10% discount.  <fact8>10 gallons</fact8> * ¥7/gallon = ¥70.00. The discount is ¥70.00 * 0.10 = ¥7.00.  His final paint cost is ¥70.00 - ¥7.00 = ¥63.00
* **Pencils:** <fact9>4 pencils</fact9> * ¥2/pencil = ¥8.00
* **Yusuf's Total Spending:** ¥63.00 + ¥8.00 = ¥71.00
* **Yusuf's Money Left:** <fact7>¥80</fact7> - ¥71.00 = ¥9.00

Finally, let's find the difference in their remaining money.

* **Difference:** Kimia's remaining money - Yusuf's remaining money = ¥23.00 - ¥9.00 = ¥14.00

Therefore, Kimia has ¥14.00 more money left than Yusuf after they leave the store.  The answer is {14}.

How much younger is Leilani than the average age of all three?

Answer:

First, let's find Ravi's current age using <fact1>Ravi will be 47 in 8 years</fact1>.  His current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old.

Next, let's find Pavel's current age using <fact3>Ravi and Pavel are currently 22 years apart in age</fact3> and the fact that Ravi is younger than Pavel.  Pavel's current age is 39 + 22 = 61 years old.

Now, let's find Leilani's current age using <fact4>Ravi and Leilani are currently 10 years apart in age</fact4> and the fact that Ravi is older than Leilani. Leilani's current age is 39 - 10 = 29 years old.

To find the average age of all three, we add their ages together and divide by 3: (39 + 61 + 29) / 3 = 129 / 3 = 43 years old.

Finally, to determine how much younger Leilani is than the average age, we subtract Leilani's age from the average age: 43 - 29 = 14 years.

Therefore, Leilani is 14 years younger than the average age of all three.

If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>budget</fact1>?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the discounted selling price. Mrs. Smith gets a <fact5>20% discount</fact5> on the <fact2>$500000 selling price</fact2>, which is $500000 * 0.20 = $100000.  So the discounted price is $500000 - $100000 = $400000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee:  <fact3>7% of the discounted selling price</fact3> is $400000 * 0.07 = $28000.

Then, we calculate the transfer fee: <fact4>12% of the discounted selling price</fact4> is $400000 * 0.12 = $48000.

The total cost for Mrs. Smith will be the discounted selling price plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee: $400000 + $28000 + $48000 = $476000.

Finally, we find the difference between the total cost and Mrs. Smith's <fact1>budget</fact1>: $476000 - <fact1>$410000</fact1> = $66000.

Therefore, the total cost will be $66000 more than Mrs. Smith's budget. The answer is {66000}.

If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>25% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, let's calculate the discount Mrs. Lee receives:  <fact5>25%</fact5> of <fact2>$440000</fact2> is (0.25 * $440000) = $110000.  Subtracting this discount from the original selling price gives us the discounted price: $440000 - $110000 = $330000.

Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: <fact3>5%</fact3> of the discounted selling price ($330000) is (0.05 * $330000) = $16500.

The difference between the total cost and Mrs. Smith's <fact1>budget of $310000</fact1> is $421200 - <fact1>$310000</fact1> = $111200.

Therefore, the total cost will be $111200 more than Mrs. Smith's budget.  The answer is {111200}.

33,"Reformatted Question: Ava and Quinn are sisters from Helsinki who love collecting signatures from authors. During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, Ava and Quinn compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Ava has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>2 more weeks</fact4> of spring break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, Ava is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Quinn decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Quinn need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Ava currently has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2>, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>. Together, they have 30 + 37 = 67 signatures. Their goal is to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> by the end of spring break.  This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 67 = 68 signatures in the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Ava's collection will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so over the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> she will collect 5 * 2 = 10 fewer signatures than she did during the first <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>.  We don't know her exact rate during the first 3 weeks, but it's not necessary. We only need to know her reduction from the previous rate.

Therefore, Quinn needs to collect the remaining signatures herself, taking into account Ava's reduced rate: 68 signatures (total needed) - 10 signatures (Ava's reduction) = 58 signatures.  Since there are <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> left, Quinn needs to collect 58 / 2 = 29 signatures per week to reach their goal.

He paid registration fees that amounted to <fact2>3% of the selling price</fact2> and also paid an agent fee that is <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3>. He also paid <fact4>$570,000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and <fact5>$15,000</fact5> for closing costs. Prof. Miller used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: First, we calculate the registration fees: <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$760,000</fact1> is 0.03 * $760,000 = $22,800.

Next, we calculate the agent fee: <fact3>4%</fact3> of <fact1>$760,000</fact1> is 0.04 * $760,000 = $30,400.

The total fees and costs paid by Prof. Miller are the registration fees ($22,800) + the agent fee ($30,400) + the remaining loan amount (<fact4>$570,000</fact4>) + closing costs (<fact5>$15,000</fact5>) = $638,200.

Prof. Miller's net proceeds from the sale are the selling price (<fact1>$760,000</fact1>) minus the total fees and costs ($638,200) which equals $121,800.

This amount ($121,800) was invested in stocks.  After the first year, the stocks gained 10%, so the value increased by 0.10 * $121,800 = $12,180. The value at the end of the first year is $121,800 + $12,180 = $133,980.

After the second year, the stocks gained another 10%, which is 0.10 * $133,980 = $13,398.  Therefore, Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years are $133,980 + $13,398 = $147,378.

Prof. Smith used the net proceeds from selling the house to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Smith's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: First, we calculate the registration fees: <fact2>3% of $560,000</fact2> is 0.03 * $560,000 = $16,800.  Next, we calculate the agent fee: <fact3>4% of $560,000</fact3> is 0.04 * $560,000 = $22,400.  The total expenses before investment are the sum of registration fees, agent fees, the remaining loan amount, and closing costs: $16,800 + $22,400 + <fact4>$440,000</fact4> + <fact5>$15,000</fact5> = $494,200.

Prof. Smith's net proceeds from selling the house are the selling price minus his expenses: <fact1>$560,000</fact1> - $494,200 = $65,800.

Now, we calculate the investment gains.  The stocks gained 10% the first year: $65,800 * 0.10 = $6,580.  So, after the first year, the investment was worth $65,800 + $6,580 = $72,380.  The second year, the investment gained another 10%: $72,380 * 0.10 = $7,238.  Therefore, after two years, Prof. Smith's net proceeds were $72,380 + $7,238 = $79,618.

Leon has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to <fact6>cover a fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Leon still missing?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop per day:  <fact1>¥150 (hotel)</fact1> + <fact2>¥30 (food)</fact2> + <fact3>¥10 (transportation)</fact3> = ¥190 per day. For a 2-day workshop, the total cost is ¥190 * 2 = ¥380.

Next, we subtract the cost covered by Leon's friends.  Since his friends are covering all the food, we need to calculate the daily food cost and then the total food cost for the 2 days.  The daily food cost is <fact2>¥30</fact2>, so for two days this is ¥30 * 2 = ¥60.  The total cost is now ¥380 - ¥60 = ¥320.

Now we consider the youth club's contribution. The youth club covers a fifth (<fact6>a fifth</fact6>) of the remaining cost, which is ¥320 / 5 = ¥64.

Therefore, after the youth club's contribution, the amount Leon still needs to raise is ¥320 - ¥64 = ¥256.  Finally, we consider the money Leon already has (<fact4>¥155</fact4>).  The amount Leon is still missing is ¥256 - ¥155 = ¥101.

After a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1330</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Nia bought <fact1>60 croissants</fact1>, which is 60/12 = 5 dozen croissants.  The cost of the croissants is 5 dozen * <fact1>$19/dozen</fact1> = $95.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons.  Nia bought <fact2>72 macarons</fact2>, which is 72/12 = 6 dozen macarons. The cost of the macarons is 6 dozen * <fact2>$20/dozen</fact2> = $120.

Before the discount, the total cost of the croissants and macarons was $95 + $120 = $215.  Let's denote the cost of the 36 brownies as 'x'.  So, before the discount, the total cost of all items was $215 + x.

Nia received a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, meaning she paid 95% of the original price.  Therefore, 0.95 * ($215 + x) = <fact5>$1330</fact5>.

To solve for x, we first divide both sides by 0.95: $215 + x = $1330 / 0.95 = $1400

Subtracting $215 from both sides, we find the total cost of the brownies: x = $1400 - $215 = $1185.

Finally, since Nia bought <fact3>36 brownies</fact3>, this is 36/12 = 3 dozen brownies. Therefore, the cost of the brownies per dozen is $1185 / 3 = $395.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1530</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact6>brownies per dozen</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Roya bought <fact1>48 croissants</fact1>, which is 48/12 = 4 dozen.  The cost of the croissants was 4 dozen * $19/dozen = $76.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons.  Roya bought <fact2>48 macarons</fact2>, which is also 48/12 = 4 dozen. The cost of the macarons was 4 dozen * $31/dozen = $124.

Before the discount, the total cost of the croissants and macarons was $76 + $124 = $200.

Let's denote the cost of the brownies per dozen as 'x'.  Roya bought <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>, which is 24/12 = 2 dozen. So the cost of the brownies was 2x.

The total cost before the discount was $200 + 2x.

After the <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, the final cost was 75% of the original price.  Therefore, 0.75 * ($200 + 2x) = <fact5>$1530</fact5>.

Now we solve for x:

0.75 * ($200 + 2x) = $1530
$150 + 1.5x = $1530
1.5x = $1530 - $150
1.5x = $1380
x = $1380 / 1.5
x = $920

Therefore, the cost of the brownies per dozen was $920.  The answer is {920}.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Ava decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer:  First, let's determine how much each person eats per day. Aisha eats <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Amelia eats twice as much as Aisha, so she eats 2 * 3 = 6 servings a day. Ava initially eats four times as much as Amelia, meaning she eats 4 * 6 = 24 servings a day.

For the first <fact5>two days</fact5>, the total consumption is:
* Aisha: 3 servings/day * 2 days = 6 servings
* Amelia: 6 servings/day * 2 days = 12 servings
* Ava: 24 servings/day * 2 days = 48 servings

After the first two days, a total of 6 + 12 + 48 = 66 servings have been eaten.  This leaves 87 - 66 = 21 servings remaining.

After day 2, Ava cuts her consumption in half, eating 24/2 = 12 servings per day.

Let's denote 'x' as the number of days it will take to eat the remaining 21 servings.  The equation to solve is:
(Aisha's daily servings + Amelia's daily servings + Ava's new daily servings) * x = remaining servings
(3 + 6 + 12) * x = 21
21x = 21
x = 1

Therefore, it will take 1 additional day to finish the remaining pizza. The total number of days to finish the entire <fact1>87-serving pizza</fact1> is 2 + 1 = 3 days.

Answer: First, let's determine how much each person eats per day. Leon eats <fact2>3 pieces a day</fact2>. Mohammed eats thrice as much as Leon, so he eats 3 * 3 = 9 pieces a day.  Sakura initially eats twice as much as Mohammed, so she eats 9 * 2 = 18 pieces a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten is:
* Leon: 3 pieces/day * 2 days = 6 pieces
* Mohammed: 9 pieces/day * 2 days = 18 pieces
* Sakura: 18 pieces/day * 2 days = 36 pieces
Total eaten in the first 2 days: 6 + 18 + 36 = 60 pieces

After 2 days, there are <fact1>102</fact1> - 60 = 42 pieces left.  Sakura's consumption is halved, so she now eats 18 / 2 = 9 pieces a day.

* Mohammed: 9 pieces/day
* Sakura: 9 pieces/day
Total consumption rate after day 2: 3 + 9 + 9 = 21 pieces/day

To find out how many more days it takes to finish the remaining 42 pieces, we divide the remaining pieces by the new daily consumption rate: 42 pieces / 21 pieces/day = 2 days.

Therefore, it will take the initial 2 days plus the additional 2 days, for a total of 2 + 2 = 4 days to eat the entire lasagna. The answer is {4}.

Answer: First, let's determine how much each person eats per day. Kimia eats <fact2>3 portions a day</fact2>. Fatima eats three times as much as Kimia, so she eats 3 * 3 = 9 portions a day (<fact3>three times as much</fact3>). Daphne initially eats four times as much as Fatima, meaning she eats 4 * 9 = 36 portions a day (<fact4>four times as much as Fatima</fact4>).

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten are:
* Kimia: 3 portions/day * 2 days = 6 portions
* Fatima: 9 portions/day * 2 days = 18 portions
* Daphne: 36 portions/day * 2 days = 72 portions

After 2 days, a total of 6 + 18 + 72 = 96 portions have been eaten.  This leaves 126 - 96 = 30 portions remaining (<fact1>126 portions</fact1>).

* Amelia: 6 pieces/day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 12 pieces

Over the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Tara eats 2 servings/day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 4 servings. Bodhi eats 6 servings/day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 12 servings. Olivia eats 12 servings/day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 24 servings.  In total, they eat 4 + 12 + 24 = 40 servings in the first two days.

The store has a promotion that if one buys <fact3>6 croissants or more</fact3>, they get a <fact4>10% discount on croissants</fact4>. How much more do <fact5>10 loaves of bread</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 croissants</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the cost of one croissant.  A croissant costs <fact2>3/4</fact2> of the price of a loaf of bread, which costs <fact1>¥5</fact1>.  Therefore, one croissant costs (3/4) * ¥5 = ¥3.75.

Since we're buying <fact6>8 croissants</fact6>, and this is more than <fact3>6 croissants</fact3>, we'll apply the <fact4>10% discount</fact4>.  The discount amount per croissant is 10% of ¥3.75, which is 0.1 * ¥3.75 = ¥0.375.  The discounted price of one croissant is ¥3.75 - ¥0.375 = ¥3.375.  The total cost of 8 croissants is 8 * ¥3.375 = ¥27.

Next, let's find the cost of <fact5>10 loaves of bread</fact5>. Each loaf costs <fact1>¥5</fact1>, so 10 loaves cost 10 * ¥5 = ¥50.

Finally, to find how much more 10 loaves of bread cost than 8 croissants, we subtract the cost of the croissants from the cost of the bread: ¥50 - ¥27 = ¥23.

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread cost ¥23 more than 8 croissants. The answer is {23}.

How much more do <fact5>5 loaves of sourdough</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 muffins</fact6>?

Answer:  The cost of one muffin is 1/4 the cost of a loaf of sourdough, which is ¥15.  Therefore, one muffin costs ¥15 / 4 = ¥3.75 <fact2>(1/4 of a loaf of sourdough)</fact2>.

Since 8 muffins are being purchased, and this exceeds the threshold of 6 muffins for the discount <fact3>(6 muffins or more)</fact3>, an 20% discount applies <fact4>(20% discount on muffins)</fact4>.  The discount per muffin is ¥3.75 * 0.20 = ¥0.75.  The discounted price per muffin is ¥3.75 - ¥0.75 = ¥3.00.

The total cost of 8 muffins is ¥3.00 * 8 = ¥24.

Five loaves of sourdough cost ¥15 * 5 = ¥75 <fact5>(5 loaves of sourdough)</fact5>.

The difference in cost between 5 loaves of sourdough and 8 muffins is ¥75 - ¥24 = ¥51.  Therefore, 5 loaves of sourdough cost ¥51 more than 8 muffins <fact6>(8 muffins)</fact6>.

How much more do <fact5>5 loaves of bread</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 bagels</fact6>?

Answer: The cost of one bagel is 1/8 of the cost of a loaf of bread, which is (1/8) * <fact1>€10</fact1> = €1.25. Since 8 bagels is more than <fact3>7 bagels</fact3>, the 10% discount applies.

Answer:  One muffin costs one-eighth of the price of a loaf of sourdough, which is ₣10/<fact2>8</fact2> = ₣1.25.  Since 12 muffins are purchased, which is more than <fact3>4 muffins</fact3>, a <fact4>20% discount</fact4> applies.  The discount amount per muffin is ₣1.25 * 0.20 = ₣0.25.

Answer: First, let's calculate the price of the more expensive flour.  The more expensive brand costs 25% more than the normal brand (<fact4>25% more</fact4>), which costs <fact2>₣16 per kilogram</fact2>.  So, the increased cost is 16 * 0.25 = ₣4 per kilogram.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the flour with the discount. The discount applies to the first <fact8>10 kilograms</fact8> at a <fact7>5% discount</fact7>. The discount amount is 10 kg * ₣20/kg * 0.05 = ₣10.  So, the cost of the first 10 kg is (10 kg * ₣20/kg) - ₣10 = ₣190. The remaining flour is 14 kg - 10 kg = 4 kg, and this is sold at the full price of ₣20/kg.  The cost of the remaining 4 kg is 4 kg * ₣20/kg = ₣80. The total cost of the flour is ₣190 + ₣80 = ₣270.

Finally, let's add the cost of the muffin. Oliver buys a <fact9>muffin for ₣4</fact9>. Therefore, the total amount Oliver has to pay is ₣270 + ₣4 = ₣274.

Answer:  Arjun uses <fact4>2 kilograms of tea per day</fact4>, and wants to buy a <fact3>week's worth</fact3>, so he needs 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg of tea.

The <fact2>more expensive brand costs 40% more than the normal brand</fact2>. The normal brand costs <fact1>¥10 per kilogram</fact1>, so the more expensive brand costs ¥10 + (40% * ¥10) = ¥10 + ¥4 = ¥14 per kilogram.

How many pancakes are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, let's calculate the initial number of pancakes Viktor had: <fact1>9 dozen pancakes</fact1> is 9 * 12 = 108 pancakes.  After eating breakfast, Viktor had 108 - <fact2>3</fact2> = 105 pancakes left.

Next, let's determine how many pancakes were found by each person:

* Liam found <fact3>5 pancakes</fact3>.
* Yusuf found 2 * <fact3>5</fact3> = <fact4>10 pancakes</fact4> (<fact4>two times as many as Liam</fact4>).
* Pavel found <fact4>10</fact4> - <fact5>4</fact5> = <fact5>6 pancakes</fact5> (<fact5>4 less than Yusuf</fact5>).

Answer:  First, let's determine the initial number of pancakes Beatriz had: <fact1>10 dozen pancakes</fact1> is 10 * 12 = 120 pancakes. After eating <fact2>3 pancakes for breakfast</fact2>, she had 120 - 3 = 117 pancakes left.  Kimia found <fact3>6 pancakes</fact3>. Sophia found <fact4>three times as many as Kimia</fact4>, which is 3 * 6 = 18 pancakes. Mateo found <fact5>2 less than Sophia</fact5>, meaning he found 18 - 2 = 16 pancakes.

How many pancakes are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to determine the total number of pancakes Kai initially had.  Since a dozen is 12, Kai started with <fact1>7 dozen pancakes</fact1> * 12 pancakes/dozen = 84 pancakes. After eating <fact2>2 pancakes for breakfast</fact2>, he had 84 - 2 = 82 pancakes left.

Next, let's figure out how many pancakes were found by Nia, Isabella, Roya, Diego, and Yara.  Nia found <fact3>6 pancakes</fact3>. Isabella found twice as many as Nia, so Isabella found 2 * 6 = 12 pancakes (<fact4>Isabella finds two times as many as Nia</fact4>).  Roya found 4 less than Isabella, so Roya found 12 - 4 = 8 pancakes (<fact5>Roya finds 4 less than Isabella</fact5>). Diego found a quarter of Roya's amount, meaning Diego found 8 / 4 = 2 pancakes (<fact6>Diego finds a quarter as many as Roya</fact6>).

Finally, Yara found two dozen (2 * 12 = 24 pancakes) more than the combined number of pancakes found by Isabella and Nia. That means Yara found 24 + 12 + 6 = 42 pancakes (<fact7>Yara finds two dozen pancakes more than Isabella and Nia combined</fact7>).

The total number of pancakes found is 6 + 12 + 8 + 2 + 42 = 70 pancakes.  Therefore, the number of pancakes still hidden in the yard is the initial amount minus the number eaten minus the number found: 82 - 70 = 12 pancakes.  The answer is {12}.

Note that Aisha can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Aisha to peel 120 clams.  Since she peels <fact1>10 clams per minute</fact1>, it will take her 120 clams / 10 clams/minute = 12 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we need to account for the clam washing time.  Washing each clam takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4>, and there are 120 clams, so the total washing time is 120 clams * 14 seconds/clam = 1680 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 1680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 28 minutes.

The total time for peeling is the peeling time plus washing time: 12 minutes + 28 minutes = 40 minutes.

After peeling, Aisha takes a <fact5>7-minute break</fact5> before sautéing.

Now let's figure out the sautéing time.  Aisha sautés <fact2>30 clams in 6 minutes</fact2>, meaning her sautéing rate is 30 clams / 6 minutes = 5 clams per minute. To sauté <fact3>120 clams</fact3> will take 120 clams / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes.

Finally, we add up all the times: 40 minutes (peeling and washing) + 7 minutes (break) + 24 minutes (sautéing) = 71 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Aisha 71 minutes to peel and sauté 120 clams. The answer is {71}.

Note that Chen can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>6-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes to wash the clams.  Since there are <fact3>120 clams</fact3> and each clam takes <fact4>15 seconds (or 0.25 minutes)</fact4> to wash, the total washing time is 120 clams * 0.25 minutes/clam = 30 minutes.

Next, let's determine the peeling time. Chen peels <fact1>5 clams per minute</fact1>, so it will take her 120 clams / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes to peel all the clams.

After peeling, Chen takes a <fact5>6-minute break</fact5>.

Note that Ava can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>15-minute break after peeling the zucchinis before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Ava to wash the zucchinis.  Since it takes <fact4>24 seconds to wash each zucchini</fact4>, and there are <fact3>140 zucchinis</fact3>, the total washing time is 140 zucchinis * 24 seconds/zucchini = 3360 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 3360 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 56 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes Ava to peel the zucchinis.  Ava peels <fact1>5 zucchinis per minute</fact1>, so it will take her <fact3>140 zucchinis</fact3> / 5 zucchinis/minute = 28 minutes to peel all the zucchinis.

After peeling, Ava takes a <fact5>15-minute break</fact5>.

Finally, let's calculate the time it takes to saute the zucchinis. Ava can saute <fact2>20 zucchinis in 6 minutes</fact2>, so her sauteing rate is 20 zucchinis / 6 minutes ≈ 3.33 zucchinis per minute.  To saute <fact3>140 zucchinis</fact3>, it will take her 140 zucchinis / 3.33 zucchinis/minute ≈ 42 minutes.

Note that <fact5>Roya can't work in parallel and needs to take a 7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Roya to peel 90 clams.  Since she can peel <fact1>6 clams per minute</fact1>, it will take her 90 clams / 6 clams/minute = 15 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we need to account for the clam washing.  Washing each clam takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4>, and there are 90 clams, so the total washing time is 90 clams * 14 seconds/clam = 1260 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 1260 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 21 minutes.

Adding the washing time to the peeling time, the total time spent peeling is 15 minutes + 21 minutes = 36 minutes.

After peeling, Roya takes a <fact5>7-minute break</fact5> before sautéing.

Finally, it takes Roya <fact2>11 minutes to saute 30 clams</fact2>. To saute <fact3>90 clams</fact3>, it will take her (90 clams / 30 clams) * 11 minutes = 33 minutes.

Note that Kimia can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>8-minute break after peeling the shrimps before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.


Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Kimia to wash the shrimps.  Since it takes <fact4>15 seconds to wash each shrimp</fact4>, and there are <fact3>60 shrimps</fact3>, the total washing time is 60 shrimps * 15 seconds/shrimp = 900 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 900 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 15 minutes.

Next, let's determine the peeling time. Kimia can peel <fact1>6 shrimps per minute</fact1>, and she needs to peel <fact3>60 shrimps</fact3>. Therefore, the peeling time is 60 shrimps / 6 shrimps/minute = 10 minutes.

After peeling, Kimia takes an <fact5>8-minute break</fact5>.

Finally, let's calculate the sautéing time.  Kimia can sauté <fact2>20 shrimps in 17 minutes</fact2>. To sauté <fact3>60 shrimps</fact3>, it will take (60 shrimps / 20 shrimps/batch) * 17 minutes/batch = 51 minutes.

He also earns an additional <fact7>10% in tips</fact7>. How much money does he make in a week?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first five complexes.  According to <fact2>, each of the first five complexes has 100 apartments, so there are 5 * 100 = 500 apartments in total.

Next, let's find the number of apartments in the sixth complex.  The question states in <fact3> that the sixth complex is 40% bigger than the other five combined (500 apartments).  Therefore, the sixth complex has 500 + (0.40 * 500) = 700 apartments.

Now let's account for the vacant apartments.  <fact4> states that 8 apartments in each of the first 5 complexes were vacant. This means a total of 5 * 8 = 40 apartments did not require service.

This leaves a total of 500 + 700 - 40 = 1160 apartments requiring garbage collection.

<fact5> tells us Hiroshi collects garbage twice a week from each apartment. So he makes 1160 apartments * 2 collections/apartment = 2320 collections.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first four complexes: <fact2>4 complexes * 100 apartments/complex = 400 apartments</fact2>.  Since <fact4>6 apartments in each of these complexes were vacant</fact4>, the number of apartments requiring service is 400 - (4 complexes * 6 apartments/complex) = 376 apartments.

Next, let's find the number of apartments in the fifth complex.  The first four complexes combined have 400 apartments, and the fifth complex is <fact3>50% bigger</fact3>, meaning it has 400 + (400 * 0.5) = 600 apartments.

Therefore, the total number of apartments requiring service across all five complexes is 376 + 600 = 976 apartments.
