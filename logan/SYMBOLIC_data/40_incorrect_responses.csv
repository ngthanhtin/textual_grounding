2,"Reformatted Question: Gabriel is rolling a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are 19 numbers greater than 1 on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 19/20. 
To roll <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, Gabriel must roll an odd number on the first roll (10/20 probability) and then roll an odd number on the second roll (10/20 probability). So the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4. 
The difference in probabilities is 19/20 - 1/4 = 16/20 = 4/5 = 0.8. 
Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.8 * 100% = 80%.

Answer: There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5. To roll <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 10/20 = 0.5, and the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 10/20 = 0.5. So, the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. The difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.25 / 0.25 * 100% = 100% more likely.

2,"Reformatted Question: Leon is rolling a <fact1>d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1>, we first note that there are 20 possible outcomes, and 19 of them are greater than 1. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 19/20.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>, we note that the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20, since half of the numbers on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> are even. The probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2> is then (10/20) * (10/20) = 1/4.

The difference in probabilities is (19/20) - (1/4) = 11/20. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (11/20) * 100 = 55%.

Answer: There are 18 numbers greater than 2 on a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 18/20 = 0.9. 
To roll <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, Oscar must roll an odd number on the first roll (10/20 = 0.5) and then roll an odd number on the second roll (10/20 = 0.5). The probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. 
The difference in probabilities is 0.9 - 0.25 = 0.65.

Answer: A <fact1>d4 die</fact1> has 4 sides, numbered 1 through 4. There are 3 numbers greater than 2 on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 3/4. To roll <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>, the first roll must be even (probability 2/4 = 1/2) and the second roll must also be even (probability 1/2). The probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. The difference in probabilities is 3/4 - 1/4 = 1/2. Expressed as a percentage, this is 50%.

2,"Reformatted Question: Tariq is rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two <fact2>even numbers</fact2> in a row?

Answer: There are <fact1>4 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Two of these outcomes are <fact2>even numbers</fact2> (2 and 4), and two are odd numbers (1 and 3). Three of these outcomes are greater than 2 (3 and 4). 

The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is therefore 3/4 or 0.75, since there are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.

To roll two <fact2>even numbers</fact2> in a row, Tariq must roll an <fact2>even number</fact2> on the first roll (with a probability of 2/4 or 0.5), and then roll another <fact2>even number</fact2> on the second roll (also with a probability of 2/4 or 0.5). Since these two events are independent, the probability of rolling two <fact2>even numbers</fact2> in a row is (0.5) x (0.5) = 0.25.

The difference in probabilities is 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.5 x 100% = 50%.

Answer: Let's start by identifying the total number of parts in the ratio, which is <fact1>83 + 25 = 108</fact1>. Since Valentina used a <fact2>total of 1188 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used. 

Let x be the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar. We can set up the proportion: 
x / <fact2>1188</fact2> = <fact1>83</fact1> / <fact1>108</fact1>

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
x = (<fact2>1188</fact2> * <fact1>83</fact1>) / <fact1>108</fact1>
x = 918

Therefore, Valentina used 918 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

If Valentina is sure to get <fact3>30% of the economics questions</fact3>, and <fact4>1/2 of the literature and geography questions</fact4> correctly, how many points is she sure to get?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many economics questions there are. Since <fact2>40% of the questions are economics</fact2>, we can calculate the number of economics questions as <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>50</fact1> = 0.4 * 50 = 20 questions.

Next, we need to find out how many literature and geography questions there are. Since the rest of the questions are equally divided as literature and geography questions, we can calculate the number of literature and geography questions as (<fact1>50</fact1> - 20) / 2 = 15 questions each.

Now, we can calculate the number of points Valentina is sure to get. She will get <fact3>30% of the economics questions</fact3> correctly, which is <fact3>30%</fact3> * 20 = 0.3 * 20 = 6 questions.

She will also get <fact4>1/2 of the literature and geography questions</fact4> correctly, which is <fact4>1/2</fact4> * 15 = 7.5 questions for each subject. Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we'll round down to 7 questions for each subject.

If Isabella is sure to get <fact3>40% of the biology questions</fact3>, and <fact4>a third of the literature and history questions</fact4> correctly, how many points is she sure to get?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many biology questions there are. Since <fact2>10% of the questions are biology</fact2>, we can calculate the number of biology questions as <fact1>150</fact1> * <fact2>0.10</fact2> = 15 questions. 
Isabella is sure to get <fact3>40% of the biology questions</fact3> correctly, which is 15 * <fact3>0.40</fact3> = 6 questions. 
The rest of the questions are equally divided as literature and history questions, so there are (<fact1>150</fact1> - 15) / 2 = 67.5 questions of each type.

If Zahra is sure to get <fact3>60% of the geography questions</fact3>, and <fact4>a third of the biology and literature questions</fact4> correctly, how many points is she sure to get?

Answer: There are <fact2>50%</fact2> * <fact1>90</fact1> = 45 geography questions. Zahra will get <fact3>60%</fact3> * 45 = 27 geography questions correct. The rest of the questions are 100% - <fact2>50%</fact2> = 50% of the total questions, which is 50% * <fact1>90</fact1> = 45 questions. Half of these are biology and half are literature, so there are 45 / 2 = 22.5 biology questions and 22.5 literature questions. Since you can't have a fraction of a question, we can assume that there are 22 biology questions and 23 literature questions, or vice versa. Either way, Zahra will get <fact4>1/3</fact4> * 22 = 7.33 biology questions correct and <fact4>1/3</fact4> * 23 = 7.67 literature questions correct.

24,"Reformatted Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has <fact1>250 calories per serving</fact1>. If a <fact2>100 oz bag has 4 servings</fact2>, how many oz can you eat if your <fact3>daily calorie target is 2000</fact3> and you have already consumed <fact4>750 calories</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories you can still consume for the day. This is <fact3>2000</fact3> - <fact4>750</fact4> = 1250 calories. Since each serving has <fact1>250 calories</fact1>, you can eat 1250 / <fact1>250</fact1> = 5 servings. Since a <fact2>100 oz bag has 4 servings</fact2>, each serving is <fact2>100 oz</fact2> / 4 = 25 oz. Therefore, you can eat 5 servings * 25 oz per serving = 125 oz.

However, since the question asks how many oz you can eat and you can only eat a maximum of the bag's capacity, the answer is the minimum between the calculated amount (125 oz) and the bag's capacity (<fact2>100 oz</fact2>). Therefore, the answer is 100 oz.",125,0,1,p2,1225,983

The transfer fee is <fact4>14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is <fact2>$370000</fact2> * 0.14 = $51800.
So the total price of the townhouse is <fact2>$370000</fact2> + $22200 + $51800 = $443000.
This is <fact1>$380000</fact1> - $443000 = -$63000 over budget. However, the question asks how much more the total price is than Mrs. Lee's budget, so the answer should be a positive number. Thus, the answer is $63000.

After accounting for <fact2>1300 seats for graduates</fact2> and <fact3>400 seats for faculty attending</fact3>, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?

So, <fact1>3000 people</fact1> - <fact2>1300 seats for graduates</fact2> - <fact3>400 seats for faculty attending</fact3> = 3000 - 1300 - 400 = 1300 seats.

Answer: To determine how long it will take Nia to peel 80 clams, we can divide the total number of clams by her peeling rate: 80 clams / <fact1>4 clams per minute</fact1> = 20 minutes. To determine how long it will take Nia to saute 80 clams, we can divide the total number of clams by her sauteing rate: 80 clams / (<fact2>20 clams in 6 minutes</fact2> = 20/6 = 3.33 clams per minute) = 80 / 3.33 = 24 minutes. So, the total time it will take Nia to peel and saute 80 clams is 20 + 24 = 44 minutes, but we can simplify this problem by finding the time it takes to saute and peel at the same time. We can find the time it takes to saute 80 clams which is 24 minutes, and then find how many clams Nia can peel in that time: <fact1>4 clams per minute</fact1> * 24 minutes = 96 clams. Since 96 > 80, we know that Nia will be done peeling the clams before she is done sauteing the clams. Therefore, the total time it will take Nia to <fact3>peel and saute 80 clams</fact3> is 24 minutes.

Answer: To determine how long it will take Mia to <fact3>peel and saute 100 shrimps</fact3>, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel 100 shrimps and the time it takes to saute 100 shrimps. 

Mia can <fact1>peel 5 shrimps a minute</fact1>, so to peel 100 shrimps, it will take her 100 / <fact1>5</fact1> = 20 minutes.

To saute 100 shrimps, we need to determine how many sets of <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2> are in 100 shrimps. 100 / <fact2>20</fact2> = 5 sets of <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2>. Since it takes <fact2>13 minutes</fact2> to saute <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2>, it will take 5 x <fact2>13 minutes</fact2> = 65 minutes to saute 100 shrimps.

However, Mia can saute and peel at the same time, so we can't simply add the times together. But we can peel the shrimps while we are waiting for other shrimps to saute, so the total time will be the time it takes to saute 100 shrimps, which is 65 minutes, and the time we spend peeling while we aren't sauteing. We spend 20 minutes peeling, but we can peel for 13 minutes while we are waiting for the first set of shrimps to saute, so we only have to add 20 - 13 = 7 minutes to the total time.

Therefore, the total time it will take Mia to <fact3>peel and saute 100 shrimps</fact3> is 65 + 7 = 72 minutes.

How many pounds of ore can <fact4>21 miners with steel pickaxes</fact4> mine in a <fact5>month with 29 days</fact5>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much ore a miner can mine with a bronze pickaxe. Since he can mine <fact2>twice as much with a bronze pickaxe</fact2> as with a basic shovel, he can mine <fact1>5 pounds</fact1> * 2 = 10 pounds of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe.

Next, we need to find out how much ore a miner can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine <fact3>40% more with a steel pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe</fact3>, he can mine 10 pounds * 1.4 = 14 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we need to find out how much ore <fact4>21 miners with steel pickaxes</fact4> can mine in a day. Since each miner can mine 14 pounds of ore per day, <fact4>21 miners</fact4> can mine 14 pounds * 21 = 294 pounds of ore per day.

Finally, we need to find out how much ore <fact4>21 miners with steel pickaxes</fact4> can mine in a <fact5>month with 29 days</fact5>. Since they can mine 294 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 294 pounds * <fact5>29 days</fact5> = 8536 pounds of ore in a month.

But as I pour it, I spill <fact5>6 liters of the lemon drink</fact5>. How much water is in the remaining <fact6>24 liters</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink. Since the lemon drink is <fact2>one-eighth water</fact2>, the amount of water in the original <fact1>14 liters of lemon drink</fact1> is <fact1>14</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 1.75 liters.

Answer: Ravi finished <fact1>4/5 of a 395 piece puzzle</fact1>, which is (4/5) * 395 = 316 pieces. Then he finished a <fact2>521 piece puzzle</fact2>. So in total, he placed 316 + 521 = 837 pieces.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the party. We know that there were <fact1>67 artists</fact1> and <fact2>32 doctors</fact2>, so the total number of people is <fact1>67</fact1> + <fact2>32</fact2> = 99.

Since <fact3>1/3 of the total number of people left</fact3>, the number of people who left is 99 * <fact3>1/3</fact3> = 33.

We are given that <fact4>30 artists stayed at the party</fact4>, so the number of artists who left is <fact1>67</fact1> - <fact4>30</fact4> = 37.

However, we know that a total of 33 people left, and 37 artists left is not possible since it exceeds the total number of people who left. This means that all 33 people who left cannot be artists, and some must be doctors.

Since 37 artists left is not possible, we know that 33 people left, and 37 - 33 = 4 of those ""extra"" artists did not actually leave. Instead, 4 doctors left.

So, the number of doctors who left is 4, and the number of doctors who stayed is <fact2>32</fact2> - 4 = 28.

The <fact3>first paid hour is ¥44</fact3>. Each hour after that is <fact4>twice the cost</fact4>, so the second paid hour is ¥44 x 2 = ¥88, and the third paid hour is ¥88 x 2 = ¥176. Therefore, James pays ¥44 + ¥88 + ¥176 = ¥308.

Answer: Luis hires the boat for <fact1>6 hours</fact1>. Since he gets <fact2>2 hours free</fact2>, he has to pay for 6 - 2 = 4 hours. The <fact3>first paid hour is ₺12</fact3>. Each hour after that is <fact4>twice the cost</fact4>, so the second paid hour is ₺12 * 2 = ₺24, the third paid hour is ₺24 * 2 = ₺48, and the fourth paid hour is ₺48 * 2 = ₺96. Therefore, the total amount Luis paid is ₺12 + ₺24 + ₺48 + ₺96 = ₺180.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>€7 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster two times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of laser tag is €6</fact5>. <fact6>The roller coaster cost €16 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: The total cost of the roller coaster rides will be <fact6>€16 per ride</fact6> * 2 rides = €32.
The cost of the pinball tokens is <fact3>€7</fact3>.
The total cost of laser tag will be <fact5>€6 per person</fact5> * number of people, where the number of people is Keisha plus the number of friends she invites.
The total cost of the party must be less than or equal to <fact1>€180</fact1>.
So, the equation for the total cost is: €6 * number of people + €32 + €7 ≤ €180.
Simplifying the equation gives: €6 * number of people ≤ €141.
Dividing both sides by €6 gives: number of people ≤ 23.5.
Since Keisha must be one of the people, the number of friends she can invite is 23.5 - 1 = 22.5.
Since she can't invite a fraction of a person, she can invite 22 friends.
The answer is {22}.",3,0,1,p2,4808,1225

The bumper cars cost <fact6>₣11 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Tara's aunt has <fact1>₣190</fact1> to spend on the party. Tara wants to ride the bumper cars <fact4>eight times</fact4> at <fact6>₣11 per ride</fact6>, which will cost 8 * <fact6>11</fact6> = ₣88. She also wants <fact3>₣3 in game room tokens</fact3>, so that's an additional <fact3>₣3</fact3>. This leaves <fact1>₣190</fact1> - ₣88 - <fact3>₣3</fact3> = ₣99 for bowling. Since <fact5>a round of bowling is ₣4</fact5>, Tara can afford ₣99 / <fact5>₣4</fact5> = 24.75 rounds of bowling. Since Tara wants to play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> with her friends, and she can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 24 friends (not including herself).

How many friends can she invite?

Answer: The total cost of the roller coaster rides will be <fact6>₣12 per ride</fact6> * 8 rides = ₣96. 
The cost of pinball tokens is <fact3>₣5</fact3>. 
The cost of laser tag for Mei is <fact5>₣4</fact5>. 
The remaining budget for her friends' laser tag is <fact1>₣210</fact1> - ₣96 - <fact3>₣5</fact3> - <fact5>₣4</fact5> = ₣105. 
The number of friends Mei can invite is ₣105 / <fact5>₣4</fact5> = 26.25, which we round down to 26.
However, since Mei also plays a round of laser tag, we need to include her in the total number of people playing laser tag. 
So the number of friends Mei can invite is 26.

How many friends can she invite?

Answer: The total cost of the roller coaster rides will be <fact6>₣9 per ride</fact6> * 2 rides = ₣18. 
The total cost of the pinball tokens will be <fact3>₣8</fact3>. 
The total cost of laser tag for Kimia will be <fact5>₣4 per round</fact5> * <fact2>1 round</fact2> = ₣4. 
The total cost for Kimia will be ₣18 + ₣8 + ₣4 = ₣30. 
This leaves <fact1>₣150</fact1> - ₣30 = ₣120 for her friends to play laser tag. 
Since each friend will cost <fact5>₣4</fact5> to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, the number of friends she can invite will be ₣120 / <fact5>₣4</fact5> = 30 friends.

The <fact6>bumper cars cost $12 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Elena wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2>, which costs <fact5>$8</fact5> per person, have <fact3>$3 in game room tokens</fact3> per person, and get to ride the <fact4>bumper cars seven times</fact4>, which costs <fact6>$12</fact6> * 7 = $84 total. The cost per person for bowling and game room tokens is <fact5>$8</fact5> + <fact3>$3</fact3> = $11. Let x be the number of friends Elena invites. Then the total cost for the party is $11 * (x + 1) + $84. This total must be less than or equal to <fact1>$190</fact1>. So $11 * (x + 1) + $84 ≤ <fact1>$190</fact1>. Subtracting $84 from both sides gives $11 * (x + 1) ≤ $106. Dividing both sides by $11 gives x + 1 ≤ 9.66. Since x must be an integer, x + 1 ≤ 9. So x ≤ 8. Therefore, Elena can invite up to 8 friends.

Answer: On the first day, the <fact1>8 people</fact1> who are initially infected will infect <fact1>8</fact1> * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 32 people. So, at the end of the first day, there will be <fact1>8</fact1> + 32 = 40 people infected. On the second day, these 40 people will infect 40 * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 160 people. So, at the end of the second day, there will be 40 + 160 = 200 people infected. On the third day, these 200 people will infect 200 * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 800 people. So, at the end of the third day, there will be 200 + 800 = 1000 people infected. On the fourth day, these 1000 people will infect 1000 * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 4000 people. So, at the end of the <fact3>4 days</fact3>, there will be 1000 + 4000 = 5000 people infected, but we also need to add the <fact1>8 people</fact1> initially infected to the 40 people infected at the end of the first day, which were already included in the 1000 people, to correctly calculate the infected people after 4 days, we only need to add the 8 to the 40 which were already included.
