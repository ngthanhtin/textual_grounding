Later, Oscar saw another <fact4>10-foot shark</fact4> with <fact5>6 remoras</fact5>, each <fact6>3 inches long</fact6>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras for each shark. For the first shark, there were originally <fact2>16 remoras</fact2>, but a quarter of them swam away, so there are <fact2>16</fact2> * 3/4 = 12 remoras left. The total length of the remoras for the first shark is 12 * <fact3>19 inches</fact3> = 228 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 228 inches / 12 = 19 feet.

For the second shark, the total length of the remoras is <fact5>6 remoras</fact5> * <fact6>3 inches</fact6> = 18 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 18 inches / 12 = 1.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first shark, the percentage is (19 feet / <fact1>38 feet</fact1>) * 100% ≈ 50%. For the second shark, the percentage is (1.5 feet / <fact4>10 feet</fact4>) * 100% = 15%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (50% + 15%) / 2 = 32.5%.

On average, what percentage of each whale's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each whale. For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/2 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>12</fact2> / 2 = 6 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>24 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * <fact3>24 inches</fact3> = 144 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 144 inches / 12 = 12 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>6 inches</fact7> = 36 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 36 inches / 12 = 3 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each whale's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first whale, the remoras cover 12 feet / <fact1>48 feet</fact1> = 0.25 or 25%. For the second whale, the remoras cover 3 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.3 or 30%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 30%) / 2 = 27.5%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. There were originally <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/6 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>18</fact2> - <fact2>18</fact2>/<fact4>6</fact4> = 15 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>16 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 15 * <fact3>16 inches</fact3> = 240 inches. Since the shark is <fact1>40 feet long</fact1>, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet: 240 inches / 12 = 20 feet. 

The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is (20 feet / <fact1>40 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 50%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark. For the first shark, there were originally <fact2>15 remoras</fact2>, but a <fact4>fifth of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>15</fact2> - <fact2>15</fact2>/<fact4>5</fact4> = 12 remoras left.

Later, Nia saw another <fact4>10-foot dolphin</fact4> with <fact5>6 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras, each 12 inches long</fact2>, which is a total of <fact2>12</fact2> * 12 = 144 inches. Since <fact3>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact3>, the remaining remoras have a total length of 144 - (144 / 3) = 96 inches. We need to convert this to feet to match the length of the dolphin, so 96 inches / 12 = 8 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact5>6 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, which is a total of <fact5>6</fact5> * 3 = 18 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 18 inches / 12 = 1.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the remoras cover 8 feet / <fact1>40 feet</fact1> = 0.2 or 20%. For the second dolphin, the remoras cover 1.5 feet / <fact4>10 feet</fact4> = 0.15 or 15%.

Later, Sanjay saw another <fact4>10-foot shark</fact4> with <fact5>8 remoras</fact5>, each <fact6>6 inches long</fact6>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the remoras attached to the first shark are <fact3>22 inches</fact3> / 12 = 1.83 feet long. The remoras attached to the second shark are <fact6>6 inches</fact6> / 12 = 0.5 feet long.

A quarter of the remoras attached to the first shark swam away, so the number of remoras left is <fact2>12 remoras</fact2> - <fact2>12 remoras</fact2> / 4 = 9 remoras.

The total length of the remoras attached to the first shark is 9 remoras * 1.83 feet/remora = 16.47 feet. The total length of the remoras attached to the second shark is <fact5>8 remoras</fact5> * 0.5 feet/remora = 4 feet.

The percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras is (16.47 feet / <fact1>33 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 49.9%. The percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras is (4 feet / <fact4>10 feet</fact4>) * 100% = 40%.

The average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras is (49.9% + 40%) / 2 = 44.95%. We can round this to 45%.

Later, Tariq saw another <fact4>10-foot dolphin</fact4> with <fact5>4 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras, each 12 inches long</fact2>, which is a total of <fact2>12</fact2> * 12 = 144 inches. Since <fact3>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact3>, the remaining remoras have a total length of 144 - (144 / 3) = 96 inches. For the second dolphin, the total length of the remoras is <fact5>4 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, which is a total of <fact5>4</fact5> * 3 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the total length of the remoras for the first dolphin is 96 / 12 = 8 feet, and for the second dolphin, it is 12 / 12 = 1 foot.

The percentage of each dolphin's body length covered by the remoras can be calculated by dividing the total length of the remoras by the length of the dolphin and multiplying by 100. For the first dolphin, this is (8 / <fact1>40</fact1>) * 100 = 20%. For the second dolphin, this is (1 / <fact4>10</fact4>) * 100 = 10%.

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for both dolphins and divide by 2: (20 + 10) / 2 = 15%.

For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>16 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/4 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>16</fact2> - <fact2>16</fact2> * <fact4>1/4</fact4> = 12 remoras left. The total length of these remoras is 12 * <fact3>21 inches</fact3> = 252 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 252 inches / 12 = 21 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact6>8 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>3 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact7>3 inches</fact7> = 24 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 24 inches / 12 = 2 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the percentage is (21 feet / <fact1>42 feet</fact1>) * 100% ≈ 50%. For the second dolphin, the percentage is (2 feet / <fact5>8 feet</fact5>) * 100% = 25%.

On average, what percentage of each whale's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each whale. For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/2 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>18</fact2> / 2 = 9 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>16 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 9 * <fact3>16 inches</fact3> = 144 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 144 inches / 12 = 12 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>6 inches</fact7> = 36 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 36 inches / 12 = 3 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each whale's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first whale, the remoras cover 12 feet / <fact1>48 feet</fact1> = 0.25 or 25%. For the second whale, the remoras cover 3 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.3 or 30%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 30%) / 2 = 27.5%.

Then, <fact4>half of the remoras swam away</fact4>. Later, Bodhi saw another <fact5>10-foot shark</fact5> with <fact6>5 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark. For the first shark, there were originally <fact2>22 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>half of them swam away</fact4>, so there are 22/2 = 11 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>12 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 11 * 12 = 132 inches. Since the shark is <fact1>44 feet long</fact1>, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet as well. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 132 inches is equal to 132/12 = 11 feet.

For the second shark, there are <fact6>5 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is 5 * 6 = 30 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 30/12 = 2.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first shark, the remoras cover 11 feet out of the shark's total length of <fact1>44 feet</fact1>, so the percentage is (11/44) * 100% ≈ 25%. For the second shark, the remoras cover 2.5 feet out of the shark's total length of <fact5>10 feet</fact5>, so the percentage is (2.5/10) * 100% = 25%.

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for the two sharks and divide by 2: (25% + 25%)/2 = 25%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>18 remoras</fact2> and each is <fact3>21 inches long</fact3>, the total length of the remoras is <fact2>18</fact2> * <fact3>21 inches</fact3> = 378 inches. Since <fact4>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, the remaining length of the remoras is 378 - (378 / 3) = 252 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so we divide by 12: 252 / 12 = 21 feet.

For the second shark, the total length of the remoras is <fact6>7 remoras</fact6> * <fact7>6 inches</fact7> = 42 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 42 / 12 = 3.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras. For the first shark, it's (21 / <fact1>42</fact1>) * 100% ≈ 50%. For the second shark, it's (3.5 / <fact5>10</fact5>) * 100% = 35%.

On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>20 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>half of them swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>20</fact2> / 2 = 10 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>12 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 10 * <fact3>12 inches</fact3> = 120 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 120 inches / 12 = 10 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>5 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>5 inches</fact7> = 30 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 30 inches / 12 = 2.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the remoras cover 10 feet / <fact1>40 feet</fact1> = 0.25 or 25%. For the second dolphin, the remoras cover 2.5 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.25 or 25%.

Later, Mohammed saw another <fact4>10-foot shark</fact4> with <fact5>6 remoras, each 6 inches long</fact5>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>18 remoras, each 15 inches long</fact2>, the total length of the remoras is 18 * 15 = 270 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so we divide by 12: 270 / 12 = 22.5 feet. After <fact3>a third of the remoras swam away</fact3>, there are 18 - 18/3 = 12 remoras left, with a total length of 12 * 15 = 180 inches, or 180 / 12 = 15 feet.

For the second shark, there are <fact5>6 remoras, each 6 inches long</fact5>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * 6 = 36 inches, or 36 / 12 = 3 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras. For the first shark, the percentage is (15 / <fact1>30</fact1>) * 100 = 50%. For the second shark, the percentage is (3 / <fact4>10</fact4>) * 100 = 30%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>21 remoras</fact2> and each is <fact3>13 inches long</fact3>, the total length of the remoras is <fact2>21</fact2> * <fact3>13</fact3> = 273 inches. However, <fact4>1/7 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so the remaining length of the remoras is 273 - (273 / 7) = 234 inches.

Next, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark. Since there are <fact6>8 remoras</fact6> and each is <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, the total length of the remoras is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact7>6</fact7> = 48 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the sharks from feet to inches. The first shark is <fact1>39 feet</fact1> long, which is 39 * 12 = 468 inches. The second shark is <fact5>8 feet</fact5> long, which is 8 * 12 = 96 inches.

To calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we divide the total length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100. For the first shark, the percentage is (234 / 468) * 100 = 50%. For the second shark, the percentage is (48 / 96) * 100 = 50%.

Since we are asked for the average percentage, we take the average of the two percentages: (50 + 50) / 2 = 50%.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras for each whale. For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>half of them swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>12</fact2>/2 = 6 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>14 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * <fact3>14 inches</fact3> = 84 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 84 inches / 12 inches per foot = 7 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact6>8 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>3 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact7>3 inches</fact7> = 24 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 24 inches / 12 inches per foot = 2 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each whale's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first whale, the remoras cover 7 feet / <fact1>35 feet</fact1> = 0.2 or 20%. For the second whale, the remoras cover 2 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.2 or 20%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark. For the first shark, there were originally <fact2>24 remoras</fact2>, but a third of them swam away, so there are <fact2>24</fact2> * 2/3 = 16 remoras left. The total length of these remoras is 16 * <fact3>12 inches</fact3> = 192 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 192 inches / 12 = 16 feet.

For the second shark, there are <fact5>6 remoras</fact5>, each <fact6>6 inches long</fact6>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact5>6</fact5> * <fact6>6 inches</fact6> = 36 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 36 inches / 12 = 3 feet.

On average, what percentage of each whale's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each whale. For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>18 remoras, each 20 inches long</fact2>, so the total length of the remoras was 18 * 20 = 360 inches. However, <fact3>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact3>, so the remaining total length of the remoras is 360 - (360 / 3) = 240 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to feet by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact5>6 remoras, each 5 inches long</fact5>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * 5 = 30 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 30 / 12 = 2.5 feet.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>20 remoras, each 15 inches long</fact2>, the total length of the remoras is <fact2>20</fact2> * 15 = 300 inches. We also need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches, so <fact1>40 feet</fact1> is equal to <fact1>40</fact1> * 12 = 480 inches. 

Then, <fact3>1/5 of the remoras swam away</fact3>, so the number of remoras left is <fact2>20</fact2> - <fact2>20</fact2> * <fact3>1/5</fact3> = 16 remoras. The total length of the remoras left is 16 * 15 = 240 inches.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>15 remoras</fact2> and each is <fact3>23 inches long</fact3>, the total length of the remoras is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact3>23 inches</fact3> = 345 inches. Since <fact4>1/5 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, the remaining length of the remoras is 345 - (1/5 * 345) = 276 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so we divide by 12: 276 / 12 = 23 feet.

If <fact3>the city is 84 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles a quarter of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 84 miles across</fact3>, a quarter of the city is 84/4 = 21 miles. 
Since <fact1>it takes 60 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>, the fog bank covers 1 mile every 60/3 = 20 minutes. 
Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, after 60 minutes, it will take the fog bank 20*2 = 40 minutes to cover 1 mile. 
In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover 60/20 = 3 miles. 
After that, the fog bank still needs to cover 21 - 3 = 18 miles. 
Since it takes the fog bank 40 minutes to cover 1 mile, it will take the fog bank 18*40 = 720 minutes to cover the remaining 18 miles.

If <fact3>the city is 95 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact4>1/5 of the city</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles 1/5 of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 95 miles across</fact3>, 1/5 of the city is 95 / 5 = 19 miles. 

Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to determine how far the fog bank will travel in the first hour and how far it will travel after the wind speed is halved. 

In the first hour, the fog bank travels <fact1>5 miles every 75 minutes</fact1>, so in 60 minutes, it will travel (60 / 75) * 5 = 4 miles. 

After the first hour, the wind speed is halved, so the fog bank will travel half the distance in the same amount of time. Therefore, it will take 75 * 2 = 150 minutes to travel 5 miles. 

Since the fog bank needs to travel 19 miles to cover <fact4>1/5 of the city</fact4>, and it travels 4 miles in the first hour, it needs to travel 19 - 4 = 15 miles after the wind speed is halved. 

It takes 150 minutes to travel 5 miles, so it will take (150 / 5) * 15 = 450 minutes to travel 15 miles. 

However, this is after the first hour, so we need to add the first hour to the total time. Therefore, the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover <fact4>1/5 of the city</fact4> is 60 + 450 = 510 minutes.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll. Since there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a <fact1>10-sided die</fact1> (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), the probability is 5/10 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.5^2 = 0.25.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>. Since there are 5 even numbers on a <fact1>10-sided die</fact1> (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 5/10 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>, we raise this probability to the power of 4: 0.5^4 = 0.0625.

Now, we can find the difference in probability between these two events: 0.25 - 0.0625 = 0.1875. To express this as a difference in percentage points, we multiply by 100: 0.1875 x 100 = 18.75.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll. Since a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> has 8 sides, and 6 of them are greater than 2, the probability is 6/8 = 0.75. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.75^2 = 0.5625.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>. Since there are 4 odd numbers on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> (1, 3, 5, and 7), the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 4/8 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>, we raise this probability to the power of 4: 0.5^4 = 0.0625.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll. Since a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> has 8 sides, and 6 of them are greater than 2, the probability is 6/8 = 0.75. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.75^2 = 0.5625.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>. Since there are 4 odd numbers on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> (1, 3, 5, and 7), the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 4/8 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>, we raise this probability to the power of 4: 0.5^4 = 0.0625.

Now, we can convert these probabilities to percentages: 0.5625 becomes 56.25%, and 0.0625 becomes 6.25%. The difference between these two percentages is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a single roll. Since a <fact1>d6 die</fact1> has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and 3 of them are greater than 3 (4, 5, 6), the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.5^2 = 0.25.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>.

Since there are 15 numbers greater than 5 on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1> (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20), the probability is 15/20 = 0.75. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.75^2 = 0.5625.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>. Since there are 10 even numbers on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1> (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>, we raise this probability to the power of 4: 0.5^4 = 0.0625.

Now, we can convert these probabilities to percentages: 0.5625 becomes 56.25%, and 0.0625 becomes 6.25%. The difference between these percentages is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll. Since a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> has 20 sides, and 19 of them are greater than 1, the probability is 19/20. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: (19/20)^2 = 0.9025, or 90.25%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>. Since half of the numbers on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> are even, the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 1/2. To find the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>, we raise this probability to the power of 4: (1/2)^4 = 0.0625, or 6.25%.

Finally, we subtract the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3> from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2> to find the difference: 90.25% - 6.25% = 84%.

Answer: There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2. The probability of rolling a number greater than 10 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

There are 10 even numbers on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling an even number is 10/20 = 1/2. The probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3> is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 10 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2> and rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3> is 1/4 - 1/16 = 3/16.

To express this difference as a percentage point difference, we can convert the fractions to percentages: 1/4 = 25%, 1/16 = 6.25%, and 3/16 = 18.75%. The difference is 25% - 6.25% = 18.75%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll. Since there are 18 numbers greater than 2 on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> (3-20), the probability is 18/20 = 0.9. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81, or 81%.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>. Since there are 10 even numbers on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 = 0.5.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a single roll. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a <fact1>6-sided die</fact1> (4, 5, and 6), so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>, we first need to find the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll. There are 3 odd numbers on a <fact1>6-sided die</fact1> (1, 3, and 5), so the probability is 3/6 = 1/2. To find the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>, we raise this probability to the power of 4: (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

What percentage of the students like to play music if the number of the students that like to paint is <fact6>6 less than five times the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to paint. We know that the number of students that like to paint is <fact6>6 less than five times the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>. Since <fact5>5 students like to play basketball</fact5>, five times this number is 5 * <fact5>5</fact5> = 25. Six less than this is 25 - 6 = 19. So, 19 students like to paint.

Answer: First, let's find the number of students that like to play video games. Two times the number that prefer playing hurling is 2 * <fact5>8</fact5> = 16. So, the number of students that like to play video games is 16 - <fact6>7</fact6> = 9. Now, let's find the number of students that like to bake. The total number of students that like to dance, play chess, swim, or play hurling is <fact2>16</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>8</fact5> = 45.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to bake is <fact6>3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the number of students that like to bake. Since the number of students that like to bake is <fact6>3 less than four times the number that prefer playing football</fact6>, we can calculate this as 4 * <fact5>13</fact5> - 3 = 49.

What percentage of the students like to bake if the number of the students that like to play music is <fact6>6 less than two times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to play music. We know that the number of students that like to play music is <fact6>6 less than two times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>. Since <fact5>38 students like to play hurling</fact5>, two times this number is 2 x <fact5>38</fact5> = 76. Then, 6 less than this number is 76 - 6 = 70. So, 70 students like to play music.

Next, we need to find the total number of students that like to read, play chess, swim, or play hurling. This is <fact2>67</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>38</fact5> = 126.

We also know that the total number of students in the class is <fact1>200</fact1>. So, the number of students that like to bake or play music is <fact1>200</fact1> - 126 = 74.

Since 70 students like to play music, the number of students that like to bake is 74 - 70 = 4.

Umar gives <fact6>two-fifths of the made popcorn to his brother Luis</fact6>. How many more pieces of popcorn does Umar have to eat than his brother?

Answer: In the first 22 seconds, <fact1>100 kernels popped</fact1>. In the next 22 seconds, <fact2>2 times that amount</fact2> popped, which is 2 x <fact1>100</fact1> = 200 kernels. In the next 22 seconds, the popping rate increased to <fact3>4 times the initial rate</fact3>, so 4 x <fact1>100</fact1> = 400 kernels popped. In the <fact4>final 22 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 22 seconds</fact4>, so 400 / 2 = 200 kernels popped. After taking the pan off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 22 seconds</fact5> also popped, which is 1/4 x 200 = 50 kernels. In total, 100 + 200 + 400 + 200 + 50 = 950 kernels popped. Umar gives <fact6>two-fifths of the made popcorn to his brother Luis</fact6>, which is 2/5 x 950 = 380 kernels. So Umar has 950 - 380 = 570 kernels to eat, and his brother has 380 kernels to eat. Therefore, Umar has 570 - 380 = 190 more kernels to eat than his brother.

In the next 18 seconds, the popping rate increased to <fact3>4 times the initial rate</fact3>, so 40 * 4 = 160 kernels popped. In the final 18 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to <fact4>half the rate of the past 18 seconds</fact4>, so 160 / 2 = 80 kernels popped. After taking the pan off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds</fact5> also popped, which is 80 / 4 = 20 kernels. In total, 40 + 120 + 160 + 80 + 20 = 420 kernels popped. Xavier gives <fact6>two-fifths of the made popcorn to his brother Gabriel</fact6>, which is 420 * 2 / 5 = 168 kernels. So Xavier has 420 - 168 = 252 kernels to eat, and his brother has 168 kernels to eat. Therefore, Xavier has 252 - 168 = 84 more kernels to eat than his brother.

We can represent the number of teaspoons of sugar as 48x, where x is a multiplier. Then, the number of cups of water is 6x, based on the ratio of <fact1>48:6</fact1>. The number of tablespoons of milk is (5/3)*6x = 10x, based on the ratio of <fact2>5:3</fact2>. The number of tablespoons of heavy cream is 2*48x = 96x, based on the ratio of <fact3>2:1</fact3>. We can set up an equation to represent the total number of ingredients: 48x + 6x + 10x + 96x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 160x = 210. Dividing both sides by 160, we get x = 1.3125. Since we want to find the number of teaspoons of sugar, we multiply x by 48: 1.3125 * 48 = 63.

She also uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 3 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information that Valeria used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. We can represent the number of teaspoons of sugar as ""s"", the number of cups of water as ""w"", the number of tablespoons of cream as ""c"", and the number of tablespoons of milk as ""m"". We know that s + w + c + m = 220.

From the ratio <fact1>60:6</fact1>, we can write an equation: s/w = 60/6, which simplifies to s/w = 10. We can rewrite this as s = 10w.

We also know that <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk are used for every 3 cups of water</fact2>, so m/w = 7/3.

Additionally, <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, so c/s = 2/1.

Now we can substitute these expressions into the original equation: s + w + c + m = 220. Substituting s = 10w, m = (7/3)w, and c = 2s, we get:

10w + w + 2(10w) + (7/3)w = 220

Combine like terms:

10w + w + 20w + (7/3)w = 220

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

30w + 3w + 60w + 7w = 660

Combine like terms:

100w = 660

Divide both sides by 100:

w = 6.6

Now that we know w, we can find s:

s = 10w
= 10(6.6)
= 66

So Valeria used 66 teaspoons of sugar.

She also uses <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 3 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>180 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information in <fact1>the ratio of 45:5 for teaspoons of sugar to cups of water</fact1>. We can write an equation using this ratio: 45x + 5x, where x is a multiplier. 

We also know from <fact2>the ratio of milk to water</fact2> that 6 tablespoons of milk are used for every 3 cups of water. Since the water ratio is 5, we need to find a common multiple for 3 and 5, which is 15. So, the ratio of milk to water becomes 6*5:3*5 = 30:15. Now we can simplify this ratio to 6:3, and we can see that for every 5 cups of water, 10 tablespoons of milk are used. We can now add this to our equation: 45x + 5x + 10x.

Next, we know from <fact3>the ratio of heavy cream to sugar</fact3> that 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar. Since the sugar ratio is 45, we can add this to our equation: 45x + 5x + 10x + 90x.

Now we can set up an equation using the information in <fact4>the total amount of ingredients used</fact4>: 45x + 5x + 10x + 90x = 180. 

Combine like terms: 150x = 180. 

Divide both sides by 150: x = 180/150 = 6/5.

Since x is a multiplier, we can multiply it by the original sugar ratio to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 45 * (6/5) = 54.

According to <fact2>the milk ratio</fact2>, she used (6/2)*(9/45*x) = 27/45*x tablespoons of milk. According to <fact3>the cream ratio</fact3>, she used 2*x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is x + 9/45*x + 27/45*x + 2*x = <fact4>190</fact4>. Solving for x, we get x + 9/45*x + 27/45*x + 2*x = 190, which simplifies to 45/45*x + 9/45*x + 27/45*x + 90/45*x = 190, which further simplifies to 171/45*x = 190.

She also uses <fact2>9 tablespoons of milk for every 18 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>230 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information in <fact1>the ratio of 63:12 for teaspoons of sugar to cups of water</fact1>. We can write an equation based on this ratio: 
Let x be the multiplier in the ratio, then the total number of teaspoons of sugar is 63x and the total number of cups of water is 12x. 

From <fact2>9 tablespoons of milk for every 18 cups of water</fact2>, we can write an equation for the total number of tablespoons of milk: (9/18) * 12x = 6x.

From <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, we can write an equation for the total number of tablespoons of heavy cream: 2 * 63x = 126x.

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is <fact4>230</fact4>. We can write the equation: 63x + 12x + 6x + 126x = 230.

Combine like terms: 207x = 230.

Divide both sides by 207: x = 230/207 = 1.11 (approximately).

Since x is approximately 1.11, the total number of teaspoons of sugar is 63x = 63 * 1.11 = 70.

Carlos has <fact1>80 square meters of kiwi field</fact1>. There are <fact2>29 kiwis per four-sixths of a square meter</fact2>. Carlos can harvest his kiwis every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. In addition, Carlos owns a <fact4>10-square meter apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>17 apricots per square meter</fact5>. The apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more kiwis does Carlos harvest than apricots?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many kiwis Carlos can harvest in two years. Since there are <fact2>29 kiwis per four-sixths of a square meter</fact2>, we need to find out how many four-sixths of a square meter are in <fact1>80 square meters of kiwi field</fact1>. To do this, we multiply 80 by 6/4 to get 120. Then we multiply 120 by <fact2>29 kiwis per four-sixths of a square meter</fact2> to get 3480 kiwis. Since Carlos can harvest his kiwis every <fact3>12 months</fact3> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Carlos can harvest 3480 kiwis twice in two years for a total of 6960 kiwis.

Next, we need to find out how many apricots Carlos can harvest in two years. Since Carlos owns a <fact4>10-square meter apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>17 apricots per square meter</fact5>, we multiply 10 by 17 to get 170 apricots. Since the apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Carlos can harvest 170 apricots 6 times in two years for a total of 1020 apricots.

Finally, we subtract the number of apricots from the number of kiwis to find out how many more kiwis Carlos harvests than apricots. 6960 - 1020 = 5940.

The pineapples can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more grapes does DeShawn harvest than pineapples?

Answer: Since there are <fact2>33 grapes per one-eighth of a hectare</fact2>, there are 8 * <fact2>33</fact2> = 264 grapes per hectare. So, <fact1>Deshawn's 10 hectares of grape field</fact1> will produce 264 * 10 = 2640 grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. Since <fact7>two years</fact7> is 24 months, Deshawn will harvest his grapes twice in this time period, resulting in a total of 2640 * 2 = 5280 grapes.

On the other hand, <fact4>DeShawn's 10-hectare pineapple field</fact4> will produce <fact5>18 pineapples per hectare</fact5> * 10 hectares = 180 pineapples every <fact6>4 months</fact6>.

The oranges can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more plums does Andre harvest than oranges?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>27 plums per 1/5 of a square yard</fact2>, there are 27 * 5 = 135 plums per square yard. With <fact1>30 square yards of plum field</fact1>, the total number of plums harvested per cycle is 135 * 30 = 4050 plums. Since Andre can harvest his plums every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, and there are <fact7>two years</fact7> (24 months), he can harvest plums twice, resulting in a total of 4050 * 2 = 8100 plums.

The kiwis can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more pears does Faisal harvest than kiwis?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pears Faisal harvests in two years. Since Faisal can harvest his pears every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of pears per square yard is <fact2>19 pears per 2/5 of a square yard</fact2>, which is equivalent to 19 / (2/5) = 19 * (5/2) = 47.5 pears per square yard. Since Faisal has <fact1>80 square yards of pear field</fact1>, the total number of pears he can harvest in one year is 47.5 * 80 = 3800 pears. Therefore, the total number of pears Faisal harvests in two years is 3800 * 2 = 7600 pears.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of kiwis Faisal harvests in two years. Since the kiwis can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Faisal can harvest 6 times in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of kiwis per square yard is <fact5>18 kiwis per square yard</fact5>. Since Faisal owns a <fact4>11-square yard kiwi field</fact4>, the total number of kiwis he can harvest in one harvest is 18 * 11 = 198 kiwis. Therefore, the total number of kiwis Faisal harvests in two years is 198 * 6 = 1188 kiwis.

If <fact9>the farmer has three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items purchased. 
The weight of hay is <fact1>5 boxes</fact1> * 6 pounds/box = 30 pounds. 
The weight of carrots is <fact2>14 bags</fact2> * 6 pounds/bag = 84 pounds. 
The weight of apples is <fact3>32 packs</fact3> * 38 pounds/pack = 1216 pounds. 
The weight of oats is <fact4>20 sacks</fact4> * 15 pounds/sack = 300 pounds. 
The weight of groceries is <fact5>43 pounds</fact5>. 
The weight of tools is <fact6>27 pounds</fact6>. 
The weight of wood is <fact7>100 pounds</fact7>. 
So, the total weight is 30 + 84 + 1216 + 300 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 1800 pounds. 
Since <fact8>each truck can carry 150 pounds at a time</fact8> and <fact9>there are three trucks</fact9>, the total weight that can be carried in one trip is 150 * 3 = 450 pounds.

The weight of tools is <fact6>27 kgs</fact6>. The weight of wood is <fact7>100 kgs</fact7>. So, the total weight is 35 + 60 + 1155 + 380 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 1800 kgs.

Since each truck can carry <fact8>100 kgs at a time</fact8>, and there are <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, the total weight that can be carried in one trip is <fact8>100</fact8> * <fact9>3</fact9> = 300 kgs. 

To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the weight that can be carried in one trip: 1800 / 300 = 6.

The weight of tools is <fact6>27 pounds</fact6>. The weight of wood is <fact7>100 pounds</fact7>. So, the total weight is 24 + 60 + 1240 + 306 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 1800 pounds.

Since each truck can carry <fact8>120 pounds at a time</fact8>, the total number of trips required is 1800 / (<fact8>120</fact8> * <fact9>3</fact9>) = 1800 / 360 = 5.

The remaining balls are tennis balls, so there are <fact1>400</fact1> - 80 = 320 tennis balls. <fact6>An eighth of the tennis balls are blue</fact6>, so there are 320 * <fact6>1/8</fact6> = 40 blue tennis balls. <fact7>All except a tenth of those blue balls are marked</fact7>, so there are 40 - (40 * <fact7>1/10</fact7>) = 40 - 4 = 36 marked blue tennis balls.

Therefore, the total number of marked balls is 4 (teal golf balls) + 36 (blue tennis balls) = 40.

Answer: There are <fact2>half of 280</fact2> = <fact1>280</fact1>/2 = 140 golf balls. Of those, <fact3>half are black</fact3>, so there are 140/2 = 70 black golf balls. Of those, <fact4>1/10 are marked</fact4>, so there are 70/10 = 7 marked black golf balls. There are also 140 tennis balls, of which <fact5>a quarter are pink</fact5>, so there are 140/4 = 35 pink tennis balls. Of those, all except <fact6>1/5 are marked</fact6>, so there are 35 - 35/5 = 35 - 7 = 28 marked pink tennis balls. Therefore, there are 7 + 28 = 35 marked balls in total.

A <fact3>quarter of the tennis balls are purple</fact3>, of which <fact4>1/5 are marked</fact4>. <fact5>1/3 of the golf balls are red</fact5>, and all except <fact6>1/8 of those red balls are marked</fact6>. How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since a <fact2>fifth of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>600</fact1> / 5 = 120. The rest are golf balls, so there are <fact1>600</fact1> - 120 = 480 golf balls.

Next, we need to find out how many marked tennis balls there are. A <fact3>quarter of the tennis balls are purple</fact3>, so there are 120 / 4 = 30 purple tennis balls. Of these, <fact4>1/5 are marked</fact4>, so there are 30 / 5 = 6 marked tennis balls.

Now, we need to find out how many marked golf balls there are. <fact5>1/3 of the golf balls are red</fact5>, so there are 480 / 3 = 160 red golf balls. All except <fact6>1/8 of those red balls are marked</fact6>, so the number of unmarked red golf balls is 160 / 8 = 20. Therefore, the number of marked red golf balls is 160 - 20 = 140.

Finally, we add the number of marked tennis balls and marked golf balls to get the total number of marked balls: 6 + 140 = 146.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: There are <fact2>half of 300</fact2> = <fact1>300</fact1>/2 = 150 golf balls. 
<fact3>A tenth of the golf balls are black</fact3>, so there are 150 / 10 = 15 black golf balls. 
<fact4>A third of the black golf balls are marked</fact4>, so there are 15 / 3 = 5 marked black golf balls. 
There are <fact1>300</fact1> - 150 = 150 tennis balls. 
<fact5>A fifth of the tennis balls are indigo</fact5>, so there are 150 / 5 = 30 indigo tennis balls. 
<fact6>Four fifths of the indigo tennis balls are marked</fact6>, so there are 30 * 4 / 5 = 24 marked indigo tennis balls.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: There are <fact1>600 balls</fact1> in total. Since <fact2>1/2 of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, there are <fact1>600</fact1> * <fact2>1/2</fact2> = 300 tennis balls. Since <fact3>1/5 of the tennis balls are red</fact3>, there are 300 * <fact3>1/5</fact3> = 60 red tennis balls. Since <fact4>a tenth of the red tennis balls are marked</fact4>, there are 60 * <fact4>1/10</fact4> = 6 marked red tennis balls.

Since <fact2>1/2 of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, the rest are golf balls, so there are <fact1>600</fact1> - 300 = 300 golf balls. Since <fact5>half of the golf balls are brown</fact5>, there are 300 * <fact5>1/2</fact5> = 150 brown golf balls. Since all except <fact6>half of those brown balls are marked</fact6>, there are 150 - (150 * <fact6>1/2</fact6>) = 150 - 75 = 75 marked brown golf balls.

Therefore, the total number of marked balls is 6 (marked red tennis balls) + 75 (marked brown golf balls) = 81.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>31 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>7 stuffed animals</fact2> = 38. 
Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is <fact3>twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined</fact3>. So, there are 2 * 38 = 76 action figures. 
Next, we find the total number of crayons, which is <fact4>12 different colors of crayon</fact4>. 
We also find the total number of stickers, which is <fact5>8 pages</fact5> * 10 stickers per page = 80 stickers. 
Then, we add up the total number of items Sophia had before buying the bouncy balls: 38 blocks and stuffed animals + 76 action figures + <fact4>12 crayons</fact4> + 80 stickers + <fact6>27 stacking rings</fact6> = 233 items. 
Since Sophia now has a total of <fact8>300 items</fact8>, the number of bouncy balls she bought is <fact8>300</fact8> - 233 = 67.

For the next 30 minutes, the cost is <fact3>$0.3 per minute</fact3> * 30 minutes = $9. 
For the remaining 80 minutes, the cost is <fact5>$0.1 per two minutes</fact5> * (80 minutes / 2) = $4. 
The total cost is $7 + $9 + $4 = $20. 
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>$15</fact6>, a <fact7>10% discount</fact7> is applied, making the final cost $20 - ($20 * 0.1) = $18.

Answer: To calculate the cost of the call, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 15 minutes, the next 20 minutes, and the remaining 70 minutes. 
The first <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> cost <fact1>€0.8 per minute</fact1>, so the total cost for this part is <fact1>€0.8</fact1> * <fact2>15</fact2> = €12.
The next 20 minutes cost <fact3>€0.7 per minute</fact3>, so the total cost for this part is <fact3>€0.7</fact3> * 20 = €14.
The remaining 70 minutes are charged at a rate of <fact5>€0.4 per two minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to €0.2 per minute. So, the total cost for this part is €0.2 * 70 = €14.
The total cost of the call is €12 + €14 + €14 = €40.
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>€15</fact6>, we get a <fact7>20% discount on the total bill</fact7>. The discount amount is €40 * 0.2 = €8.

Answer: Mateo used <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7> = 120 ounces to make the giant cubes.
He used <fact3>6 ounces</fact3> * <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 72 ounces to make the medium cubes.
He used <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> * <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> = 7 ounces to make the small cubes.

Answer: Viktor used <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2> = 108 ounces of water to make the giant cubes.
He used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> = 48 ounces of water to make the medium cubes.
He used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces of water to make the small cubes.
Since <fact6>47 total ice cubes</fact6> were made, the number of tiny cubes made is 47 - 9 - 14 - 12 = 12 tiny cubes.
Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 0.5 * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 0.25 ounces per cube.
So, Viktor used 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces per cube = 3 ounces of water to make the tiny cubes.

Since the tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they must be 1/2 * <fact4>1/2 of a ounce</fact4> = 1/4 of an ounce.
So, Ravi used 12 tiny cubes * 1/4 of an ounce = 3 ounces of water to make the tiny cubes.
In total, Ravi used 104 + 48 + 7 + 3 = 162 ounces of water to make all the ice cubes.

How many ounces of water does DeShawn have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, DeShawn used <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>14 ounces per cube</fact2> = 112 ounces. For medium cubes, he used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>5 ounces</fact3> = 60 ounces. For small cubes, he used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 0.5 * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 0.25 ounces per cube. We know that DeShawn made <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6>, so the number of tiny cubes is <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6> - <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. The amount of water used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces. Now, we can calculate the total amount of water used: 112 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 182 ounces. Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: <fact1>327 ounces of water</fact1> - 182 ounces = 145 ounces.

How many ounces of water does Liam have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. The giant cubes use <fact2>14 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> = 112 ounces. The medium cubes use <fact3>6 ounces</fact3> * <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 72 ounces. The small cubes use <fact4>1/2 of a ounce</fact4> * <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> = 7 ounces. Since the tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 1/4 of an ounce per cube. We know that the total number of cubes is <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6>, so the number of tiny cubes is <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6> - <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. The tiny cubes use 1/4 of an ounce per cube * 12 tiny cubes = 3 ounces. The total amount of water used is 112 + 72 + 7 + 3 = 194 ounces. Therefore, Liam has <fact1>315 ounces of water</fact1> - 194 ounces = 121 ounces of water left.

Answer: Sanjay used <fact2>16 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7> = 160 ounces to make the giant cubes.
He used <fact3>6 ounces</fact3> * <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 72 ounces to make the medium cubes.
He used <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> * <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> = 7 ounces to make the small cubes.
Since <fact5>tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 1/4 ounces per cube. 
Sanjay made <fact6>48 total ice cubes</fact6> - <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes.
So he used 1/4 ounces per cube * 12 tiny cubes = 3 ounces to make the tiny cubes.

How many ounces of water does Ibrahim have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, <fact7>12 cubes</fact7> * <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2> = 144 ounces. For medium cubes, <fact9>12 cubes</fact9> * <fact3>5 ounces per cube</fact3> = 60 ounces. For small cubes, <fact8>14 cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 ounces per cube</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces. Since <fact6>50 total ice cubes</fact6> were made, and we know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes: <fact6>50</fact6> - <fact7>12</fact7> - <fact9>12</fact9> - <fact8>14</fact8> = 12 tiny cubes. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use <fact4>2/4</fact4>/2 = 1/4 ounces per cube. So, 12 tiny cubes use 12 * 1/4 = 3 ounces. Now, we can calculate the total amount of water used: 144 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 214 ounces. Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount: <fact1>318 ounces</fact1> - 214 ounces = 104 ounces.

For medium cubes, the amount of water used is <fact9>15 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>3 ounces</fact3> = 45 ounces. For small cubes, the amount of water used is <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 ounces per cube. We know that Luca makes <fact6>49 total ice cubes</fact6>, so the number of tiny cubes is <fact6>49 total ice cubes</fact6> - <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>15 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes.

How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Carlos has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Carlos had <fact3>720 almonds</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the almonds</fact7>, he ate 720 / 5 = 144 almonds. So, he has 720 - 144 = 576 almonds left.

Next, we need to find out how many almonds the tables can hold. Since <fact2>each table can hold three times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds. Since Carlos has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has 1 table left. So, the table can hold 72 almonds.

Now, we need to find out how many almonds the bowls can hold. Since Carlos has <fact4>7 bowls</fact4> and <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, the bowls can hold 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.

The total capacity of the tables and bowls is 72 + 168 = 240 almonds. Since Carlos has 576 almonds left, he needs to place 576 - 240 = 336 more almonds.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, Carlos needs 336 / 24 = 14 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Arash has left after eating one-fourth of them. Since Arash had <fact3>600 crackers</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fourth of all the crackers</fact7>, he ate 600 / 4 = 150 crackers. So, he has 600 - 150 = 450 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers Arash can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact1>each table can hold 25 crackers</fact1> and Arash has <fact4>11 tables</fact4>, he can place 11 x 25 = 275 crackers on the tables. 

Since <fact2>each plate can hold six times</fact2> the number of crackers a table can hold, each plate can hold 6 x <fact1>25</fact1> = 150 crackers.

In total, Tariq can place 252 + 147 = 399 olives on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 525 olives left, he needs to place 525 - 399 = 126 more olives.

Since <fact1>each table can hold 21 olives</fact1>, Tariq needs 126 / 21 = 6 more tables to place all the remaining olives.

How many more bowls does Wei need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Wei has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the olives</fact7>. Wei started with <fact3>525 olives</fact3> and ate <fact3>525</fact3>/<fact7>5</fact7> = 105 olives. So, Wei has <fact3>525</fact3> - 105 = 420 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives the plates can hold. Since <fact2>each plate can hold four times</fact2> what <fact1>each bowl can hold</fact1>, each plate can hold <fact1>35</fact1> * <fact2>4</fact2> = 140 olives. Wei has <fact5>3 plates</fact5> but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so Wei has <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 plate left. This plate can hold 140 olives.

Wei also has <fact4>7 bowls</fact4> that can hold <fact1>35 olives</fact1> each, for a total of <fact4>7</fact4> * <fact1>35</fact1> = 245 olives.

In total, Wei's plates and bowls can hold 140 + 245 = 385 olives. Wei has 420 olives left, so he needs to hold 420 - 385 = 35 more olives.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 35 olives</fact1>, Wei needs 1 more bowl to hold the remaining olives.

How many more tables does Viktor need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Viktor has left after eating <fact7>one-eighth of all the cookies</fact7>. Viktor had <fact3>720 cookies</fact3> and ate 720/<fact7>8</fact7> = 90 cookies. So, Viktor has 720 - 90 = 630 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Viktor can place on the tables and bowls he has. Viktor has <fact4>11 tables</fact4> and each table can hold <fact1>21 cookies</fact1>, so he can place 11 * 21 = 231 cookies on the tables. Viktor had <fact5>5 bowls</fact5> but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 bowls left. Each bowl can hold <fact2>three times</fact2> as many cookies as a table, which is 3 * <fact1>21 cookies</fact1> = 63 cookies. So, Viktor can place 3 * 63 = 189 cookies on the bowls.

In total, Viktor can place 231 + 189 = 420 cookies on the tables and bowls he has. He has 630 cookies left, so he needs to place 630 - 420 = 210 more cookies.

Since each table can hold <fact1>21 cookies</fact1>, Viktor needs 210/<fact1>21</fact1> = 10 more tables to place all the remaining cookies.

How many more tables does Qasim need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Qasim has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the almonds</fact7>. Since Qasim had <fact3>540 almonds</fact3>, he ate 540 / 5 = 108 almonds. So, he has 540 - 108 = 432 almonds left.

Now, let's find out how many almonds Qasim can place on the tables and bowls he has. He has <fact4>7 tables</fact4> and each table can hold <fact1>24 almonds</fact1>, so he can place 7 x 24 = 168 almonds on the tables. 

As for the bowls, Qasim had <fact5>4 bowls</fact5> but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 bowls left. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold three times</fact2> as many almonds as a table, each bowl can hold 24 x 3 = 72 almonds. So, Qasim can place 2 x 72 = 144 almonds on the bowls.

In total, Qasim can place 168 + 144 = 312 almonds on the tables and bowls he has. Since he has 432 almonds left, he needs to place 432 - 312 = 120 more almonds.

Since <fact1>each table can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, Qasim needs 120 / 24 = 5 more tables to place all the remaining almonds.

How many more plates does Leon need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Leon has left after eating <fact7>one-ninth of all the bananas</fact7>. To do this, we need to calculate <fact7>one-ninth of all the bananas</fact7>, which is <fact3>675 bananas</fact3> / 9 = 75 bananas. So, Leon has <fact3>675 bananas</fact3> - 75 bananas = 600 bananas left.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Leon can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Leon has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> - 2 tables = 1 table left. Each table can hold <fact2>seven times</fact2> the number of bananas a plate can hold, which is <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> * 7 = 140 bananas. So, Leon can place 140 bananas on the 1 table he has left.

Leon also has <fact4>19 plates</fact4>, and each plate can hold <fact1>20 bananas</fact1>. So, Leon can place <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> * <fact4>19 plates</fact4> = 380 bananas on the plates.

In total, Leon can place 140 bananas + 380 bananas = 520 bananas on the tables and plates he has. Since Leon has 600 bananas left, he needs to place 600 bananas - 520 bananas = 80 bananas on additional plates.

Since each plate can hold <fact1>20 bananas</fact1>, Leon needs 80 bananas / <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> = 4 more plates to place all the remaining bananas.

How many more tables does Ali need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Ali has left after eating one-fifth of them. Ali eats <fact7>one-fifth</fact7> of <fact3>660 almonds</fact3>, which is 660 / 5 = 132 almonds. So, Ali has 660 - 132 = 528 almonds left.

Since <fact2>each plate can hold seven times</fact2> what <fact1>each table can hold</fact1>, each plate can hold 24 * 7 = 168 almonds.

Ali has <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 plate left. This plate can hold 168 almonds.

Ali also has <fact4>11 tables</fact4>, and each table can hold <fact1>24 almonds</fact1>, so these tables can hold 11 * 24 = 264 almonds.

In total, Ali can place 168 + 264 = 432 almonds on the tables and plates he has.

Since Ali has 528 almonds left, he needs to place 528 - 432 = 96 more almonds.

To place these almonds, Ali needs 96 / <fact1>24 almonds per table</fact1> = 4 more tables.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Andre has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Andre had <fact3>540 cookies</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the cookies</fact7>, he ate 540 / 5 = 108 cookies. So, he has 540 - 108 = 432 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the plates can hold. Since <fact2>each plate can hold three times</fact2> the number of cookies a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 cookies</fact1>, each plate can hold 24 * 3 = 72 cookies. Since Andre has <fact5>4 plates</fact5> but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, he has 4 - 2 = 2 plates left. So, the plates can hold 2 * 72 = 144 cookies.

How many more tables does Theo need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies each bowl can hold. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> as many cookies as a table, and <fact1>each table can hold 20 cookies</fact1>, each bowl can hold 5 x 20 = 100 cookies.

Theo originally had <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he is left with 3 - 2 = 1 bowl. The total capacity of the bowls is 1 x 100 = 100 cookies.

Theo also has <fact4>8 tables</fact4>, and <fact1>each table can hold 20 cookies</fact1>, so the total capacity of the tables is 8 x 20 = 160 cookies.

How many more bowls does Bodhi need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Bodhi has left after eating two-fourths of them. Since Bodhi eats <fact7>two-fourths of all the cookies</fact7>, he eats 2/4 * <fact3>660 cookies</fact3> = 330 cookies. So, he has <fact3>660 cookies</fact3> - 330 cookies = 330 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Bodhi can place on the tables and bowls he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Bodhi has <fact5>4 tables</fact5> - 2 tables = 2 tables left. Since <fact2>each table can hold three times</fact2> as many cookies as a bowl, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 22 cookies</fact1>, each table can hold 3 * <fact1>22 cookies</fact1> = 66 cookies.

Bodhi also has <fact4>7 bowls</fact4> which can hold <fact4>7 bowls</fact4> * <fact1>22 cookies</fact1> = 154 cookies.

In total, Bodhi can place 132 cookies + 154 cookies = 286 cookies on the tables and bowls he has.

Since Bodhi has 330 cookies left, and he can place 286 cookies on the tables and bowls he has, he needs to place 330 cookies - 286 cookies = 44 cookies on additional bowls.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 22 cookies</fact1>, Bodhi needs 44 cookies / <fact1>22 cookies</fact1> = 2 more bowls.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Gabriel has left after eating <fact7>one-tenth of all the crackers</fact7>. Since Gabriel had <fact3>600 crackers</fact3>, he ate 600 / 10 = 60 crackers. So, he has 600 - 60 = 540 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers the tables can hold. Since <fact2>each table can hold four times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 20 crackers</fact1>, each table can hold 4 x 20 = 80 crackers. Since Gabriel has <fact5>4 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has 4 - 2 = 2 tables left. So, the tables can hold 2 x 80 = 160 crackers.

Deshawn starts with <fact3>630 cookies</fact3> and eats <fact7>one-tenth of all the cookies</fact7>, so he eats <fact3>630</fact3> / 10 = 63 cookies. This leaves him with <fact3>630</fact3> - 63 = 567 cookies.

Deshawn has <fact4>12 plates</fact4> and <fact5>4 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has <fact5>4</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 2 bowls left.

Since Deshawn has 567 cookies left and can only hold 378 cookies, he needs to hold 567 - 378 = 189 more cookies. Since <fact1>each plate can hold 21 cookies</fact1>, Deshawn needs 189 / <fact1>21</fact1> = 9 more plates.

Since <fact2>each plate can hold two times</fact2> what <fact1>each bowl can hold</fact1>, each plate can hold <fact1>32</fact1> * 2 = 64 crackers.

Qasim has <fact4>10 bowls</fact4> and <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 plate left.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Ravi has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Ravi had <fact3>660 almonds</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the almonds</fact7>, he ate 660 / 5 = 132 almonds. So, he has 660 - 132 = 528 almonds left.

Next, we need to find out how many almonds Ravi can place on the plates he has. Since <fact2>each plate can hold three times</fact2> what <fact1>each bowl can hold</fact1>, each plate can hold 22 * 3 = 66 almonds. Ravi has <fact5>5 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 plates left. He can place 3 * 66 = 198 almonds on the plates.

Now, we need to find out how many almonds Ravi can place on the bowls he has. Ravi has <fact4>12 bowls</fact4> and <fact1>each bowl can hold 22 almonds</fact1>, so he can place 12 * 22 = 264 almonds on the bowls.

In total, Ravi can place 198 + 264 = 462 almonds on the plates and bowls he has. Since he has 528 almonds left, he needs to place 528 - 462 = 66 more almonds.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 22 almonds</fact1>, Ravi needs 66 / 22 = 3 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.

How many more bowls does Oscar need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Oscar has left after eating <fact7>one-seventh of all the almonds</fact7>. He has <fact3>630 almonds</fact3> and eats 630/<fact7>7</fact7> = 90 almonds. So, he has 630 - 90 = 540 almonds left.

Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Oscar has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> - 2 = 1 table left. Each table can hold <fact1>30 almonds</fact1> * <fact2>8</fact2> = 240 almonds. So, the remaining table can hold 240 almonds. 

Oscar also has <fact4>8 bowls</fact4> and each bowl can hold <fact1>30 almonds</fact1>. So, the bowls can hold <fact1>30 almonds</fact1> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 240 almonds.

How many more bowls does Diego need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Diego has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the crackers</fact7>. Since Diego had <fact3>690 crackers</fact3>, he ate 690 / 5 = 138 crackers. So, he has 690 - 138 = 552 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers the plates can hold. Since <fact2>each plate can hold six times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 23 crackers</fact1>, each plate can hold 23 * 6 = 138 crackers. Since Diego has <fact5>3 plates</fact5> but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, he has 3 - 2 = 1 plate left. So, the plate can hold 138 crackers.

Now, we need to find out how many crackers the bowls can hold. Since Diego has <fact4>15 bowls</fact4>, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 23 crackers</fact1>, the bowls can hold 15 * 23 = 345 crackers.

Since the plate can hold 138 crackers, and the bowls can hold 345 crackers, together they can hold 138 + 345 = 483 crackers. But Diego has 552 crackers left, so he needs to place 552 - 483 = 69 more crackers.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 23 crackers</fact1>, Diego needs 69 / 23 = 3 more bowls to place all the remaining crackers.

How many more bowls does Noah need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers each plate can hold. Since each plate can hold <fact2>five times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and a bowl can hold <fact1>24 crackers</fact1>, a plate can hold 24 * 5 = 120 crackers.

Noah has <fact4>9 bowls</fact4> and <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 9 bowls and 1 plate left. The total capacity of the bowls is <fact1>24 crackers</fact1> * <fact4>9 bowls</fact4> = 216 crackers. The capacity of the remaining plate is 120 crackers. So, the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 216 + 120 = 336 crackers.

Noah starts with <fact3>600 crackers</fact3> and eats <fact7>two-fifths of all the crackers</fact7>, which is 2/5 * 600 = 240 crackers. So, he has 600 - 240 = 360 crackers left.

Since the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 336 crackers, and Noah has 360 crackers left, he needs to place 360 - 336 = 24 crackers. Since each bowl can hold <fact1>24 crackers</fact1>, Noah needs 1 more bowl.

How many more tables does Faisal need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Faisal has left after eating one-ninth of them. Since Faisal started with <fact3>720 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-ninth of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 720 / 9 = 80 olives. So, he has 720 - 80 = 640 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives Faisal can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact1>each table can hold 32 olives</fact1> and Faisal has <fact4>7 tables</fact4>, he can place 7 x 32 = 224 olives on the tables. Since <fact2>each plate can hold three times that</fact2> of a table, each plate can hold 32 x 3 = 96 olives. Faisal has <fact5>4 plates</fact5> but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 plates left. He can place 2 x 96 = 192 olives on the plates.

In total, Faisal can place 224 + 192 = 416 olives on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 640 olives left, he needs to place 640 - 416 = 224 more olives.

Deshawn then eats <fact7>two-fifths of all the almonds</fact7>. How many more bowls does DeShawn need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds each table can hold. Since <fact2>each table can hold four times</fact2> as many almonds as a bowl, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 27 almonds</fact1>, each table can hold 4 * 27 = 108 almonds.

Next, we need to find out how many almonds Deshawn has left after eating <fact7>two-fifths of all the almonds</fact7>. Since Deshawn had <fact3>630 almonds</fact3> initially, he ate 2/5 * 630 = 252 almonds. So, he has 630 - 252 = 378 almonds left.

Now, let's find out how many almonds Deshawn can place on the tables and bowls he has. He has <fact5>3 tables</fact5>, but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 table left. This table can hold 108 almonds. He also has <fact4>9 bowls</fact4>, which can hold 9 * 27 = 243 almonds.

In total, Deshawn can place 108 + 243 = 351 almonds on the tables and bowls he has. Since he has 378 almonds left, he needs to place 378 - 351 = 27 more almonds.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 27 almonds</fact1>, Deshawn needs 1 more bowl to place the remaining almonds.

Next, we need to find out how many almonds James can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> - 2 = 1 table left. Each table can hold <fact1>20 almonds</fact1> * 3 = 60 almonds (since <fact2>each table can hold three times that</fact2> of a plate). So, he can place 1 * 60 = 60 almonds on the table.

Answer: Mateo starts with <fact3>720 almonds</fact3> and eats <fact7>one-fifth of all the almonds</fact7>, so he eats 720/<fact7>5</fact7> = 144 almonds. This leaves him with 720 - 144 = 576 almonds. 
Each bowl can hold <fact1>24 almonds</fact1> * 2 = <fact2>48 almonds</fact2>. Mateo has <fact5>5 bowls</fact5> but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 bowls left. The bowls can hold 3 * <fact2>48 almonds</fact2> = 144 almonds.

How many more tables does Faisal need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Faisal has left after eating one-tenth of them. Since Faisal eats <fact7>one-tenth of all the cookies</fact7>, he eats <fact3>720 cookies</fact3> / 10 = 72 cookies. So, he has <fact3>720 cookies</fact3> - 72 cookies = 648 cookies left.

Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> as many cookies as a table, each bowl can hold <fact1>27 cookies</fact1> * 5 = 135 cookies.

Faisal has <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has <fact5>3 bowls</fact5> - <fact6>2 bowls</fact6> = 1 bowl left. This bowl can hold 135 cookies.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Oliver has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Oliver eats <fact7>one-fifth of all the cookies</fact7>, he eats <fact3>630</fact3> * 1/5 = 126 cookies. So, he has <fact3>630</fact3> - 126 = 504 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Oliver can place on the tables and bowls he has. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> as many cookies as a table, each bowl can hold <fact1>28</fact1> * 5 = 140 cookies. However, <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so Oliver only has <fact5>3</fact5> - 2 = 1 bowl left. This bowl can hold 140 cookies. Oliver also has <fact4>11 tables</fact4>, which can hold <fact1>28</fact1> * 11 = 308 cookies.

In total, Oliver can place 140 + 308 = 448 cookies on the tables and bowls he has. Since he has 504 cookies left, he needs to place 504 - 448 = 56 more cookies.

Finally, since <fact1>each table can hold 28 cookies</fact1>, Oliver needs 56 / 28 = 2 more tables to place all the remaining cookies.

How many more plates does Oscar need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Oscar has left after eating <fact7>one-sixth of all the bananas</fact7>. Since Oscar had <fact3>600 bananas</fact3>, he ate 600/<fact7>6</fact7> = 100 bananas. So, he has 600 - 100 = 500 bananas left.

Since <fact2>each bowl can hold six times</fact2> as many bananas as a plate, and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 bananas</fact1>, each bowl can hold 20 * 6 = 120 bananas.

Oscar has <fact4>18 plates</fact4> and <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 bowl left. The total capacity of the plates is <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> * <fact4>18 plates</fact4> = 360 bananas. The total capacity of the bowl is 120 * 1 = 120 bananas.

In total, Oscar can place 360 + 120 = 480 bananas on the plates and the bowl. Since he has 500 bananas left, he needs to place 500 - 480 = 20 more bananas.

Since <fact1>each plate can hold 20 bananas</fact1>, Oscar needs 1 more plate to place the remaining bananas.

Mohammed then eats <fact7>one-seventh of all the cookies</fact7>. How many more tables does Mohammed need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Mohammed has left after eating <fact7>one-seventh of all the cookies</fact7>. Mohammed had <fact3>630 cookies</fact3> and ate 630 / 7 = 90 cookies. So, he has 630 - 90 = 540 cookies left.

Since <fact2>each bowl can hold two times</fact2> what <fact1>each table can hold</fact1>, each bowl can hold 27 * 2 = 54 cookies.

Mohammed has <fact4>11 tables</fact4> and <fact5>5 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 11 tables and 5 - 2 = 3 bowls left.

The total capacity of the tables is <fact1>27 cookies</fact1> * <fact4>11 tables</fact4> = 297 cookies. The total capacity of the bowls is 54 cookies * 3 bowls = 162 cookies. So, the total capacity of the tables and bowls is 297 + 162 = 459 cookies.

Mohammed has 540 cookies left, but the tables and bowls can only hold 459 cookies. So, he needs to place 540 - 459 = 81 more cookies.

Since <fact1>each table can hold 27 cookies</fact1>, Mohammed needs 81 / 27 = 3 more tables to place all the remaining cookies.

How many more plates does Thiago need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Thiago has left after eating one-tenth of them. Since Thiago started with <fact3>630 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-tenth of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 630 / 10 = 63 olives. So, he has 630 - 63 = 567 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives Thiago can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact2>each table can hold four times</fact2> what <fact1>each plate can hold</fact1>, each table can hold 4 * 27 = 108 olives. Thiago has <fact5>5 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 tables left. He can place 3 * 108 = 324 olives on the tables.

Thiago also has <fact4>8 plates</fact4> and <fact1>each plate can hold 27 olives</fact1>, so he can place 8 * 27 = 216 olives on the plates.

In total, Thiago can place 324 + 216 = 540 olives on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 567 olives left, he needs to place 567 - 540 = 27 more olives.

Since <fact1>each plate can hold 27 olives</fact1>, Thiago needs 1 more plate to place the remaining olives.

How many more plates does Tariq need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Tariq has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the bananas</fact7>. Since Tariq had <fact3>690 bananas</fact3>, he ate 690/<fact7>5</fact7> = 138 bananas. So, he has 690 - 138 = 552 bananas left.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas the tables can hold. Since <fact2>each table can hold eight times</fact2> what a plate can hold, and <fact1>each plate can hold 24 bananas</fact1>, each table can hold 24 * 8 = 192 bananas. Since Tariq has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has 1 table left that can hold 192 bananas.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas the plates can hold. Since Tariq has <fact4>8 plates</fact4> and <fact1>each plate can hold 24 bananas</fact1>, the plates can hold 8 * 24 = 192 bananas.

In total, the tables and plates can hold 192 + 192 = 384 bananas. Since Tariq has 552 bananas left, he needs to place 552 - 384 = 168 more bananas.

Since <fact1>each plate can hold 24 bananas</fact1>, Tariq needs 168/24 = 7 more plates to place all the remaining bananas.

How many more bowls does Mateo need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: Mateo has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 table left. Since <fact2>each table can hold three times</fact2> as many bananas as a bowl, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 25 bananas</fact1>, the table can hold 3 * 25 = 75 bananas. Mateo also has <fact4>8 bowls</fact4> which can hold 8 * 25 = 200 bananas. In total, Mateo can hold 75 + 200 = 275 bananas with the bowls and tables he has. Mateo started with <fact3>600 bananas</fact3> but ate <fact7>one-fourth of all the bananas</fact7>, so he has 600 - 600/4 = 450 bananas left.

How many more plates does Andre need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Andre has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Andre started with <fact3>675 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 675 / 5 = 135 olives. So, he has 675 - 135 = 540 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives the bowls can hold. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> what a plate can hold, and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 olives</fact1>, each bowl can hold 5 x 20 = 100 olives. Since Andre has <fact5>3 bowls</fact5> but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, he has 3 - 2 = 1 bowl left. So, the bowl can hold 100 olives.

Now, we need to find out how many olives the plates can hold. Since Andre has <fact4>13 plates</fact4> and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 olives</fact1>, the plates can hold 13 x 20 = 260 olives.

Since the bowl and the plates together can hold 100 + 260 = 360 olives, and Andre has 540 olives left, he needs to place 540 - 360 = 180 more olives.

Deshawn then eats <fact7>one-tenth of all the bananas</fact7>. How many more tables does DeShawn need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas each plate can hold. Since each plate can hold <fact2>four times</fact2> what a table can hold, each plate can hold <fact1>22</fact1> * 4 = 88 bananas.

Initially, Deshawn has <fact3>660 bananas</fact3>, <fact4>11 tables</fact4>, and <fact5>5 plates</fact5>. However, <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he is left with <fact5>5</fact5> - 2 = 3 plates.

Deshawn then eats <fact7>one-tenth of all the bananas</fact7>, which is <fact3>660</fact3> / 10 = 66 bananas. So, he is left with <fact3>660</fact3> - 66 = 594 bananas.

The total capacity of the tables is <fact1>22</fact1> * <fact4>11</fact4> = 242 bananas. The total capacity of the plates is 88 * 3 = 264 bananas. So, the total capacity of the tables and plates is 242 + 264 = 506 bananas.

Since Deshawn has 594 bananas left, he needs to place 594 - 506 = 88 more bananas. Since each table can hold <fact1>22</fact1> bananas, he needs 88 / <fact1>22</fact1> = 4 more tables.

Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the grocery store without being late?

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes for Noah and Oscar to get to the gym. It takes them <fact2>12 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the mall is and another <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to get to the gym. So, the total time to get to the gym is <fact2>12</fact2> + <fact3>38</fact3> = 50 minutes. 

Since they have to return home to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again, the total time spent walking to the gym and back home and then back to the gym is 50 * 2 = 100 minutes for the round trip to home and 50 minutes to get back to the gym.

After a visit to the vet, Noah discovered that <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before</fact7>. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Noah has <fact1>96 puppies</fact1>, Jamal has <fact3>55 puppies</fact3>, and Andre has <fact5>59 dogs</fact5> with <fact6>11 puppies</fact6> each, so Andre has <fact5>59</fact5> * <fact6>11</fact6> = 649 puppies. The total number of puppies is <fact1>96</fact1> + <fact3>55</fact3> + 649 = 800.

Answer: 
Kai's dog originally had <fact2>17 puppies with spots</fact2>. Since <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before</fact7>, the number of puppies with spots increased by half of (<fact1>119</fact1> - <fact2>17</fact2>) = 51.

After a visit to the vet, Luca discovered that <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before</fact7>. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Luca has <fact1>135 puppies</fact1>, Gabriel has <fact3>45 puppies</fact3>, and Mateo has <fact5>50 dogs</fact5> with <fact6>14 puppies</fact6> each, so Mateo has <fact5>50</fact5> * <fact6>14</fact6> = 700 puppies.

After a visit to the vet, Noah discovered that <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before</fact7>. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Noah's dog has <fact1>136 puppies</fact1>, Qasim's dog has <fact3>49 puppies</fact3>, and Jin has <fact5>59 dogs</fact5> with <fact6>10 puppies</fact6> each, so Jin has <fact5>59</fact5> * <fact6>10</fact6> = 590 puppies. The total number of puppies is <fact1>136</fact1> + <fact3>49</fact3> + 590 = 775 puppies.

Noah's dog had <fact2>18 puppies with spots</fact2> and Qasim's dog had <fact4>15 puppies with spots</fact4>. Jin had <fact5>59</fact5> * <fact6>10</fact6> = 590 puppies with spots. So, the initial number of puppies with spots is <fact2>18</fact2> + <fact4>15</fact4> + 590 = 623.

However, after the vet visit, it was discovered that <fact7>half of Noah's unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7>. Noah had <fact1>136</fact1> - <fact2>18</fact2> = 118 unspotted puppies. Half of these, 118 / 2 = 59, actually have spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 623 + 59 = 682.

Leon also has <fact1>147 puppies</fact1> - <fact2>27 puppies with spots</fact2> = 120 puppies without spots. But <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before</fact7>, so Leon has 120 / 2 = 60 more puppies with spots.

So, the total number of puppies with spots is 27 + 13 + 670 + 60 = 770 puppies.

Finally, we can find the percentage of puppies with spots by dividing the total number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100.

Ibrahim has <fact1>148 puppies</fact1>, Noah has <fact3>56 puppies</fact3>, and Hiroshi has <fact5>61 dogs</fact5> with <fact6>11 puppies with spots</fact6> each, so Hiroshi has <fact5>61</fact5> * <fact6>11</fact6> = 671 puppies. The total number of puppies is <fact1>148</fact1> + <fact3>56</fact3> + 671 = 875 puppies.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Ibrahim has <fact2>20 puppies with spots</fact2>, Noah has <fact4>15 puppies with spots</fact4>, and Hiroshi has <fact5>61</fact5> * <fact6>11</fact6> = 671 puppies with spots.

However, we also need to consider the puppies that Ibrahim discovered had hidden spots. The number of unspotted puppies Ibrahim had initially was <fact1>148</fact1> - <fact2>20</fact2> = 128. Since <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7>, the number of puppies with hidden spots is 128 / 2 = 64.

Answer: 
Carlos's dog originally had <fact2>18 puppies with spots</fact2>. He also had <fact1>148</fact1> - <fact2>18</fact2> = 130 puppies without spots. After the vet visit, <fact7>half of the unspotted puppies</fact7> were found to have spots. So, 130 / 2 = 65 more puppies were found to have spots.

The total number of puppies is <fact1>103</fact1> + <fact3>64</fact3> + 583 = 750.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Thiago has <fact2>25 puppies with spots</fact2>, Ibrahim has <fact4>13 puppies with spots</fact4>, and Jin has <fact5>53</fact5> * <fact6>11</fact6> = 583 puppies with spots.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Ananya's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach, and it takes her <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> to do so after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. Let's call her original speed on the beach ""x"" miles per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed is 0.5x miles per minute. We can set up the equation: <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / 0.5x = <fact6>50 minutes</fact6>. Solving for x, we get x = 0.4 miles per minute.

Since Ananya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 miles per minute. After her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.4 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Ananya to walk <fact3>14 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>14 miles</fact3> / 0.4 miles per minute = 35 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Ananya to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to get the total time: <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> + 35 minutes = 85 minutes.

If <fact6>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Olga walks <fact2>12 miles on the beach</fact2> and this takes her <fact6>48 minutes</fact6>, her speed on the beach after the injury is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles per minute. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her original speed on the beach was 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 miles per minute. Since she walks <fact4>two times as fast on the sidewalk</fact4>, her original speed on the sidewalk was 0.5 * 2 = 1 mile per minute. After the injury, her speed on the sidewalk is 1 / 2 = 0.5 miles per minute. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>14 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> after the injury: <fact3>14 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 28 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1> is <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> on the beach + 28 minutes on the sidewalk = 76 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Nia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>.

If <fact6>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>35-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Nia's original speed on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2x kilometers per minute</fact4>. After the injury, her speed on the beach becomes x/2 kilometers per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk becomes x kilometers per minute. 

Since <fact6>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, and the distance walked on the beach is <fact2>17 kilometers</fact2>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows: 
17 kilometers / 51 minutes = x/2 kilometers per minute. 
Solving for x, we get x = 2 * 17 / 51 = 2/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk. The distance walked on the sidewalk is <fact3>18 kilometers</fact3>, and her speed on the sidewalk is x = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 
So, the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk is 18 / (2/3) = 27 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>35-kilometer walk</fact1> is 51 + 27 = 78 minutes.

If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Tara's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach, and it takes her <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. So, her current speed on the beach is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 miles per minute. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her original speed on the beach was 2 * (1/6) = 1/3 miles per minute. 

Since Tara walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk was 3 * (1/3) = 1 mile per minute. After her speed <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her speed on the sidewalk is now 1/2 mile per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Tara to walk <fact3>19 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> at her current speed. Time = Distance / Speed = <fact3>19 miles</fact3> / (1/2 mile per minute) = 38 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Tara to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> (on the beach) + 38 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 104 minutes.

If <fact6>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>25-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Nadia's original speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2x miles per minute</fact4>. After the injury, her speed on the beach becomes x/2 miles per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk becomes x miles per minute. 

Since <fact6>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, and the distance on the beach is <fact2>13 miles</fact2>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows: 
x/2 = <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact6>65 minutes</fact6>
x = 26/65 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk. The distance on the sidewalk is <fact3>12 miles</fact3>, and her speed on the sidewalk is x = 26/65 miles per minute. 
Time on sidewalk = <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / (26/65 miles per minute) = 30 minutes.

The total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>25-mile walk</fact1> is the sum of the time on the beach and the time on the sidewalk:

If <fact6>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Tara's original speed on the beach. Since she walks <fact2>12 miles</fact2> in <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles per minute. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her original speed on the beach was 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 miles per minute. 

Since Tara walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk was 0.5 * 2 = 1 mile per minute. After her speed <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her speed on the sidewalk is now 1 / 2 = 0.5 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Tara to walk <fact3>17 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> at her current speed. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>17 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 34 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for Tara to complete her <fact1>29-mile walk</fact1> by adding the time she spends walking on the beach and the sidewalk. Total time = <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> + 34 minutes = 82 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Fatima walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Fatima's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Fatima's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach and that it now takes her <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> to do so. However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so it used to take her 55/2 = 27.5 minutes to walk <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach. Thus, her original speed on the beach was <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / 27.5 minutes = 0.4 miles per minute. 

Her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>three times her speed on the beach</fact4>, so her original speed on the sidewalk was 3 x 0.4 = 1.2 miles per minute. 

However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so her current speed on the beach is 0.4/2 = 0.2 miles per minute and her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.2/2 = 0.6 miles per minute. 

Thus, it will take her <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / 0.2 miles per minute = <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> to walk on the beach and <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 0.6 miles per minute = 25 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. 

Therefore, it will take her <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> + 25 minutes = 80 minutes to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>.

On the sidewalk, Keisha walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Keisha's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>22-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>3x miles per minute</fact4>. After the injury, her speed on the beach becomes <fact5>x/2 miles per minute</fact5> and her speed on the sidewalk becomes <fact5>3x/2 miles per minute</fact5>. 

Since <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows: 
<fact2>11 miles</fact2> / 66 minutes = <fact5>x/2 miles per minute</fact5>. 
Solving for x, we get x = 11/33 = 1/3 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk: 
<fact5>3x/2 miles per minute</fact5> = 3 * (1/3) / 2 = 1/2 miles per minute.

The time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk is: 
<fact3>11 miles</fact3> / (1/2 miles per minute) = 22 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>22-mile walk</fact1> is: 
66 minutes (on the beach) + 22 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 88 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Uma walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Uma's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Uma's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>16 miles</fact2> on the beach and that it now takes her <fact6>64 minutes</fact6> to do so. However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so it used to take her 64/2 = 32 minutes to walk <fact2>16 miles</fact2> on the beach. Thus, her original speed on the beach was <fact2>16 miles</fact2> / 32 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute. 

Her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>twice her speed on the beach</fact4>, so it is 2 * 0.5 = 1 mile per minute. 

However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so her current speed on the beach is 0.5/2 = 0.25 miles per minute and her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 = 0.5 miles per minute.

Thus, it will take her <fact2>16 miles</fact2> / 0.25 miles per minute = <fact6>64 minutes</fact6> to walk on the beach and <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 24 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

So, in total, it will take her <fact6>64 minutes</fact6> + 24 minutes = 88 minutes to complete her <fact1>28-mile walk</fact1>.

On the sidewalk, Tara walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Tara's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Tara's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach, and it takes her <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> to do so after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. Let's call her original speed on the beach ""x"" miles per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed is 0.5x miles per minute. We can set up the equation: <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / 0.5x = <fact6>50 minutes</fact6>. Solving for x, we get x = 0.4 miles per minute.

Since Tara walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 3 * 0.4 = 1.2 miles per minute. After her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.6 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Tara to walk <fact3>18 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>18 miles</fact3> / 0.6 miles per minute = 30 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Tara to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to get the total time: <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> + 30 minutes = 80 minutes.

What is the least amount Qasim can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the notebooks is <fact1>18</fact1> * ¥9.0 = ¥162. The cost of the crayons is <fact2>12</fact2> * ¥18.75 = ¥225. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>¥21</fact3>. The cost of the pencils is <fact4>8</fact4> * ¥9 = ¥72. So, the total cost without any discount is ¥162 + ¥225 + ¥21 + ¥72 = ¥480.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. The discount amount is ¥480 * 0.05 = ¥24. So, the total cost with the <fact6>5% discount</fact6> is ¥480 - ¥24 = ¥456.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the <fact5>20% discount</fact5> and the <fact5>one-time ¥20 fee</fact5>. The discount amount is ¥480 * 0.20 = ¥96. So, the total cost with the <fact5>20% discount</fact5> is ¥480 - ¥96 = ¥384. Adding the <fact5>one-time ¥20 fee</fact5>, the total cost is ¥384 + ¥20 = ¥404.

What is the least amount Yuki can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the crayons is <fact1>22 * ¥8.0 = ¥176</fact1>. The cost of the erasers is <fact2>14 * ¥17.0 = ¥238</fact2>. The cost of the bond paper is <fact3>¥13</fact3>. The cost of the markers is <fact4>3 * ¥11 = ¥33</fact4>. The total cost is ¥176 + ¥238 + ¥13 + ¥33 = ¥460.

If Yuki becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 20% of ¥460, which is ¥92. So, the total cost after the discount is ¥460 - ¥92 = ¥368. Adding the one-time membership fee of <fact5>¥20</fact5>, the total cost is ¥368 + ¥20 = ¥388.

If Yuki does not become a member, he will get a 5% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 5% of ¥460, which is ¥23. So, the total cost after the discount is ¥460 - ¥23 = ¥437.

What is the least amount Viktor can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the 20 folders is <fact1>20 * €7.0 = €140</fact1>. The cost of the 8 folders is <fact2>8 * €14.25 = €114</fact2>. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€16</fact3>. The cost of the 5 rulers is <fact4>5 * €10 = €50</fact4>. So, the total cost without any discount is €140 + €114 + €16 + €50 = €320.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €320, which is €320 * 0.05 = €16. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €320 - €16 = €304.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of €320, which is €320 * 0.20 = €64. However, Viktor needs to pay <fact5>a one-time €20 fee to become a member</fact5>. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €320 - €64 + €20 = €276.

The cost of the notebooks is <fact4>3</fact4> * ¥<fact4>11</fact4> = ¥33. So, the total cost without any discount is ¥104 + ¥144 + ¥19 + ¥33 = ¥300.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of ¥300, which is ¥60. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ¥300 - ¥60 = ¥240. However, Tariq needs to pay <fact5>a one-time ¥20 fee to become a member</fact5>, so the total cost with the 20% discount is ¥240 + ¥20 = ¥260.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of ¥300, which is ¥15. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ¥300 - ¥15 = ¥285.

Comparing the two options, the least amount Tariq can spend on everything is ¥260.

The answer is {260}.",260.0,1,1,p2,801,1548

He bought <fact1>18 pencils which cost ¥4.5 each</fact1>, <fact2>12 erasers which cost ¥12.0 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost ¥15</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>4 rulers which cost ¥10 each</fact4>. Wei can either pay <fact5>a one-time ¥20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Wei can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of pencils is <fact1>18</fact1> * ¥<fact1>4.5</fact1> = ¥81. The cost of erasers is <fact2>12</fact2> * ¥<fact2>12.0</fact2> = ¥144. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ¥<fact3>15</fact3>. The cost of rulers is <fact4>4</fact4> * ¥<fact4>10</fact4> = ¥40. So, the total cost without any discount is ¥81 + ¥144 + ¥15 + ¥40 = ¥280.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount as a member. The discount amount is 20% of ¥280, which is ¥56. So, the total cost as a member is ¥280 - ¥56 = ¥224. However, we need to add the one-time membership fee of ¥<fact5>20</fact5>, making the total cost ¥244.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount as a non-member. The discount amount is 5% of ¥280, which is ¥14. So, the total cost as a non-member is ¥280 - ¥14 = ¥266.

Comparing the two options, we can see that becoming a member and getting the 20% discount results in a lower total cost of ¥244.

What is the least amount Oscar can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the rulers is <fact1>8 rulers</fact1> * €11.0 = €88. The total cost of the notebooks is <fact2>8 notebooks</fact2> * €14.5 = €116. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€16</fact3>. The total cost of the folders is <fact4>4 folders</fact4> * €10 = €40. So, the total cost without any discount is €88 + €116 + €16 + €40 = €260.

Now, let's calculate the total cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €260, which is €13. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €260 - €13 = €247.

Next, let's calculate the total cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of €260, which is €52. However, Oscar needs to pay <fact5>a one-time €20 fee to become a member</fact5>. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €260 - €52 + €20 = €228.

Since €228 is less than €247, the least amount Oscar can spend on everything is €228.

What is the least amount James can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of erasers is <fact1>20 erasers</fact1> * ₣9.5 = ₣190. The total cost of folders is <fact2>4 folders</fact2> * ₣14.75 = ₣59. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>₣21</fact3>. The total cost of crayons is <fact4>7 crayons</fact4> * ₣10 = ₣70. So, the total cost without any discount is ₣190 + ₣59 + ₣21 + ₣70 = ₣340.

If James becomes a member, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, but he has to pay a <fact5>one-time ₣20 fee</fact5>. The total discount will be ₣340 * 0.2 = ₣68. So, the total cost with the membership discount is ₣340 - ₣68 + ₣20 = ₣292.

If James does not become a member, he will get a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be ₣340 * 0.05 = ₣17. So, the total cost with the non-membership discount is ₣340 - ₣17 = ₣323.

Therefore, the least amount James can spend on everything is ₣292.

What is the least amount Bodhi can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the folders is <fact1>18 * $9.5</fact1> = $171. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact2>8 * $15.75</fact2> = $126. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$23</fact3>. The cost of the erasers is <fact4>4 * $10</fact4> = $40. So, the total cost without any discount is $171 + $126 + $23 + $40 = $360.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of $360, which is $18. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is $360 - $18 = $342.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of $360, which is $72. However, Bodhi needs to pay a <fact5>one-time $20 fee to become a member</fact5>. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is $360 - $72 + $20 = $308.

Since $308 is less than $342, Bodhi should become a member and get the 20% discount. Therefore, the least amount Bodhi can spend on everything is $308.

What is the least amount Benjamin can spend on everything?

Answer: 
First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. 
<fact1>20 erasers</fact1> will cost <fact1>20 * $7.75</fact1> = $155. 
<fact2>12 folders</fact2> will cost <fact2>12 * $18.0</fact2> = $216. 
<fact3>A ream of bond paper</fact3> costs <fact3>$24</fact3>. 
<fact4>5 pencils</fact4> will cost <fact4>5 * $9</fact4> = $45. 
So, the total cost without any discount is $155 + $216 + $24 + $45 = $440.

Now, let's calculate the cost with <fact6>a 5% discount</fact6>. 
5% of $440 is 0.05 * $440 = $22. 
So, the cost with <fact6>a 5% discount</fact6> is $440 - $22 = $418.

Next, let's calculate the cost with <fact5>a 20% discount and a one-time $20 fee</fact5>. 
20% of $440 is 0.20 * $440 = $88. 
So, the cost with <fact5>a 20% discount</fact5> is $440 - $88 = $352. 
Adding <fact5>the one-time $20 fee</fact5>, the total cost is $352 + $20 = $372.

He bought <fact1>8 rulers which cost ₣4.0 each</fact1>, <fact2>12 folders which cost ₣13.25 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost ₣24</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>5 crayons which cost ₣9 each</fact4>. Arash can either pay a <fact5>one-time ₣20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive only a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Arash can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the rulers is <fact1>8 rulers</fact1> * ₣<fact1>4.0</fact1> = ₣32. The cost of the folders is <fact2>12 folders</fact2> * ₣<fact2>13.25</fact2> = ₣159. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ₣<fact3>24</fact3>. The cost of the crayons is <fact4>5 crayons</fact4> * ₣<fact4>9</fact4> = ₣45. So, the total cost without any discount is ₣32 + ₣159 + ₣24 + ₣45 = ₣260.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is ₣260 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = ₣13. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ₣260 - ₣13 = ₣247.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee. The discount amount is ₣260 * <fact5>20%</fact5> = ₣52. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ₣260 - ₣52 = ₣208. Adding the one-time membership fee of ₣<fact5>20</fact5>, the total cost becomes ₣208 + ₣20 = ₣228.

Comparing the two options, we can see that the least amount Arash can spend on everything is ₣228, which is the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee.

What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of pencils is <fact1>10 * ₣9.5</fact1> = ₣95. The cost of crayons is <fact2>10 * ₣13.5</fact2> = ₣135. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>₣14</fact3>. The cost of rulers is <fact4>4 * ₣9</fact4> = ₣36. So, the total cost without any discount is ₣95 + ₣135 + ₣14 + ₣36 = ₣280.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is <fact6>5%</fact6> of ₣280, which is ₣14. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ₣280 - ₣14 = ₣266.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of ₣280, which is ₣56. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ₣280 - ₣56 = ₣224. Adding the <fact5>one-time ₣20 fee</fact5>, the total cost becomes ₣224 + ₣20 = ₣244.

What is the least amount Carlos can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the <fact1>24 colored pencils</fact1> is <fact1>24</fact1> * <fact2>₣8.5</fact2> = ₣204. The cost of the <fact3>12 pencils</fact3> is <fact3>12</fact3> * <fact4>₣9.0</fact4> = ₣108. The cost of the <fact5>ream of bond paper</fact5> is <fact6>₣24</fact6>.

If Carlos becomes a member, he will get a <fact10>20% discount</fact10> on the total cost, which is ₣380 * 0.20 = ₣76. So, the total cost with the membership discount is ₣380 - ₣76 = ₣304.

If Carlos does not become a member, he will get a <fact11>5% discount</fact11> on the total cost, which is ₣380 * 0.05 = ₣19. So, the total cost without membership is ₣380 - ₣19 = ₣361.

Since ₣324 is less than ₣361, the least amount Carlos can spend on everything is ₣324.

What is the least amount Ravi can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Ravi bought without any discount. The total cost of pencils is <fact1>24</fact1> * $7 = $168. The total cost of notebooks is <fact2>14</fact2> * $17 = $238. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$22</fact3>. The total cost of folders is <fact4>8</fact4> * $9 = $72. So, the total cost without any discount is $168 + $238 + $22 + $72 = $500.

If Ravi becomes a member and pays the <fact5>one-time $20 fee</fact5>, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>. The total discount will be 20% of $500, which is 0.20 * $500 = $100. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $500 - $100 = $400. Adding the <fact5>one-time $20 fee</fact5>, the total cost will be $400 + $20 = $420.

If Ravi does not become a member, he will receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be 5% of $500, which is 0.05 * $500 = $25. So, the total cost with the non-membership discount is $500 - $25 = $475.

Since $420 is less than $475, the least amount Ravi can spend on everything is $420.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact1>16</fact1> * ₺<fact1>10.5</fact1> = ₺168. The cost of the pencils is <fact2>8</fact2> * ₺<fact2>18.0</fact2> = ₺144. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ₺<fact3>15</fact3>. The cost of the markers is <fact4>3</fact4> * ₺<fact4>11</fact4> = ₺33. So, the total cost without any discount is ₺168 + ₺144 + ₺15 + ₺33 = ₺360.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is ₺360 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = ₺360 * 0.05 = ₺18. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ₺360 - ₺18 = ₺342.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee. The discount amount is ₺360 * <fact5>20%</fact5> = ₺360 * 0.20 = ₺72. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ₺360 - ₺72 = ₺288. Adding the one-time membership fee of ₺<fact5>20</fact5>, the total cost becomes ₺288 + ₺20 = ₺308.

Comparing the two options, the least amount Hiroshi can spend on everything is ₺308.

He bought <fact1>16 markers which cost €4.75 each</fact1>, <fact2>14 colored pencils which cost €8.5 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost €15</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>3 pencils which cost €10 each</fact4>. Liam can either pay <fact5>a one-time €20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Liam can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the markers is <fact1>16 markers</fact1> * €<fact1>4.75</fact1> = €76. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact2>14 colored pencils</fact2> * €<fact2>8.5</fact2> = €119. The cost of the ream of bond paper is €<fact3>15</fact3>. The cost of the pencils is <fact4>3 pencils</fact4> * €<fact4>10</fact4> = €30. So, the total cost without any discount is €76 + €119 + €15 + €30 = €240.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €240, which is €240 * 0.05 = €12. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €240 - €12 = €228.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. First, we need to add the one-time membership fee of €<fact5>20</fact5> to the total cost. Then, we can calculate the discount amount, which is 20% of €240, or €240 * 0.20 = €48. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €240 - €48 + €20 = €212.

Since €212 is less than €228, Liam should become a member and get the 20% discount to spend the least amount of money.

He also bought <fact4>8 folders which cost ¥11 each</fact4>. Umar can either pay <fact5>a one-time ¥20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Umar can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Umar bought. The total cost of the folders is <fact1>22 folders</fact1> * ¥5.0 = ¥110 + <fact4>8 folders</fact4> * ¥11 = ¥88, for a total of ¥110 + ¥88 = ¥198. The total cost of the pencils is <fact2>14 pencils</fact2> * ¥16.5 = ¥231. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>¥11</fact3>. So, the total cost of all the items is ¥198 + ¥231 + ¥11 = ¥440.

If Umar becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time ¥20 fee</fact5>. So, the total amount he will spend as a member is ¥440 - (20% of ¥440) + ¥20. 20% of ¥440 is 0.2 * ¥440 = ¥88. So, the total amount Umar will spend as a member is ¥440 - ¥88 + ¥20 = ¥372.

If Umar does not become a member, he will receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. So, the total amount he will spend as a non-member is ¥440 - (5% of ¥440). 5% of ¥440 is 0.05 * ¥440 = ¥22. So, the total amount Umar will spend as a non-member is ¥440 - ¥22 = ¥418.

Since ¥372 is less than ¥418, Umar will spend the least amount of money if he becomes a member.

What is the least amount Hiroshi can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the notebooks is <fact1>24 notebooks</fact1> * $9.5 = $228. The cost of the pencils is <fact2>12 pencils</fact2> * $15 = $180. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$12</fact3>. The cost of the erasers is <fact4>8 erasers</fact4> * $10 = $80. So, the total cost without any discount is $228 + $180 + $12 + $80 = $500.

If Hiroshi becomes a member and gets a <fact5>20% discount</fact5>, he will pay a <fact5>one-time $20 fee</fact5> and the total cost will be 80% of $500, which is $400, plus the $20 fee, for a total of $420.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the markers is <fact1>8 markers</fact1> * $7.75 = $62. The total cost of the folders is <fact2>12 folders</fact2> * $13 = $156. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$14</fact3>. The total cost of the pencils is <fact4>8 pencils</fact4> * $11 = $88. So, the total cost without any discount is $62 + $156 + $14 + $88 = $320.

If Sanjay becomes a member, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, but he will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time $20 fee</fact5>. The total discount will be 20% of $320, which is 0.2 * $320 = $64. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $320 - $64 + $20 = $276.

If Sanjay does not become a member, he will get <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be 5% of $320, which is 0.05 * $320 = $16. So, the total cost without the membership discount is $320 - $16 = $304.

Since $276 is less than $304, the least amount Sanjay can spend on everything is $276.

Answer: On Saturday, Xavier picks <fact3>double the number of watermelons he did on Thursday</fact3>, which is 2 * <fact1>111</fact1> = 222 watermelons. 
So in the first 3 days, he picked <fact1>111</fact1> + <fact2>131</fact2> + 222 = 464 watermelons. 
On Sunday, he picks <fact4>half the amount of what he picked in the past 3 days combined</fact4>, which is 464 / 2 = 232 watermelons. 
So in total, he picked <fact1>111</fact1> + <fact2>131</fact2> + 222 + 232 = 696 watermelons. 
He can make 696 / <fact5>24</fact5> = 29 boxes of watermelons.

On <fact2>Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 4-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV James watched on Tuesday and Wednesday. Since <fact1>he watched 4-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he watched a total of 4 + 4 = 8 hours.

On <fact4>Saturday, he watched four 4-hour episodes</fact4>, which is a total of 4 x 4 = 16 hours.

On <fact5>Sunday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>, which is a total of 3 x 45/60 = 2.25 hours.

On <fact3>Friday, he watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>, which is a total of 4 + 15/60 = 4.25 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours we've calculated so far: 8 + 16 + 2.25 + 4.25 = 30.5 hours.

Since <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, we subtract the hours we've calculated from the total: 31 - 30.5 = 0.5 hours.

We know that <fact2>Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2>, and we need to find out how many episodes he watched. Since 0.5 hours is equal to 30 minutes, and each episode is 15 minutes, we can divide 30 minutes by 15 minutes to get the number of episodes: 30/15 = 2.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Alejandro watched on the days other than Wednesday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 * 4 = 8 hours of TV (<fact1>4 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Thursday, he watched 4 hours and 15 minutes, which is 4.25 hours (<fact3>4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>). On Friday, he watched 4 * 3 = 12 hours (<fact4>four 3-hour episodes</fact4>).

Since <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 31 - 26.5 = 4.5 hours of TV on Wednesday.

If <fact6>he watched 25 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Sunday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Kai watched on the days other than Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, he watched <fact1>5 hours * 2 nights = 10 hours</fact1>. On Monday, he watched <fact3>2 hours + 45 minutes = 2.75 hours</fact3>. On Tuesday, he watched <fact4>4 hours * 2 = 8 hours</fact4>. On Wednesday, he watched <fact5>15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours</fact5>. So, the total hours of TV he watched on the days other than Sunday is 10 + 2.75 + 8 + 0.5 = 21.25 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 25 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 25 - 21.25 = 3.75 hours of TV on Sunday. Since each episode on Sunday is 45 minutes, which is 0.75 hours, he must have watched 3.75 / 0.75 = 5 episodes on Sunday.

If <fact6>he watched 30 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Friday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Faisal watched on the days other than Friday. On Wednesday and Thursday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact1>3 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Saturday, he watched 2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours of TV (<fact3>2-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>). On Sunday, he watched 3 * 4 = 12 hours of TV (<fact4>three 4-hour episodes</fact4>). On Monday, he watched 5 * 0.5 = 2.5 hours of TV (<fact5>five 30-minute episodes</fact5>). So, the total hours of TV watched on days other than Friday is 6 + 2.5 + 12 + 2.5 = 23 hours. Since <fact6>Faisal watched a total of 30 hours of TV</fact6>, he must have watched 30 - 23 = 7 hours of TV on Friday. Since each episode on Friday was 60 minutes or 1 hour, Faisal watched 7 hours / 1 hour per episode = 7 episodes on Friday.

On <fact2>Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Thursday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 21 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total time Ibrahim spent watching TV on Saturday and Sunday. Since <fact1>he watched 5-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he spent a total of 2 * 5 = 10 hours watching TV on these two days.

On <fact3>Tuesday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>, which is equivalent to 2 hours + 0.25 hours = 2.25 hours.

On <fact4>Wednesday, he watched two 2-hour episodes</fact4>, which is equivalent to 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

On <fact5>Thursday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to 3 * 0.75 = 2.25 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on these days: 10 hours (Saturday and Sunday) + 2.25 hours (Tuesday) + 4 hours (Wednesday) + 2.25 hours (Thursday) = 18.5 hours.

Since <fact6>he watched 21 hours of TV in all</fact6>, the time spent watching TV on Monday is 21 - 18.5 = 2.5 hours.

Finally, since <fact2>Monday's episodes were 30 minutes each</fact2>, we can calculate the number of episodes by dividing the total time by the episode length: 2.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 5 episodes.

If <fact6>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours Umar watched on Saturday and Sunday. Since <fact1>he watched 5-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he watched a total of 5 + 5 = 10 hours. 

On <fact3>Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>, which is equivalent to 3 + 0.5 = 3.5 hours. 

On <fact4>Wednesday, he watched two 3-hour episodes</fact4>, which is equivalent to 2 x 3 = 6 hours. 

On <fact5>Thursday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to 3 x 0.75 = 2.25 hours. 

So far, Umar has watched 10 + 3.5 + 6 + 2.25 = 21.75 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 23 - 21.75 = 1.25 hours on Monday. 

Since each episode on Monday is 15 minutes, we can convert 1.25 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 1.25 x 60 = 75 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 75 / 15 = 5 episodes.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Alejandro watched on the days other than Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, he watched a total of <fact1>2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours</fact1>. On Monday, he watched a total of <fact3>4 hours + 15 minutes = 4.25 hours</fact3>. On Tuesday, he watched a total of <fact4>5 episodes * 2 hours/episode = 10 hours</fact4>. On Wednesday, he watched a total of <fact5>5 episodes * 30 minutes/episode = 2.5 hours</fact5>. So, the total hours of TV he watched on the days other than Sunday is 8 + 4.25 + 10 + 2.5 = 24.75 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 27 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 27 - 24.75 = 2.25 hours of TV on Sunday. Since each episode on Sunday is 45 minutes, we can convert 2.25 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 2.25 * 60 = 135 minutes. Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 135 / 45 = 3 episodes.

On <fact4>Tuesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Wednesday, he watched four episodes, each 30 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 19 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Sunday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Diego watched on the days other than Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, he watched <fact1>4 hours * 2 nights = 8 hours</fact1>. On Monday, he watched <fact3>2 hours + 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours</fact3>. On Tuesday, he watched <fact4>2 hours * 2 = 4 hours</fact4>. On Wednesday, he watched <fact5>4 episodes * 0.5 hours = 2 hours</fact5>. So, the total hours of TV he watched on the days other than Sunday is 8 + 2.5 + 4 + 2 = 16.5 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 19 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 19 - 16.5 = 2.5 hours of TV on Sunday. Since each episode is 30 minutes or 0.5 hours, he must have watched 2.5 / 0.5 = 5 episodes on Sunday.

If <fact6>he watched 29 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total hours of TV Sanjay watched on the days other than Wednesday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact1>3 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Thursday, he watched 5 hours + 30 minutes = 5.5 hours of TV (<fact3>5 hours for one episode and 30 minutes for another</fact3>). On Friday, he watched 5 * 2 = 10 hours of TV (<fact4>5 episodes, each 2 hours long</fact4>). On Saturday, he watched 2 * 45 minutes = 1.5 hours of TV (<fact5>2 episodes, each 45 minutes long</fact5>). So, the total hours of TV watched on days other than Wednesday is 6 + 5.5 + 10 + 1.5 = 23 hours. Since <fact6>Sanjay watched a total of 29 hours of TV</fact6>, he must have watched 29 - 23 = 6 hours of TV on Wednesday. Since each episode on Wednesday was 60 minutes long (<fact2>60-minute show</fact2>), Sanjay watched 6 hours / 1 hour per episode = 6 episodes on Wednesday.

Answer: Viktor watched <fact1>3 hours</fact1> * 2 nights = 6 hours on Monday and Tuesday.
He watched <fact3>2 hours + 0.5 hours</fact3> = 2.5 hours on Thursday.
He watched <fact4>5 episodes</fact4> * 3 hours per episode = 15 hours on Friday.

If <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Monday and Tuesday. Since <fact1>he watched 6-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he watched a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

On <fact3>Thursday, he watched a 6-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>, which is equivalent to 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 hours.

On <fact4>Friday, he watched four 2-hour episodes</fact4>, which is equivalent to 4 x 2 = 8 hours.

On <fact5>Saturday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours watched on these days: 12 + 6.5 + 8 + 0.75 = 27.25 hours.

Since <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, the hours watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total hours watched on other days from the total hours: 31 - 27.25 = 3.75 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 45 minutes, we can convert the hours watched on Wednesday to minutes: 3.75 x 60 = 225 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode: 225 / 45 = 5 episodes.

Later, when she went to set the table, <fact6>she had a total of 48 plates</fact6>. How many plates were in the package that Zahra bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of plates in the package that Zahra bought as x. 
<fact2>Her husband bought 13 plates</fact2>, so the total number of plates they bought is x + 13. 
<fact3>Zahra used 17 plates</fact3> and <fact4>threw away 11 plates</fact4>, so the total number of plates left is x + 13 - 17 - 11 = x - 15. 
<fact5>The guests brought 3 packs of plates, each having 11 plates</fact5>, so they brought a total of 3 * 11 = 33 plates. 
The total number of plates now is x - 15 + 33 = x + 18.

Now, the total number of forks is x + 4 + 36 = x + 40. 
We know that <fact6>the total number of forks is 62</fact6>, so we can set up the equation x + 40 = 62.

How many spoons were in the package that Mei bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Mei bought as x. Mei started with x spoons, then her husband gave her <fact2>6 more spoons</fact2>, so she had x + 6 spoons. After <fact3>using 8 spoons</fact3> to sample the roast chicken, she had x + 6 - 8 = x - 2 spoons. Then, she <fact4>threw away 9 defective spoons</fact4>, leaving her with x - 2 - 9 = x - 11 spoons. The guests <fact5>brought 4 packs of 9 spoons each</fact5>, which is 4 * 9 = 36 spoons. So, the total number of spoons Mei had was x - 11 + 36 = x + 25. Since she had a total of <fact6>53 spoons</fact6>, we can set up the equation x + 25 = 53. Solving for x, we get x = 53 - 25 = 28. Therefore, the package Mei bought had 28 spoons.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Priya pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren. Each child needs <fact2>6 skeins for a hat</fact2> + <fact3>6 skeins for a cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a shawl</fact4> + <fact5>11 skeins for gloves</fact5> + <fact6>9 skeins for booties</fact6> = 44 skeins. Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins needed for them is 44 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 176 skeins.

For Priya's jackets, she needs <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>8 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 16 skeins.

In total, Priya needs 176 + 16 = 192 skeins. Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $9</fact9>, we need to convert the total number of skeins to dozens. 192 skeins is equal to 192 / 12 = 16 dozen skeins.

The total cost is 16 * <fact9>$9</fact9> = $144. Since the total cost is over $100, Priya receives a <fact10>$20 discount</fact10>. Therefore, the final amount Priya should pay is $144 - <fact10>$20</fact10> = $124.

Answer: Nia needs to make a shawl, vest, hat, gloves, and leg warmers for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>. So, she needs <fact2>3 skeins of wool</fact2> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 12 skeins of wool for shawls, <fact3>6 skeins of wool</fact3> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 24 skeins of wool for vests, <fact4>8 skeins of wool</fact4> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 32 skeins of wool for hats, <fact5>12 skeins of wool</fact5> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 48 skeins of wool for gloves, and <fact6>13 skeins of wool</fact6> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 52 skeins of wool for leg warmers.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact9>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact9>. How much should Beatriz pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we must first calculate the number of skeins needed for the grandchildren and then add the number needed for Beatriz's jackets. 
For each of the <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, Beatriz needs <fact2>5 skeins for a cardigan</fact2> + <fact3>5 skeins for a hat</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a shawl</fact4> + <fact5>12 skeins for a pair of mittens</fact5> + <fact6>10 skeins for a pair of gloves</fact6> = 44 skeins. 
So, for all <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, Beatriz needs 5 x 44 = 220 skeins of wool. 
For her two jackets, Beatriz needs 2 x <fact7>10 skeins</fact7> = 20 skeins of wool. 
Therefore, Beatriz needs a total of 220 + 20 = 240 skeins of wool. 
Since <fact8>each dozen skeins costs $6</fact8>, we divide 240 by 12 to get 20 dozen skeins. 
The total cost is 20 x <fact8>$6</fact8> = $120. 
Since the total cost is over $100, Beatriz receives a <fact9>$20 discount</fact9>. 
So, the final cost is $120 - <fact9>$20</fact9> = $100.

For Elena's jackets, she needs <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>9 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 18 skeins.

In total, Elena needs 138 + 18 = 156 skeins. Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $8</fact9>, the total cost is 156 / 12 * 8 = $104.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's clothing. 
<fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> * (<fact2>4 skeins for a tunic</fact2> + <fact3>6 skeins for a cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>10 skeins for a shawl</fact4> + <fact5>10 skeins for booties</fact5> + <fact6>14 skeins for mittens</fact6>) = 3 * (4 + 6 + 10 + 10 + 14) = 3 * 44 = 132 skeins.
Then, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for Sakura's jackets. 
<fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>6 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 12 skeins.
So, the total number of skeins needed is 132 + 12 = 144 skeins.
Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $9</fact9>, the total cost is 144 / 12 * 9 = 108 dollars.
Since the total cost is over $100, Sakura will receive a <fact10>$20 discount</fact10>. Therefore, the final amount she needs to pay is 108 - 20 = 88 dollars.

Answer: Chen needs to make a set of clothes for each of her <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>. Each set requires <fact2>6 skeins for a cardigan</fact2> + <fact3>4 skeins for a hat</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a vest</fact4> + <fact5>12 skeins for booties</fact5> + <fact6>14 skeins for gloves</fact6> = 48 skeins of wool.

Answer: To determine how much Yara should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs (<fact2>3 skeins for a sweater</fact2> + <fact3>5 skeins for a tunic</fact3> + <fact4>9 skeins for a shawl</fact4> + <fact5>12 skeins for leg warmers</fact5> + <fact6>15 skeins for gloves</fact6>) * <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> = (3 + 5 + 9 + 12 + 15) * 5 = 44 * 5 = 220 skeins. For <fact7>two warm jackets for herself</fact7>, she needs <fact7>2</fact7> * <fact8>4 skeins</fact8> = 8 skeins. In total, she needs 220 + 8 = 228 skeins. Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $6</fact9>, the total cost before the discount is (228 / 12) * 6 = 19 * 6 = $114.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact9>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact9>. How much should Winnie pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren. 
<fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1> * (<fact2>5 skeins for a beanie</fact2> + <fact3>6 skeins for a shawl</fact3> + <fact4>8 skeins for a poncho</fact4> + <fact5>10 skeins for mittens</fact5> + <fact6>11 skeins for leg warmers</fact6>) = 4 * (5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 11) = 4 * 40 = 160 skeins.
Then, calculate the number of skeins needed for Winnie's jackets. 
2 jackets * <fact7>4 skeins per jacket</fact7> = 8 skeins.
So, the total number of skeins needed is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins.
Now, calculate the total cost before the discount. 
168 skeins / 12 skeins per dozen * <fact8>$9 per dozen</fact8> = 14 * $9 = $126.
Since the total cost is over $100, Winnie gets a <fact9>$20 discount</fact9>.

Answer: To calculate the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the number of skeins needed for each item and multiply it by the number of grandchildren. 
The number of skeins needed for tunics is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact2>3</fact2> = 12 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for shawls is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact3>6</fact3> = 24 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for hats is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact4>12</fact4> = 48 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for booties is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact5>12</fact5> = 48 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for gloves is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact6>15</fact6> = 60 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for Uma's jackets is <fact7>2</fact7> * <fact8>12</fact8> = 24 skeins.

Answer: To determine how much Camila should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs to make 4 sets of winter wear. Each set requires <fact2>4 skeins for a vest</fact2> + <fact3>6 skeins for a shawl</fact3> + <fact4>8 skeins for a cardigan</fact4> + <fact5>11 skeins for gloves</fact5> + <fact6>9 skeins for booties</fact6> = 38 skeins.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren's clothing. 
<fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> * (<fact2>6 skeins for a vest</fact2> + <fact3>3 skeins for a cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a tunic</fact4> + <fact5>10 skeins for leg warmers</fact5> + <fact6>11 skeins for socks</fact6>) = 5 * (6 + 3 + 12 + 10 + 11) = 5 * 42 = 210 skeins.
Then, we add the skeins needed for Rania's jackets: <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>9 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 18 skeins.
So, the total number of skeins needed is 210 + 18 = 228 skeins.

For <fact7>two warm jackets for herself</fact7>, she needs <fact7>2</fact7> * <fact8>12 skeins of wool</fact8> = 24 skeins. In total, she needs 180 + 24 = 204 skeins. Since <fact9>each dozen skeins of wool costs $8</fact9>, the total cost before the discount is (204 / 12) * <fact9>$8</fact9> = 17 * $8 = $136. Since the total cost is over $100, Jasmine receives a <fact10>$20 discount</fact10>, making the final cost $136 - $20 = $116.

How many more oz of cookies does Bodhi need to consume than Nia?

Answer: Bodhi's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>230 pounds</fact4> = 3450 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> - <fact6>50 calories</fact6> = 1050 calories. So he can consume 3450 - 1050 = 2400 more calories. Nia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>130 pounds</fact7> = 1950 calories. She has already consumed <fact8>1000 calories</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories</fact9> = 1150 calories. So she can consume 1950 - 1150 = 800 more calories. Bodhi can consume 2400 / <fact1>200 calories per serving</fact1> = 12 more servings of cookies, while Nia can consume 800 / <fact1>200 calories per serving</fact1> = 4 more servings of cookies. Since <fact2>a 400 oz bag has 5 servings</fact2>, each serving is 400 / 5 = 80 oz. So Bodhi can consume 12 * 80 = 960 more oz of cookies, while Nia can consume 4 * 80 = 320 more oz of cookies. Therefore, Bodhi can consume 960 - 320 = 640 more oz of cookies than Nia.

How many more grams of popcorn does Thiago need to consume than Roya?

Answer: Thiago's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>210 lbs</fact4> = 3150 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1250 calories</fact5> - <fact6>50 calories</fact6> = 1200 calories. So he can consume 3150 - 1200 = 1950 calories more. Since <fact1>each serving of popcorn has 325 calories</fact1>, Thiago can consume 1950 / 325 = 6 servings of popcorn. Since <fact2>a 325 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Thiago can consume 6 / 5 * 325 = 390 grams of popcorn.

Roya's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories. She has already consumed <fact8>800 in food</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 975 calories. So she can consume 1950 - 975 = 975 calories more.

How many more ounces of breads does James need to consume than Mia?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for James and Mia. James' daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>240 lbs</fact4> = 3600 calories. Mia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>170 lbs</fact7> = 2550 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories James and Mia have already consumed. James has consumed <fact5>950 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 800 calories. Mia has consumed <fact8>800 calories</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories</fact9> = 950 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories James and Mia can consume. James can consume 3600 - 800 = 2800 calories. Mia can consume 2550 - 950 = 1600 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 200 calories per serving</fact1>, James can consume 2800 / 200 = 14 servings. Mia can consume 1600 / 200 = 8 servings.

Since <fact2>a 175 ounces bag has 7 servings</fact2>, James needs 14 / 7 * 175 = 350 ounces of bread. Mia needs 8 / 7 * 175 = 200 ounces of bread.

Therefore, James needs to consume 350 - 200 = 150 ounces more of bread than Mia.

How many more oz of cookies does Noah need to consume than Camila?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Noah and Camila. For Noah, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>240 lbs</fact4> = 3600 calories. For Camila, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>150 lbs</fact7> = 2250 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Noah and Camila have already consumed. Noah has consumed <fact5>1200 calories</fact5> - <fact6>100 calories through exercise</fact6> = 1100 calories. Camila has consumed <fact8>800 in food</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1000 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Noah and Camila can consume. For Noah, it's 3600 - 1100 = 2500 calories. For Camila, it's 2250 - 1000 = 1250 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of cookies has 250 calories per serving</fact1>, Noah can consume 2500 / 250 = 10 servings, and Camila can consume 1250 / 250 = 5 servings.

Finally, since <fact2>a 200 oz bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Noah can consume 10 * 200 / 5 = 400 oz, and Camila can consume 5 * 200 / 5 = 200 oz. Therefore, Noah needs to consume 400 - 200 = 200 oz more than Camila.

How many more ounces of breads does Wei need to consume than Keisha?

Answer: Wei's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>250 pounds</fact4> = 3750 calories. He has already <fact5>consumed 1000 calories</fact5> and <fact6>burned 50 calories through exercise</fact6>, so he needs 3750 - 1000 + 50 = 2800 more calories. Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 400 calories per serving</fact1>, he needs 2800 / 400 = 7 servings of bread. Since <fact2>a 400 ounces bag has 5 servings</fact2>, he needs 7 / 5 * 400 = 560 ounces of bread.

Keisha's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>140 pounds</fact7> = 2100 calories.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Carlos and Olga. For Carlos, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>230 pounds</fact4> = 3450 calories. For Olga, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>170 pounds</fact7> = 2550 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Carlos and Olga have already consumed. Carlos has consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> - <fact6>100 calories</fact6> = 1000 calories. Olga has consumed <fact8>800 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 975 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Carlos and Olga need to consume to reach their daily targets. Carlos needs 3450 - 1000 = 2450 calories. Olga needs 2550 - 975 = 1575 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 175 calories per serving</fact1>, Carlos needs 2450 / 175 = 14 servings and Olga needs 1575 / 175 = 9 servings.

Finally, since <fact2>a 350 ounces bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Carlos needs 14 / 5 * 350 = 980 ounces and Olga needs 9 / 5 * 350 = 630 ounces. Therefore, Carlos needs to consume 980 - 630 = 350 ounces more than Olga.

Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of swimmers in the class. Since <fact2>50% of the class are swimmers</fact2>, the number of swimmers is <fact1>84</fact1> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 42.
However, <fact5>half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the number of swimmers leaving early is 42 * <fact5>0.5</fact5> = 21.
The <fact3>remaining class</fact3> has <fact1>84</fact1> - 42 = 42 students. Since <fact4>50% of the students are debate team members or part of choir members</fact4>, the number of debate team members and choir members is 42 * <fact4>0.5</fact4> = 21.
So, the total number of students leaving early is 21 (swimmers) + 21 (debate team members and choir members) = 42.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>45% of the class are soccer players</fact2> and there are <fact1>80 students in the class</fact1>, we can calculate the number of soccer players as 0.45 * <fact1>80</fact1> = 36. However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so only 36 / 2 = 18 soccer players will be leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>80 students in the class</fact1> and 36 are soccer players, the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> has <fact1>80</fact1> - 36 = 44 students. Then, we can calculate the number of choir members and dancers as 0.25 * 44 = 11.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are swimmers. Since <fact2>30% of the class are swimmers</fact2>, we can calculate the number of swimmers as <fact1>100 students</fact1> * <fact2>0.3</fact2> = 30 swimmers. However, <fact5>half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the actual number of swimmers leaving early is 30 / 2 = 15 swimmers.

Next, we need to find out how many students are dancers or part of debate team members. Since <fact4>20% of the students are dancers or part of debate team members</fact4> out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, we first need to find out how many students are in the remaining class.

How many hamburgers does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The grandfather and his partner eat a combined total of <fact1>20 hamburgers per day</fact1> + <fact2>20 hamburgers per day</fact2> = 40 hamburgers per day. Their son eats <fact3>three-sixths of the combined number of hamburgers they eat per day</fact3>, which is 3/6 * 40 = 20 hamburgers per day. So, the family eats 40 + 20 = 60 hamburgers per day. In one month, they eat 60 hamburgers per day * 30 days per month = 1800 hamburgers. In the second month, they reduce their food consumption by <fact4>25% for the first half of the month</fact4>, which means they eat 75% of their original amount, or 0.75 * 60 = 45 hamburgers per day for the first 15 days.

How many sushi rolls does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The uncle eats <fact1>10 sushi rolls per day</fact1> and his spouse eats <fact2>5 sushi rolls per day</fact2>, so together they eat <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 15 sushi rolls per day. Their grandchild eats <fact3>one-third of the combined number of sushi rolls they eat per day</fact3>, which is 15 / 3 = 5 sushi rolls per day. So, the family eats 15 + 5 = 20 sushi rolls per day. In <fact4>one month</fact4>, which is 30 days, the family eats 20 * 30 = 600 sushi rolls. 

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>20% for the first half of the month</fact5>, which means they eat 80% of their original amount. 80% of 20 sushi rolls is 0.8 * 20 = 16 sushi rolls per day. For the first half of the month, which is 15 days, the family eats 16 * 15 = 240 sushi rolls. 

Then, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact6>25% for the second half</fact6>, which means they eat 75% of the amount they ate in the first half of the month. 75% of 16 sushi rolls is 0.75 * 16 = 12 sushi rolls per day. For the second half of the month, which is also 15 days, the family eats 12 * 15 = 180 sushi rolls. 

In total, the family eats 600 + 240 + 180 = 1020 sushi rolls in two months.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, <fact4>reducing their food consumption by 50% for the first half of the month</fact4>, and then by <fact5>an additional 50% for the second half</fact5>. How many burritos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of burritos the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>4 burritos per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>8 burritos per day</fact2>, so together they eat 4 + 8 = 12 burritos per day. The daughter eats <fact3>two-thirds of the combined number of burritos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 2/3 * 12 = 8 burritos per day. So, the total number of burritos the family eats per day is 12 + 8 = 20 burritos per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, the family eats 20 * 30 = 600 burritos in the first month.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact4>50% for the first half of the month</fact4>, which means they eat 50% of 20 burritos per day, or 10 burritos per day, for 15 days. This is a total of 10 * 15 = 150 burritos.

For the second half of the month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>an additional 50%</fact5>, which means they eat 50% of 10 burritos per day, or 5 burritos per day, for 15 days. This is a total of 5 * 15 = 75 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos the family eats in the second month is 150 + 75 = 225 burritos.

Therefore, the total number of burritos the family eats in two months is 600 + 225 = 825 burritos.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>20 pizzas per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>5 pizzas per day</fact2>, so together they eat 20 + 5 = 25 pizzas per day.

So, the total number of pizzas the family eats per day is 25 + 15 = 40 pizzas.

In the first month, the family eats 40 pizzas per day for 30 days, so they eat a total of 40 * 30 = 1200 pizzas.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact4>20% for the first half of the month</fact4>, which means they eat 80% of their original amount. 80% of 40 pizzas is 0.8 * 40 = 32 pizzas per day. For the first half of the month (15 days), they eat 32 * 15 = 480 pizzas.

For the second half of the month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>an additional 25%</fact5>, which means they eat 75% of their previous amount. 75% of 32 pizzas is 0.75 * 32 = 24 pizzas per day. For the second half of the month (15 days), they eat 24 * 15 = 360 pizzas.

In total, the family eats 1200 + 480 + 360 = 2040 pizzas in two months.

The grandchild eats <fact3>two-fourths</fact3> of this amount, which is 2/4 * 30 = 15 burritos per day. So, the family eats a total of 30 + 15 = 45 burritos per day. In <fact4>one month</fact4>, which is 30 days, the family eats 45 * 30 = 1350 burritos. 

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>20% for the first half of the month</fact5>. This means they eat 80% of their usual amount, which is 0.8 * 45 = 36 burritos per day. For the first half of the month, which is 15 days, the family eats 36 * 15 = 540 burritos. 

For the second half of the month, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50%</fact6>. This means they eat 50% of the amount they ate in the first half of the month, which is 0.5 * 36 = 18 burritos per day. For the second half of the month, which is 15 days, the family eats 18 * 15 = 270 burritos. 

In total, the family eats 1350 + 540 + 270 = 2160 burritos in two months.

How many pizzas does this family eat in <fact8>two months</fact8>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>20 pizzas per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>10 pizzas per day</fact2>, so together they eat 20 + 10 = 30 pizzas per day. The daughter eats <fact3>two-sixths of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day</fact3>, which is 2/6 * 30 = 10 pizzas per day. So, the total number of pizzas the family eats per day is 30 + 10 = 40 pizzas.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are 30 days, so the family eats 40 * 30 = 1200 pizzas in the first month.

In the <fact5>second month</fact5>, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact6>20% for the first half of the month</fact6>. Since there are 30 days in a month, the first half of the month is 15 days. The family eats 40 * 0.8 * 15 = 480 pizzas in the first half of the month.

In the second half of the month, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional <fact7>50% for the second half</fact7>. So, they eat 40 * 0.8 * 0.5 * 15 = 240 pizzas in the second half of the month.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of tacos the family eats per day. The grandfather eats <fact1>20 tacos per day</fact1> and his partner eats <fact2>10 tacos per day</fact2>, so together they eat 20 + 10 = 30 tacos per day. The son eats <fact3>one-sixth of the combined number of tacos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 1/6 * 30 = 5 tacos per day. So, the total number of tacos the family eats per day is 30 + 5 = 35 tacos.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are 30 days, so the family eats 35 * 30 = 1050 tacos in the first month.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>60%</fact5> for the first half of the month, which means they eat 35 * 0.4 = 14 tacos per day for 15 days. This is a total of 14 * 15 = 210 tacos.

How many tacos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The grandfather and his partner eat a combined total of <fact1>15</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2> = 30 tacos per day. The son eats <fact3>one-half of the combined number of tacos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 30 / 2 = 15 tacos per day. So, the family eats 30 + 15 = 45 tacos per day. In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are approximately 30 days. So, in the first month, the family eats 45 tacos per day * 30 days = 1350 tacos. 

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>60%</fact5> for the first half of the month. This means they eat 45 tacos per day * (1 - 0.6) = 18 tacos per day for the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50%</fact6>. This means they eat 18 tacos per day * (1 - 0.5) = 9 tacos per day for the second half of the month. 

Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, the family eats 18 tacos per day * 15 days = 270 tacos in the first half of the month, and 9 tacos per day * 15 days = 135 tacos in the second half of the month. So, in the second month, the family eats 270 + 135 = 405 tacos. 

In total, the family eats 1350 tacos in the first month + 405 tacos in the second month = 1755 tacos in two months.

Ravi work overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>75% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of emails that require a response. Since <fact2>12% of the emails don't require a response</fact2>, the number of emails that require a response is <fact1>25</fact1> - (<fact2>12%</fact2> * <fact1>25</fact1>) = 25 - 3 = 22 emails per day.

For the first 2 days of the <fact4>3 day work week</fact4>, Viktor responds to 10 * 2 = 20 emails. On the last day, Viktor works overtime and can respond to <fact5>20% more emails than usual</fact5>, which is 10 * 1.2 = 12 emails. So, in total, Viktor responds to 20 + 12 = 32 emails.

Since <fact2>25% of the emails don't require any response</fact2>, Jamal is left with <fact1>32</fact1> * (1 - <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = 24 emails that require a response. Then, Jamal can respond to <fact3>1/2 of the remaining emails minus 2</fact3>, which is (24 / 2) - 2 = 10 emails per day.

In a <fact4>6 day work week</fact4>, Jamal can respond to 10 * 5 = 50 emails in the first 5 days. On the last day, he can respond to 10 * (1 + <fact5>0.20</fact5>) = 12 emails. Therefore, in total, Jamal can respond to 50 + 12 = 62 emails in a 6 day work week.

Now, we need to find the number of unoccupied rooms initially. This is <fact1>1200</fact1> - 300 (occupied) - 240 (out of service) = 660 rooms.

Since <fact4>20 patients are admitted each day</fact4>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact5>3 weeks</fact5> is <fact4>20</fact4> * 7 (days per week) * <fact5>3</fact5> = 420 patients.

Assuming each patient occupies one room, the number of unoccupied rooms after <fact5>3 weeks</fact5> is 660 - 420 = 240 rooms.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of rooms that are out of service. Since <fact3>one-ninth of all the rooms are out of service</fact3>, we can calculate this as <fact1>1800</fact1> / 9 = 200 rooms.

Next, we need to find the number of occupied rooms. Since <fact2>1/2 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate this as <fact1>1800</fact1> / 2 = 900 rooms.

Now, we can find the initial number of unoccupied rooms by subtracting the number of occupied rooms and out of service rooms from the total capacity: <fact1>1800</fact1> - 900 - 200 = 700 rooms.

Since <fact4>35 patients are admitted into the clinic each day</fact4>, and there are <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> (14 days), the total number of new patients is 35 * 14 = 490.

Assuming each patient occupies one room, we can subtract the number of new patients from the initial number of unoccupied rooms to find the final number of unoccupied rooms: 700 - 490 = 210.

Answer: First, we need to find Elena's current age.

Answer: First, we need to find Xena's current age. Since Xena will be <fact3>3 times as old as Yuki is now</fact3> in <fact2>6 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation: Xena's age in 6 years = 3 * <fact1>Yuki's current age</fact1>.

Now, we know Xena's current age is 21. We can find Gabriel's current age using the fact that <fact4>he is 8 years younger than Yuki</fact4>. So, Gabriel's age = <fact1>Yuki's age</fact1> - 8 = <fact1>9</fact1> - 8 = 1.

Next, we can find Fatima's current age using the fact that <fact5>she is 8 years older than Gabriel</fact5>. So, Fatima's age = Gabriel's age + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9.

Now, we have the current ages of all four: Yuki is <fact1>9</fact1>, Xena is 21, Gabriel is 1, and Fatima is 9. To find their average age in <fact6>3 years</fact6>, we need to add 3 to each of their current ages and then find the average.

Answer: 
First, we need to find Winnie's age. Since Winnie will be <fact3>2 times as old as Kai is now</fact3> in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, we can set up the equation: Winnie's age in 4 years = 2 * <fact1>22</fact1>. So, Winnie's age in 4 years is 2 * 22 = 44. Since this is in 4 years, we subtract 4 to find Winnie's current age: 44 - 4 = 40.

Next, we find Theo's age. Since Theo is <fact4>12 years younger than Kai</fact4>, Theo's age is <fact1>22</fact1> - 12 = 10.

Then, we find Roya's age. Since Roya is <fact5>10 years older than Theo</fact5>, Roya's age is 10 + 10 = 20.

Since Mia will be <fact3>4 times as old as Noah is now</fact3> in <fact2>3 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation to represent this: Mia's age in 3 years = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>Noah's current age</fact1>. Let's call Mia's current age ""x"". Then, Mia's age in 3 years is x + 3. We know that x + 3 = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>24</fact1>, so x + 3 = 96. Solving for x, we get x = 93. 

Now we know that Mia is currently 93 years old. We can find Luis's age using the fact that <fact4>Luis is 6 years younger than Noah</fact4>. So, Luis is <fact1>24</fact1> - 6 = 18 years old. 

We can find Kimia's age using the fact that <fact5>Kimia is 7 years older than Luis</fact5>. So, Kimia is 18 + 7 = 25 years old. 

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>. Noah will be <fact1>24</fact1> + 2 = 26, Mia will be 93 + 2 = 95, Luis will be 18 + 2 = 20, and Kimia will be 25 + 2 = 27. 

Finally, we can find the average of their ages in 2 years by adding their ages and dividing by 4: (26 + 95 + 20 + 27) / 4 = 168 / 4 = 42.

Pavel's brother, Carlos, is <fact4>7 years younger than Pavel</fact4>, and Priya's sister Sofia is <fact5>10 years older than Carlos</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's current age. Since in <fact2>2 years</fact2>, Priya will be <fact3>3 times as old as Pavel is now</fact3>, we can set up an equation: Priya's current age + <fact2>2</fact2> = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>13</fact1>. Solving for Priya's current age, we get Priya's current age = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact2>2</fact2> = 37.

Next, we can find Carlos' current age, which is <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact4>7</fact4> = 6 years old.

Then, we can find Sofia's current age, which is <fact5>10 years older than Carlos</fact5>, so Sofia's current age = 6 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 16.

Now, we can find the ages of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>: Pavel's age = <fact1>13</fact1> + <fact6>5</fact6> = 18, Priya's age = 37 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 42, Carlos' age = 6 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 11, and Sofia's age = 16 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 21.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the current age of Roya. Since in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, Roya will be <fact3>2 times as old as James is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Roya's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>2 times James' current age</fact3>. We know <fact1>James is 19 years old</fact1>, so we can substitute this value into the equation. Let's call Roya's current age ""R"". Then, R + <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>19</fact1>. Solving for R, we get R = 38 - <fact2>4</fact2> = 34. 

Next, we can find the current age of Umar. Since <fact4>Umar is 7 years younger than James</fact4>, and <fact1>James is 19 years old</fact1>, Umar's current age is <fact1>19</fact1> - <fact4>7</fact4> = 12.

Then, we can find the current age of Elena. Since <fact5>Elena is 11 years older than Umar</fact5>, and Umar's current age is 12, Elena's current age is 12 + <fact5>11</fact5> = 23.

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>. James will be <fact1>19</fact1> + <fact6>2</fact6> = 21, Roya will be 34 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 36, Umar will be 12 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 14, and Elena will be 23 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 25.

Finally, we can find the average of their ages in <fact6>2 years</fact6>. The average is (21 + 36 + 14 + 25) / 4 = 96 / 4 = 24.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>6 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Sophia's current age. Since in <fact2>9 years</fact2>, Sophia will be <fact3>2 times as old as Mohammed is now</fact3>, and <fact1>Mohammed is 13 years old</fact1>, Sophia will be 2 * <fact1>13</fact1> = 26 years old in <fact2>9 years</fact2>. So, Sophia's current age is 26 - <fact2>9</fact2> = 17 years old.

Next, we find Theo's current age. Since <fact4>Theo is 6 years younger than Mohammed</fact4>, and <fact1>Mohammed is 13 years old</fact1>, Theo is <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact4>6</fact4> = 7 years old.

Then, we find Tara's current age. Since <fact5>Tara is 8 years older than Theo</fact5>, and Theo is 7 years old, Tara is 7 + <fact5>8</fact5> = 15 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Kayla's current age. Since in <fact2>7 years</fact2>, Kayla will be <fact3>4 times as old as Carlos is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Kayla's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times</fact3> * <fact1>19 years</fact1>. 
So, Kayla's current age + 7 = 4 * 19. 
Kayla's current age + 7 = 76. 
Kayla's current age = 76 - 7 = 69. 
Since <fact4>Alejandro is 9 years younger than Carlos</fact4>, Alejandro's current age is <fact1>19 years</fact1> - 9 years = 10 years. 
Since <fact5>Elena is 8 years older than Alejandro</fact5>, Elena's current age is 10 years + 8 years = 18 years.

Answer: First, we need to find Ava's current age. Since Ava will be <fact3>2 times as old as Yusuf is now</fact3> in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation: Ava's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>2 times Yusuf's current age</fact3>. We know Yusuf is <fact1>17 years old</fact1>, so Ava's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>17 years</fact1> = 34 years. Therefore, Ava's current age is 34 - <fact2>4 years</fact2> = 30 years.

Next, we need to find Ali's current age. Since Ali is <fact4>8 years younger than Yusuf</fact4>, Ali's current age is <fact1>17 years</fact1> - <fact4>8 years</fact4> = 9 years.

Then, we need to find Isabella's current age. Since Isabella is <fact5>7 years older than Ali</fact5>, Isabella's current age is 9 years + <fact5>7 years</fact5> = 16 years.

Answer: First, we need to find Winnie's current age. Since Winnie will be <fact3>4 times as old as Xavier is now</fact3> in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, we can set up the equation: Winnie's current age + <fact2>8 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times</fact3> * <fact1>Xavier's current age</fact1>. 
Let's substitute <fact1>Xavier's current age</fact1> with 15 and solve for Winnie's current age: Winnie's current age + 8 = 4 * 15, Winnie's current age + 8 = 60, Winnie's current age = 52.

Since Sophia will be <fact3>4 times as old as Jin is now</fact3> in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation to represent this: Sophia's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times Jin's current age</fact3>. We know <fact1>Jin is 12 years old</fact1>, so we can substitute this value into the equation. Let's call Sophia's current age ""S"". Then, the equation becomes: S + <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>12</fact1>. Solving for S, we get S = 44.

Next, we need to find Noah's current age. We know that <fact4>Noah is 5 years younger than Jin</fact4>, and <fact1>Jin is 12 years old</fact1>, so Noah's current age is <fact1>12</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 7 years old.

We also need to find Gabrielle's current age. We know that Gabrielle is <fact5>10 years older than Noah</fact5>, and Noah is 7 years old, so Gabrielle's current age is 7 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 17 years old.

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>. Jin will be <fact1>12</fact1> + <fact6>5</fact6> = 17 years old. Sophia will be 44 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 49 years old. Noah will be 7 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 12 years old. Gabrielle will be 17 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 22 years old.

Finally, we can find the average of their ages in <fact6>5 years</fact6> by adding up their ages and dividing by 4: (17 + 49 + 12 + 22) / 4 = 25.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: Since Tara will be <fact3>4 times as old as Ali is now</fact3> in <fact2>9 years</fact2>, Tara will be <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>14</fact1> = 56 years old in <fact2>9 years</fact2>. So Tara is currently 56 - <fact2>9</fact2> = 47 years old. 
Oscar is <fact4>6 years younger than Ali</fact4>, so Oscar is <fact1>14</fact1> - <fact4>6</fact4> = 8 years old. 
Ava is <fact5>11 years older than Oscar</fact5>, so Ava is <fact4>8</fact4> + <fact5>11</fact5> = 19 years old. 
In <fact6>5 years</fact6>, Ali will be <fact1>14</fact1> + <fact6>5</fact6> = 19 years old, Tara will be 47 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 52 years old, Oscar will be <fact4>8</fact4> + <fact6>5</fact6> = 13 years old, and Ava will be 19 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 24 years old.

Answer: In <fact2>2 years</fact2>, Kimia will be <fact3>4 times as old as Viktor is now</fact3>, which is <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>18</fact1> = 72 years old. So, Kimia is currently 72 - <fact2>2</fact2> = 70 years old. 
Luca is <fact4>5 years younger than Viktor</fact4>, so Luca is <fact1>18</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 13 years old. 
Elena is <fact5>10 years older than Luca</fact5>, so Elena is 13 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 23 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>3 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Yara's current age. Since in <fact2>2 years</fact2>, Yara will be <fact3>2 times as old as Oscar is now</fact3>, and <fact1>Oscar is 23 years old</fact1>, Yara will be 2 * 23 = 46 years old in 2 years. So, Yara's current age is 46 - 2 = 44 years old.

Next, we find Kai's current age. Since <fact4>Kai is 10 years younger than Oscar</fact4>, and <fact1>Oscar is 23 years old</fact1>, Kai is 23 - 10 = 13 years old.

Then, we find Nia's current age. Since <fact5>Nia is 7 years older than Kai</fact5>, and Kai is 13 years old, Nia is 13 + 7 = 20 years old.

Now, we calculate their ages in <fact6>3 years</fact6>. Oscar will be 23 + 3 = 26 years old, Yara will be 44 + 3 = 47 years old, Kai will be 13 + 3 = 16 years old, and Nia will be 20 + 3 = 23 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Aisha's current age. Since in <fact2>5 years</fact2>, Aisha will be <fact3>3 times as old as Esteban is now</fact3>, and <fact1>Esteban is 14 years old</fact1>, Aisha will be 14 * 3 = 42 years old in <fact2>5 years</fact2>. So, Aisha's current age is 42 - 5 = 37 years old.

Next, we find Qasim's current age. Since <fact4>Qasim is 5 years younger than Esteban</fact4>, and <fact1>Esteban is 14 years old</fact1>, Qasim is 14 - 5 = 9 years old.

Then, we find Leilani's current age. Since Leilani is <fact5>11 years older than Qasim</fact5>, and Qasim is 9 years old, Leilani is 9 + 11 = 20 years old.

Now, we calculate their ages in <fact6>2 years</fact6>. Esteban will be 14 + 2 = 16 years old, Aisha will be 37 + 2 = 39 years old, Qasim will be 9 + 2 = 11 years old, and Leilani will be 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>3 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's current age. Since in <fact2>7 years</fact2>, Priya will be <fact3>2 times as old as Liam is now</fact3>, and <fact1>Liam is 9 years old</fact1>, Priya will be 2 * <fact1>9</fact1> = 18 years old in <fact2>7 years</fact2>. So, Priya's current age is 18 - <fact2>7</fact2> = 11 years old.

Now, we can find Carlos' current age. Since <fact4>Carlos is 5 years younger than Liam</fact4>, and <fact1>Liam is 9 years old</fact1>, Carlos is <fact1>9</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 4 years old.

Next, we can find Mei's current age. Since <fact5>Mei is 8 years older than Carlos</fact5>, and Carlos is 4 years old, Mei is 4 + <fact5>8</fact5> = 12 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Ananya's current age. Since in <fact2>7 years</fact2>, Ananya will be <fact3>2 times as old as Yusuf is now</fact3>, we can set up an equation: Ananya's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>2 times Yusuf's current age</fact3>. We know Yusuf is <fact1>22 years old</fact1>, so Ananya's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>22 years</fact1> = 44 years. Therefore, Ananya's current age is 44 - <fact2>7 years</fact2> = 37 years.

Next, we find Santiago's current age. Since Santiago is <fact4>11 years younger than Yusuf</fact4>, and Yusuf is <fact1>22 years old</fact1>, Santiago is <fact1>22 years</fact1> - <fact4>11 years</fact4> = 11 years old.

Then, we find Aisha's current age. Since Aisha is <fact5>7 years older than Santiago</fact5>, and Santiago is 11 years old, Aisha is 11 + <fact5>7 years</fact5> = 18 years old.

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>. Yusuf will be <fact1>22 years</fact1> + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 27 years old. Ananya will be 37 + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 42 years old. Santiago will be 11 + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 16 years old. Aisha will be 18 + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 23 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>4 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Fatima's age. Since Fatima will be <fact3>2 times as old as Mohammed is now</fact3> in <fact2>3 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation to find Fatima's age. Let's call Fatima's age F. Then, F + <fact2>3</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>10</fact1>. Solving for F, we get F = 2 * <fact1>10</fact1> - <fact2>3</fact2> = 17. 

Now we know Fatima's age is 17. We can find Bodhi's age using the information that <fact4>Bodhi is 7 years younger than Mohammed</fact4>. So Bodhi's age is <fact1>10</fact1> - 7 = 3. 

We can find Nia's age using the information that <fact5>Nia is 7 years older than Bodhi</fact5>. So Nia's age is 3 + 7 = 10.

Answer: First, let's calculate how much money Sofia spent. She bought <fact3>18 screws</fact3> at <fact5>€0.22 each</fact5>, which is 18 * 0.22 = €3.96. She also bought <fact4>9 nuts at €0.57 each</fact4>, which is 9 * 0.57 = €5.13. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at €7 each (since she's not a member and doesn't get a discount), which is 8 * 7 = €56. So, Sofia spent a total of 3.96 + 5.13 + 56 = €65.09. She had <fact2>€83.09</fact2> initially, so she has 83.09 - 65.09 = €18 left.

Now, let's calculate how much money DeShawn spent. He bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at €7 each, but since he's a member, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>.

He had <fact7>€80</fact7> initially, so he has 80 - 72 = €8 left.

Therefore, Sofia has €18 - €8 = €10 more than DeShawn after they leave the store.

How much more money does Olga have left than Alejandro after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Olga and Alejandro have left, we need to calculate how much they spent. Olga bought <fact3>16 washers</fact3> at <fact5>¥0.24 each</fact5>, which is 16 x 0.24 = ¥3.84. She also bought <fact4>9 anchors at ¥0.59 each</fact4>, which is 9 x 0.59 = ¥5.31. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ¥7.0 each (since <fact1>she is not a member</fact1>), which is 8 x 7 = ¥56. So, Olga spent 3.84 + 5.31 + 56 = ¥65.15. Since <fact2>Olga had ¥86.15</fact2>, she has 86.15 - 65.15 = ¥21 left.

Alejandro bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at ¥7.0 each, but since <fact1>he is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>. So, he paid 10 x 7 x 0.9 = ¥63 for the paint. He also bought <fact9>4 carpenter pencils at ¥4 each</fact9>, which is 4 x 4 = ¥16. So, Alejandro spent 63 + 16 = ¥79. Since <fact7>Alejandro had ¥90</fact7>, he has 90 - 79 = ¥11 left.

Therefore, Olga has ¥21 - ¥11 = ¥10 more than Alejandro.

How much more money does Uma have left than Qasim after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Uma has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The cost of the washers is <fact3>18</fact3> * <fact5>€0.37</fact5> = €6.66. The cost of the screws is <fact4>9</fact4> * €0.63 = €5.67. The cost of the paint is <fact6>8</fact6> * €9.0 = €72.0. So, the total cost for Uma is €6.66 + €5.67 + €72.0 = €84.33. Uma had <fact2>€95.33</fact2> initially, so she has €95.33 - €84.33 = €11.0 left.

For Qasim, the cost of the paint is <fact8>10</fact8> * €9.0 = €90.0, but since <fact1>Qasim is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. So, the cost of the paint for Qasim is €90.0 - (€90.0 * 0.1) = €81.0. The cost of the pencils is <fact9>3</fact9> * €3 = €9.0. So, the total cost for Qasim is €81.0 + €9.0 = €90.0. Qasim had <fact7>€100</fact7> initially, so he has €100 - €90.0 = €10.0 left.

Therefore, Uma has €11.0 - €10.0 = €1.0 more than Qasim.

How much more money does Camila have left than Gabriel after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Camila and Gabriel have left, we need to calculate how much they spent. Camila spent <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact5>$0.39</fact5> = $5.85 on nails and <fact4>8</fact4> * <fact4>$0.68</fact4> = $5.44 on washers. She also spent <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact8>$7.0</fact8> = $56 on paint. In total, Camila spent $5.85 + $5.44 + $56 = $67.29. Since <fact1>Camila is not a member</fact1>, she does not get a discount. Gabriel spent <fact8>10</fact8> * <fact8>$7.0</fact8> * (1 - <fact10>0.1</fact10>) = $63 on paint and <fact9>4</fact9> * <fact9>$3</fact9> = $12 on carpenter pencils. In total, Gabriel spent $63 + $12 = $75. Camila has <fact2>$93.29</fact2> - $67.29 = $26 left. Gabriel has <fact7>$100</fact7> - $75 = $25 left.

Answer: Mei buys <fact3>15 nails</fact3> at <fact5>₣0.29</fact5> each, which is <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact5>0.29</fact5> = ₣4.35. She also buys <fact4>10 washers</fact4> at <fact4>₣0.6</fact4> each, which is <fact4>10</fact4> * <fact4>0.6</fact4> = ₣6. Mei also buys <fact6>10 gallons of paint</fact6> at <fact8>₣7.5</fact8> each, which is <fact6>10</fact6> * <fact8>7.5</fact8> = ₣75. So Mei spends ₣4.35 + ₣6 + ₣75 = ₣85.35. Mei has <fact2>₣96.35</fact2> initially, so she has ₣96.35 - ₣85.35 = ₣11 left.

Wei buys <fact8>12 gallons of paint</fact8> at <fact8>₣7.5</fact8> each, but with a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>, the price per gallon is <fact8>₣7.5</fact8> * (1 - <fact10>0.1</fact10>) = ₣6.75.

The store offers <fact10>a 10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Sofia have left than Oliver after they leave the store?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much Sofia spent. She bought <fact3>18 anchors</fact3> at <fact5>€0.26 each</fact5>, which is 18 * 0.26 = €4.68. She also bought <fact4>9 screws at €0.61 each</fact4>, which is 9 * 0.61 = €5.49. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at €7.5 each (no discount for Sofia), which is 8 * 7.5 = €60. So, Sofia spent a total of 4.68 + 5.49 + 60 = €70.17. Sofia had <fact2>€87.17</fact2> initially, so she has 87.17 - 70.17 = €17 left.

Now, let's calculate how much Oliver spent. He bought <fact8>12 gallons of paint</fact8> at €7.5 each, but as a member, he gets <fact10>a 10% discount on paint</fact10>. So, the price of paint for Oliver is 7.5 * 0.9 = €6.75 per gallon. Therefore, Oliver spent 12 * 6.75 = €81 on paint. He also bought <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at €3 each</fact9>, which is 3 * 3 = €9. So, Oliver spent a total of 81 + 9 = €90. Oliver had <fact7>€100</fact7> initially, so he has 100 - 90 = €10 left.

Finally, Sofia has €17 left and Oliver has €10 left, so Sofia has 17 - 10 = €7 more than Oliver.

Answer: To find out how much money Olivia and James have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases. 
Olivia buys <fact3>15 nails</fact3> at <fact5>€0.31</fact5> each, for a total of <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact5>0.31</fact5> = €4.65.

The total cost of paint for Olivia is <fact6>10</fact6> * <fact8>7.0</fact8> = €70. 
So, the total cost for Olivia is 4.65 + 5.58 + 70 = €80.23. 
Olivia has <fact2>€90.23</fact2> initially, so she has <fact2>90.23</fact2> - 80.23 = €10 left.

Since <fact1>James is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. 
The cost of paint for James is <fact8>10</fact8> * <fact8>7.0</fact8> * 0.9 = €63. 
James also buys <fact9>4 carpenter pencils</fact9> at €2 each, for a total of <fact9>4</fact9> * 2 = €8. 
So, the total cost for James is 63 + 8 = €71. 
James has <fact7>€80</fact7> initially, so he has <fact7>80</fact7> - 71 = €9 left.

Therefore, Olivia has €10 - €9 = €1 more than James.

So, Xena spends ₺4.95 + ₺6.40 + ₺60 = ₺71.35. Xena has <fact2>₺96.35</fact2> initially, so she has ₺96.35 - ₺71.35 = ₺25 left.

Hiroshi buys <fact8>12 gallons of paint</fact8> at ₺7.5 each, but as a member, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>. So, he pays 12 x ₺7.5 x 0.9 = ₺81. He also buys <fact9>3 carpenter pencils</fact9> at ₺2 each, which costs 3 x ₺2 = ₺6. So, Hiroshi spends ₺81 + ₺6 = ₺87. Hiroshi has <fact7>₺100</fact7> initially, so he has ₺100 - ₺87 = ₺13 left.

Therefore, Xena has ₺25 - ₺13 = ₺12 more than Hiroshi after they leave the store.

The store offers a <fact10>10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Emma have left than Benjamin after they leave the store?

Answer: Emma buys <fact3>15 screws</fact3> at <fact5>€0.26</fact5> each for a total of <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact5>0.26</fact5> = €3.90. She buys <fact4>9 anchors</fact4> at €0.61 each for a total of <fact4>9</fact4> * 0.61 = €5.49. She buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at €7 each for a total of <fact6>8</fact6> * 7 = €56. Emma's total cost is 3.90 + 5.49 + 56 = €65.39. Since Emma started with <fact2>€98.39</fact2>, she has €98.39 - 65.39 = €33 left.

Benjamin buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at €7 each, but as a <fact1>member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>. So, he pays 7 * 0.9 = €6.30 per gallon of paint.

Since Benjamin started with <fact7>€100</fact7>, he has €100 - 79 = €21 left.

The difference between the amount of money Emma and Benjamin have left is €33 - 21 = €12.

Answer: Xena buys <fact3>15 nuts</fact3> at <fact5>₺0.27 each</fact5>, which costs 15 x <fact5>0.27</fact5> = ₺4.05. She also buys <fact4>9 screws at ₺0.7 each</fact4>, which costs <fact4>9</fact4> x <fact4>0.7</fact4> = ₺6.3. Additionally, she buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ₺9.0 each, which costs <fact6>8</fact6> x 9.0 = ₺72. So, Xena spends 4.05 + 6.3 + 72 = ₺82.35. Xena has <fact2>₺96.35</fact2> initially, so she has <fact2>96.35</fact2> - 82.35 = ₺14 left.

Ali buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at ₺9.0 each, but with a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>, the price becomes 9.0 - (9.0 x <fact10>0.1</fact10>) = ₺8.1 per gallon.

Jamal, who is <fact3>younger than Ananya but older than Benjamin</fact3>, will be <fact4>74 in 8 years</fact4>. How much younger is Benjamin than the average age of all three?

Answer: 
Jamal will be <fact4>74 in 8 years</fact4>, so his current age is 74 - 8 = 66 years. 
Since Jamal is <fact3>younger than Ananya but older than Benjamin</fact3>, and Jamal and Ananya are <fact1>12 years apart in age</fact1>, Ananya's current age is 66 + 12 = 78 years.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 14% of the selling price</fact4>. If Ms. Johnson can get a <fact5>25% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Ms. Johnson's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>25%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $640000</fact2>, which is 0.25 * 640000 = $160000. So, the discounted selling price is 640000 - 160000 = $480000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * 480000 = $14400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 * 480000 = $67200.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: 480000 + 14400 + 67200 = $561600.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Ms. Johnson's <fact1>$490000 budget</fact1>. The difference is 561600 - 490000 = $71600.

If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>10% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>10%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $500000</fact2>, which is 0.1 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $50000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$500000</fact2> - $50000 = $450000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 x $450000 = $13500. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 x $450000 = $63000.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $450000 + $13500 + $63000 = $526500.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$430000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $526500 - <fact1>$430000</fact1> = $96500.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is <fact3>5%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.05 x $400000 = $20000. The transfer fee is <fact4>12%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.12 x $400000 = $48000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.04 x $400000 = $16000. The <fact4>transfer fee is 13% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.13 x $400000 = $52000.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $400000 + $16000 + $52000 = $468000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's <fact1>$420000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $468000 - <fact1>$420000</fact1> = $48000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is <fact3>7%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.07 * $420000 = $29400. The transfer fee is <fact4>12%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.12 * $420000 = $50400.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $420000 + $29400 + $50400 = $499800.

Finally, let's calculate how much more the total cost is than Dr. Patel's budget. The difference is $499800 - <fact1>$430000</fact1> = $69800.

The answer is {69800}.",69800.0,1,1,p2,1449,1376
32,"Reformatted Question: Dr. Patel is looking for a new condo that will not go beyond her <fact1>$300000 budget</fact1>. She saw a property that has a <fact2>selling price of $400000</fact2>. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price</fact4>. If Dr. Patel can get a <fact5>15% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Dr. Patel's budget?

Answer: First, let's calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>15%</fact5> of <fact2>$400000</fact2>, which is 0.15 x <fact2>$400000</fact2> = $60000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$400000</fact2> - $60000 = $340000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is <fact3>4%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.04 x $340000 = $13600. The transfer fee is <fact4>13%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.13 x $340000 = $44200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $340000 + $13600 + $44200 = $397800.

Finally, let's calculate how much more the total cost is than Dr. Patel's budget. The difference is $397800 - <fact1>$300000</fact1> = $97800.

If Dr. Patel can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Dr. Patel's budget?

Answer: First, let's calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of <fact2>$500000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $100000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$500000</fact2> - $100000 = $400000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is <fact3>6%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.06 x $400000 = $24000. The transfer fee is <fact4>13%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.13 x $400000 = $52000.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $400000 + $24000 + $52000 = $476000.

Finally, let's calculate how much more the total cost is than Dr. Patel's budget. The difference is $476000 - <fact1>$420000</fact1> = $56000.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the science fair. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>2-day science fair</fact1> is <fact2>₺150</fact2> * 2 = ₺300. The cost of the <fact3>food for the science fair</fact3> is <fact3>₺20</fact3> * 2 = ₺40, but this cost is covered by Pavel's friends, so we don't need to consider it. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>2-day science fair</fact1> is <fact4>₺10</fact4> * 2 = ₺20. Therefore, the total cost of the science fair is ₺300 + ₺20 = ₺320.

The parent association is covering <fact6>half of the remaining cost of the science fair</fact6>, which is ₺320 / 2 = ₺160.

Answer: The total cost of the conference is (<fact2>¥200</fact2> + <fact3>¥30</fact3> + <fact4>¥30</fact4>) * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥780.

Pavel has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/2 of the remaining cost of the science fair</fact6>. How much money is Pavel still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the science fair. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day science fair</fact1> is <fact2>€200</fact2> * 3 = €600. The cost of the <fact3>food for the science fair</fact3> is <fact3>€30</fact3> * 3 = €90, but this cost is covered by Pavel's friends, so we don't need to consider it. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>3-day science fair</fact1> is <fact4>€10</fact4> * 3 = €30. So, the total cost of the science fair is €600 + €30 = €630. 

Since Pavel's friends are covering the cost of the food, the remaining cost of the science fair is €630. The community center is covering <fact6>1/2 of the remaining cost of the science fair</fact6>, which is €630 / 2 = €315. 

Now, let's calculate how much money Pavel still needs. The total cost of the science fair that Pavel needs to cover is €630 - €315 = €315. Pavel only has <fact5>€30</fact5>, so he still needs €315 - €30 = €285.

Each day costs <fact2>€200 for hotel</fact2>, <fact3>€20 for food</fact3>, and <fact4>€10 for transportation</fact4>. Tariq only has <fact5>€55</fact5>. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the field trip</fact3>. Tariq has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>a fifth of the remaining cost of the field trip</fact6>. How much money is Tariq still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the field trip. The cost of the hotel for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>€200 per day</fact2> = €600. The cost of food is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>€20 per day</fact3> = €60, but this is covered by Tariq's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of transportation is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>€10 per day</fact4> = €30. Therefore, the total cost of the field trip is €600 + €30 = €630.

Since Tariq's friends are covering the cost of food, Tariq only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is €630. The community center is covering <fact6>a fifth of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is €630 / 5 = €126. So, the community center will pay €126, leaving Tariq to pay €630 - €126 = €504.

Tariq already has <fact5>€55</fact5>, so he still needs €504 - €55 = €449.

Answer: The total cost of the seminar is (<fact2>¥100</fact2> + <fact3>¥40</fact3> + <fact4>¥10</fact4>) * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = ¥300. Since Yusuf's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3>, which is <fact3>¥40</fact3> * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = ¥80, Yusuf will only need to pay ¥300 - ¥80 = ¥220.

Carlos has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>a tenth of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>. How much money is Carlos still missing?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the <fact1>3-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost per day is <fact2>€100 for hotel</fact2> + <fact4>€30 for transportation</fact4> + <fact3>€20 for food</fact3> = €150. Since the tournament is for <fact1>3 days</fact1>, the total cost is €150 * 3 = €450. However, Carlos' friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>, which is €20 * 3 = €60. So, the remaining cost is €450 - €60 = €390. The community center will cover <fact6>a tenth of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is €390 / 10 = €39. Now, we subtract the amount Carlos has, <fact5>€55</fact5>, and the amount the community center will cover, €39, from the remaining cost: €390 - €55 - €39 = €296.

Theo has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost of the field trip</fact6>. How much money is Theo still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the field trip. The cost of the hotel for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>$100 per day</fact2> = $300. The cost of the food for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>$30 per day</fact3> = $90, but this is covered by Theo's friends, so we don't need to include it in our total. The cost of transportation for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>$20 per day</fact4> = $60. So the total cost of the field trip, excluding food, is $300 + $60 = $360. 

Since Theo's friends are covering the cost of food, we only need to consider the remaining cost of $360. The school is covering <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is $360 / 6 = $60. 

So, the amount that Theo still needs to cover is $360 - $60 = $300. He already has <fact5>$10</fact5>, so he is still missing $300 - $10 = $290.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1050</fact5>. What was the cost of scones per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of danishes. Since Uma bought <fact1>48 danishes at $16 per dozen</fact1>, and there are 4 dozens in 48, the cost of danishes is 4 * $16 = $64. Next, let's calculate the cost of tarts. Since Uma bought <fact2>48 tarts at $25 per dozen</fact2>, and there are 4 dozens in 48, the cost of tarts is 4 * $25 = $100. Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. The total cost is $64 + $100 + the cost of scones. We know that after a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, Uma paid a total of <fact5>$1050</fact5>. So, the total cost before the discount is <fact5>$1050</fact5> / (1 - <fact4>25%</fact4>) = $1050 / 0.75 = $1400. Now, we can calculate the cost of scones.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1140</fact5>. What was the cost of scones per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of danishes and tarts. The cost of <fact1>48 danishes at $20 per dozen</fact1> is 48 / 12 * $20 = $80. The cost of <fact2>60 tarts at $24 per dozen</fact2> is 60 / 12 * $24 = $120. The total cost of danishes and tarts is $80 + $120 = $200. 

Let x be the cost of scones per dozen. Then the cost of <fact3>24 scones</fact3> is 24 / 12 * x = 2x. 

The total cost of all treats before the discount is $200 + 2x. 

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, the total cost becomes ($200 + 2x) * (1 - 0.25) = ($200 + 2x) * 0.75 = $150 + 1.5x.

Since Mia paid a total of <fact5>$1140</fact5>, we can set up the equation $150 + 1.5x = $1140.

Solving for x, we get 1.5x = $1140 - $150 = $990, so x = $990 / 1.5 = $660.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the total number of dozens of donuts is <fact1>48</fact1>/12 = 4. The cost of the donuts is 4 * $18 = $72.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. The total number of dozens of mini cupcakes is <fact2>72</fact2>/12 = 6. The cost of the mini cupcakes is 6 * $29 = $174.

The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $72 + $174 = $246.

Since Daphne paid a total of <fact5>$1200</fact5> after a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the original price before the discount was <fact5>$1200</fact5> / (1 - <fact4>0.20</fact4>) = $1500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of cookies. Since Ananya bought <fact2>48 cookies at $21 per dozen</fact2>, the total cost of cookies is 48 / 12 * 21 = $84. The total cost of eclairs and cookies is 108 + 84 = $192. Since Ananya paid a total of <fact5>$1360</fact5> after a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the original price before the discount is 1360 / (1 - 0.2) = $1700. The cost of muffins is 1700 - 192 = $1508.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1120</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, Chen bought <fact1>24</fact1>/12 = 2 dozen donuts. So, the total cost of the donuts is 2 * <fact1>$16</fact1> = $32. Since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, Chen bought <fact2>72</fact2>/12 = 6 dozen mini cupcakes. So, the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 6 * <fact2>$33</fact2> = $198. The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $32 + $198 = $230. 

Let's denote the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen as x. Since Chen bought <fact3>72</fact3>/12 = 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6x. 

The total cost of all the pastries before the discount is $230 + 6x. After the <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, Chen paid a total of <fact5>$1120</fact5>. So, we can set up the equation: ($230 + 6x) * (1 - <fact4>20%</fact4>) = <fact5>$1120</fact5>.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the eclairs and cookies. Since there are 12 items in a dozen, the cost of 60 eclairs is <fact1>$13 per dozen</fact1> * 5 = $65. The cost of 72 cookies is <fact2>$20 per dozen</fact2> * 6 = $120. The total cost of eclairs and cookies is $65 + $120 = $185. 

Let's denote the cost of muffins per dozen as x. Since Olivia bought <fact3>36 muffins</fact3>, which is 3 dozen, the total cost of muffins is 3x. 

The total cost of all desserts before the discount is $185 + 3x. After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the total cost becomes ($185 + 3x) * 0.8 = <fact5>$1000</fact5>. 

Now we can solve for x: ($185 + 3x) * 0.8 = $1000. 
$148 + 2.4x = $1000. 
2.4x = $852. 
x = $852 / 2.4 = $355.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1300</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since Nadia bought <fact1>60 donuts at $11 per dozen</fact1>, we need to convert the number of donuts to dozens. 60 donuts is equal to 60/12 = 5 dozen donuts. So, the cost of the donuts is 5 * $11 = $55.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Since Nadia bought <fact2>72 mini cupcakes at $20 per dozen</fact2>, we need to convert the number of cupcakes to dozens. 72 cupcakes is equal to 72/12 = 6 dozen cupcakes. So, the cost of the cupcakes is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts and cupcakes. The total cost is $55 + $120 = $175.

Since Nadia paid a total of <fact5>$1300</fact5> after a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, we need to calculate the original price before the discount. Let's call the original price x. Then, x - 20% of x = $1300. Solving for x, we get x = $1300 / 0.8 = $1625.

Now, we know that the total cost of the donuts and cupcakes is $175, and the original price is $1625. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1625 - $175 = $1450.

Since Nadia bought <fact3>24 mini cheesecakes</fact3>, we need to convert the number of cheesecakes to dozens. 24 cheesecakes is equal to 24/12 = 2 dozen cheesecakes. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen is $1450 / 2 = $725.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1230</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts. Since Haruka bought <fact1>72 donuts at $11 per dozen</fact1>, we need to divide 72 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 6. Then, we multiply 6 by $11 to get the total cost of the donuts, which is $66.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mini cupcakes. Since Haruka bought <fact2>48 mini cupcakes at $26 per dozen</fact2>, we need to divide 48 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 4. Then, we multiply 4 by $26 to get the total cost of the mini cupcakes, which is $104.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes together, which is $66 + $104 = $170.

Since Haruka paid a total of <fact5>$1230</fact5> after a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, we need to calculate the original price before the discount. Let's call the original price x. Then, we can set up the equation: x - 0.25x = 1230. Solving for x, we get x = 1230 / 0.75 = 1640.

Now, we know that the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes together is $170, and the original price of all the pastries is $1640. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1640 - $170 = $1470.

Since Haruka bought <fact3>36 mini cheesecakes</fact3>, we need to divide 36 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 3. Then, we can calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen by dividing $1470 by 3, which is $490.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since Daphne bought <fact1>36 donuts at $15 per dozen</fact1>, we can calculate the total cost of the donuts by dividing 36 by 12 and multiplying by $15. This gives us 3 * $15 = $45 for the donuts.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Since Daphne bought <fact2>72 mini cupcakes at $25 per dozen</fact2>, we can calculate the total cost of the mini cupcakes by dividing 72 by 12 and multiplying by $25. This gives us 6 * $25 = $150 for the mini cupcakes.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Esteban eats <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 6 servings, Theo eats 9 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 18 servings, and Gabriel eats 36 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 72 servings. So, in total, they eat 6 + 18 + 72 = 96 servings in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Gabriel cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 36 / 2 = 18 servings a day. Now, the three of them eat <fact2>3</fact2> + 9 + 18 = 30 servings a day. 

There are <fact1>126 servings</fact1> in total, and they have already eaten 96 servings, so there are 126 - 96 = 30 servings left. Since they eat 30 servings a day, it will take them 1 more day to finish the pie.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Arash decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. Haruka can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Daphne can eat <fact3>four times as much</fact3> as Haruka, so she can eat 4 * <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> = 12 servings a day. Arash can eat <fact4>twice as much as Daphne</fact4>, so he can eat 2 * 12 servings a day = 24 servings a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> + 12 servings a day + 24 servings a day = 39 servings a day. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 39 servings a day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 78 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Arash cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 24 servings a day / 2 = 12 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> + 12 servings a day + 12 servings a day = 27 servings a day.

There are <fact1>105 servings</fact1> - 78 servings = 27 servings left. Since they eat 27 servings a day, it will take 27 servings / 27 servings a day = 1 day to finish the remaining pizza.

So, in total, it will take <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 1 day = 3 days to fully eat the pizza.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Mei decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many portions each person can eat per day. <fact2>Oliver can eat 3 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Pavel can eat twice as much</fact3> as Oliver, Pavel can eat 2 * 3 = 6 portions per day. Since <fact4>Mei can eat two times as much as Pavel</fact4>, Mei can eat 2 * 6 = 12 portions per day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 21 * 2 = 42 portions. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Mei decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Mei now eats 12 / 2 = 6 portions per day. Now, the total number of portions eaten per day is 3 + 6 + 6 = 15.

There are <fact1>87 portions</fact1> initially, and 42 portions were eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are 87 - 42 = 45 portions left. 

To find out how many more days it will take to eat the remaining portions, we divide the remaining portions by the new daily consumption: 45 / 15 = 3. 

So, it will take 3 more days to eat the remaining portions. Since they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of days it will take to eat the entire cake is 2 + 3 = 5 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sophia decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Jasmine can eat 5 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Roya can eat twice as much</fact3> as Jasmine, Roya can eat 2 * 5 = 10 portions per day. Since <fact4>Sophia can eat twice as much as Roya</fact4>, Sophia can eat 2 * 10 = 20 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Jasmine is <fact2>5 portions per day</fact2> * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 10 portions. The total portions eaten by Roya is 10 portions per day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 20 portions. The total portions eaten by Sophia is 20 portions per day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 40 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they have eaten 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 portions in total.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sophia decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Sophia will eat 20 / 2 = 10 portions per day. Now, the total portions eaten per day is 5 (by Jasmine) + 10 (by Roya) + 10 (by Sophia) = 25 portions per day.

There are <fact1>120 portions</fact1> - 70 portions = 50 portions left. Since they eat 25 portions per day, it will take 50 / 25 = 2 more days to finish the cake.

So, in total, it will take <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 2 days = 4 days to finish the cake.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Yusuf decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Sakura can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Keisha can eat two times as much</fact3> as Sakura, Keisha can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions per day. Since <fact4>Yusuf can eat four times as much as Keisha</fact4>, Yusuf can eat 4 * 4 = 16 portions per day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 16 = 22. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 22 * 2 = 44 portions.

Answer: Wei can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Priya, so Wei can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> * 2 = 4 servings a day. Ava can eat <fact4>three times as much as Wei</fact4>, so Ava can eat 4 servings a day * 3 = 12 servings a day. For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> + 4 servings a day + 12 servings a day = 18 servings a day. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 18 servings a day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 36 servings. After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Ava cuts her consumption by half, so she eats 12 servings a day / 2 = 6 servings a day.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Camila decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many servings each person can eat per day. Nadia can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Ali can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Nadia, so Ali can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Camila can eat <fact4>six times as much as Ali</fact4>, so Camila can eat 6 * 6 = 36 servings a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Camila eats 36 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 72 servings. After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Camila cuts her consumption in half, so she eats 36 / 2 = 18 servings a day.

Let's calculate the total number of servings eaten by all three people in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. Nadia eats <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 6 servings. Ali eats 6 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 12 servings. Camila eats 72 servings. So, the total number of servings eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5> is 6 + 12 + 72 = 90 servings.

Now, let's calculate how many servings are left after <fact5>2 days</fact5>. There are <fact1>117 servings</fact1> initially, and 90 servings are eaten, so there are <fact1>117</fact1> - 90 = 27 servings left.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the three people eat 3 + 6 + 18 = 27 servings per day. Since there are 27 servings left, it will take them 1 more day to finish the pie.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sanjay decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat in a day. We already know that <fact2>Fatima can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Ravi can eat twice as much</fact3> as Fatima, Ravi can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions a day. Since <fact4>Sanjay can eat five times as much as Ravi</fact4>, Sanjay can eat 5 * 4 = 20 portions a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 20 = 26. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 26 * 2 = 52 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sanjay decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Sanjay now eats 20 / 2 = 10 portions a day. Now, the total number of portions eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 10 = 16.

There are <fact1>84 portions</fact1> initially, and 52 portions were eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are 84 - 52 = 32 portions left.

To find out how many more days it will take to eat the remaining portions, we divide the remaining portions by the new daily consumption: 32 / 16 = 2.

So, it will take 2 more days to eat the remaining portions. Adding the initial <fact5>2 days</fact5>, it will take a total of 2 + 2 = 4 days for the pizza to be fully eaten.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Mohammed can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Luis can eat <fact3>seven times as much</fact3> as Mohammed, so Luis can eat <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>7</fact3> = 14 servings a day.

Answer: First, let's determine how much each person can eat in a day. Umar can eat <fact2>2 portions a day</fact2>. Arash can eat <fact3>thrice as much</fact3> as Umar, so Arash can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 portions a day.

Answer: First, let's calculate how much each person can eat in a day. <fact2>Kai can eat 5 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Liam can eat twice as much</fact3> as Kai, Liam can eat 2 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 10 portions a day.

Since <fact3>Xena can eat twice as much</fact3> as Jamal, Xena can eat 2 * 2 = 4 pieces a day. Since <fact4>Rania can eat thrice as much as Xena</fact4>, Rania can eat 3 * 4 = 12 pieces a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 12 = 18. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 18 * 2 = 36 pieces. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Rania decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Rania can eat 12 / 2 = 6 pieces a day. Now, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. 

There are <fact1>48 pieces</fact1> in total, and 36 pieces have been eaten, so there are 48 - 36 = 12 pieces left. Since they can eat 12 pieces per day, it will take 1 more day to finish the pizza. 

So, in total, it will take 2 + 1 = 3 days to finish the pizza.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Luca decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Roya can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. <fact3>Mohammed can eat twice as much</fact3> as Roya, so Mohammed can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions per day. <fact4>Luca can eat ten times as much as Mohammed</fact4>, so Luca can eat 4 * 10 = 40 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Luca eats 40 * 2 = 80 portions, Mohammed eats 4 * 2 = 8 portions, and Roya eats 2 * 2 = 4 portions. So, in total, they eat 80 + 8 + 4 = 92 portions in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Luca decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Luca now eats 40 / 2 = 20 portions per day. Now, the three of them eat 20 + 4 + 2 = 26 portions per day.

They have <fact1>118 portions</fact1> - 92 portions = 26 portions left. Since they eat 26 portions per day, it will take them 1 more day to finish the lasagna.

So, in total, it will take them <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 1 day = 3 days to finish the lasagna.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Arjun decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pieces each person can eat per day. We know that <fact2>Kayla can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Jin can eat twice as much</fact3> as Kayla, Jin can eat 2 * 2 = 4 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Arjun can eat twice as much as Jin</fact4>, Arjun can eat 4 * 2 = 8 pieces per day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 pieces. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 14 * 2 = 28 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Arjun decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Arjun can eat 8 / 2 = 4 pieces per day. Now, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 pieces.

There are <fact1>118 pieces</fact1> in total, and 28 pieces have been eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. So, there are 118 - 28 = 90 pieces left. 

To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 90 pieces, we divide 90 by the new daily consumption of 10 pieces. 90 / 10 = 9 days.

However, we need to add the initial <fact5>2 days</fact5> to this result, as the question asks for the total number of days it will take to eat the entire pizza. Therefore, the total number of days is 9 + 2 = 11 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Rania decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pieces each person can eat per day. Nia can eat <fact2>2 pieces a day</fact2>. Jasmine can eat <fact3>three times as much</fact3> as Nia, so she can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 pieces a day. Rania can eat <fact4>three times as much as Jasmine</fact4>, so she can eat 3 * 6 = 18 pieces a day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Nia eats <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 4 pieces, Jasmine eats 6 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 12 pieces, and Rania eats 18 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 36 pieces. So, in total, they eat 4 + 12 + 36 = 52 pieces in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Rania decides to go on a diet and cut her consumption by half, so she can eat 18 / 2 = 9 pieces a day. Now, the three of them eat <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 9 = 17 pieces per day. 

There are <fact1>86 pieces</fact1> - 52 pieces = 34 pieces left. To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining pieces, we divide 34 by 17, which is 2. 

However, we need to add the <fact5>2 days</fact5> they already spent eating the cake. So, the total number of days it will take for the cake to be fully eaten is 2 + 2 = 4.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Rania decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Diego can eat 5 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Ibrahim can eat two times as much</fact3> as Diego, Ibrahim can eat 2 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 10 portions per day. Since <fact4>Rania can eat two times as much as Ibrahim</fact4>, Rania can eat 2 * 10 = 20 portions per day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Diego is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 10 portions. The total portions eaten by Ibrahim is 10 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 20 portions. The total portions eaten by Rania is 20 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 40 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten is 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Rania decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Rania can eat 20 / 2 = 10 portions per day.

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take to eat the remaining portions. The remaining portions are <fact1>95</fact1> - 70 = 25 portions. The total portions eaten per day by Diego, Ibrahim, and Rania is <fact2>5</fact2> + 10 + 10 = 25 portions per day.

So, it will take 25 / 25 = 1 day to eat the remaining portions.

Therefore, the total number of days it will take to eat the entire pizza is <fact5>2</fact5> + 1 = 3 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Elena decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. Valentina can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Santiago can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Valentina, so he can eat 2 * 2 = 4 servings a day. Elena can eat <fact4>three times as much as Santiago</fact4>, so she can eat 3 * 4 = 12 servings a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Valentina eats 2 * 2 = 4 servings, Santiago eats 2 * 4 = 8 servings, and Elena eats 2 * 12 = 24 servings. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 24 = 36 servings in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Elena decides to go on a diet and cut her consumption by half, so she can eat 12 / 2 = 6 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings they can eat per day is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 servings.

There are <fact1>48 servings</fact1> in total, and they have already eaten 36 servings, so there are 48 - 36 = 12 servings left. Since they can eat 12 servings per day, it will take them 1 more day to finish the pie.

So, in total, it will take them 2 + 1 = 3 days to fully eat the pie.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Santiago decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Olivia can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Valentina can eat thrice as much</fact3> as Olivia, Valentina can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Santiago can eat four times as much as Valentina</fact4>, Santiago can eat 4 * 6 = 24 pieces per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 24 = 32 pieces. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 32 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 64 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Santiago decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so he now eats 24 / 2 = 12 pieces per day. Now, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 20 pieces.

There are <fact1>104 pieces</fact1> - 64 = 40 pieces left. To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining pieces, we divide 40 by 20, which is 2.

However, we need to add the <fact5>2 days</fact5> they already spent eating. So, the total number of days it will take for the lasagna to be fully eaten is 2 + 2 = 4.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Viktor decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Leilani can eat <fact2>3 portions a day</fact2>. Chen can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Leilani, so Chen can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 portions a day. Viktor can eat <fact4>three times as much as Chen</fact4>, so Viktor can eat 3 * 6 = 18 portions a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total consumption per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 27 portions. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 27 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 54 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Viktor cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 18 / 2 = 9 portions a day. The total consumption per day becomes <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 9 = 18 portions.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining lasagna. The remaining lasagna is <fact1>90</fact1> - 54 = 36 portions.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Leilani can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Xavier can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Leilani, so Xavier can eat 2 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 4 servings a day. Aisha can eat <fact4>six times as much as Xavier</fact4>, so Aisha can eat 6 * 4 = 24 servings a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 4 + 24 = 30 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 30 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 60 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Aisha cuts her consumption in half, so she eats 24 / 2 = 12 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 4 + 12 = 18 servings.

There are <fact1>78 servings</fact1> in total, and 60 servings have been eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are <fact1>78</fact1> - 60 = 18 servings left.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Diego can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. <fact3>Benjamin can eat five times as much</fact3> as Diego, so Benjamin can eat 5 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 10 portions per day. <fact4>Carlos can eat twice as much as Benjamin</fact4>, so Carlos can eat 2 * 10 = 20 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Diego is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 4 portions. The total portions eaten by Benjamin is 10 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 20 portions.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Bodhi can eat <fact2>3 portions a day</fact2>. Emma can eat <fact3>thrice as much</fact3> as Bodhi, so she can eat 3 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 9 portions a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Bodhi eats <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 6 portions, Emma eats 9 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 18 portions, and Umar eats 18 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 36 portions. So, in total, they eat 6 + 18 + 36 = 60 portions in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>.

Answer: Luis eats <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Beatriz eats <fact3>six times as much</fact3> as Luis, so she eats 6 * <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> = 12 servings a day. Theo eats <fact4>twice as much as Beatriz</fact4>, so he eats 2 * 12 servings a day = 24 servings a day. For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> + 12 servings a day + 24 servings a day = 38 servings a day. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 38 servings a day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 76 servings.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Tara can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Zahra can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Tara, so Zahra can eat 2 * 2 = 4 servings a day.

Answer: First, let's calculate how much each person can eat in a day. <fact2>Elena can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. <fact3>Xavier can eat twice as much</fact3> as Elena, so Xavier can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions a day. <fact4>James can eat thrice as much as Xavier</fact4>, so James can eat 3 * 4 = 12 portions a day.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Noah decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by <fact6>half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: Ava eats <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Camila eats <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Ava, so Camila eats 2 * <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Noah eats <fact4>twice as much as Camila</fact4>, so Noah eats 2 * 6 servings a day = 12 servings a day. For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 21 servings a day. After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they have eaten 21 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 42 servings. After Noah cuts his consumption by <fact6>half</fact6>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 6 = 15 servings a day.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>James decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Hiroshi can eat <fact2>3 portions a day</fact2>. Umar can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Hiroshi, so Umar can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 portions a day. James can eat <fact4>twice as much as Umar</fact4>, so James can eat 2 * 6 = 12 portions a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 21. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 21 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 42 portions. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, James cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 12 / 2 = 6 portions a day. Now, the total number of portions eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 6 = 15.

There are <fact1>102 portions</fact1> initially, and 42 portions were eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are <fact1>102</fact1> - 42 = 60 portions left. 

To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining portions, we divide the remaining portions by the number of portions eaten per day, which is 60 / 15 = 4. 

So, it will take <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 4 days = 6 days for the lasagna to be fully eaten.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Valentina decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Alejandro can eat <fact2>2 portions a day</fact2>. Luca can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Alejandro, so Luca can eat 2 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 4 portions a day. Valentina can eat <fact4>twice as much as Luca</fact4>, so Valentina can eat 2 * 4 = 8 portions a day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Alejandro eats <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 4 portions, Luca eats 4 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 8 portions, and Valentina eats 8 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 16 portions. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 portions in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Valentina cuts her consumption in half, so she eats 8 / 2 = 4 portions a day. Now, the three of them eat <fact2>2</fact2> + 4 + 4 = 10 portions a day. 

There are <fact1>78 portions</fact1> initially, and they have eaten 28 portions, so there are <fact1>78</fact1> - 28 = 50 portions left. 

Since they eat 10 portions a day, it will take them 50 / 10 = 5 days to eat the remaining portions. 

However, this is the time it takes to eat the remaining portions, and we want to know the total time it takes to eat the entire pizza. They have already eaten for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so the total time is <fact5>2</fact5> + 5 = 7 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Olivia can eat 4 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Roya can eat two times as much</fact3> as Olivia, Roya can eat 2 * <fact2>4</fact2> = 8 portions per day. Since <fact4>Gabrielle can eat three times as much as Roya</fact4>, Gabrielle can eat 3 * 8 = 24 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Olivia is <fact2>4</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 8 portions. The total portions eaten by Roya is 8 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 16 portions. The total portions eaten by Gabrielle is 24 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 48 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten is 8 + 16 + 48 = 72 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Gabrielle can eat 24 / 2 = 12 portions per day. Now, the total portions eaten per day is <fact2>4</fact2> + 8 + 12 = 24 portions.

The remaining portions of the pie is <fact1>96</fact1> - 72 = 24 portions. Since they can eat 24 portions per day, it will take 24 / 24 = 1 day to finish the remaining portions. 

So, the total number of days it will take for the pie to be fully eaten is <fact5>2</fact5> + 1 = 3 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kayla decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to determine how much each person can eat per day. We know that <fact2>Rania can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Diego can eat twice as much</fact3> as Rania, Diego can eat 2 * 2 = 4 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Kayla can eat six times as much as Diego</fact4>, Kayla can eat 6 * 4 = 24 pieces per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 (Rania) + 4 (Diego) + 24 (Kayla) = 30 pieces per day. So, in 2 days, they eat 30 * 2 = 60 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kayla decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Kayla's new daily consumption is 24 / 2 = 12 pieces per day. The new total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 (Rania) + 4 (Diego) + 12 (Kayla) = 18 pieces per day.

There are <fact1>78 pieces</fact1> initially, and 60 pieces were eaten in the first 2 days, so there are 78 - 60 = 18 pieces left. Since they eat 18 pieces per day after Kayla's diet, it will take 1 more day to finish the lasagna.

Therefore, the total number of days it will take to fully eat the lasagna is 2 (initial days) + 1 (day after Kayla's diet) = 3 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabriel decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many pieces each person can eat per day. <fact2>Sofia can eat 3 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Diego can eat twice as much</fact3> as Sofia, Diego can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Gabriel can eat three times as much as Diego</fact4>, Gabriel can eat 3 * 6 = 18 pieces per day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 27. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 27 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 54 pieces.

There are <fact1>126 pieces</fact1> initially, and 54 pieces were eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are <fact1>126</fact1> - 54 = 72 pieces left. 

To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining pieces, we divide the remaining pieces by the new total number of pieces eaten per day: 72 / 18 = 4.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Elena can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Fatima can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Elena, so Fatima can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Gabrielle can eat <fact4>three times as much as Fatima</fact4>, so Gabrielle can eat 3 * 6 = 18 servings a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 27 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 27 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 54 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Hiroshi decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. Liam can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Jasmine can eat <fact3>three times as much</fact3> as Liam, so she can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Hiroshi can eat <fact4>two times as much as Jasmine</fact4>, so he can eat 2 * 6 = 12 servings a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 20 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 20 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 40 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Hiroshi cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 12 / 2 = 6 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 6 = 14 servings.

There are <fact1>82 servings</fact1> in total, and 40 servings have been eaten, so there are <fact1>82</fact1> - 40 = 42 servings left. 

To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 42 servings, we divide 42 by the new daily consumption of 14 servings: 42 / 14 = 3 days.

However, we must not forget that they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so the total number of days is <fact5>2</fact5> + 3 = 5 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kai decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pieces each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Arash can eat 3 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Emma can eat two times as much</fact3> as Arash, she can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Kai can eat two times as much as Emma</fact4>, he can eat 2 * 6 = 12 pieces per day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Arash eats <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 6 pieces, Emma eats 6 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 12 pieces, and Kai eats 12 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 24 pieces. So, in total, they eat 6 + 12 + 24 = 42 pieces in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kai decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so he can eat 12 / 2 = 6 pieces per day.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces they eat per day after Kai's diet: Arash eats <fact2>3</fact2> pieces, Emma eats 6 pieces, and Kai eats 6 pieces, for a total of 3 + 6 + 6 = 15 pieces per day.

They have already eaten 42 pieces, so they have <fact1>102</fact1> - 42 = 60 pieces left. Since they eat 15 pieces per day, it will take them 60 / 15 = 4 days to eat the remaining pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: Wei can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Hiroshi, so Wei can eat <fact2>3 portions</fact2> * 2 = 6 portions a day. 
Gabrielle can eat <fact4>three times as much as Wei</fact4>, so Gabrielle can eat 6 portions * 3 = 18 portions a day. 
In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Hiroshi eats <fact2>3 portions</fact2> * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 6 portions, Wei eats 6 portions * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 12 portions, and Gabrielle eats 18 portions * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 36 portions. 
So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they have eaten 6 + 12 + 36 = 54 portions. 
There are <fact1>108 portions</fact1> - 54 portions = 54 portions left. 
After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle cuts her consumption by half</fact6>, so she now eats 18 / 2 = 9 portions a day. 
Now, Hiroshi, Wei, and Gabrielle eat <fact2>3 portions</fact2> + 6 portions + 9 portions = 18 portions a day. 
It will take them 54 portions / 18 portions per day = 3 days to eat the remaining pizza.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pieces each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>James can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Kai can eat two times as much</fact3> as James, Kai can eat 2 * 2 = 4 pieces per day. And since <fact4>Jin can eat two times as much as Kai</fact4>, Jin can eat 2 * 4 = 8 pieces per day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, James eats 2 * 2 = 4 pieces, Kai eats 4 * 2 = 8 pieces, and Jin eats 8 * 2 = 16 pieces. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 pieces in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Jin decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Jin can now eat 8 / 2 = 4 pieces per day.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces they eat per day after Jin's diet: James eats 2 pieces, Kai eats 4 pieces, and Jin eats 4 pieces, for a total of 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 pieces per day.

They have already eaten 28 pieces, so they have <fact1>68</fact1> - 28 = 40 pieces left. Since they eat 10 pieces per day, it will take them 40 / 10 = 4 days to eat the remaining pieces.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many pieces each person can eat per day. <fact2>Xavier can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Alejandro can eat three times as much</fact3> as Xavier, Alejandro can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Valentina can eat four times as much as Alejandro</fact4>, Valentina can eat 4 * 6 = 24 pieces per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 24 = 32 pieces. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 32 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 64 pieces.

There are <fact1>124 pieces</fact1> - 64 = 60 pieces left. To find the number of days it takes to eat the remaining pieces, we divide 60 by 20, which is 3.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Leon decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Ali can eat 2 servings a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Camila can eat four times as much</fact3> as Ali, Camila can eat 4 * <fact2>2 servings</fact2> = 8 servings per day. Since <fact4>Leon can eat three times as much as Camila</fact4>, Leon can eat 3 * 8 servings = 24 servings per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings</fact2> + 8 servings + 24 servings = 34 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 34 servings * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 68 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Leon decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Leon now eats 24 servings / 2 = 12 servings per day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings</fact2> + 8 servings + 12 servings = 22 servings.

The remaining number of servings is <fact1>112 servings</fact1> - 68 servings = 44 servings. To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining servings, we divide the remaining servings by the new daily consumption: 44 servings / 22 servings per day = 2 days.

Since they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of days it will take to fully eat the pizza is <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 2 days = 4 days.

How much more do <fact5>7 loaves of sourdough</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 biscuits</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the cost of a biscuit. Since the cost of a biscuit is <fact2>3/4 of a loaf of sourdough</fact2> and a <fact1>loaf of sourdough costs $5</fact1>, the cost of a biscuit is 3/4 * $5 = $3.75.

Answer: The cost of a croissant is <fact2>one-fourth of a loaf of bread</fact2>, which is <fact1>¥5</fact1>/4 = ¥1.25. Since the store offers a <fact4>20% discount on croissants</fact4> when buying <fact3>5 croissants or more</fact3>, and <fact6>8 croissants</fact6> is more than 5, the discounted price of a croissant is ¥1.25 * 0.8 = ¥1.

Answer: First, we need to find the cost of a muffin. Since the cost of a muffin is <fact2>1/4 of a loaf of sourdough</fact2> and a loaf of sourdough costs <fact1>¥5</fact1>, the cost of a muffin is <fact1>¥5</fact1> * 1/4 = ¥1.25. 

Since the cafe has a promotion that if one buys <fact3>6 muffins or more</fact3>, they get a <fact4>20% discount on muffins</fact4> and we are buying <fact6>8 muffins</fact6>, we can apply the discount. The original cost of <fact6>8 muffins</fact6> would be ¥1.25 * 8 = ¥10. With the <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the cost becomes ¥10 * 0.8 = ¥8.

The cost of <fact5>5 loaves of sourdough</fact5> is <fact1>¥5</fact1> * 5 = ¥25.

So, the difference in cost between <fact5>5 loaves of sourdough</fact5> and <fact6>8 muffins</fact6> is ¥25 - ¥8 = ¥17.

Answer: The cleaner has to clean <fact1>70 rooms</fact1> in <fact2>10 days</fact2>, so they need to clean 70/<fact2>10</fact2> = 7 rooms per day. Due to their injury, it now takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3> * <fact4>2</fact4> = 30 minutes per room. They need to clean 7 rooms per day, so they will spend 7 * 30 minutes = 210 minutes per day cleaning rooms. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they will spend 210 minutes / 60 = 3.5 hours per day cleaning rooms. They work for <fact5>7 hours a day</fact5>, so the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms is (3.5 / <fact5>7</fact5>) * 100% ≈ 50%.

Now, we know that there are <fact1>2 purple bricks</fact1> and 16 black bricks, so the total number of non-orange bricks is 2 + 16 = 18. Since there are <fact3>45 bricks in total</fact3>, the number of orange bricks must be <fact3>45</fact3> - 18 = 27. To find the percentage of bricks that are orange, we divide the number of orange bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100: (27 / <fact3>45</fact3>) * 100 = 60%.

Now we know that there are <fact1>4 black cubes</fact1> and 12 pink cubes, so the total number of non-orange cubes is <fact1>4</fact1> + 12 = 16 cubes.

Since there are <fact3>40 cubes in the pyramid in total</fact3>, and 16 of them are not orange, the number of orange cubes must be <fact3>40</fact3> - 16 = 24 cubes.

To find the percentage of cubes that are orange, we divide the number of orange cubes by the total number of cubes and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of orange cubes is (24 / <fact3>40</fact3>) * 100 = 60%.

Answer: 
Carlos needs to buy a week's worth of flour, which is <fact3>2 kgs of flour per day</fact3> * 7 days = 14 kgs of flour. 
The more expensive brand costs <fact1>₣10 per kg</fact1> + <fact1>₣10 per kg</fact1> * <fact2>40%</fact2> = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kg. 
For the first <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, Carlos gets a <fact4>45% discount</fact4>, so he pays ₣14 per kg * <fact5>10 kgs</fact5> * (1 - <fact4>45%</fact4>) = ₣14 * 10 * 0.55 = ₣77.

Ibrahim also decides to buy himself a <fact6>bagel for ₺1</fact6>. How much does Ibrahim have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺4</fact1> + (<fact1>₺4</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ₺5 per kg.

Ibrahim uses <fact3>3 kgs of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of tea.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Ibrahim will get a discount on 20 kgs of tea. The discounted price is ₺5 per kg * (1 - <fact4>0.5</fact4>) = ₺2.5 per kg. The cost of 20 kgs of tea is ₺2.5 per kg * 20 kgs = ₺50.

For the remaining 1 kg of tea, Ibrahim will pay the regular price of ₺5 per kg.

The total cost of tea is ₺50 + ₺5 = ₺55.

Adding the cost of the <fact6>bagel for ₺1</fact6>, the total amount Ibrahim has to pay is ₺55 + ₺1 = ₺56.

Qasim also decides to buy himself a muffin for <fact6>$4</fact6>. How much does Qasim have to pay?

Answer: Qasim needs <fact3>3 kilograms of sugar per day</fact3> for 7 days, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of sugar. The more expensive brand costs <fact1>$10 per kilogram</fact1> + <fact2>10% more</fact2> = $10 + $1 = $11 per kilogram. For the first <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, Qasim gets a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, so he pays $11 * 0.95 = $10.45 per kilogram. For the remaining 1 kilogram, Qasim pays the regular price of $11 per kilogram. So, the total cost of sugar is 20 * $10.45 + 1 * $11 = $209 + $11 = $220.

Answer: Thiago needs to buy a week's worth of flour, which is <fact3>3 pounds per day</fact3> * 7 days = 21 pounds of flour. The more expensive brand of flour costs <fact1>$4 per pound</fact1> * (1 + <fact2>25%</fact2>) = $4 * 1.25 = $5 per pound.

Xavier also decides to buy himself a cookie for <fact6>₺4</fact6>. How much does Xavier have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺10</fact1> + (<fact2>20%</fact2> of <fact1>₺10</fact1>) = ₺10 + ₺2 = ₺12 per pound.

Xavier uses <fact3>3 pounds of tea per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 3 pounds/day * 7 days = 21 pounds of tea.

The store has a <fact4>10% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Xavier will get a discount on the first 10 pounds of tea. The discount is <fact4>10%</fact4> of ₺12 * 10 = ₺12, which is ₺1.2 per pound. So, the cost of the first 10 pounds of tea is ₺12 * 10 - ₺1.2 * 10 = ₺108.

The remaining 11 pounds of tea will be sold at the regular price of ₺12 per pound, so the cost is ₺12 * 11 = ₺132.

The total cost of the tea is ₺108 + ₺132 = ₺240.

Leon also decides to buy himself a cookie for <fact6>¥2</fact6>. How much does Leon have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥5</fact1> + (<fact1>¥5</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = ¥7 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of flour Leon needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 pounds of flour per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of flour, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of flour.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 pounds</fact5>, so Leon can get a discount on 20 pounds of flour. The cost of 20 pounds of flour at the discounted price is 20 * ¥7 * (1 - <fact4>0.5</fact4>) = 20 * ¥7 * 0.5 = ¥70.

For the remaining 1 pound of flour, Leon needs to pay the regular price, which is ¥7 per pound. So, the cost of the remaining flour is 1 * ¥7 = ¥7.

Finally, Leon also buys a cookie for <fact6>¥2</fact6>. Therefore, the total amount Leon needs to pay is ¥70 + ¥7 + ¥2 = ¥79.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>€5</fact1> + (<fact2>20%</fact2> of <fact1>€5</fact1>) = €5 + €1 = €6 per kg.

Sanjay uses <fact3>2 kgs of rice per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of rice, so he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of rice.

The store has a <fact4>40% discount on rice</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Sanjay will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The discount is <fact4>40%</fact4> of €6 per kg * 10 kgs = €24. The cost of the first 10 kgs is €6 per kg * 10 kgs - €24 = €36.

The remaining 4 kgs (14 kgs - 10 kgs) will be sold at the regular price of €6 per kg, so the cost is €6 per kg * 4 kgs = €24.

Alejandro uses <fact3>3 kgs of sugar per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>45% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Alejandro will get a discount on the first 20 kgs. The discount is ₺12/kg * <fact4>0.45</fact4> = ₺5.40 per kg.

Ravi uses <fact3>3 pounds of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of tea.

The store has a <fact4>35% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Ravi will get a discount on the first 10 pounds. The discount is <fact4>35%</fact4> of the cost of 10 pounds of tea, which is $20 * 10 * <fact4>0.35</fact4> = $70. The cost of the first 10 pounds of tea after the discount is $20 * 10 - $70 = $130.

Ravi needs 21 pounds of tea, but the discount only applies to the first 10 pounds. The remaining 11 pounds will be sold at the regular price of $20 per pound, so the cost is $20 * 11 = $220.

The store has a <fact5>30% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kilograms</fact5>. So, for the first 10 kilograms, the cost is €7 * 10 * (1 - <fact5>0.3</fact5>) = €49. For the remaining 11 kilograms, the cost is €7 * 11 = €77.

The total cost of the rice is €49 + €77 = €126. Adding the cost of the <fact6>muffin for €2</fact6>, the total amount Jin has to pay is €126 + €2 = €128.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>30% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥10</fact1> + (<fact1>¥10</fact1> * <fact2>0.3</fact2>) = ¥13 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Noah needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>2 pounds of sugar per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, he needs 2 * 7 = 14 pounds of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>40% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so the discounted price for the first 10 pounds is ¥13 * 0.6 = ¥7.8 per pound. The total cost for the first 10 pounds is ¥7.8 * 10 = ¥78.

For the remaining 4 pounds, the regular price of ¥13 per pound applies, so the total cost is ¥13 * 4 = ¥52.

Finally, Noah also buys a cookie for <fact6>¥1</fact6>, so the total amount he needs to pay is ¥78 + ¥52 + ¥1 = ¥131.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺4</fact1> + (<fact1>₺4</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ₺5 per kilogram.

Oliver uses <fact3>2 kilograms of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 2 * 7 = 14 kilograms of tea.

The store has a <fact4>30% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5>, so Oliver will get a discount on the first 10 kilograms. The discount is <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5> * <fact4>0.3</fact4> * ₺5 = ₺15.

The cost of the first 10 kilograms of tea after the discount is <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5> * ₺5 - ₺15 = ₺35.

The remaining 4 kilograms of tea will be sold at the regular price, which is 4 * ₺5 = ₺20.

The total cost of the tea is ₺35 + ₺20 = ₺55.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>10% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥10</fact1> + (<fact1>¥10</fact1> * <fact2>0.10</fact2>) = ¥11 per pound.

Oscar uses <fact3>2 pounds of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 2 * 7 = 14 pounds of tea.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Oscar will get a discount on the first 10 pounds. The discounted price for the first 10 pounds is ¥11 * <fact5>10</fact5> * (1 - <fact4>0.50</fact4>) = ¥55.

For the remaining 4 pounds, Oscar will pay the regular price of ¥11 per pound, which is ¥11 * 4 = ¥44.

He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar and he uses <fact3>2 kgs of sugar per day</fact3>.

Alejandro also decides to buy himself a <fact6>bagel for $3</fact6>. How much does Alejandro have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>$10</fact1> + (<fact1>$10</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = $12 per kg.

Alejandro uses <fact3>2 kgs of sugar per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, so he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>35% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Alejandro will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The discount is <fact4>35%</fact4> of the cost of 10 kgs, which is $12/kg * 10 kgs = $120. The discount is $120 * <fact4>0.35</fact4> = $42.

So, the cost of the first 10 kgs is $120 - $42 = $78.

Alejandro needs 14 kgs of sugar, but the discount only applies to the first 10 kgs. The remaining 4 kgs will be sold at the regular price of $12/kg, so the cost is 4 kgs * $12/kg = $48.

The total cost of the sugar is $78 + $48 = $126.

Finally, Alejandro also buys a <fact6>bagel for $3</fact6>, so the total amount he has to pay is $126 + $3 = $129.

Gabriel also decides to buy himself a muffin for <fact6>₣4</fact6>. How much does Gabriel have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣5</fact1> + (<fact1>₣5</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = ₣7 per kilogram.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Gabriel needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 kilograms of sugar per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of sugar.

Since the store has a <fact4>5% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, Gabriel can get a discount on 20 kilograms of sugar. The discount amount is (<fact5>20</fact5> * ₣7) * <fact4>0.05</fact4> = ₣7.

The total cost of the sugar is (20 * ₣7) - ₣7 = ₣133 for the first 20 kilograms, and 1 * ₣7 = ₣7 for the additional kilogram. So, the total cost of the sugar is ₣133 + ₣7 = ₣140.

Finally, we add the cost of the muffin, which is <fact6>₣4</fact6>. Therefore, the total amount Gabriel has to pay is ₣140 + ₣4 = ₣144.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥4</fact1> + (<fact1>¥4</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ¥5 per pound.

Ravi uses <fact3>3 pounds of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of flour.

The store has a <fact4>15% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 pounds</fact5>, so Ravi will get a discount on the first 20 pounds. The discount is ¥5 * <fact4>0.15</fact4> = ¥0.75 per pound, so the discounted price is ¥5 - ¥0.75 = ¥4.25 per pound for the first 20 pounds.

Ravi will pay ¥4.25 * 20 = ¥85 for the first 20 pounds and ¥5 * 1 = ¥5 for the additional 1 pound.

Finally, Ravi also buys a cookie for <fact6>¥4</fact6>, so the total cost is ¥85 + ¥5 + ¥4 = ¥94.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣10</fact1> + (<fact1>₣10</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = ₣14 per kg.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Andre needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>2 kgs of sugar per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>20% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Andre will get a discount on the first 10 kgs of sugar. The discounted price for the first 10 kgs is ₣14/kg * 10 kgs * (1 - <fact4>0.2</fact4>) = ₣112.

For the remaining 4 kgs of sugar, Andre will have to pay the regular price of ₣14/kg, which is ₣14/kg * 4 kgs = ₣56.

Finally, Andre also buys a bagel for <fact6>₣2</fact6>, so the total amount he has to pay is ₣112 + ₣56 + <fact6>₣2</fact6> = ₣170.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>$12</fact1> + (<fact1>$12</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = $15 per kilogram.

Arjun uses <fact3>3 kilograms of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of flour.

The store has a <fact4>25% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, so Arjun will get a discount on the first 20 kilograms. The discount is <fact4>25%</fact4> of the cost of 20 kilograms, which is 20 * $15 * <fact4>0.25</fact4> = $75. The cost of the first 20 kilograms after the discount is 20 * $15 - $75 = $225.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it costs <fact2>30% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost per pound is <fact1>$10</fact1> + (<fact1>$10</fact1> * <fact2>0.3</fact2>) = $13 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of rice Noah needs to buy for a week. Since he uses <fact3>3 pounds of rice per day</fact3> and there are 7 days in a week, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of rice.

Since the store has a <fact4>30% discount on rice</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, Noah will get a discount on the first 10 pounds of rice. The cost of the first 10 pounds is 10 * $13 = $130. With the <fact4>30% discount</fact4>, the cost becomes $130 - ($130 * <fact4>0.3</fact4>) = $91.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺8</fact1> + (<fact1>₺8</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ₺10 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of flour James needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 pounds of flour per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of flour, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of flour.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so James will get a discount on the first 10 pounds of flour. The cost of the first 10 pounds is 10 * ₺10 = ₺100, but with the <fact4>50% discount</fact4>, James will pay ₺100 * 0.5 = ₺50 for the first 10 pounds.

For the remaining 11 pounds of flour (21 - 10 = 11), James will pay the regular price of ₺10 per pound, which is 11 * ₺10 = ₺110.

Finally, James also buys a cookie for <fact6>₺3</fact6>, so the total amount he needs to pay is ₺50 + ₺110 + ₺3 = ₺163.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>10% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺10</fact1> + (<fact1>₺10</fact1> * <fact2>0.10</fact2>) = ₺11 per kg.

Tariq uses <fact3>3 kgs of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of flour.

The store has a <fact4>10% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Tariq will get a discount on the first 20 kgs. The discount is <fact4>10%</fact4> of the cost of 20 kgs, which is ₺11/kg * 20 kgs = ₺220. The discount is ₺220 * <fact4>0.10</fact4> = ₺22.

The cost of the first 20 kgs of flour after the discount is ₺220 - ₺22 = ₺198. The cost of the additional 1 kg of flour is ₺11.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥5</fact1> + (<fact1>¥5</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ¥6 per kilogram.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of rice Qasim needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 kilograms of rice per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of rice, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of rice.

The store has a <fact4>25% discount on rice</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5>, so Qasim will get a discount on the first 10 kilograms. The cost of the first 10 kilograms is ¥6 * 10 = ¥60, and with the <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, the cost is ¥60 - (¥60 * 0.25) = ¥45.

The remaining 11 kilograms of rice will be sold at the regular price of ¥6 per kilogram, so the cost is ¥6 * 11 = ¥66.

The total cost of the rice is ¥45 + ¥66 = ¥111. Adding the cost of the muffin, <fact6>¥3</fact6>, the total amount Qasim has to pay is ¥111 + ¥3 = ¥114.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥15</fact1> + (<fact1>¥15</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ¥18 per kg.

Tariq uses <fact3>3 kgs of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of flour.

The store has a <fact4>15% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Tariq will get a discount on the first 20 kgs. The discount is ¥18/kg * <fact4>0.15</fact4> = ¥2.70 per kg. The cost of the first 20 kgs is ¥18/kg - ¥2.70/kg = ¥15.30 per kg.

The total cost of the first 20 kgs is ¥15.30/kg * 20 kgs = ¥306.

The remaining 1 kg (21 kgs - 20 kgs) will be sold at the regular price of ¥18 per kg.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>€10</fact1> + (<fact1>€10</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = €12 per pound.

Yusuf uses <fact3>3 pounds of sugar per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>45% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Yusuf will get a discount on the first 10 pounds. The discount is <fact4>45%</fact4> of €12 * 10 = €120, which is €54. So, the cost of the first 10 pounds is €120 - €54 = €66.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣5</fact1> + (<fact1>₣5</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ₣6 per kg.

Deshawn uses <fact3>2 kgs of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of tea.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Deshawn will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The discounted price is ₣6 per kg * (1 - <fact4>0.50</fact4>) = ₣3 per kg. For the first 10 kgs, Deshawn will pay ₣3 per kg * 10 kgs = ₣30.

For the remaining 4 kgs (14 kgs - 10 kgs), Deshawn will pay the regular price of ₣6 per kg, which is ₣6 per kg * 4 kgs = ₣24.

What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of caterpillars. Since there are <fact1>2/5 as many caterpillars as bees</fact1> and <fact5>15 bees</fact5>, there are (2/5) * <fact5>15</fact5> = 6 caterpillars. 
Then, we can find the total number of rabbits. Since there are <fact2>42 white animals</fact2> and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, there are <fact2>42</fact2> / 2 = 21 rabbits.

What percentage of animals in the garden were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of wasps in the garden. Since there are <fact1>three-sixths as many wasps as bees</fact1> and <fact5>6 bees</fact5>, we can find the number of wasps as <fact1>three-sixths</fact1> * <fact5>6</fact5> = 3 wasps.

Next, we can find the total number of rabbits. Since there are <fact2>26 white animals</fact2> and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, we can find the number of rabbits as <fact2>26</fact2> / 2 = 13 rabbits.

We also know that there are <fact2>70 white animals</fact2>, <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so there are 70 / 2 = 35 rabbits. Additionally, there are <fact4>15 caterpillars</fact4>. Therefore, the total number of animals in the garden is 18 + 72 + 70 + 15 = 175.

Now, we can find the percentage of animals that are rabbits. There are 35 rabbits out of a total of 175 animals, so the percentage of rabbits is (35 / 175) * 100 = 20%.

Nia then found <fact2>28 white animals</fact2>, <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>. In addition, she saw <fact4>22 wasps</fact4>, and <fact5>16 grasshoppers</fact5>. What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of bees. Since there are <fact1>one-fourth as many bees as grasshoppers</fact1> and there are <fact5>16 grasshoppers</fact5>, the number of bees is <fact5>16</fact5>/<fact1>4</fact1> = 4 bees. 
The total number of animals is the sum of the number of bees, wasps, grasshoppers, and white animals. So, the total number of animals is 4 bees + <fact4>22 wasps</fact4> + <fact5>16 grasshoppers</fact5> + <fact2>28 white animals</fact2> = 70 animals.
Since <fact3>half of the 28 white animals were rabbits</fact3>, the number of rabbits is <fact2>28</fact2>/<fact3>2</fact3> = 14 rabbits.
The percentage of animals that are rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100. So, the percentage of rabbits is (14/70) * 100 = 20%.

What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of animals in the plot. We know that there are <fact5>15 ladybugs</fact5> and <fact1>3/5 as many ants as ladybugs</fact1>, so the number of ants is 3/5 * <fact5>15</fact5> = 9 ants. We also know that there are <fact4>24 bees</fact4> and <fact2>52 white animals</fact2>, <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so the number of rabbits is <fact2>52</fact2> / 2 = 26 rabbits. The other half of the white animals are not rabbits, so there are also 26 other white animals. Therefore, the total number of animals in the plot is 9 ants + <fact5>15 ladybugs</fact5> + <fact4>24 bees</fact4> + 26 rabbits + 26 other white animals = 100 animals. The percentage of animals that are rabbits is then 26 rabbits / 100 animals = 0.26 or 26%.

What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of wasps in the plot. Since there are <fact1>one-sixth as many wasps as caterpillars</fact1> and there are <fact5>24 caterpillars</fact5>, we can calculate the number of wasps as <fact5>24</fact5> / 6 = 4 wasps.

Next, we need to find the total number of rabbits in the plot. We know that there are <fact2>44 white animals</fact2> and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so the number of rabbits is <fact2>44</fact2> / 2 = 22 rabbits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the plot by adding the number of wasps, caterpillars, beetles, and white animals (which include rabbits and non-rabbits). The total number of animals is 4 wasps + <fact5>24 caterpillars</fact5> + <fact4>28 beetles</fact4> + <fact2>44 white animals</fact2> = 100 animals.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits by dividing the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiplying by 100. The percentage of rabbits is (22 rabbits / 100 animals) * 100 = 22%.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of animals in the plot. We know that there are <fact5>16 ladybugs</fact5> and <fact1>one-fourth as many ants as ladybugs</fact1>, so there are <fact5>16</fact5>/4 = 4 ants. We also know that there are <fact2>40 white animals</fact2>, <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so there are <fact2>40</fact2>/2 = 20 rabbits and 20 other white animals. Additionally, there are <fact4>40 caterpillars</fact4>. Therefore, the total number of animals in the plot is 16 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 40 = 100.

To find the percentage of animals that are rabbits, we divide the number of rabbits (20) by the total number of animals (100) and multiply by 100. This gives us (20/100) x 100 = 20%.

Then, we can find the total number of animals in the patch by adding the number of wasps, beetles, white animals, and caterpillars. 
There are <fact2>64 white animals</fact2> and <fact4>28 caterpillars</fact4>, so the total number of animals is 24 wasps + <fact5>12 beetles</fact5> + <fact2>64 white animals</fact2> + <fact4>28 caterpillars</fact4> = 128 animals. 
Since <fact3>half of the 64 white animals were rabbits</fact3>, there are <fact2>64</fact2> / 2 = 32 rabbits. 
To find the percentage of animals that are rabbits, we divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100. 
So, the percentage of rabbits is (32 / 128) * 100 = 25%.

So, the number of boys is <fact1>9 girls</fact1> * <fact2>1/3</fact2> = 3 boys. The total number of kids is <fact1>9 girls</fact1> + 3 boys = 12 kids. Now, we can find the percentage of girls by dividing the number of girls by the total number of kids and multiplying by 100. So, the percentage of girls is (<fact1>9 girls</fact1> / 12 kids) * 100 = 75%.

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many seats are available for the graduates' friends and family. We do this by subtracting the number of seats already reserved from the total number of seats in the arena. So, we have <fact1>6700 people</fact1> - <fact2>1250 seats for graduate</fact2> - <fact3>350 seats for the faculty attending</fact3> - <fact4>100 seats for the event's staff</fact4> = 5000 seats available for friends and family.

Since there are <fact2>1250 seats for graduate</fact2>, we can assume that there are 1250 graduates. So, each graduate will receive 5000 / 1250 = 4 tickets.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many seats are available for friends and family. The total number of seats is <fact1>6000 people</fact1>, but some seats are already reserved for graduates, faculty, and staff. The number of reserved seats is <fact2>700 seats for graduate</fact2> + <fact3>300 seats for the faculty attending</fact3> + <fact4>100 seats for the event's staff</fact4> = 1100 seats.

Since there are <fact2>700 seats for graduate</fact2>, we can assume there are 700 graduates. If the tickets are split equally, each graduate will receive 4900 seats / 700 graduates = 7 tickets.

Qasim finds <fact6>half as many as Tariq</fact6>, and Noah finds <fact7>two dozen eggs more than Luis and Mateo combined</fact7>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many eggs were initially hidden in the yard. Since Beatriz had <fact1>8 dozen eggs</fact1> and ate <fact2>3 eggs for breakfast</fact2>, she hid 8 * 12 - 3 = 93 eggs in the yard. 

Mateo found <fact3>3 eggs</fact3>. Luis found <fact4>six times as many as Mateo</fact4>, which is 6 * <fact3>3</fact3> = 18 eggs. 

Tariq found <fact5>2 less than Luis</fact5>, which is 18 - 2 = 16 eggs. 

Qasim found <fact6>half as many as Tariq</fact6>, which is 16 / 2 = 8 eggs. 

The total number of eggs found by Mateo and Luis is 3 + 18 = 21 eggs. 

Noah found <fact7>two dozen eggs more than Luis and Mateo combined</fact7>, which is 2 * 12 + 21 = 45 eggs.

The total number of eggs found is 3 + 18 + 16 + 8 + 45 = 90 eggs.

How many waffles are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many waffles Diego had initially. Since <fact1>8 dozen waffles</fact1> is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 waffles and he ate <fact2>2 waffles for breakfast</fact2>, he hid 96 - 2 = 94 waffles in the yard.

<fact3>Roya finds 7 waffles</fact3>, <fact4>Yusuf finds twice as many as Roya</fact4> which is 7 * 2 = 14 waffles, and <fact5>Priya finds 2 less than Yusuf</fact5> which is 14 - 2 = 12 waffles. 

<fact6>Keisha finds 1/3 as many as Priya</fact6> which is 12 / 3 = 4 waffles.

The total number of waffles found by Roya and Yusuf is 7 + 14 = 21 waffles. Since <fact7>Ava finds two dozen waffles more than Yusuf and Roya combined</fact7>, Ava finds 21 + 24 = 45 waffles.

The total number of waffles found is 7 + 14 + 12 + 4 + 45 = 82 waffles.

Now, let's calculate how many eggs each person found:
- <fact3>Priya found 3 eggs</fact3>.
- <fact4>Oscar found 9 times as many as Priya</fact4>, so Oscar found 9 * 3 = 27 eggs.
- <fact5>Thiago found 3 less than Oscar</fact5>, so Thiago found 27 - 3 = 24 eggs.
- <fact6>Daphne found 1/8 as many as Thiago</fact6>, so Daphne found 24 / 8 = 3 eggs.
- The total number of eggs found by Oscar and Priya is 27 + 3 = 30 eggs. <fact7>Quinn found two dozen eggs more than Oscar and Priya combined</fact7>, so Quinn found 30 + 24 = 54 eggs.

Answer: First, we need to determine how many eggs Oscar hid in the yard. Since Oscar initially had <fact1>10 dozen eggs</fact1> and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he had <fact1>10</fact1> * 12 = 120 eggs. After eating <fact2>5 eggs for breakfast</fact2>, he had 120 - <fact2>5</fact2> = 115 eggs left to hide.

Sanjay finds <fact7>two dozen eggs more than Ava and Viktor combined</fact7>. Ava and Viktor combined found 12 + <fact3>4</fact3> = 16 eggs. Two dozen eggs is 2 * 12 = 24 eggs. So Sanjay finds 16 + 24 = 40 eggs.

The total number of eggs found by all the children is 28 + 40 = 68 eggs.

How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to convert the initial number of cookies from dozens to individual cookies. Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, Elena initially had <fact1>9 dozen cookies</fact1> * 12 cookies/dozen = 108 cookies. After eating <fact2>5 cookies</fact2> for breakfast, she had 108 - 5 = 103 cookies left to hide in the yard.

Now, let's calculate the number of cookies found by each person:
- <fact3>James finds 6 cookies</fact3>.
- <fact4>Roya finds twice as many as James</fact4>, so Roya finds 2 * 6 = 12 cookies.
- <fact5>Kai finds 3 less than Roya</fact5>, so Kai finds 12 - 3 = 9 cookies.
- <fact6>Ali finds a third as many as Kai</fact6>, so Ali finds 9 / 3 = 3 cookies.
- To calculate the number of cookies found by Valentina, we first need to find the total number of cookies found by Roya and James combined: 12 (Roya) + 6 (James) = 18 cookies. Since <fact7>Valentina finds three dozen cookies more than Roya and James combined</fact7>, Valentina finds 18 + 3 * 12 = 18 + 36 = 54 cookies.

Now, let's add up the total number of cookies found by everyone: 6 (James) + 12 (Roya) + 9 (Kai) + 3 (Ali) + 54 (Valentina) = 84 cookies.

Finally, we subtract the total number of cookies found from the initial number of cookies hidden in the yard: 103 - 84 = 19 cookies.

How many cookies are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies were initially hidden in the yard. Tara had <fact1>10 dozen cookies</fact1>, which is 10 * 12 = 120 cookies. After eating <fact2>4 cookies for breakfast</fact2>, she had 120 - 4 = 116 cookies left to hide.

Now, let's calculate how many cookies each person found. <fact3>Qasim found 3 cookies</fact3>. <fact4>Rania found thrice as many as Qasim</fact4>, which is 3 * 3 = 9 cookies. <fact5>Yusuf found 2 less than Rania</fact5>, which is 9 - 2 = 7 cookies. <fact6>Liam found 1/7 as many as Yusuf</fact6>, which is 7 / 7 = 1 cookie. 

To find out how many cookies <fact7>Camila found</fact7>, we need to calculate how many cookies Rania and Qasim found combined, which is 3 + 9 = 12 cookies. Camila found two dozen cookies more than that, which is 12 + 24 = 36 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies that were found: 3 + 9 + 7 + 1 + 36 = 56 cookies.

To find out how many cookies are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of cookies found from the total number of cookies hidden: 116 - 56 = 60 cookies.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs were hidden in the yard. Uma initially had <fact1>8 dozen eggs</fact1>, which is 8 * 12 = 96 eggs. After eating <fact2>4 eggs for breakfast</fact2>, she had 96 - 4 = 92 eggs left to hide.

Now, let's calculate how many eggs each person found. <fact3>Xavier finds 4 eggs</fact3>. <fact4>Zahra finds two times as many as Xavier</fact4>, so she found 2 * 4 = 8 eggs. <fact5>Viktor finds 1 less than Zahra</fact5>, so he found 8 - 1 = 7 eggs. <fact6>Gabriel finds 1/7 as many as Viktor</fact6>, so he found 7 / 7 = 1 egg. 

The total number of eggs found by Xavier, Zahra, Viktor, and Gabriel is 4 + 8 + 7 + 1 = 20 eggs.

<fact7>Qasim finds three dozen eggs more than Zahra and Xavier combined</fact7>. Since Zahra and Xavier found 8 + 4 = 12 eggs, Qasim found 3 * 12 + 12 = 48 eggs.

Now, we add up all the eggs found: 20 + 48 = 68 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 92 - 68 = 24 eggs.

How many waffles are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many waffles Priya had initially. Since <fact1>11 dozen waffles</fact1> is given, we convert it to the number of waffles. 1 dozen = 12 waffles, so <fact1>11 dozen waffles</fact1> = 11 * 12 = 132 waffles.

After eating <fact2>4 waffles for breakfast</fact2>, Priya has 132 - 4 = 128 waffles left.

Now, let's calculate how many waffles each person found:
- <fact3>Pavel finds 10 waffles</fact3>.
- <fact4>Olivia finds two times as many as Pavel</fact4>, so Olivia finds 2 * 10 = 20 waffles.
- <fact5>Mia finds 4 less than Olivia</fact5>, so Mia finds 20 - 4 = 16 waffles.

- <fact7>Arjun finds two dozen waffles more than Olivia and Pavel combined</fact7>. Olivia and Pavel combined found 20 + 10 = 30 waffles. Two dozen waffles is 2 * 12 = 24 waffles. So, Arjun finds 30 + 24 = 54 waffles.

The total number of waffles found is 10 + 20 + 16 + 8 + 54 = 108 waffles.

To find out how many waffles are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of waffles found from the number of waffles Priya had left after eating breakfast: 128 - 108 = 20 waffles.

Mei finds <fact6>1/5 as many as Nia</fact6>, and Ava finds <fact7>two dozen pancakes more than Olivia and Winnie combined</fact7>. How many pancakes are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pancakes were initially hidden in the yard. Since Mia had <fact1>9 dozen pancakes</fact1> and ate <fact2>5 pancakes for breakfast</fact2>, she hid 9 * 12 - 5 = 103 pancakes in the yard. Now, let's calculate how many pancakes each person found. Winnie found <fact3>4 pancakes</fact3>. Olivia found <fact4>two times as many as Winnie</fact4>, so she found 2 * 4 = 8 pancakes. Nia found <fact5>3 less than Olivia</fact5>, so she found 8 - 3 = 5 pancakes. Mei found <fact6>1/5 as many as Nia</fact6>, so she found 5 / 5 = 1 pancake. Ava found <fact7>two dozen pancakes more than Olivia and Winnie combined</fact7>, so she found 2 * 12 + 4 + 8 = 36 pancakes. Now, let's add up all the pancakes that were found: 4 + 8 + 5 + 1 + 36 = 54 pancakes. To find out how many pancakes are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the number of pancakes found from the total number of pancakes hidden: 103 - 54 = 49 pancakes.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute <fact3>160 carrots</fact3> if it takes <fact4>18 seconds to wash each carrot</fact4> before peeling it? Note that Nadia can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>6-minute break after peeling the carrots</fact5> before she can start sautéing them.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes to wash the carrots. There are <fact3>160 carrots</fact3> and it takes <fact4>18 seconds to wash each carrot</fact4>. So, the total time to wash the carrots is <fact3>160 carrots</fact3> * <fact4>18 seconds per carrot</fact4> = 2880 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 2880 / 60 = 48 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to peel the carrots. Nadia can <fact1>peel 4 carrots a minute</fact1>, so the time it takes to peel <fact3>160 carrots</fact3> is <fact3>160 carrots</fact3> / <fact1>4 carrots per minute</fact1> = 40 minutes.

After peeling the carrots, Nadia needs to take a <fact5>6-minute break</fact5>. 

Then, let's calculate the time it takes to saute the carrots. Nadia can <fact2>saute 20 carrots in 11 minutes</fact2>, so the time it takes to saute <fact3>160 carrots</fact3> is <fact3>160 carrots</fact3> / <fact2>20 carrots per 11 minutes</fact2> = (160 / 20) * 11 = 88 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes Nadia to peel and saute the carrots is 48 minutes (washing) + 40 minutes (peeling) + 6 minutes (break) + 88 minutes (sauteing) = 182 minutes.

Note that Keisha can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>9-minute break</fact5> after peeling the shrimps before she can start sautéing them.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes to wash the shrimps. There are <fact3>150 shrimps</fact3> and it takes <fact4>24 seconds to wash each shrimp</fact4>. So, the total time spent washing the shrimps is <fact3>150</fact3> * <fact4>24</fact4> seconds = 3600 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the time spent washing the shrimps is 3600 / 60 = 60 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to peel the shrimps. Keisha can <fact1>peel 5 shrimps a minute</fact1>, so the time it takes to peel <fact3>150 shrimps</fact3> is <fact3>150</fact3> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 30 minutes.

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute <fact3>90 zucchinis</fact3> if it takes <fact4>20 seconds to wash each zucchini</fact4> before peeling it? Note that Elena can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>6-minute break</fact5> after peeling the zucchinis before she can start sautéing them.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the time it takes to wash the zucchinis. Since it takes <fact4>20 seconds to wash each zucchini</fact4>, and there are <fact3>90 zucchinis</fact3>, the total washing time is <fact3>90</fact3> * <fact4>20 seconds</fact4> = 1800 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 1800 / 60 = 30 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to peel the zucchinis. Since Elena can <fact1>peel 10 zucchinis a minute</fact1>, and there are <fact3>90 zucchinis</fact3>, the total peeling time is <fact3>90</fact3> / <fact1>10</fact1> = 9 minutes.

After peeling, Elena needs to take a <fact5>6-minute break</fact5> before sautéing. 

Finally, we calculate the time it takes to sauté the zucchinis. Since Elena can <fact2>saute 30 zucchinis in 13 minutes</fact2>, and there are <fact3>90 zucchinis</fact3>, the total sautéing time is (<fact3>90</fact3> / <fact2>30</fact2>) * <fact2>13 minutes</fact2> = 39 minutes.

Adding up the washing, peeling, break, and sautéing times, we get 30 + 9 + 6 + 39 = 84 minutes.

Since there are <fact3>180 zucchinis</fact3> and it takes <fact4>21 seconds to wash each zucchini</fact4>, the total washing time is <fact3>180</fact3> * <fact4>21</fact4> seconds = 3780 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 3780 / 60 = 63 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to peel the zucchinis. Since Camila can <fact1>peel 4 zucchinis a minute</fact1>, the total peeling time for <fact3>180 zucchinis</fact3> is <fact3>180</fact3> / <fact1>4</fact1> = 45 minutes.

After peeling, Camila needs to take a <fact5>11-minute break</fact5> before sautéing. 

Finally, let's calculate the time it takes to saute the zucchinis. Since Camila can <fact2>saute 20 zucchinis in 19 minutes</fact2>, the total sautéing time for <fact3>180 zucchinis</fact3> is (<fact3>180</fact3> / <fact2>20</fact2>) * 19 = 171 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes Camila to peel and saute <fact3>180 zucchinis</fact3> is 63 minutes (washing) + 45 minutes (peeling) + <fact5>11 minutes</fact5> (break) + 171 minutes (sauteing) = 290 minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the time it takes to saute the carrots. Valeria can <fact2>saute 30 carrots in 7 minutes</fact2>, so the time it takes to saute <fact3>180 carrots</fact3> is <fact3>180 carrots</fact3> / <fact2>30 carrots per 7 minutes</fact2> = (180 / 30) * 7 = 42 minutes.

Adding up all the times, we get 36 minutes (washing) + 20 minutes (peeling) + 14 minutes (break) + 42 minutes (sauteing) = 112 minutes.

Answer: The first 6 apartment complexes have a total of <fact2>100 apartments each</fact2> * 6 = 600 apartments. The last apartment complex is <fact3>35% bigger than the other 6 combined</fact3>, so it has 600 * 0.35 = 210 more apartments than the other 6 combined. Therefore, the last apartment complex has 600 + 210 = 810 apartments.

However, <fact4>10 apartments from each of the first 6 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service</fact4>, so the total number of apartments that require collection service is 600 - 10 * 6 = 540 apartments from the first 6 complexes, and 810 apartments from the last complex.

He gets paid <fact6>₣0.5 per collection for each apartment</fact6>, so he earns a total of 2560 * 0.5 = ₣1280 per week.

He also earns an additional <fact7>10% in tips</fact7>, so he earns an additional ₣1280 * 0.1 = ₣128 per week.

Therefore, the total amount of money Luis makes in a week is ₣1280 + ₣128 = ₣1408.

The last complex is <fact3>50% bigger than the other 5 combined</fact3>, so it has 500 * 1.5 = 750 apartments. However, <fact4>8 apartments from each of the first 5 complexes were vacant</fact4>, so the total number of apartments that require collection service is 500 - 8 * 5 = 460 + 750 = 1210 apartments. Esteban collects garbage <fact5>2 times a week from each place</fact5>, so he makes <fact6>¥0.5 per collection for each apartment</fact6> * 2 * 1210 = ¥1210 per week. He also earns an <fact7>additional 10% in tips</fact7>, so his total weekly earnings are ¥1210 * 1.1 = ¥1331.

Answer: The first two apartment complexes have a total of <fact1>100 + 100 = 200 apartments</fact1>.

Answer: The first 5 apartment complexes have a total of <fact2>100 apartments</fact2> * 5 = 500 apartments. The last apartment complex is <fact3>80% bigger than the other 5 combined</fact3>, so it has 500 * 0.8 = 400 more apartments than the other 5 combined.

Answer: The first two apartment complexes have a total of <fact1>200</fact1> + <fact1>200</fact1> = 400 apartments. The last complex is <fact2>35% bigger than the other 2 combined</fact2>, so it has 400 * 0.35 = 140 more apartments than the first two combined.

However, <fact3>6 apartments from each of the first 2 complexes were vacant</fact3>, so the total number of apartments that require collection service is 400 - 12 = 388 apartments from the first two complexes, and 540 apartments from the last complex.
