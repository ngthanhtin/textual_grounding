4,"Reformatted Question: Benjamin is popping popcorn for a snack. As the skillet of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. <fact1>80 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking</fact1>, then <fact2>3 times that amount in the next 10 seconds</fact2>. The kernels increase to <fact3>6 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds</fact3>, but in the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 10 seconds</fact4>. After Benjamin takes the skillet off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>. How many pieces of popcorn does Benjamin have to eat?

Answer: In the first 10 seconds, <fact1>80 kernels pop</fact1>.  In the next 10 seconds, <fact2>3 times that amount</fact2>, or 3 * 80 = 240 kernels pop.  Over the following 10 seconds, <fact3>6 times the initial popping rate</fact3> means 6 * 80 = 480 kernels pop. In the final 10 seconds, the popping rate is <fact4>half the rate of the previous 10 seconds</fact4>, so 480 / 2 = 240 kernels pop. After the heat is removed, <fact5>a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds also pop</fact5>, which is 240 / 4 = 60 kernels.

To find the total number of popcorn kernels, we add the number of kernels from each 10-second interval and the residual kernels: 80 + 240 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1100.  Therefore, Benjamin has 1100 pieces of popcorn to eat. The answer is {1100}.

The kernels increase to <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate in the next 12 seconds</fact3>, but in the final 12 seconds, the popping slows down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 12 seconds</fact4>. After Valeria takes the pan off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 12 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>. How many pieces of popcorn does Valeria have to eat?

Answer: In the first 12 seconds, <fact1>30 kernels pop</fact1>.  In the next 12 seconds, <fact2>3 times that amount</fact2>, or 30 * 3 = 90 kernels pop.  Then, in the following 12 seconds, <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3> means 30 * 4 = 120 kernels pop.  In the final 12 seconds, the popping rate is <fact4>half the rate of the previous 12 seconds</fact4>, so 120 / 2 = 60 kernels pop. After the pan is removed, <fact5>a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 12 seconds also pop</fact5>, which is 60 / 4 = 15 kernels.

To find the total number of popcorn kernels, we add the number of kernels that popped in each 12-second interval and the additional kernels that popped from residual heat: 30 + 90 + 120 + 60 + 15 = 315.  Therefore, Valeria has 315 pieces of popcorn to eat.

The answer is {315}.

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Corn:** <fact1>6 boxes * 3 pounds/box = 18 pounds</fact1>
* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>13 bags * 9 pounds/bag = 117 pounds</fact2>
* **Apples:** <fact3>35 packs * 39 pounds/pack = 1365 pounds</fact3>
* **Wheat:** <fact4>20 sacks * 15 pounds/sack = 300 pounds</fact4>

Next, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 18 + 117 + 1365 + 300 = 1800 pounds

Finally, let's determine the number of trips needed, given that <fact5>the truck can carry 100 pounds at a time</fact5>: 1800 pounds / 100 pounds/trip = 18 trips.

* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>thirteen 5-pound bags</fact2> * 5 pounds/bag = 65 pounds
* **Apples:** <fact3>thirty-three 39-pound packs</fact3> * 39 pounds/pack = 1287 pounds
* **Wheat:** <fact4>nineteen 18-pound sacks</fact4> * 18 pounds/sack = 342 pounds

Next, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 56 pounds + 65 pounds + 1287 pounds + 342 pounds = 1750 pounds

Finally, let's determine the number of trips needed. Since <fact5>his farm truck can carry 250 pounds at a time</fact5>, the farmer needs 1750 pounds / 250 pounds/trip = 7 trips.

The answer is {7}.

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Corn:** <fact1>six 3-pound boxes</fact1>  = 6 boxes * 3 pounds/box = 18 pounds
* **Carrots:** <fact2>thirteen 6-pound bags</fact2> = 13 bags * 6 pounds/bag = 78 pounds
* **Wheats:** <fact3>thirty five 41-pound packs</fact3> = 35 packs * 41 pounds/pack = 1435 pounds
* **Oats:** <fact4>seventeen 17-pound sacks</fact4> = 17 sacks * 17 pounds/sack = 289 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 18 pounds + 78 pounds + 1435 pounds + 289 pounds = 1820 pounds

Since <fact5>the farm truck can carry 140 pounds at a time</fact5>, the number of trips needed is 1820 pounds / 140 pounds/trip = 13 trips.  The farmer needs to make 13 trips to transport all the feed.  Since we can't have a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the answer is {13}.

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Oats:** <fact1>7 boxes * 5 pounds/box = 35 pounds</fact1>
* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>13 bags * 5 pounds/bag = 65 pounds</fact2>
* **Corn:** <fact3>32 packs * 40 pounds/pack = 1280 pounds</fact3>
* **Apples:** <fact4>15 sacks * 16 pounds/sack = 240 pounds</fact4>

Next, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 35 + 65 + 1280 + 240 = 1620 pounds.

Finally, let's determine the number of trips needed.  Since <fact5>the truck carries 180 pounds per trip</fact5>, the farmer needs 1620 pounds / 180 pounds/trip = 9 trips.  Therefore, the farmer needs 9 trips to transport all the feed.

* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>thirteen 7-pound bags</fact2> = 13 bags * 7 pounds/bag = 91 pounds
* **Wheats:** <fact3>thirty-one 43-pound packs</fact3> = 31 packs * 43 pounds/pack = 1333 pounds
* **Corns:** <fact4>sixteen 15-pound sacks</fact4> = 16 sacks * 15 pounds/sack = 240 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 36 pounds + 91 pounds + 1333 pounds + 240 pounds = 1700 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry <fact5>170 pounds at a time</fact5>, the farmer needs 1700 pounds / 170 pounds/trip = 10 trips to transport all the feed.

Therefore, the farmer needs 10 trips.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Oats:** <fact1>four 4-pound boxes</fact1>  = 4 boxes * 4 pounds/box = 16 pounds
* **Beets:** <fact2>twelve 8-pound bags</fact2> = 12 bags * 8 pounds/bag = 96 pounds
* **Wheats:** <fact3>thirty-two 37-pound packs</fact3> = 32 packs * 37 pounds/pack = 1184 pounds
* **Hay:** <fact4>nineteen 16-pound sacks</fact4> = 19 sacks * 16 pounds/sack = 304 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 16 pounds + 96 pounds + 1184 pounds + 304 pounds = 1600 pounds

Since the farmer's truck can carry <fact5>200 pounds at a time</fact5>, the number of trips needed is 1600 pounds / 200 pounds/trip = 8 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs 8 trips to transport all the feed. The answer is {8}.

He buys <fact2>twelve 7-kg bags of cucumbers</fact2>. He buys <fact3>thirty-five 44-kg packs of hay</fact3>. He buys <fact4>sixteen 17-kg sacks of corns</fact4>.  His farm truck can carry <fact5>240 kgs at a time</fact5>. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Oats:** <fact1>8 boxes * 3 kg/box = 24 kg</fact1>
* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>12 bags * 7 kg/bag = 84 kg</fact2>
* **Hay:** <fact3>35 packs * 44 kg/pack = 1540 kg</fact3>
* **Corns:** <fact4>16 sacks * 17 kg/sack = 272 kg</fact4>

Next, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 24 kg + 84 kg + 1540 kg + 272 kg = 1920 kg

Finally, let's determine the number of trips needed. Since the truck can carry <fact5>240 kg at a time</fact5>, the farmer needs 1920 kg / 240 kg/trip = 8 trips.

She noticed that she was out of plastic plates, so she <fact2>bought a new package of plates</fact2>. Later, her husband also <fact3>bought a package of 11 new plates</fact3> and gave them to Nia. While Nia was making the <fact1>shrimp scampi</fact1>, she <fact4>used six of the plates to sample her shrimp scampi</fact4>. Later, when she went to set the table, she <fact5>had a total of 21 plates</fact5>. How many plates were in the package that <fact2>Nia bought</fact2>?

Answer:  After her husband gave her 11 plates (<fact3>bought a package of 11 new plates</fact3>), and after she used 6 for sampling (<fact4>used six of the plates to sample her shrimp scampi</fact4>), Nia had a total of 21 plates (<fact5>had a total of 21 plates</fact5>).  To find out how many plates she had *before* her husband gave her plates, we subtract those 11 plates: 21 - 11 = 10 plates.  Since she used 6 plates for sampling, we add those back in to find the number of plates in the original package she bought: 10 + 6 = 16 plates.  Therefore, there were 16 plates in the package that Nia bought (<fact2>bought a new package of plates</fact2>). The answer is {16}.

She noticed that she was out of plastic forks, so she bought a new package of forks. Later, her husband also bought a package of <fact1>14 new forks</fact1> and gave them to Fatima. While Fatima was making the beef stew, she used <fact2>six of the forks</fact2> to sample her beef stew. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact3>26 forks</fact3>. How many forks were in the package that Fatima bought?

Answer:  Let's denote the number of forks in the package Fatima bought as 'x'.

* **Husband's contribution:** Fatima's husband gave her <fact1>14 forks</fact1>.
* **Forks used:** Fatima used <fact2>six forks</fact2> while making the stew.
* **Total forks:**  After setting the table, Fatima had a total of <fact3>26 forks</fact3>.

To find the number of forks in the package Fatima initially bought, we can set up an equation:

x (forks from Fatima's package) + 14 (forks from husband's package) - 6 (forks used) = 26 (total forks)

Solving for x:

x + 14 - 6 = 26
x + 8 = 26
x = 26 - 8
x = 18

Therefore, there were 18 forks in the package that Fatima bought. The answer is {18}.
