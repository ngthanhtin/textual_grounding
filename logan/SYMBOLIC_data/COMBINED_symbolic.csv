47,"Reformatted Question: Yuki hid <fact1>5 dozen eggs</fact1> in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. <fact2>Gabriel finds 5 eggs</fact2>. <fact3>Sophia finds two times as many as Gabriel</fact3>. <fact4>Ali finds 4 less than Sophia</fact4>, and <fact5>Esteban finds a third as many as Ali</fact5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs were hidden in total. Since <fact1>5 dozen eggs</fact1> were hidden, and 1 dozen equals 12, then 5 x 12 = 60 eggs were hidden.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs each person found. We know that <fact2>Gabriel finds 5 eggs</fact2>. Since <fact3>Sophia finds two times as many as Gabriel</fact3>, then Sophia found 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Since <fact4>Ali finds 4 less than Sophia</fact4>, then Ali found 10 - 4 = 6 eggs.

Finally, since <fact5>Esteban finds a third as many as Ali</fact5>, then Esteban found 6 / 3 = 2 eggs.

Now, we can add up all the eggs that were found: 5 (Gabriel) + 10 (Sophia) + 6 (Ali) + 2 (Esteban) = 23 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 60 - 23 = 37 eggs.

31,"Reformatted Question: Amelia and Tara are currently <fact1>22 years apart in age</fact1>. If <fact2>Amelia, who is younger than Tara, is 37 years old</fact2>, what's the average of their ages?

Answer: Since <fact2>Amelia is 37 years old</fact2> and <fact1>22 years apart in age</fact1> from Tara, Tara must be 37 + <fact1>22</fact1> = 59 years old. To find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 37 + 59 = 96. Dividing by 2, we get 96 / 2 = 48. Therefore, the average of their ages is 48.

Answer: To peel 100 shrimps, it will take Ava <fact3>100 shrimps</fact3> / <fact1>10 shrimps per minute</fact1> = 10 minutes. To saute 100 shrimps, it will take Ava (<fact2>18 minutes</fact2> / <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2>) * <fact3>100 shrimps</fact3> = (18/20) * 100 = 90 minutes. So, the total time it will take Ava to peel and saute 100 shrimps is 10 + 90 = 100 minutes.

Due to the major accident, <fact3>35 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the medical center after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: The number of occupied wards initially is <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> * <fact2>1/10</fact2> = 160 wards. 
The number of unoccupied wards initially is <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> - 160 wards = 1440 wards.
There are <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> * 7 days/week = 28 days in 4 weeks.
The number of patients admitted in 4 weeks is <fact3>35 patients/day</fact3> * 28 days = 980 patients.
Assuming each patient occupies one ward, the number of occupied wards after 4 weeks is 160 wards + 980 wards = 1140 wards.
The number of unoccupied wards after 4 weeks is <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> - 1140 wards = 460 wards.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls there are. Since <fact2>an eighth of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, we can calculate the number of tennis balls by dividing the total number of balls by 8. So, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>960</fact1> / 8 = 120. 

Next, we need to find out how many of these tennis balls are indigo. Since <fact3>1/5 of the tennis balls are indigo</fact3>, we can calculate the number of indigo tennis balls by dividing the number of tennis balls by 5 and then multiplying by 1. So, the number of indigo tennis balls is 120 / 5 = 24.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of orange cards. Since there are <fact2>76% more orange cards</fact2> than yellow cards, we can calculate the number of orange cards by finding 76% of the number of yellow cards and adding it to the number of yellow cards. 76% of <fact1>25 yellow cards</fact1> is 0.76 * 25 = 19. So, there are 25 + 19 = 44 orange cards.

Now, we know that <fact3>green cards are as many as the sum of yellow and orange cards</fact3>. Therefore, the number of green cards is <fact1>25 yellow cards</fact1> + 44 orange cards = 69 green cards.

To find the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we add the number of yellow, orange, and green cards: <fact1>25 yellow cards</fact1> + 44 orange cards + 69 green cards = 138 cards.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many golf balls there are. Since <fact2>half of the balls are golf balls</fact2>, we can calculate the number of golf balls by dividing the total number of balls by 2. So, the number of golf balls is <fact1>680</fact1> / 2 = 340.

Next, we need to find out how many of these golf balls are green. Since <fact3>1/5 of the golf balls are green</fact3>, we can calculate the number of green golf balls by multiplying the number of golf balls by 1/5. So, the number of green golf balls is 340 * 1/5 = 68.

Answer: To find the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in one month, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls each person eats in a month and then add them together. 

Since there are approximately 30 days in <fact4>one month</fact4>, the father eats <fact1>7 sushi rolls per day</fact1> * 30 days = 210 sushi rolls per month. 

The wife eats <fact2>4 sushi rolls per day</fact2> * 30 days = 120 sushi rolls per month.

Answer: To find the perimeter of the room, we need to find the width of the room first. Since the area of the room is given as <fact1>810 square meters</fact1> and the area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width, we can set up the equation: <fact2>6 meters</fact2> * width = <fact1>810 square meters</fact1>.

If <fact2>the city is 85 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance covered in the given time and then multiply by the given time. The total distance across the city is <fact2>85 miles</fact2> and the distance covered in the given time is <fact1>5 miles</fact1>. So, the number of times the given distance fits into the total distance is <fact2>85</fact2>/<fact1>5</fact1> = 17. Now, we multiply this by the given time, which is <fact1>241 minutes</fact1>. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is 17 * <fact1>241 minutes</fact1> = 4100 minutes, but since 85 is not perfectly divisible by 5, we should calculate the remaining distance and add the time it takes to cover that distance.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d10 die</fact1> is 7/10, since there are 7 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100, since there are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an odd number twice in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: (7/10) - (25/100) = (70/100) - (25/100) = 45/100.

Answer: Let's denote the number of orange tiles as <fact2>7x</fact2>, where x is a positive integer. The total number of tiles in the stack is the sum of the green tiles, orange tiles, and black tiles. We can write an equation to represent this: <fact1>2</fact1> + <fact2>7x</fact2> + <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>46</fact4>. Since we don't know the number of black tiles, we can represent it as <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>46</fact4> - <fact1>2</fact1> - <fact2>7x</fact2>. We can simplify this expression to <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>44</fact4> - <fact2>7x</fact2>. Since the number of black tiles must be a non-negative integer, we can set up the inequality <fact4>44</fact4> - <fact2>7x</fact2> ≥ 0.

He buys <fact3>thirty-three 36-pound packs of wheats</fact3>. He buys <fact4>seventeen 16-pound sacks of oats</fact4>.  <fact5>His farm truck can carry 230 pounds at a time</fact5>. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Apples:** <fact1>eight 3-pound boxes</fact1> = 8 * 3 = 24 pounds
* **Cucumbers:** <fact2>fourteen 9-pound bags</fact2> = 14 * 9 = 126 pounds
* **Wheats:** <fact3>thirty-three 36-pound packs</fact3> = 33 * 36 = 1188 pounds
* **Oats:** <fact4>seventeen 16-pound sacks</fact4> = 17 * 16 = 272 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 24 + 126 + 1188 + 272 = 1610 pounds.

Since <fact5>his farm truck can carry 230 pounds at a time</fact5>, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to determine the number of trips: 1610 pounds / 230 pounds/trip = 7.0 trips.

Because we can't make a partial trip, the farmer needs to make a total of 8 trips to transport all the feed.

Therefore, the answer is {8}.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs were hidden in total. Since 5 dozen eggs were hidden, and 1 dozen equals 12, then 5 x 12 = 60 eggs were hidden.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs each person found. We know that Gabriel finds 5 eggs. Since Sophia finds two times as many as Gabriel, then Sophia found 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Since Ali finds 4 less than Sophia, then Ali found 10 - 4 = 6 eggs.

Finally, since Esteban finds a third as many as Ali, then Esteban found 6 / 3 = 2 eggs.

Now, we can add up all the eggs that were found: 5 (Gabriel) + 10 (Sophia) + 6 (Ali) + 2 (Esteban) = 23 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 60 - 23 = 37 eggs.

Answer: The number of occupied wards initially is 1600 wards * 1/10 = 160 wards. 
The number of unoccupied wards initially is 1600 wards - 160 wards = 1440 wards.
There are 4 weeks * 7 days/week = 28 days in 4 weeks.
The number of patients admitted in 4 weeks is 35 patients/day * 28 days = 980 patients.
Assuming each patient occupies one ward, the number of occupied wards after 4 weeks is 160 wards + 980 wards = 1140 wards.
The number of unoccupied wards after 4 weeks is 1600 wards - 1140 wards = 460 wards.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of orange cards. Since there are 76% more orange cards than yellow cards, we can calculate the number of orange cards by finding 76% of the number of yellow cards and adding it to the number of yellow cards. 76% of 25 yellow cards is 0.76 * 25 = 19. So, there are 25 + 19 = 44 orange cards.

Now, we know that green cards are as many as the sum of yellow and orange cards. Therefore, the number of green cards is 25 yellow cards + 44 orange cards = 69 green cards.

To find the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we add the number of yellow, orange, and green cards: 25 yellow cards + 44 orange cards + 69 green cards = 138 cards.

Answer: To find the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in one month, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls each person eats in a month and then add them together. 

Since there are approximately 30 days in one month, the father eats 7 sushi rolls per day * 30 days = 210 sushi rolls per month. 

The wife eats 4 sushi rolls per day * 30 days = 120 sushi rolls per month.

Answer: To find the perimeter of the room, we need to find the width of the room first. Since the area of the room is given as 810 square meters and the area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width, we can set up the equation: 6 meters * width = 810 square meters. Solving for width, we get width = 810 square meters / 6 meters = 135 meters. Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values, we get perimeter = 2 * (6 meters + 135 meters) = 2 * 141 meters = 282 meters.

Answer: Luis hires the boat for 6 hours. Since he gets 2 hours free, he has to pay for 6 - 2 = 4 hours. The first paid hour is ₺12. Each hour after that is twice the cost, so the second paid hour is ₺12 * 2 = ₺24, the third paid hour is ₺24 * 2 = ₺48, and the fourth paid hour is ₺48 * 2 = ₺96. Therefore, the total amount Luis paid is ₺12 + ₺24 + ₺48 + ₺96 = ₺180.

Once they reach the library for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the mall without being late?

Answer: It takes them 13 minutes + 42 minutes = 55 minutes to get to the library. Since they have to return home and then walk back to the library, they spend 55 * 2 = 110 minutes walking to the library and back. They have 192 minutes - 110 minutes = 82 minutes left to get to the mall without being late.

1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 241 minutes to cover every 5 miles of the city. If the city is 85 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance covered in the given time and then multiply by the given time. The total distance across the city is 85 miles and the distance covered in the given time is 5 miles. So, the number of times the given distance fits into the total distance is 85/5 = 17. Now, we multiply this by the given time, which is 241 minutes. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is 17 * 241 minutes = 4100 minutes, but since 85 is not perfectly divisible by 5, we should calculate the remaining distance and add the time it takes to cover that distance. The remaining distance is 85 - (17 * 5) = 0 miles, so we don't need to add any extra time.",4097.0,0,0,symbolic,99
2,"Reformatted Question: Hiroshi is rolling a d10 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a d10 die is 7/10, since there are 7 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100, since there are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an odd number twice in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: (7/10) - (25/100) = (70/100) - (25/100) = 45/100.

To express this difference as a percentage, multiply by 100: (45/100) * 100 = 45%.

Answer: Since the medical center has 1600 wards and 1/10 of them are occupied, the number of occupied wards is 1600 * 1/10 = 160 wards. The number of unoccupied wards is 1600 - 160 = 1440 wards. 

Since 35 patients are admitted into the medical center each day, the number of patients admitted in 4 weeks is 35 * 7 * 4 = 980 patients. 

However, since the medical center has a capacity of 1600 wards and only 1/10 of them are occupied, the medical center can accommodate more than 160 patients. Therefore, the medical center will not run out of space after 4 weeks, and the number of unoccupied wards remains the same, which is 1440 wards.

41,"Reformatted Question: A stack is made out of 2 green tiles, seven times as many orange tiles, and an unknown number of black tiles. If there are 46 tiles in the total, how many black tiles are there?
Answer: Let's denote the number of orange tiles as 7x, where x is a positive integer. The total number of tiles in the stack is the sum of the green tiles, orange tiles, and black tiles. We can write an equation to represent this: 2 + 7x + black tiles = 46. Since we don't know the number of black tiles, we can represent it as black tiles = 46 - 2 - 7x. We can simplify this expression to black tiles = 44 - 7x. Since the number of black tiles must be a non-negative integer, we can set up the inequality 44 - 7x ≥ 0. Solving for x, we get x ≤ 44 / 7 ≈ 6.29. Since x must be a positive integer, the largest possible value of x is 6. Substituting x = 6 into the expression for the number of black tiles, we get black tiles = 44 - 7 * 6 = 44 - 42 = 2. Therefore, there are 2 black tiles in the stack.",30.0,0,0,symbolic,2063

He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 2 kg of rice per day. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for €2. How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to find out how much the more expensive brand of rice costs. To do this, we need to find 40% of the normal brand's price and add it to the normal brand's price. 40% of €5 is 40% * €5 = 40% * €5 / 100% = €2. So, the more expensive brand of rice costs €5 + €2 = €7 per kg. Arash needs 2 kg of rice per day for a week, so he needs 2 kg * 7 days = 14 kg of rice. The normal brand of rice would cost €5 * 14 kg = €70. The more expensive brand of rice would cost €7 * 14 kg = €98. So, the total cost of the rice is €70 + €98 = €168.

7,"Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys eight 3-pound boxes of apples for the whole stable. He buys fourteen 9-pound bags of cucumbers. He buys thirty-three 36-pound packs of wheats. He buys seventeen 16-pound sacks of oats.  His farm truck can carry 230 pounds at a time. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

* **Apples:** eight 3-pound boxes = 8 * 3 = 24 pounds
* **Cucumbers:** fourteen 9-pound bags = 14 * 9 = 126 pounds
* **Wheats:** thirty-three 36-pound packs = 33 * 36 = 1188 pounds
* **Oats:** seventeen 16-pound sacks = 17 * 16 = 272 pounds

Now, let's find the total weight of all the feed: 24 + 126 + 1188 + 272 = 1610 pounds.

Since his farm truck can carry 230 pounds at a time, we need to divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to determine the number of trips: 1610 pounds / 230 pounds/trip = 7.0 trips.

Because we can't make a partial trip, the farmer needs to make a total of 8 trips to transport all the feed.

Therefore, the answer is {8}.
