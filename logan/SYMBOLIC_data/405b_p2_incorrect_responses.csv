1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 15 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>. However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If <fact3>the city is 96 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles a quarter of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 96 miles across</fact3>, a quarter of the city is 96 / 4 = 24 miles. 

Since <fact1>it takes 15 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>, we can find out how many sets of 3 miles are in 24 miles by dividing 24 by 3. 24 / 3 = 8. 

Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to determine if this will affect our time. However, since we are not given the exact time that the fog starts rolling in, and we are not told to consider the time after the wind speed is halved, we can assume that the time we are looking for is within the first hour. 

Therefore, it will take 8 * <fact1>15 minutes</fact1> = 120 minutes for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city.

1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>. However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If <fact3>the city is 78 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover half of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles the fog bank needs to cover to reach half of the city. Since <fact3>the city is 78 miles across</fact3>, half of the city would be 78 / 2 = 39 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 3 miles the fog bank needs to cover to reach 39 miles. Since <fact1>it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles</fact1>, we can divide 39 miles by 3 miles to get 39 / 3 = 13 sets of 3 miles.

However, we also know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. Since we don't know exactly when the wind speed will be halved, we will assume that the fog bank will cover the first half of the distance at the original speed.

So, it will take the fog bank 13 sets * <fact1>10 minutes per set</fact1> = 130 minutes to cover 39 miles at the original speed.

1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 30 minutes to cover every 6 miles of the city</fact1>. However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If <fact3>the city is 60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city?

Answer: To cover 1/2 of the city, the fog bank needs to cover <fact3>60 miles</fact3>/2 = 30 miles. 
Since <fact1>it takes 30 minutes to cover every 6 miles of the city</fact1>, the fog bank can cover 30 miles in 30/<fact1>6</fact1> * <fact1>30</fact1> = 150 minutes at its original speed. 
However, since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, after 60 minutes, the speed of the fog bank will be halved. 
In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank can cover <fact1>6</fact1>/<fact1>30</fact1> * 60 = 12 miles at its original speed. 
This leaves 30 - 12 = 18 miles to be covered at the halved speed. 
Since the speed is halved, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance, so it will take 18/<fact1>6</fact1> * <fact1>30</fact1> * 2 = 180 minutes to cover the remaining 18 miles. 
However, this is the time it would take if the fog bank were moving at the halved speed from the beginning. 
Since it moved at its original speed for the first 60 minutes, we need to subtract 60 from the total time to get 180 + 60 - 60 = 180 minutes. 
But the first 60 minutes were already accounted for in the original 60 minutes, so we only need to add the time it took to cover the remaining 18 miles at the halved speed, which is 180 - 60 = 120 minutes. 
Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city is 60 + 120 = 180 minutes.

1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>80 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city</fact1>. However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If <fact3>the city is 76 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles a quarter of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 76 miles across</fact3>, a quarter of the city is 76/4 = 19 miles. 

Since <fact1>it takes 80 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city</fact1>, the fog bank's speed is 4 miles / 80 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute. 

Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, and it takes less than an hour to cover a quarter of the city (as we will see), we can assume the wind speed is constant for the time being. 

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to cover 19 miles at a speed of 1/20 miles per minute. 

Time = Distance / Speed = 19 miles / (1/20 miles per minute) = 19 * 20 = 380 minutes.

However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If <fact3>the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?

Answer: To cover 1/4 of the city, the fog bank needs to cover 1/4 * <fact3>80 miles</fact3> = 20 miles. Since <fact1>it takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles</fact1>, the fog bank's original speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes. To cover 20 miles at this speed, it would take 20 miles / (4 miles / 60 minutes) = 300 minutes. However, since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to consider the reduced speed. The fog bank will cover the first 4 miles in 60 minutes, but then the speed will be halved. The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city is 20 - 4 = 16 miles. At the reduced speed, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance, so it will take 2 * (16 miles / (4 miles / 60 minutes)) = 480 minutes to cover the remaining 16 miles. However, this is not the total time, as the fog bank already covered 4 miles in the first 60 minutes. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city is 60 minutes + 240 minutes (half of 480 minutes, since the speed is halved after 1 hour) = 300 minutes.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more plums does Wei harvest than kiwis?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many plums and kiwis Wei can harvest in one year. 
There are <fact2>27 plums per two-fifths of a hectare</fact2>, so there are 27 / (2/5) = 27 / 0.4 = 67.5 plums per hectare. 
Wei has <fact1>15 hectares of plum field</fact1>, so he can harvest 67.5 * 15 = 1012.5 plums every <fact3>4 months</fact3>. 
In one year, there are 12 months, so Wei can harvest plums 12 / <fact3>4</fact3> = 3 times. 
So, in one year, Wei can harvest 1012.5 * 3 = 3037.5 plums. 
In <fact7>two years</fact7>, Wei can harvest 3037.5 * 2 = 6075 plums. 
Wei has a <fact4>14-hectare kiwi field</fact4> that produces <fact5>15 kiwis per hectare</fact5>, so he can harvest 14 * 15 = 210 kiwis every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. 
In one year, Wei can harvest kiwis 12 / <fact6>4</fact6> = 3 times. 
So, in one year, Wei can harvest 210 * 3 = 630 kiwis. 
In <fact7>two years</fact7>, Wei can harvest 630 * 2 = 1260 kiwis. 
Therefore, in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Wei harvests 6075 - 1260 = 4815 more plums than kiwis.

The plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apples does Xavier harvest than plums?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apples harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>13 apples per four-fifths of a square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the number of apples per square meter as 13 / (4/5) = 16.25 apples per square meter. With <fact1>65 square meters of apple field</fact1>, the total number of apples harvested in one round is 65 * 16.25 = 1056.25 apples. Since Xavier can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 4 times. So, the total number of apples harvested in two years is 1056.25 * 4 = 4225 apples.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With <fact4>11-square meter plum field</fact4> and <fact5>13 plums per square meter</fact5>, the total number of plums harvested in one round is 11 * 13 = 143 plums. Since the plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Xavier can harvest 3 times in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 6 times. So, the total number of plums harvested in two years is 143 * 6 = 858 plums.

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of apples and plums harvested in two years. The difference is 4225 - 858 = 3367.

The bananas can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more grapes does Ravi harvest than bananas?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes Ravi harvests in two years. Since there are <fact2>23 grapes per three-fifths of a square yard</fact2>, we need to calculate the number of three-fifths of a square yard in <fact1>85 square yards of grape field</fact1>. To do this, we multiply 85 by 3/5, which equals 51. Then, we multiply 51 by <fact2>23 grapes</fact2> to get 1173 grapes. Since Ravi can harvest his grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Ravi can harvest his grapes twice in two years. Therefore, the total number of grapes Ravi harvests in two years is 1173 * 2 = 2346 grapes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of bananas Ravi harvests in two years. Since Ravi's <fact4>8-square yard banana field</fact4> produces <fact5>15 bananas per square yard</fact5>, we multiply 8 by 15 to get 120 bananas. Since the bananas can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Ravi can harvest his bananas 6 times in two years. Therefore, the total number of bananas Ravi harvests in two years is 120 * 6 = 720 bananas.

Finally, we subtract the total number of bananas from the total number of grapes to find the difference. 2346 - 720 = 1626.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of golf balls and tennis balls. The number of golf balls is <fact1>480</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 60. The number of tennis balls is <fact1>480</fact1> - 60 = 420, which is also <fact3>the rest</fact3> of the balls.
Next, we need to find the number of marked golf balls and marked tennis balls. The number of orange golf balls is 60 * <fact4>1/3</fact4> = 20. The number of marked golf balls is 20 * <fact5>1/5</fact5> = 4.
The number of cyan tennis balls is 420 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = 46.67, which we will round down to 46 since we can't have a fraction of a ball. The number of marked tennis balls is 46 * <fact7>9/10</fact7> = 41.4, which we will also round down to 41.
Therefore, the total number of marked balls is 4 + 41 = 45.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since <fact2>1/4 of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, we can calculate the number of tennis balls as <fact1>320</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 80. The rest are golf balls, so there are <fact1>320</fact1> - 80 = 240 golf balls.

Now, let's find out how many marked tennis balls there are. We know that <fact4>a quarter of the tennis balls are pink</fact4>, so there are 80 * <fact4>1/4</fact4> = 20 pink tennis balls. Since <fact5>half of these pink tennis balls are marked</fact5>, there are 20 * <fact5>1/2</fact5> = 10 marked tennis balls.

Next, let's find out how many marked golf balls there are. We know that <fact6>1/9 of the golf balls are brown</fact6>, so there are 240 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = 26.67 (round down to 26 since we can't have a fraction of a ball) brown golf balls. Since <fact7>all except 1/4 of those brown balls are marked</fact7>, there are 26 - (26 * <fact7>1/4</fact7>) = 26 - 6.5 = 19.5 (round down to 19 since we can't have a fraction of a ball) marked golf balls.

Finally, we can add the number of marked tennis balls and marked golf balls to find the total number of marked balls: 10 + 19 = 29.

A <fact2>third of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, and the rest are golf balls. <fact3>1/5 of the tennis balls are turquoise</fact3>, of which <fact4>a quarter are marked</fact4>. <fact5>1/3 of the golf balls are yellow</fact5>, and all except <fact6>1/4 of those yellow balls are marked</fact6>. How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since <fact2>a third of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>600</fact1> / 3 = 200. This means that the number of golf balls is <fact1>600</fact1> - 200 = 400.

Next, we need to find out how many marked tennis balls there are. We know that <fact3>1/5 of the tennis balls are turquoise</fact3>, so the number of turquoise tennis balls is 200 / 5 = 40. Since <fact4>a quarter of these are marked</fact4>, the number of marked tennis balls is 40 / 4 = 10.

Now, we need to find out how many marked golf balls there are. We know that <fact5>1/3 of the golf balls are yellow</fact5>, so the number of yellow golf balls is 400 / 3 = 133.33 (round down to 133 since we can't have a fraction of a ball). Since all except <fact6>1/4 of these are marked</fact6>, the number of marked golf balls is 133 - (133 / 4) = 133 - 33.25 = 99.75 (round down to 99 since we can't have a fraction of a ball).

Finally, we add the number of marked tennis balls and golf balls to get the total number of marked balls: 10 + 99 = 109.

A <fact2>tenth of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, and the rest are golf balls. <fact3>1/10 of the tennis balls are teal</fact3>, of which <fact4>half are marked</fact4>. <fact5>1/8 of the golf balls are magenta</fact5>, and all except <fact6>1/9 of those magenta balls are marked</fact6>. How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: There are <fact1>200 balls</fact1> in total. <fact2>A tenth of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, so there are <fact1>200</fact1> * <fact2>1/10</fact2> = 20 tennis balls. The rest are golf balls, so there are <fact1>200</fact1> - 20 = 180 golf balls. 
Of the tennis balls, <fact3>1/10 of the tennis balls are teal</fact3>, so there are 20 * <fact3>1/10</fact3> = 2 teal tennis balls. Of those, <fact4>half are marked</fact4>, so there is 2 * <fact4>1/2</fact4> = 1 marked teal tennis ball.
Of the golf balls, <fact5>1/8 of the golf balls are magenta</fact5>, so there are 180 * <fact5>1/8</fact5> = 22.5 magenta golf balls. Since we can't have a fraction of a ball, we'll assume this is 22 magenta golf balls with 0.5 left over, which we can ignore for this problem. Of those magenta golf balls, all except <fact6>1/9 of those magenta balls are marked</fact6>, so there are 22 - (22 * <fact6>1/9</fact6>) = 22 - 2.44 = 19.56 marked magenta golf balls. Again, we can't have a fraction of a ball, so we'll assume this is 19 marked magenta golf balls with 0.56 left over, which we can ignore for this problem.
Therefore, there is a total of 1 marked teal tennis ball + 19 marked magenta golf balls = 20 marked balls.

Answer: Emma originally had <fact2>11 potted plants on each of the 58 window ledges</fact2>, so she had <fact2>11</fact2> * 58 = 638 potted plants. She then received <fact1>46 new potted plants</fact1> and purchased <fact3>80 new plants</fact3> at a discount, so she got 80 * 0.5 = 40 plants from the purchase. This brings her total to 638 + <fact1>46</fact1> + 40 = 724 potted plants. She then gives away <fact4>6 potted plants from each ledge</fact4>, so she gives away <fact4>6</fact4> * 58 = 348 potted plants. This leaves her with 724 - 348 = 376 potted plants.

It takes them <fact2>14 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the bank is. It takes them another <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to get to the library. When they reach the library, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the library again. Once they reach the library for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the cinema without being late?

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes for Ravi and Isabella to get to the library. It takes them <fact2>14 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the bank is and another <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to get to the library. So, the total time to get to the library is <fact2>14</fact2> + <fact3>38</fact3> = 52 minutes. 

Since they have to return home to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the library again, the total time spent walking to the library and back home and then to the library again is 52 * 2 = 104 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have available. They have <fact1>266 minutes</fact1> available, and they've already spent 104 minutes walking to the library and back home and then to the library again, and then another 52 minutes to get to the library for the first time. However, the 52 minutes spent the first time is already included in the 104 minutes. Therefore, the time they have left is <fact1>266</fact1> - 104 = 162 minutes.

Answer: Ananya and Rania have <fact1>199 minutes</fact1> to get to the gym. They spend <fact2>11 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>44 minutes</fact3> = 55 minutes to get to the library the first time. Then they spend another 55 minutes to get back home and then back to the library again. So they have spent 55 + 55 = 110 minutes so far. Therefore, they have <fact1>199 minutes</fact1> - 110 minutes = 89 minutes left to get to the gym without being late.

Noah has <fact5>67 dogs</fact5>, each having <fact6>15 puppies with spots</fact6>. After a visit to the vet, Luca discovered that <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots that were not visible before</fact7>. What percentage of all the puppies have spots?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Luca has <fact1>103 puppies</fact1>, Diego has <fact3>42 puppies</fact3>, and Noah has <fact5>67 dogs</fact5> * <fact6>15 puppies</fact6> = 1005 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 103 + 42 + 1005 = 1150.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Luca has <fact2>25 puppies with spots</fact2> and <fact1>103</fact1> - <fact2>25</fact2> = 78 unspotted puppies. However, <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7>, so the number of puppies with spots for Luca is <fact2>25</fact2> + 78/2 = 64. Diego has <fact4>12 puppies with spots</fact4>. Noah has <fact5>67 dogs</fact5> * <fact6>15 puppies with spots</fact6> = 1005 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 64 + 12 + 1005 = 1081.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots. The percentage is (1081 / 1150) * 100 = 93.83%.

Answer: On Thursday, Andre sold <fact1>25 boxes of cupcakes</fact1> and <fact4>26</fact4> - <fact2>18</fact2> = 8 boxes of pineapple pie. 
On Friday, he sold <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact3>11</fact3> = 36 boxes of cupcakes and <fact4>26 boxes of pineapple pie</fact4>. 
On Saturday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, which is (25 + 8) + (36 + 26) = 95 boxes total. 
Since he sold a total of 25 + 36 + 95 = 156 boxes of cupcakes and pineapple pies over the three days, and 25 + 36 = 61 of those were cupcakes, then 95 - 61 = 34 of the boxes sold on Saturday were cupcakes and 61 were pineapple pies. 
Therefore, the total number of cupcakes sold is 25 + 36 + 34 = 95, and the total number of pineapple pies sold is 8 + 26 + 61 = 95.

Answer: On Friday, James sold <fact1>29 boxes of cookies</fact1> and <fact4>25</fact4> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 10 boxes of apple pie. 
On Saturday, James sold <fact1>29</fact1> + <fact3>14</fact3> = 43 boxes of cookies and <fact4>25 boxes of apple pie</fact4>. 
On Sunday, James sold (<fact1>29</fact1> + 43) + (<fact4>25</fact4> + 10) = 107 boxes in total.

Answer: On Saturday, Mateo sold <fact1>29 boxes of cupcakes</fact1> and <fact4>21</fact4> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 6 boxes of grape pie. 
On Sunday, Mateo sold <fact1>29</fact1> + <fact3>14</fact3> = 43 boxes of cupcakes and <fact4>21 boxes of grape pie</fact4>.

On the sidewalk, Xena walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Xena's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Xena's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>66 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach before her injury was <fact2>11</fact2> km / <fact6>66</fact6> min = 1/6 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 km/min = 1/12 km/min.

We also know that Xena walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach</fact4>, so her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 3 * 1/6 km/min = 1/2 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 1/2 km/min = 1/4 km/min.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Xena to walk <fact3>13 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 1/4 km/min. This is <fact3>13</fact3> km / (1/4 km/min) = 52 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Xena to complete her <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1> is <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> (on the beach) + 52 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 118 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Nia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Nia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute.

We also know that Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Nia to walk <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>14 kilometers</fact3> / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 42 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Nia to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 42 minutes = 102 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Sophia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Sophia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>31-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Sophia's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>15 miles</fact2> on the beach and that this takes her <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>. We can use the formula speed = distance / time to find her speed on the beach. This gives us a speed of <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles per minute.

Since Sophia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 miles per minute.

We also know that Sophia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Since her speed on the beach is 0.125 miles per minute, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 x 0.125 = 0.25 miles per minute.

Now we can find the time it takes for Sophia to walk <fact3>16 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we get <fact3>16 miles</fact3> / 0.25 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Sophia to complete the entire <fact1>31-mile walk</fact1> is <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> (on the beach) + 64 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 124 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Priya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Priya's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>25-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>40 minutes</fact6> after her injury, and her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. So, her original speed on the beach was 10 km / (40 min * 2) = 10 km / 80 min = 1/8 km/min. 

Her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>twice her speed on the beach</fact4>, so it is 2 * 1/8 km/min = 1/4 km/min.

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/8 km/min = 1/16 km/min, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 1/4 km/min = 1/8 km/min.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact2>10 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>15 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3> after her injury. 

Time on the beach = distance / speed = <fact2>10 km</fact2> / (1/16 km/min) = 160 min. However, we are given that she spends <fact6>40 minutes</fact6> on the beach, so this is consistent with our calculation.

Time on the sidewalk = distance / speed = <fact3>15 km</fact3> / (1/8 km/min) = 120 min.

So, the total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>25-kilometer walk</fact1> is 40 min + 120 min = 160 min.

If <fact6>55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Emma's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>55 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> = 0.2 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 kilometers per minute. 

We also know that she walks <fact4>four times as fast</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 0.2 * <fact4>4</fact4> = 0.8 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the sidewalk is 0.8 / 2 = 0.4 kilometers per minute. 

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> / 0.4 kilometers per minute = 30 minutes. 

Finally, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to get the total time. Total time = <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> + 30 minutes = 85 minutes.

If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>21-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Aisha's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> to do so. However, this is after her injury, so we need to find her original speed. Since her speed <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can set up the equation: 
11 km / x = 66 minutes * 2 (to account for the decrease in speed)
11 km / x = 132 minutes
x = 11 km / 132 minutes = 5 minutes per km (original speed)

Since Aisha walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4 * 5 minutes per km = 1.25 minutes per km (original speed)

After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is 1.25 minutes per km * 2 = 2.5 minutes per km

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk: 
<fact3>10 kilometers</fact3> * 2.5 minutes per km = 25 minutes

The total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>21-kilometer walk</fact1> is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

If <fact6>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Roya's speed on the beach before the injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>44 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>11 km</fact2> / <fact6>44 min</fact6> = 0.25 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is 0.25 km/min / 2 = 0.125 km/min.

We also know that she walks <fact4>two times as fast on the sidewalk</fact4> as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was 2 * 0.25 km/min = 0.5 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the sidewalk is 0.5 km/min / 2 = 0.25 km/min.

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>16 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = Distance / Speed = <fact3>16 km</fact3> / 0.25 km/min = 64 minutes.

The total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-kilometer walk</fact1> is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. Total Time = <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> + 64 minutes = 108 minutes.

He bought <fact1>24 folders which cost €10.0 each</fact1>, <fact2>14 folders which cost €9.0 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost €14</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>4 notebooks which cost €10 each</fact4>. Luca can either pay <fact5>a one-time €20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive only <fact6>a 5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Luca can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the folders is <fact1>24 folders * €10.0 each</fact1> = €240 + <fact2>14 folders * €9.0 each</fact2> = €126 = €366. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€14</fact3>. The cost of the notebooks is <fact4>4 notebooks * €10 each</fact4> = €40. So, the total cost without any discount is €366 + €14 + €40 = €420.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is €420 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = €21. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €420 - €21 = €399.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. First, we need to add the one-time membership fee of <fact5>€20</fact5> to the total cost. Then, we can calculate the discount amount, which is (€420 + €20) * <fact5>20%</fact5> = €88. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is (€420 + €20) - €88 = €352.

Since €352 is less than €399, the least amount Luca can spend on everything is €352.

What is the least amount Mohammed can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the folders is <fact1>14 folders</fact1> * €9.5 = €133. The total cost of the notebooks is <fact2>12 notebooks</fact2> * €11.0 = €132. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€15</fact3>. The total cost of the markers is <fact4>6 markers</fact4> * €10 = €60. So, the total cost without any discount is €133 + €132 + €15 + €60 = €340.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is €340 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = €17. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €340 - €17 = €323.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. First, we need to add the one-time membership fee of <fact5>€20</fact5> to the total cost. Then, we can calculate the discount amount, which is (€340 + €20) * <fact5>20%</fact5> = €72. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is (€340 + €20) - €72 = €288.

Since €288 is less than €323, the least amount Mohammed can spend on everything is €288.

What is the least amount Mateo can spend on everything?

Answer: Mateo bought <fact1>22 colored pencils</fact1> for <fact2>₣11.0 each</fact2>, so the total cost of the pencils is <fact1>22</fact1> * <fact2>₣11.0</fact2> = ₣242. 
He bought <fact3>4 notebooks</fact3> for <fact4>₣12.5 each</fact4>, so the total cost of the notebooks is <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact4>₣12.5</fact4> = ₣50. 
He bought a <fact5>ream of bond paper</fact5> for <fact6>₣14</fact6>. 
He bought <fact7>6 folders</fact7> for <fact8>₣9 each</fact8>, so the total cost of the folders is <fact7>6</fact7> * <fact8>₣9</fact8> = ₣54. 
The total cost of all the items is ₣242 + ₣50 + <fact6>₣14</fact6> + ₣54 = ₣360. 
If Mateo becomes a member, he will pay a one-time <fact9>₣20 fee</fact9> and get a <fact10>20% discount</fact10> on all purchases, so the total cost will be ₣360 - (₣360 * <fact10>0.20</fact10>) + <fact9>₣20</fact9> = ₣288. 
If Mateo does not become a member, he will receive only a <fact11>5% discount</fact11> on all purchases, so the total cost will be ₣360 - (₣360 * <fact11>0.05</fact11>) = ₣342.

Umar can only respond to <fact3>2 less than the half of them</fact3>, so he can respond to: (120 / 2) - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58 emails in a normal 4-day period.
Since Umar works overtime on the last day and can respond to <fact5>30% more emails than usual</fact5>, the number of emails he can respond to on the last day is: 58 / 4 * 1.3 = 18.85, round down to 18 emails for the first 4 days he responds to 58 - 18 = 40 emails and on the 5th day he can respond to 18 + (18 * 0.3) = 18 + 5.4 = 23.4, round down to 23 emails.
So, in total, Umar responds to: 40 + 23 = 63 emails in a <fact4>5 day work week</fact4>.

Due to the flu season, <fact4>25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1400 beds</fact1> with <fact2>1/3 occupied</fact2>, which means 1/3 * <fact1>1400</fact1> = 466.67 beds are occupied. Since we can't have a fraction of a bed, we'll round down to 466 beds. Additionally, <fact3>one-sixth of all the beds are out of service</fact3>, which is 1/6 * <fact1>1400</fact1> = 233.33 beds.

Due to the flu season, <fact4>25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> with <fact2>1/4 occupied</fact2>, which means 1800 * 1/4 = 450 beds are occupied. Additionally, <fact3>one-half of all the beds are out of service</fact3>, which means 1800 * 1/2 = 900 beds are out of service. This leaves 1800 - 450 - 900 = 450 beds available. 

Over the course of <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, the hospital will admit <fact4>25 patients per day</fact4> * 14 days per week * 2 weeks = 700 patients. Since there are only 450 beds available, the hospital will be over capacity by 700 - 450 = 250 patients.

However, the question asks for the total number of unoccupied beds, which would be 450 - 700 = -250. Since the hospital cannot have a negative number of unoccupied beds, this means that the hospital is over capacity and there are no unoccupied beds. In this case, we can say that there are 0 unoccupied beds, as all available beds are occupied.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1700 beds</fact1> with <fact2>1/3 occupied</fact2>, which means 1/3 * <fact1>1700</fact1> = 566.67 beds are occupied. Since you can't have a fraction of a bed, we'll round down to 566 beds occupied.

Due to the pandemic, <fact4>45 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms. Since <fact2>1/3 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, the number of occupied rooms is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>1/3</fact2> = 633.33, which we will round down to 633 rooms.

Next, we need to find the number of rooms that are out of service. Since <fact3>one-sixth of all the rooms are out of service</fact3>, the number of rooms out of service is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact3>1/6</fact3> = 316.67, which we will round down to 316 rooms.

Now, we can find the initial number of unoccupied rooms. This is <fact1>1900</fact1> - 633 - 316 = 951 rooms.

Since <fact4>45 patients are admitted each day</fact4>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> is <fact4>45</fact4> * <fact5>14</fact5> = 630 patients.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Ananya's current age. Since in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, Ananya will be <fact3>4 times as old as DeShawn is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Ananya's current age + <fact2>8</fact2> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>23</fact1>. 
Solving for Ananya's current age, we get Ananya's current age = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>23</fact1> - <fact2>8</fact2> = 92 - 8 = 84. 
However, this is Ananya's age in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, so we need to subtract <fact2>8</fact2> from 92 to get Ananya's current age, which is 84. 
Now we know Ananya is currently 84 - <fact2>8</fact2> = 76 years old.
Next, we can find Diego's age. Since <fact4>Deshawn's brother, Diego, is 9 years younger than DeShawn</fact4>, Diego is <fact1>23</fact1> - 9 = 14 years old.
Then, we can find Sophia's age. Since <fact5>Ananya's sister Sophia is 9 years older than Diego</fact5>, Sophia is 14 + 9 = 23 years old.
In <fact6>2 years</fact6>, their ages will be: 
- Deshawn: <fact1>23</fact1> + <fact6>2</fact6> = 25
- Ananya: 76 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 78
- Diego: 14 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 16
- Sophia: 23 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 25

How much younger is Jasmine than the average age of all three?

Answer: Since <fact3>Fatima will be 51 in 5 years</fact3>, Fatima is currently 51 - 5 = 46 years old. 
Since <fact1>Fatima and Mei are 22 years apart</fact1> and Fatima is younger than Mei, Mei is 46 + 22 = 68 years old. 
Since <fact2>Fatima and Jasmine are 7 years apart</fact2> and Fatima is older than Jasmine, Jasmine is 46 - 7 = 39 years old.

If Ms. Johnson can get a <fact5>25% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Ms. Johnson's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>25%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $480000</fact2>, which is 0.25 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $120000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$480000</fact2> - $120000 = $360000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 7% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.07 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $33600. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $57600.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $360000 + $33600 + $57600 = $451200.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Ms. Johnson's <fact1>$400000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $451200 - <fact1>$400000</fact1> = $51200.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 6% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $500000</fact2>, which is 0.2 * <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $100000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$500000</fact2> - $100000 = $400000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 6% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.06 * <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $30000. However, since the selling price is discounted, we should calculate the brokerage fee based on the discounted selling price, but the problem statement doesn't explicitly state this, so we will assume it is based on the original selling price. 

The <fact4>transfer fee is 13% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.13 * <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $65000. Again, we assume this is based on the original selling price.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $400000 + $30000 + $65000 = $495000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$450000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $495000 - <fact1>$450000</fact1> = $45000.

If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $500000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $100000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$500000</fact2> - $100000 = $400000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.04 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $20000. The <fact4>transfer fee is 13% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.13 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $65000.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $400000 + $20000 + $65000 = $485000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's <fact1>$440000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $485000 - <fact1>$440000</fact1> = $45000.

If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>25% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>25%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $480000</fact2>, which is 0.25 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $120000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$480000</fact2> - $120000 = $360000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.04 * $360000 = $14400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 13% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.13 * $360000 = $46800.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $360000 + $14400 + $46800 = $420200.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$320000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $420200 - <fact1>$320000</fact1> = $100200.

Answer: Dr. Patel can get a <fact5>10% discount on the selling price</fact5>, so the actual selling price she needs to pay is <fact2>$400000</fact2> - <fact2>$400000</fact2> * <fact5>10%</fact5> = $360000.
The <fact3>brokerage fee is 7% of the selling price</fact3>, which is <fact2>$400000</fact2> * <fact3>7%</fact3> = $28000.
The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is <fact2>$400000</fact2> * <fact4>14%</fact4> = $56000.

If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $450000</fact2>, which is 0.2 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $90000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$450000</fact2> - $90000 = $360000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $13500. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $63000.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the discounted selling price plus the brokerage fee and transfer fee, which is $360000 + $13500 + $63000 = $436500.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's budget. The difference is $436500 - <fact1>$390000</fact1> = $46500.

Adding these fees to the <fact4>$370000 remaining loan amount</fact4> and the <fact5>$25000 closing costs</fact5>, Dr. Miller paid a total of $11000 + $16500 + <fact4>$370000</fact4> + <fact5>$25000</fact5> = $422500. Subtracting this amount from the <fact1>$550000 selling price</fact1>, Dr. Miller's initial net proceeds were <fact1>$550000</fact1> - $422500 = $127500. 

Since the stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>, Dr. Miller's net proceeds after two years will be $127500 * (1 + 0.10)^2 = $127500 * 1.1 * 1.1 = $154387.50.

Prof. Johnson used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Johnson's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: Prof. Johnson started with <fact1>$430000</fact1> from the sale of his apartment. He then paid <fact2>3% of the selling price</fact2> in registration fees, which is <fact2>0.03</fact2> * <fact1>$430000</fact1> = $12900. He also paid <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3> in agent fees, which is <fact3>0.04</fact3> * <fact1>$430000</fact1> = $17200. Additionally, he paid <fact4>$230000 for the remaining loan amount</fact4> and <fact5>$25000 for closing costs</fact5>. So, his total expenses were $12900 + $17200 + <fact4>$230000</fact4> + <fact5>$25000</fact5> = $295100. Therefore, his net proceeds from the sale were <fact1>$430000</fact1> - $295100 = $134900. 

Prof. Johnson then invested his net proceeds of $134900 in stocks. The stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>, so the amount at the end of two years is $134900 * (1 + <fact6>0.10</fact6>)^2 = $134900 * 1.1^2 = $134900 * 1.21 = $163229.

Answer: The total cost of the hotel for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>₣250 per day</fact2> = ₣750. The total cost of the food for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>₣40 per day</fact3> = ₣120. The total cost of the transportation for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>₣10 per day</fact4> = ₣30. So the total cost of the music festival is ₣750 + ₣120 + ₣30 = ₣900.

Xavier has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>. How much money is Xavier still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the <fact1>2-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>$250</fact2> * 2 = $500. The cost of the food is <fact3>$20</fact3> * 2 = $40, but this is covered by Xavier's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of transportation is <fact4>$30</fact4> * 2 = $60. Therefore, the total cost of the <fact1>2-day sports tournament</fact1> is $500 + $60 = $560.

Since Xavier's friends are covering the cost of the food, we can subtract this from the total cost: $560 - $40 = $520.

Xavier has <fact5>$150</fact5>, so we subtract this from the total cost: $520 - $150 = $370.

The school is covering <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>, which is $370 * 1/5 = $74.

Sanjay has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the field trip</fact6>. How much money is Sanjay still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the field trip. The cost of the hotel for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>₣250 per day</fact2> = ₣750. The cost of transportation for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>₣20 per day</fact4> = ₣60. Since Sanjay's friends are covering the cost of food, we don't need to include that in the total cost. So, the total cost of the field trip is ₣750 + ₣60 = ₣810.

Since Sanjay has <fact5>₣30</fact5>, we subtract that from the total cost to get the remaining cost: ₣810 - ₣30 = ₣780.

The local charity is covering <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is ₣780 / 5 = ₣156. So, the amount Sanjay is still missing is ₣780 - ₣156 = ₣624.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the seminar. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day seminar</fact1> is <fact2>$100</fact2> * 3 = $300. The cost of the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3> is <fact3>$40</fact3> * 3 = $120, but this is covered by Yusuf's friends.

The parent association is covering <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is ₺525 / 5 = ₺105. 

So, the amount of money Jin is still missing is the remaining cost minus the amount covered by the parent association: ₺525 - ₺105 = ₺420.

Answer: The total cost of the workshop is (<fact2>₣100</fact2> + <fact3>₣20</fact3> + <fact4>₣10</fact4>) * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = ₣260.

Answer: The total cost of the hotel for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>$250 per day</fact2> = $750. The total cost of the food for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>$20 per day</fact3> = $60. The total cost of transportation for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>$10 per day</fact4> = $30. So the total cost of the music festival is $750 + $60 + $30 = $840. Since Mateo's friends will cover the cost of the food, Mateo only needs to pay $840 - $60 = $780. Mateo has <fact5>$105</fact5>, so he still needs $780 - $105 = $675. However, the school will cover <fact6>1/4 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is $675 / 4 = $168.75. So Mateo still needs $675 - $168.75 = $506.25.

Yusuf has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/9 of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>. How much money is Yusuf still missing?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the seminar. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>2-day seminar</fact1> is <fact2>€250</fact2> * 2 = €500. The cost of the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3> is <fact3>€30</fact3> * 2 = €60, but this is covered by Yusuf's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>2-day seminar</fact1> is <fact4>€20</fact4> * 2 = €40. Therefore, the total cost of the seminar is €500 + €40 = €540. 

Since Yusuf's friends are covering the cost of the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3>, Yusuf only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is €540. Yusuf has <fact5>€35</fact5>, so he still needs €540 - €35 = €505. 

However, the community center is covering <fact6>1/9 of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>, which is €505 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = €56.11. Therefore, Yusuf still needs €505 - €56.11 = €448.89.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day workshop</fact1> is <fact2>€150</fact2> * 3 = €450. The cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3> is <fact3>€40</fact3> * 3 = €120, but this is covered by Alejandro's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost.

The total cost of the food for the <fact1>2-day music festival</fact1> is <fact3>$40</fact3> * 2 = $80.

The cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3> is <fact3>₣40</fact3> * 3 = ₣120, but this is covered by Hiroshi's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the music festival. The cost of the hotel for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>€250 per day</fact2> = €750. The cost of food for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>€40 per day</fact3> = €120. The cost of transportation for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>€10 per day</fact4> = €30. So, the total cost of the music festival is €750 + €120 + €30 = €900.

Since Yuki's friends will cover the cost of all the food, Yuki only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is €750 + €30 = €780.

Yuki has <fact5>€25</fact5>, so he still needs €780 - €25 = €755.

The community center will cover <fact6>1/10 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is €755 * 1/10 = €75.5.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the <fact1>2-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>¥150</fact2> * 2 = ¥300. The cost of the food is <fact3>¥40</fact3> * 2 = ¥80. The cost of the transportation is <fact4>¥30</fact4> * 2 = ¥60. So, the total cost is ¥300 + ¥80 + ¥60 = ¥440. 

However, Xavier's friends will cover the cost of the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>, which is ¥80. So, the remaining cost is ¥440 - ¥80 = ¥360. 

The youth club will cover <fact6>1/9 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>, which is ¥360 / 9 = ¥40. 

Xavier only has <fact5>¥125</fact5>, and he will receive ¥40 from the youth club. So, the total amount of money he has is ¥125 + ¥40 = ¥165.

Kai has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost of the seminar</fact6>. How much money is Kai still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the seminar. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>¥250</fact2> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥750. The cost of food is <fact3>¥30</fact3> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥90, but this is covered by Kai's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of transportation is <fact4>¥30</fact4> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥90. Therefore, the total cost of the seminar is ¥750 + ¥90 = ¥840. 

Kai has <fact5>¥180</fact5>, so he still needs ¥840 - ¥180 = ¥660. However, the youth club will cover <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is ¥660 * 1/6 = ¥110. Therefore, Kai still needs ¥660 - ¥110 = ¥550.

James has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/4 of the remaining cost of the field trip</fact6>. How much money is James still missing?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the field trip. The cost for the hotel is <fact2>$200</fact2> * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = $400. The cost for the food is <fact3>$40</fact3> * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = $80, but James' friends will cover this cost. The cost for transportation is <fact4>$10</fact4> * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = $20. So, the total cost of the field trip is $400 + $20 = $420. 

Since James' friends will cover the cost of food, James only needs to pay $420. James has <fact5>$70</fact5>, so he still needs $420 - $70 = $350. 

However, the school will cover <fact6>1/4 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is 1/4 * $350 = $87.50. Therefore, James still needs $350 - $87.50 = $262.50.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$960</fact5>. What was the cost of muffins per dozen?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the eclairs and cookies. Since there are 12 eclairs in a dozen, the cost of 24 eclairs is 2 * <fact1>$12 per dozen</fact1> = $24. Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, the cost of 48 cookies is 4 * <fact2>$31 per dozen</fact2> = $124. The total cost of eclairs and cookies is $24 + $124 = $148. 

Let's denote the cost of muffins per dozen as x. Since there are 12 muffins in a dozen, the cost of 48 muffins is 4 * x. 

The total cost of all the desserts before the discount is $148 + 4 * x. 

After the <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the total cost becomes 0.8 * ($148 + 4 * x) = <fact5>$960</fact5>. 

Now, we can solve for x: 
0.8 * ($148 + 4 * x) = $960 
$118.4 + 3.2 * x = $960 
3.2 * x = $841.6 
x = $262.375 

Since the cost is per dozen, we can round it to the nearest cent.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1410</fact5>. What was the cost of brownies per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, the cost of 24 croissants is 2 * <fact1>$13 per dozen</fact1> = $26.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Since there are 12 macarons in a dozen, the cost of 48 macarons is 4 * <fact2>$34 per dozen</fact2> = $136.
The total cost of the croissants and macarons is $26 + $136 = $162.
Since Kayla paid a total of <fact5>$1410</fact5> after a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, the original price before the discount was <fact5>$1410</fact5> / (1 - <fact4>0.25</fact4>) = $1880.

How much more do <fact5>8 loaves of bread</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 bagels</fact6>?

Answer: The cost of a bagel is <fact2>one-eighth of a loaf of bread</fact2>, which is <fact1>₣10</fact1>/8 = ₣1.25. Since the customer is buying <fact6>8 bagels</fact6>, which is more than <fact3>7 bagels</fact3>, they get a <fact4>10% discount on bagels</fact4>. The discount is ₣1.25 x 0.1 = ₣0.125 per bagel.

He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs <fact2>30% more</fact2> since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses <fact3>3 kilograms of tea per day</fact3>.

Diego also decides to buy himself a muffin for <fact6>€1</fact6>. How much does Diego have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>30% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>€10</fact1> + (<fact1>€10</fact1> * <fact2>0.3</fact2>) = €13 per kilogram.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of tea Diego needs to buy for a week. Since he uses <fact3>3 kilograms of tea per day</fact3> and there are 7 days in a week, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of tea.

Since the store has a <fact4>45% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, Diego can get a discount on 20 kilograms of tea. The discount amount is €13 * <fact5>20</fact5> * <fact4>0.45</fact4> = €117. The discounted price for 20 kilograms of tea is €13 * <fact5>20</fact5> - €117 = €103.

For the remaining 1 kilogram of tea (21 - 20 = 1), Diego has to pay the regular price of €13.

Finally, Diego also buys a muffin for <fact6>€1</fact6>. Therefore, the total amount Diego has to pay is €103 + €13 + €1 = €117.

After eating <fact2>5 cookies for breakfast</fact2>, he had 132 - 5 = 127 cookies left. <fact3>Umar finds 3 cookies</fact3>, leaving 127 - 3 = 124 cookies. <fact4>Ibrahim finds seven times as many as Umar</fact4>, which is 7 * 3 = 21 cookies. So, 124 - 21 = 103 cookies are left. <fact5>Leon finds 3 less than Ibrahim</fact5>, which is 21 - 3 = 18 cookies. Now, 103 - 18 = 85 cookies are left. <fact6>Winnie finds 1/9 as many as Leon</fact6>, which is 18 / 9 = 2 cookies. So, 85 - 2 = 83 cookies are left. <fact7>Emma finds three dozen cookies more than Ibrahim and Umar combined</fact7>, which is 3 * 12 + 21 + 3 = 48 cookies. Therefore, 83 - 48 = 35 cookies are still hidden in the yard.

How many waffles are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: Luca initially had <fact1>10 dozen waffles</fact1>, which is 10 * 12 = 120 waffles. After eating <fact2>3 waffles for breakfast</fact2>, he had 120 - 3 = 117 waffles left. <fact3>Santiago finds 6 waffles</fact3>, <fact4>Daphne finds three times as many as Santiago</fact4>, which is 3 * 6 = 18 waffles. <fact5>Arash finds 3 less than Daphne</fact5>, which is 18 - 3 = 15 waffles. <fact6>Jin finds a fifth as many as Arash</fact6>, which is 15 / 5 = 3 waffles. The total number of waffles found by Santiago, Daphne, Arash, and Jin is 6 + 18 + 15 + 3 = 42 waffles. <fact7>Xavier finds three dozen waffles more than Daphne and Santiago combined</fact7>, which is 3 * 12 + 6 + 18 = 48 waffles. The total number of waffles found is 42 + 48 = 90 waffles. Therefore, the number of waffles still hidden in the yard is 117 - 90 = 27 waffles.
