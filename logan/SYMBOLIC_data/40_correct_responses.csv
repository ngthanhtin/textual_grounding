Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>, which is 4. There are 2 numbers greater than 2 on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>, which are 3 and 4. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 0.5.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are 2 odd numbers on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>, which are 1 and 3. So, the probability of rolling an odd number on each roll is 2/4 = 0.5. The probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number <fact2>greater than 3</fact2> on a <fact1>d6 die</fact1>, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes. There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a d6 die: 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>, we need to calculate the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and then rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 even numbers on a d6 die: 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: (1/4) × 100 = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Noah rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1>, we first note that there are 20 possible outcomes, and 18 of them are greater than 2. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 18/20 = 0.9.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>, we note that the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 10/20 = 0.5, since half of the numbers on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> are even.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>4</fact2> on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1>, we first find the number of favorable outcomes. There are 16 numbers greater than <fact2>4</fact2> on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20). The total number of possible outcomes is 20. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>4</fact2> is 16/20 = 0.8.

To calculate the probability of rolling two <fact3>even numbers</fact3> in a row, we find the probability of rolling an <fact3>even number</fact3> on the first roll and multiply it by the probability of rolling an <fact3>even number</fact3> on the second roll. The probability of rolling an <fact3>even number</fact3> on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> is 10/20 = 0.5, since there are 10 <fact3>even numbers</fact3> (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20). So, the probability of rolling two <fact3>even numbers</fact3> in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

The difference in probabilities is 0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.55 * 100 = 55%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. Since Esteban is rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>, there are 4 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The numbers greater than 2 are 3 and 4, so there are 2 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 0.5.

To calculate the probability of rolling two <fact2>even numbers</fact2> in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and multiply it by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. Since there are 2 even numbers (2 and 4) out of 4 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an even number on each roll is 2/4 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.

To find the difference in probabilities, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 x 100 = 25%.

Answer: A <fact1>d8 die</fact1> has 8 sides, numbered 1 through 8. There are 4 numbers greater than 4 on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1>, which are 5, 6, 7, and 8. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is 4/8 = 0.5.

To roll <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, Pavel would have to roll an odd number on the first roll, and then roll another odd number on the second roll. There are 4 odd numbers on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1>, which are 1, 3, 5, and 7. So the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 4/8 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 4/8 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, we multiply the probabilities of the two rolls together: 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.

The difference between the two probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 x 100 = 25%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>four-sided die</fact1>, which is 4. Out of these 4 possible outcomes, 3 are greater than 1. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 3/4.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2>, we need to consider that there are 2 even numbers (2 and 4) on a <fact1>four-sided die</fact1>. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 2/4 = 1/2. Since the die is rolled independently, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling <fact2>two even numbers in a row</fact2> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities: (3/4) - (1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

How many like to paint if the number that like to play video games is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students who like to play video games. Since the number of students who like to play video games is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact4>, and <fact3>23 students like to play basketball</fact3>, the number of students who like to play video games is 2 * <fact3>23</fact3> = 46.

We know that <fact2>71 students like to play music</fact2>, <fact3>23 students like to play basketball</fact3>, and 46 students like to play video games. So, the total number of students who like to play music, basketball, or video games is <fact2>71</fact2> + <fact3>23</fact3> + 46 = 140.

Since there are <fact1>148 students</fact1> in total, and 140 students like to play music, basketball, or video games, the number of students who like to paint is <fact1>148</fact1> - 140 = 8.

In the next 18 seconds, the popping rate increased to <fact3>5 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, which is 5 x <fact1>40</fact1> = 200 kernels. In the <fact4>final 18 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact4>, which is 200 / 2 = 100 kernels. After taking the skillet off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds</fact5> also popped, which is 100 / 4 = 25 kernels. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 40 + 80 + 200 + 100 + 25 = 445.

In the next 18 seconds, the kernels popped at <fact3>6 times the initial rate</fact3>, which is <fact3>6</fact3> * <fact1>80</fact1> = 480 kernels. In the <fact4>final 18 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate of the past 18 seconds</fact4>, so the kernels popped at a rate of 480 / <fact4>2</fact4> = 240 kernels. After taking the pan off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds</fact5> also popped, which is <fact5>1/4</fact5> * 240 = 60 kernels. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180.

Answer: Let's start by identifying the parts of the ratio. The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is <fact1>128:8</fact1>, which means that for every 128 teaspoons of sugar, Sofia uses 8 cups of water. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 8. This gives us a simplified ratio of 16:1.

Since Sofia used a <fact2>total of 136 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the number of teaspoons of sugar Sofia used. Then, the number of cups of water she used is 136 - x.

We know that the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 16:1, so we can set up the following equation:

x / (136 - x) = 16 / 1

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

x = 16(136 - x)

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2176 - 16x

Adding 16x to both sides gives us:

17x = 2176

The weight of hay is <fact1>7 boxes</fact1> * <fact1>3 kg/box</fact1> = 21 kg. 
The weight of cucumbers is <fact2>14 bags</fact2> * <fact2>7 kg/bag</fact2> = 98 kg. 
The weight of wheats is <fact3>35 packs</fact3> * <fact3>35 kg/pack</fact3> = 1225 kg. 
The weight of corns is <fact4>16 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>16 kg/sack</fact4> = 256 kg. 
The total weight of the feed is 21 kg + 98 kg + 1225 kg + 256 kg = 1600 kg. 
Since <fact5>the farm truck can carry 200 kg at a time</fact5>, the farmer needs to make 1600 kg / 200 kg/trip = 8 trips to transport all the feed.

He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact2>eleven 5-kg bags</fact2>. Corns are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys <fact3>thirty three 35-kg packs</fact3>. Apples are a staple to supplement the corns, so he buys <fact4>seventeen 16-kg sacks</fact4>. If his farm truck can <fact5>carry 100 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together. 
The weight of oats is <fact1>6 boxes</fact1> * <fact1>3 kg/box</fact1> = 18 kg. 
The weight of carrots is <fact2>11 bags</fact2> * <fact2>5 kg/bag</fact2> = 55 kg. 
The weight of corns is <fact3>33 packs</fact3> * <fact3>35 kg/pack</fact3> = 1155 kg. 
The weight of apples is <fact4>17 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>16 kg/sack</fact4> = 272 kg. 
The total weight of the feed is 18 kg + 55 kg + 1155 kg + 272 kg = 1500 kg. 
Since the farm truck can <fact5>carry 100 kgs at a time</fact5>, the farmer needs to make 1500 kg / <fact5>100 kg/trip</fact5> = 15 trips to transport all the feed.

The giant cubes use <fact2>12 grams per cube</fact2> * <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5> = 108 grams of water. 
The medium cubes use <fact3>11 grams</fact3> * <fact7>14 medium cubes</fact7> = 154 grams of water. 
The small cubes use <fact4>1/7 of a gram</fact4> * <fact6>14 small cubes</fact6> = 2 grams of water. 
So, the total amount of water used is 108 + 154 + 2 = 264 grams. 
To find out how many grams of water Thiago has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: <fact1>344 grams of water</fact1> - 264 grams = 80 grams.

He can make giant cubes that use <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2>, medium cubes that use <fact3>11 ounces</fact3>, and small cubes that use <fact4>1/5 of ounce</fact4>. If he makes <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5>, <fact6>15 small cubes</fact6>, and <fact7>13 medium cubes</fact7>, how many ounces of water does he have left?

Answer: To find out how many ounces of water Alejandro has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the ice cubes. 
The giant cubes use <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5> = 108 ounces of water. 
The medium cubes use <fact3>11 ounces</fact3> * <fact7>13 medium cubes</fact7> = 143 ounces of water. 
The small cubes use <fact4>1/5 of ounce</fact4> * <fact6>15 small cubes</fact6> = 3 ounces of water. 
So, the total amount of water used is 108 + 143 + 3 = 254 ounces. 
To find out how many ounces of water Alejandro has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: <fact1>326 ounces of water</fact1> - 254 ounces = 72 ounces.

It takes them another <fact3>12 minutes</fact3> to get to the library. How much longer do they have to get to bank without being late?

Answer: To find out how much longer Ava and Uma have to get to the bank, we need to subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have available. They have spent <fact2>16 minutes</fact2> getting to the corner where the gym is and another <fact3>12 minutes</fact3> getting to the library. So, the total time they have spent walking so far is <fact2>16</fact2> + <fact3>12</fact3> = 28 minutes. They have <fact1>113 minutes</fact1> available in total. Therefore, they have <fact1>113</fact1> - 28 = 85 minutes left to get to the bank without being late.

If <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>25-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Leilani's speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>14 miles</fact2> in <fact5>56 minutes</fact5>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>14 miles</fact2> / <fact5>56 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute.

Since Leilani walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.25 miles per minute = 0.5 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Leilani to walk <fact3>11 miles on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>11 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 22 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for Leilani to complete the entire <fact1>25-mile walk</fact1> by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. Total time = <fact5>56 minutes</fact5> + 22 minutes = 78 minutes.

If <fact5>54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: To find Beatriz's speed on the beach, we divide the distance she walks on the beach by the time she spends on the beach. Her speed on the beach is <fact2>18 miles</fact2> / <fact5>54 minutes</fact5> = 1/3 miles per minute. 

Her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>twice her speed on the beach</fact4>, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 1/3 miles per minute = 2/3 miles per minute.

To find the time she spends on the sidewalk, we divide the distance she walks on the sidewalk by her speed on the sidewalk. The time she spends on the sidewalk is <fact3>10 miles</fact3> / (2/3 miles per minute) = 15 minutes.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = 1/6 miles per minute.

Since Priya walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 3 * (1/6) = 1/2 miles per minute.

On the sidewalk, Mei walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Mei walks <fact2>15 miles</fact2> on the beach in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute. Since Mei walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 miles per minute. To walk <fact3>13 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk, Mei will need <fact3>13 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 26 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes Mei to complete her <fact1>28-mile walk</fact1> is <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> on the beach + 26 minutes on the sidewalk = 86 minutes.

17,"Reformatted Question: Winnie walks <fact1>27 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: To find Winnie's speed on the beach, we divide the distance she walks on the beach by the time she spends on the beach. This gives us a speed of <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>45 minutes</fact5> = 1/3 miles per minute.
Since Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 1/3 = 2/3 miles per minute.
The time it takes for Winnie to walk on the sidewalk is the distance she walks on the sidewalk divided by her speed on the sidewalk. This gives us a time of <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / (2/3 miles per minute) = 18 minutes.
Therefore, the total time it takes for Winnie to complete her walk is the time she spends on the beach plus the time she spends on the sidewalk. This gives us a total time of <fact5>45 minutes</fact5> + 18 minutes = 63 minutes.

17,"Reformatted Question: Winnie walks <fact1>30 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>13 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>17 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: To find Winnie's speed on the beach, we divide the distance she walks on the beach by the time she spends on the beach. So, her speed on the beach is <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute. 
Since she walks <fact4>twice as fast on the sidewalk</fact4>, her speed on the sidewalk is 0.25 * <fact4>2</fact4> = 0.5 miles per minute. 
The time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance she walks on the sidewalk divided by her speed on the sidewalk. So, she spends <fact3>17 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 34 minutes on the sidewalk. 
Therefore, the total time she spends on her walk is <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> on the beach + 34 minutes on the sidewalk = 86 minutes.

The rest of the questions are equally divided as history and literature, so each of these subjects has (<fact1>150</fact1> - 60) / 2 = 45 questions.

Now, let's calculate how many questions Nia is sure to get correctly. She will get <fact3>35% of the chemistry questions</fact3> correctly, which is 60 * <fact3>0.35</fact3> = 21 questions. She will also get <fact4>1/9 of the history and literature questions</fact4> correctly, which is 45 * <fact4>1/9</fact4> = 5 questions for each subject. So, in total, she will get 21 + 5 + 5 = 31 questions correctly.

Therefore, Nia is sure to get 31 points.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday and Wednesday. Since <fact1>he watched a 4-hour episode each night</fact1>, that's 4 hours * 2 nights = 8 hours. On Friday, <fact3>he watched a 6-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>, which is 6 hours + 0.25 hours = 6.25 hours. On Saturday, <fact4>he watched two 4-hour episodes</fact4>, which is 4 hours * 2 = 8 hours. So, the total hours watched on these days is 8 + 6.25 + 8 = 22.25 hours. Since <fact5>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact5>, the hours watched on Thursday is 23 - 22.25 = 0.75 hours.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total hours of TV Deshawn watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact1>3 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Thursday, he watched 6 hours + 0.5 hours = 6.5 hours of TV (<fact3>6-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>).

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total hours of TV Ravi watched on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. On <fact1>Wednesday and Thursday, he watched a 4-hour episode each night</fact1>, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 hours. On <fact3>Saturday, he watched a 5-hour episode and a 45-minute show</fact3>, which is 5 + 0.75 = 5.75 hours. On <fact4>Sunday, he watched three 3-hour episodes</fact4>, which is 3 * 3 = 9 hours. So, the total hours watched on these days is 8 + 5.75 + 9 = 22.75 hours. Since <fact5>he watched 24 hours of TV in all</fact5>, he must have watched 24 - 22.75 = 1.25 hours on Friday. Since each episode on Friday is 15 minutes, we need to convert 1.25 hours to minutes, which is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes. Now, we can divide 75 minutes by 15 minutes per episode to find the number of episodes watched on Friday, which is 75 / 15 = 5 episodes.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Saturday and Sunday. Since <fact1>he watched 5 hours each night</fact1>, the total hours watched on these two days is 5 + 5 = 10 hours.

On <fact3>Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>, which is equivalent to 3 + 0.5 = 3.5 hours.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday and Wednesday. Since <fact1>he watched a 3-hour episode each night</fact1>, that's 3 hours * 2 nights = 6 hours. On <fact3>Friday, he watched a 5-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>, which is 5 hours + 0.5 hours = 5.5 hours.

Later, when she went to set the table, <fact4>she had a total of 36 plates</fact4>. How many plates were in the package that Chen bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of plates in the package Chen bought as x. We know that Chen's husband bought <fact2>13 new plates</fact2> and Chen used <fact3>5 plates</fact3> to sample her stuffed peppers. So, the total number of plates Chen had initially (x) plus the number of plates her husband bought (<fact2>13</fact2>), minus the number of plates she used (<fact3>5</fact3>), should equal the total number of plates she had when she set the table (<fact4>36</fact4>). This can be expressed as: x + <fact2>13</fact2> - <fact3>5</fact3> = <fact4>36</fact4>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact4>36</fact4> - <fact2>13</fact2> + <fact3>5</fact3> = 28.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>100 students in the class</fact1> and 40 students are soccer players, the number of students in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> is <fact1>100</fact1> - 40 = 60 students.

Then, we can calculate the number of students who are choir members or part of debate team members. Since <fact4>20% of the students in the remaining class are choir members or part of debate team members</fact4>, we can calculate the number of these students as 0.2 * 60 = 12 students.

Finally, we can find the total number of students who are leaving early by adding the number of soccer players and the number of choir members or debate team members. This gives us 40 + 12 = 52 students.

Due to the pandemic, <fact3>80 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms in the care facility. Since <fact2>2/5 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate the number of occupied rooms as follows: <fact2>2/5</fact2> * <fact1>1900</fact1> = 760 rooms.

Next, we need to find the number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility. We can do this by subtracting the number of occupied rooms from the total capacity: <fact1>1900</fact1> - 760 = 1140 rooms.

Due to the pandemic, <fact3>40 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many beds are initially occupied. Since <fact2>1/6 of the beds are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as <fact1>1500</fact1> * <fact2>1/6</fact2> = 250 beds.

Next, we need to find out how many new patients are admitted over the course of <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are <fact4>4</fact4> * 7 = 28 days in 4 weeks.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>700 rooms</fact1> with <fact2>1/5 occupied</fact2>, so the number of occupied rooms is <fact1>700</fact1> * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 140 rooms. The number of unoccupied rooms is <fact1>700</fact1> - 140 = 560 rooms. 

Since <fact3>35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> is <fact3>35</fact3> * 14 = 490 patients.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1800 wards</fact1> with <fact2>1/9 occupied</fact2>, so the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/9</fact2> = 200 wards. The number of unoccupied wards is <fact1>1800</fact1> - 200 = 1600 wards. 

Since <fact3>65 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> is <fact3>65</fact3> * 14 = 910 patients. 

Assuming each patient occupies one ward, the number of unoccupied wards after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> is 1600 - 910 = 690 wards.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many beds are initially occupied. Since <fact2>2/5 of the beds are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows: <fact2>2/5</fact2> * <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> = 720 beds.

Next, we need to find out how many new patients are admitted over the course of <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>. There are 7 days in a week, so <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> is equal to 2 * 7 = 14 days. Since <fact3>45 patients are admitted each day</fact3>, the total number of new patients admitted is <fact3>45 patients/day</fact3> * 14 days = 630 patients.

Now, we can calculate the total number of occupied beds after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> by adding the initial number of occupied beds to the number of new patients admitted: 720 beds + 630 patients = 1350 beds.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total number of occupied beds from the hospital's capacity: <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> - 1350 beds = 450 beds.

Answer: The number of occupied beds is <fact1>1200</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 150 beds. The number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1200</fact1> - 150 = 1050 beds. Since there are <fact3>20 patients admitted each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> is <fact3>20 patients/day</fact3> * 7 days/week * <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> = 560 patients.

Due to the pandemic, <fact3>45 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many beds are initially occupied. Since <fact2>2/5 of the beds are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows: <fact2>2/5</fact2> * <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> = 520 beds.

Next, we need to find out how many new patients are admitted over the course of <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>. There are 7 days in a week, so <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> is equal to 2 * 7 = 14 days. Since <fact3>45 patients are admitted each day</fact3>, the total number of new patients admitted is <fact3>45 patients/day</fact3> * 14 days = 630 patients.

However, we don't know if the initially occupied beds become available over the course of the two weeks, so we will assume that they remain occupied. Therefore, the total number of occupied beds after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> is 520 (initially occupied) + 630 (newly admitted) = 1150 beds.

Finally, we can calculate the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity: <fact1>1300 beds</fact1> - 1150 beds = 150 beds.

Due to the pandemic, <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the care facility after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: The care facility has <fact1>1500 beds</fact1> with <fact2>1/5 occupied</fact2>, so the number of occupied beds is <fact1>1500</fact1> * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 300 beds. The number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1500</fact1> - 300 = 1200 beds.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> and <fact2>1/4</fact2> are occupied, so the number of occupied beds is <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 450 beds. The number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1800</fact1> - 450 = 1350 beds. 

In <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, there are 14 days. The hospital admits <fact3>85 patients</fact3> per day, so in 14 days, the hospital admits <fact3>85 patients</fact3> * 14 days = 1190 patients.

Since <fact3>35 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact3>, after <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> (14 days), the total number of patients admitted is <fact3>35</fact3> * 14 = 490.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many rooms are initially occupied. Since <fact2>3/4 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate the number of occupied rooms as <fact1>1500</fact1> * <fact2>3/4</fact2> = 1125 rooms.

Next, we need to find out how many rooms are initially unoccupied. We can do this by subtracting the number of occupied rooms from the total capacity: <fact1>1500</fact1> - 1125 = 375 unoccupied rooms.

Now, we need to calculate how many new patients are admitted over the course of <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>. Since there are 7 days in a week, <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> is equal to 2 * 7 = 14 days. With <fact3>25 patients admitted each day</fact3>, the total number of new patients is 14 * <fact3>25</fact3> = 350 patients.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1400 beds</fact1> and <fact2>1/5</fact2> of them are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is <fact1>1400</fact1> * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 280 beds. The number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1400</fact1> - 280 = 1120 beds.

It takes them <fact3>20 minutes per floor</fact3>. If they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning floors. With <fact1>210 floors</fact1> and <fact3>20 minutes per floor</fact3>, the total time spent cleaning is <fact1>210</fact1> * <fact3>20</fact3> = 4200 minutes.

Since the worker has <fact2>10 days</fact2> to complete the task and works <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, the total available time is <fact2>10</fact2> * <fact4>10</fact4> = 100 hours. 

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning floors, we divide the total time spent cleaning (70 hours) by the total available time (100 hours) and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning floors. Since there are <fact1>120 floors</fact1> and it takes <fact3>20 minutes per floor</fact3>, the total time spent cleaning floors is <fact1>120 floors</fact1> * <fact3>20 minutes per floor</fact3> = 2400 minutes.

Since the janitor works <fact4>8 hours each day</fact4>, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total minutes worked per day is <fact4>8 hours</fact4> * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes per day.

The janitor has <fact2>10 days</fact2> to complete the task, so the total minutes worked in 10 days is 480 minutes per day * <fact2>10 days</fact2> = 4800 minutes.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of time spent cleaning floors. The time spent cleaning floors is 2400 minutes, and the total time worked is 4800 minutes. So, the percentage of time spent cleaning floors is (2400 minutes / 4800 minutes) * 100% = 50%.

It takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>. If they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning rooms. With <fact1>140 rooms</fact1> and <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>, the total time spent cleaning is <fact1>140</fact1> * <fact3>15</fact3> = 2100 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 2100 / 60 = 35 hours. 

Since the worker has <fact2>5 days</fact2> to complete the task and works <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, the total available time is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact4>10</fact4> = 50 hours. 

To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning rooms, we divide the total time spent cleaning (35 hours) by the total available time (50 hours) and multiply by 100. This gives us (35 / 50) * 100 = 70%. 

So, on average, the worker spends 70% of their day cleaning rooms.

It takes them <fact3>15 minutes per floor</fact3>. If they work <fact4>9 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total time spent cleaning floors. Since there are <fact1>90 floors</fact1> and it takes <fact3>15 minutes per floor</fact3>, the total time spent cleaning floors is <fact1>90 floors</fact1> * <fact3>15 minutes per floor</fact3> = 1350 minutes.

Since there are <fact2>5 days</fact2> to complete the task, the average time spent cleaning floors per day is 1350 minutes / <fact2>5 days</fact2> = 270 minutes per day.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60: 270 minutes / 60 = 4.5 hours per day.

If they work <fact4>7 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes the cleaner works each day. Since they work <fact4>7 hours each day</fact4>, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work 7 x 60 = 420 minutes per day.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes the cleaner spends cleaning floors in total. Since it takes them <fact3>10 minutes per floor</fact3> and there are <fact1>210 floors</fact1>, they spend 10 x 210 = 2100 minutes cleaning floors in total.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes the cleaner spends cleaning floors in total. Since it takes them <fact3>15 minutes per floor</fact3> and there are <fact1>80 floors</fact1>, they spend <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact3>15</fact3> = 1200 minutes cleaning floors in total.

Since they have <fact2>5 days</fact2> to get it done, they spend on average 1200 / <fact2>5</fact2> = 240 minutes per day cleaning floors.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors by dividing the time spent cleaning floors by the total time worked and multiplying by 100. So, (240 / 600) * 100 = 40%.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of flour Wei buys. He buys <fact3>a week's worth of flour</fact3>, which is 7 days, and he uses <fact4>2 kilogram of flour per day</fact4>. So, the total amount of flour he buys is 7 days * <fact4>2 kilogram per day</fact4> = 14 kilograms.

The total cost of the flour is 14 kilograms * €6 per kilogram = €84. 

Finally, we add the cost of the cookie, which is <fact5>€1</fact5>. 

So, the total cost of everything is €84 + <fact5>€1</fact5> = €85.

So, the number of boys is <fact1>10</fact1> * 1/2 = 5. Now, we add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids: <fact1>10 girls</fact1> + 5 boys = 15 kids.

Answer: First, we need to convert <fact1>9 dozen eggs</fact1> into a total number of eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, <fact1>9 dozen eggs</fact1> is equal to 9 * 12 = 108 eggs.

Next, we know that <fact2>James finds 9 eggs</fact2>. Then, <fact3>Oliver finds thrice as many as James</fact3>, which is 3 * 9 = 27 eggs.

After that, <fact4>Benjamin finds 3 less than Oliver</fact4>, which is 27 - 3 = 24 eggs.

Finally, <fact5>Jasmine finds 1/2 as many as Benjamin</fact5>, which is 24 / 2 = 12 eggs.

Now, we can add up the total number of eggs found by all the children: 9 + 27 + 24 + 12 = 72 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs hidden: 108 - 72 = 36 eggs.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to convert the number of eggs Deshawn hid into a numerical value. Since <fact1>8 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 8 x 12 = 96 eggs, we know that Deshawn hid 96 eggs.

Next, we can calculate the number of eggs each person found. We already know that <fact2>Mateo finds 7 eggs</fact2>. Since <fact3>Carlos finds thrice as many as Mateo</fact3>, we can calculate that Carlos found 3 x 7 = 21 eggs.

Then, since <fact4>Valeria finds 1 less than Carlos</fact4>, we know that Valeria found 21 - 1 = 20 eggs.

Finally, since <fact5>Beatriz finds 1/5 as many as Valeria</fact5>, we can calculate that Beatriz found 1/5 x 20 = 4 eggs.

Now, we can add up the total number of eggs found by each person: 7 (Mateo) + 21 (Carlos) + 20 (Valeria) + 4 (Beatriz) = 52 eggs.

To find the number of eggs still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Deshawn hid: 96 - 52 = 44 eggs.

The last apartment complex is <fact2>20% bigger than the other 2 combined</fact2>, which means it has 200 + (200 x 0.20) = 240 apartments. In total, Yuki collects garbage from 200 + 240 = 440 apartments. Since Yuki collects garbage <fact3>5 times a week from each place</fact3>, he makes <fact4>₣0.35 per collection for each apartment</fact4> x 5 collections per week = ₣1.75 per week for each apartment. Therefore, Yuki makes ₣1.75 per week for each apartment x 440 apartments = ₣770 per week.

So, we can plug these values into the formula to get 1095 = 5 x Width. To find the width, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5, which gives us Width = 1095 / 5 = 219 meters. Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get <fact3>perimeter</fact3> = 2(5 + 219) = 2 x 224 = 448 meters.

50,"Reformatted Question: The area of Theo's rectangular office is <fact1>468 square feet</fact1>. If the length of his room is <fact2>6 yards</fact2>, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?

Answer: First, we need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, the length of the room is <fact2>6 yards</fact2> * 3 feet/yard = 18 feet. 

Next, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length * width = area. We know the area is <fact1>468 square feet</fact1> and the length is 18 feet, so we can solve for the width: width = <fact1>468 square feet</fact1> / 18 feet = 26 feet.

Now that we have the length and width, we can find the perimeter using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values, we get: perimeter = 2 * (18 feet + 26 feet) = 2 * 44 feet = 88 feet.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Santiago has initially. Since he has <fact1>6 €10 bills</fact1>, he has a total of 6 x 10 = €60.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the action figures. He buys <fact2>14 action figures for €3 each</fact2>, so the total cost is 14 x 3 = €42.

Then, we need to calculate the total cost of the candy bars. He buys <fact3>4 packs of candy bars for €3 each</fact3>, so the total cost is 4 x 3 = €12.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Santiago spent by adding the cost of the action figures and the candy bars: €42 + €12 = €54.

Finally, we can calculate the amount of money Santiago has left by subtracting the total amount he spent from the initial amount: €60 - €54 = €6.

Writing three-sixths of it once means that Sakura has written <fact1>48 letters</fact1> * 3/6 = 24 letters. So, in total, Sakura has written 240 + 24 = 264 letters. Then, she <fact4>re-writes everything she has already written</fact4>, which means she writes another 264 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Sakura has written is 264 + 264 = 528.

How many kgs of ore can <fact4>23 trolls</fact4> with titanium pickaxes mine in a <fact5>month with 30 days</fact5>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much ore a troll can mine with a titanium pickaxe. We know that a troll can mine <fact1>5 kgs of ore per day</fact1> with a basic shovel and <fact2>two times as much with a bronze pickaxe</fact2>, which means <fact1>5</fact1> * 2 = 10 kgs of ore per day with a bronze pickaxe. Since a troll can mine <fact3>30% more with a titanium pickaxe than with a bronze pickaxe</fact3>, we can calculate the amount of ore a troll can mine with a titanium pickaxe as 10 + (10 * 0.3) = 13 kgs of ore per day.

Now, we need to find out how much ore <fact4>23 trolls</fact4> can mine in a <fact5>month with 30 days</fact5>. We can calculate the total amount of ore mined by multiplying the amount of ore mined by one troll in one day by the number of trolls and the number of days: 13 * <fact4>23</fact4> * <fact5>30</fact5> = 8970 kgs of ore.

But as I pour it, I <fact5>spill 4 liters of the mango drink</fact5>. How much water is in the remaining <fact6>33 liters</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the amount of water in the mango drink. Since the mango drink is <fact2>two-sixths water</fact2>, and there were originally <fact1>16 liters of mango drink</fact1>, the amount of water in the mango drink is <fact2>2/6</fact2> * <fact1>16</fact1> = 16/3 liters. However, <fact5>4 liters of the mango drink</fact5> were spilled, so the amount of water in the remaining mango drink is (16/3) * (12/16) = 4 liters (after removing 1/4 of the water since 4 out of 16 liters were spilled).

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the peach drink. Since the peach drink is <fact4>2/3 water</fact4> and there are <fact3>21 liters of peach drink</fact3>, the amount of water in the peach drink is <fact4>2/3</fact4> * <fact3>21</fact3> = 14 liters.

When he went back home, he inspected the pebbles further. <fact4>Five of them he picked up weren't pebbles, but actually beads</fact4> so he got rid of it. How many pebbles did Mohammed end up with?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pebbles Mohammed dropped. Since he dropped <fact2>2/4 of them</fact2>, we need to calculate 2/4 of <fact1>62</fact1>. To do this, we multiply 62 by 2 and then divide by 4, which gives us 31. So, Mohammed dropped 31 pebbles. After dropping 31 pebbles, Mohammed had <fact1>62</fact1> - 31 = 31 pebbles left in his bag. Then, he picked up <fact3>18</fact3> more pebbles, but <fact4>5 of them were beads</fact4>, not pebbles. So, he actually picked up 18 - 5 = 13 pebbles.

So, there are 50 + 32 = 82 purple cards.

Now, we can find the number of blue cards. According to the problem, <fact3>blue cards are as many as the sum of green and purple cards</fact3>. Therefore, the number of blue cards is <fact1>50 green cards</fact1> + 82 purple cards = 132 blue cards.

Finally, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of green, purple, and blue cards: <fact1>50 green cards</fact1> + 82 purple cards + 132 blue cards = 264 cards.

Benjamin's car breaks down. <fact1>The car weighs 1300 pounds</fact1> and he has <fact2>luggage in it weighing 200 pounds</fact2>. He also has his <fact3>4 young children who weigh 50 pounds each</fact3> in it. If <fact4>the force to move the car is 1% of the weight</fact4>, how much force does he need to push the car?

Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 
The car weighs <fact1>1300 pounds</fact1>. 
The luggage weighs <fact2>200 pounds</fact2>. 
The children weigh <fact3>4</fact3> x <fact3>50</fact3> = 200 pounds. 
So, the total weight is <fact1>1300</fact1> + <fact2>200</fact2> + 200 = 1700 pounds. 
Since <fact4>the force to move the car is 1% of the weight</fact4>, we need to calculate 1% of 1700 pounds. 
1% of 1700 pounds is 0.01 x 1700 = 17 pounds. 
Therefore, Benjamin needs 17 pounds of force to push the car.

The total weight is <fact1>2900 pounds</fact1> + <fact2>200 pounds</fact2> + <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact3>50 pounds</fact3> = 2900 + 200 + 100 = 3200 pounds. Since <fact4>the force to move the truck is 1% of the weight</fact4>, we need to calculate 1% of 3200 pounds, which is 0.01 * 3200 = 32 pounds.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much hay each horse needs. Since <fact2>each horse needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs</fact2> and <fact1>each alpaca needs 9 kg</fact1>, each horse needs 2 * <fact1>9</fact1> - 6 = 12 kg of hay.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much feed each turkey needs. Since <fact2>each turkey needs 5 kilograms less than twice the amount each pig needs</fact2> and <fact1>each pig needs 7 kilograms</fact1>, each turkey needs 2 * <fact1>7</fact1> - 5 = 9 kilograms of feed.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of feed needed for the pigs. Since there are <fact3>12 pigs</fact3> and <fact1>each pig needs 7 kilograms</fact1>, the total amount of feed needed for the pigs is <fact3>12</fact3> * <fact1>7</fact1> = 84 kilograms.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much grain each llama needs. Since <fact2>each llama needs 6 kilograms less than twice the amount each cow needs</fact2> and <fact1>each cow needs 11 kilograms</fact1>, each llama needs 2 * <fact1>11</fact1> - 6 = 16 kilograms. 

Now, we can calculate the total amount of grain needed for the cows and llamas. For the cows, we have <fact3>14 cows</fact3> * <fact1>11 kilograms per cow</fact1> = 154 kilograms. For the llamas, we have <fact4>40 llamas</fact4> * 16 kilograms per llama = 640 kilograms.

If there are <fact3>44 turkeys</fact3> and <fact4>24 ducks</fact4>, how many pounds of feed does Theo need?

Answer: To find out how much feed Theo needs, we first need to calculate how much feed each duck needs. Since <fact2>each duck needs 1 pounds less than twice the amount each turkey needs</fact2> and <fact1>each turkey needs 8 pounds</fact1>, each duck needs 2 * <fact1>8</fact1> - 1 = 15 pounds of feed. 

Since there are <fact3>44 turkeys</fact3> and each turkey needs <fact1>8 pounds</fact1> of feed, the total amount of feed needed for the turkeys is <fact3>44</fact3> * <fact1>8</fact1> = 352 pounds.

Each person sends <fact3>3 letters a week</fact3> and each letter is <fact4>5 pages long</fact4>, so Oscar receives 3 * 5 = 15 pages per person per week. 
Since Oscar responds in kind, he writes 15 pages per person per week as well. 
So, in total, Oscar writes 15 pages per person per week * 8 people = 120 pages per week. 
Since Oscar can write a <fact5>page every 13 minutes</fact5>, he spends 120 pages per week * 13 minutes per page = 1560 minutes per week writing. 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Oscar spends 1560 minutes per week / 60 = 26 hours per week writing.

How old was Santiago when he saw the Comet for the first time?

Answer: Since <fact1>Comet Halley orbits the sun every 70 years</fact1>, the time between when Santiago's dad saw the comet and when Santiago saw the comet for the first time is 70 years. Since <fact2>Santiago's dad saw the Comet when he was 32 years old</fact2>, Santiago was 32 years old when his dad saw the comet. Therefore, when Santiago saw the comet for the first time, he was 32 + 70 = 102 years old, but this is the age when Santiago's dad was 102 years old. However, we are looking for the age of Santiago when he saw the comet for the first time. We are given that <fact3>Santiago saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw the Comet</fact3>, which is 3 * 32 = 96 years old.

Since she has finished writing <fact2>4/5 of the essay</fact2>, and the total number of pages is <fact1>170 pages</fact1>, we can calculate the number of pages she has written as follows: 
<fact2>4/5</fact2> * <fact1>170 pages</fact1> = 136 pages.
Now, to find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages: 
<fact1>170 pages</fact1> - 136 pages = 34 pages.

How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Answer: Liam has to take <fact1>6 periods</fact1> + <fact2>1 extra class</fact2> = 7 classes per day. Since each class is <fact3>60 minutes long</fact3>, he spends 7 * <fact3>60</fact3> = 420 minutes per day in class.

He goes to class for <fact4>4 days a week</fact4>. He then spends <fact5>one-fourth of his weekly minutes</fact5> each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?

Answer: Wei has <fact1>8 periods</fact1> + <fact2>1 extra class</fact2> = 9 classes per day. Since each class is <fact3>50 minutes long</fact3>, he spends 9 * <fact3>50 minutes</fact3> = 450 minutes per day in class. He goes to class for <fact4>4 days a week</fact4>, so he spends 450 * <fact4>4</fact4> = 1800 minutes per week in class. He spends an additional <fact5>one-fourth of his weekly minutes</fact5> * 2 (for Saturday and Sunday) = 0.5 * 1800 = 900 minutes per week on extra learning time.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the meeting. We can do this by adding the number of engineers and nurses: <fact1>32 engineers</fact1> + <fact2>73 nurses</fact2> = 105 people. 

Then, we need to find out how many people left the meeting. Since <fact3>four-sixths of the total number of people left</fact3>, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows: (4/6) * 105 = 70 people.

Since we know that <fact4>30 engineers stayed at the meeting</fact4>, the number of engineers who left is <fact1>32 engineers</fact1> - <fact4>30 engineers</fact4> = 2 engineers.

This means that the number of nurses who left is 70 people - 2 engineers = 68 nurses.

Finally, we can find the number of nurses who stayed by subtracting the number of nurses who left from the total number of nurses: <fact2>73 nurses</fact2> - 68 nurses = 5 nurses.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the meeting. We can do this by adding the number of teachers and nurses: <fact1>67 teachers</fact1> + <fact2>68 nurses</fact2> = 135 people. 

Then, we need to find out how many people left the meeting. Since <fact3>three-fifths of the total number of people left</fact3>, we can calculate the number of people who left as follows: (3/5) * 135 = 81 people.

Now, we know that <fact4>19 doctors stayed at the meeting</fact4>. To find out how many artists stayed, we need to find out how many people stayed in total and subtract the number of doctors who stayed. 

The total number of people who stayed is 108 - 72 = 36 people. Since <fact4>19 doctors stayed at the meeting</fact4>, the number of artists who stayed is 36 - 19 = 17 artists.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the celebration. We know that there were <fact1>68 nurses</fact1> and <fact2>36 engineers</fact2>, so the total number of people is <fact1>68</fact1> + <fact2>36</fact2> = 104. 

Since <fact3>one-half of the total number of people left</fact3>, the number of people who left is 104 / 2 = 52. 

This means that 104 - 52 = 52 people stayed at the celebration. 

We know that <fact4>23 nurses stayed</fact4>, so the number of engineers who stayed is 52 - <fact4>23</fact4> = 29.

82,"Reformatted Question: At the beginning of the meeting, there were <fact1>44 nurses</fact1> and <fact2>66 engineers</fact2>. After 45 minutes, <fact3>three-sixths of the total number of people left</fact3>. How many engineers are left if <fact4>24 nurses stayed at the meeting</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the meeting. We can do this by adding the number of nurses and engineers: <fact1>44 nurses</fact1> + <fact2>66 engineers</fact2> = 110 people. 

Then, we need to find out how many people left the meeting. Since <fact3>three-sixths of the total number of people left</fact3>, we can calculate this as 3/6 * 110 = 55 people.

Since we know that <fact4>24 nurses stayed at the meeting</fact4>, the number of nurses who left is <fact1>44 nurses</fact1> - <fact4>24 nurses</fact4> = 20 nurses.

This means that the number of engineers who left is 55 people - 20 nurses = 35 engineers.

Finally, we can find the number of engineers who stayed by subtracting the number of engineers who left from the total number of engineers: <fact2>66 engineers</fact2> - 35 engineers = 31 engineers.

Answer: To find the number of engineers left, we first need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the celebration. This is the sum of <fact1>31 teachers</fact1> and <fact2>75 engineers</fact2>, which is 31 + 75 = 106 people. 

Since <fact4>1/2 of the total number of people left</fact4>, the number of people left is 106 / 2 = 53 people.

We are given that <fact5>21 teachers stayed</fact5> at the celebration. So, the number of engineers left is 53 - 21 = 32 engineers.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of people at the beginning of the conference. We know that there were <fact1>41 nurses</fact1> and <fact2>19 artists</fact2>, so the total number of people is <fact1>41</fact1> + <fact2>19</fact2> = 60.

Since <fact3>2/5 of the total number of people left</fact3>, the number of people who left is 2/5 * 60 = 24.

We are given that <fact4>30 nurses stayed at the conference</fact4>, which means that 11 nurses left (since <fact1>41</fact1> - <fact4>30</fact4> = 11).

Since a total of 24 people left, and 11 of them were nurses, the remaining 24 - 11 = 13 people who left must be artists.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many people left the conference. The total number of people at the beginning of the conference was <fact1>29 engineers</fact1> + <fact2>15 artists</fact2> = 44 people. Since <fact3>one-fourth of the total number of people left</fact3>, the number of people who left is 44 / 4 = 11 people. 

We know that <fact4>27 engineers stayed</fact4> at the conference, so the number of engineers who left is <fact1>29 engineers</fact1> - <fact4>27 engineers</fact4> = 2 engineers. 

Since 11 people left in total, and 2 of them were engineers, the remaining 11 - 2 = 9 people who left must be artists.

The total amount of fence is <fact1>200 feet</fact1>, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 200. Solving for x, we get 2x + 60 = 200, 2x = 140, and x = 70. Therefore, Sofia gets 70 feet of fence.

Answer: Let's denote the amount of fence Pavel gets as x. Since <fact2>Roya gets 100 yards more than Pavel</fact2>, Roya gets x + 100 yards. The total amount of fence they have is <fact1>320 yards</fact1>, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 100) = 320. Combine like terms: 2x + 100 = 320. Subtract 100 from both sides: 2x = 220. Divide both sides by 2: x = 110. So Pavel gets 110 yards of fence.

Answer: Since Jasmine can skip at <fact3>6 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>3/5 as fast as running</fact2>, we can find her running speed by dividing 6 by 3/5. This gives us 6 / (3/5) = 6 * (5/3) = 10 miles per hour. 

Since Jasmine can run <fact1>five times faster than she can walk</fact1>, her walking speed is 10 / 5 = 2 miles per hour.

She spends <fact5>2/4 of the time running</fact5>, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. So, she spends 1/2 * <fact4>6 hours</fact4> = 3 hours running. 

She also spends <fact6>three-sixths of the time walking</fact6>, which is equivalent to 1/2 of the time. So, she spends 1/2 * <fact4>6 hours</fact4> = 3 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 2 miles per hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.

If she can skip at <fact3>8 miles per hour</fact3>, how many miles can she travel in <fact4>4 hours</fact4> if she spends <fact5>2/4 of the time running</fact5> and <fact6>two-fourths of the time walking</fact6>?

Answer: Since Jasmine can skip at <fact3>8 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>4/5 as fast as running</fact2>, we can calculate her running speed as follows: 
Let's denote her running speed as R. Then, 4/5 * R = 8. 
R = 8 / (4/5) = 8 * (5/4) = 10 miles per hour.

Given that Jasmine can run <fact1>ten times faster than she can walk</fact1>, we can calculate her walking speed as follows: 
Let's denote her walking speed as W. Then, 10 * W = 10. 
W = 10 / 10 = 1 mile per hour.

Since she spends <fact5>2/4 of the time running</fact5> and <fact6>two-fourths of the time walking</fact6>, and the total time is <fact4>4 hours</fact4>, she spends 2 hours running and 2 hours walking.

The distance she travels while running is 2 hours * 10 miles per hour = 20 miles.
The distance she travels while walking is 2 hours * 1 mile per hour = 2 miles.

Therefore, the total distance she travels is 20 miles + 2 miles = 22 miles.

Answer: First, we need to find out how fast Sofia can run. We know that she can skip at <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3> and that skipping is <fact2>2/5 as fast as running</fact2>. So, if we multiply the skipping speed by 5/2, we can find the running speed: 2 * (5/2) = 5 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how fast Sofia can walk. We know that she can run <fact1>ten times faster than she can walk</fact1>, so if we divide the running speed by 10, we can find the walking speed: 5 / 10 = 0.5 miles per hour.

Now, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in <fact4>8 hours</fact4>. Sofia spends <fact5>three-fourths of the time running</fact5>, which is 8 * (3/4) = 6 hours, and <fact6>one-fourth of the time walking</fact6>, which is 8 * (1/4) = 2 hours.

The distance traveled while running is 5 miles per hour * 6 hours = 30 miles. The distance traveled while walking is 0.5 miles per hour * 2 hours = 1 mile.

Therefore, the total distance traveled is 30 + 1 = 31 miles.

Answer: Since Haruka can skip at <fact3>3 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>2/4 as fast as running</fact2>, we can set up the equation (2/4) * x = 3, where x is Haruka's running speed. Solving for x, we get x = 3 / (2/4) = 3 / 0.5 = 6 miles per hour. 

Now that we know Haruka's running speed is 6 miles per hour, we can find her walking speed. Since she can run <fact1>six times faster than she can walk</fact1>, her walking speed is 6 / 6 = 1 mile per hour.

Haruka spends <fact5>three-fifths of the time running</fact5> and <fact6>2/5 of the time walking</fact6>. So, in <fact4>10 hours</fact4>, she will run for (3/5) * 10 = 6 hours and walk for (2/5) * 10 = 4 hours.

The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 6 hours = 36 miles. The distance she travels while walking is 1 mile per hour * 4 hours = 4 miles.

So, the total distance she travels is 36 + 4 = 40 miles.

Answer: First, we need to find out how fast Priya can run. We know that <fact2>her skipping speed is 2/5 of her running speed</fact2>, and <fact3>her skipping speed is 4 miles per hour</fact3>. So, her running speed is <fact3>4</fact3> / <fact2>2/5</fact2> = 4 / 0.4 = 10 miles per hour.

Since <fact1>Priya can run five times faster than she can walk</fact1>, her walking speed is 10 / 5 = 2 miles per hour.

Now, we need to find out how many miles Priya can travel in <fact4>10 hours</fact4>. She spends <fact5>4/5 of the time running</fact5>, which is 10 * 4/5 = 8 hours. In these 8 hours, she can travel 8 * 10 = 80 miles.

She spends <fact6>one-fifth of the time walking</fact6>, which is 10 * 1/5 = 2 hours. In these 2 hours, she can travel 2 * 2 = 4 miles.

So, in total, Priya can travel 80 + 4 = 84 miles in <fact4>10 hours</fact4>.

If she can skip at <fact3>4 miles per hour</fact3>, how many miles can she travel in <fact4>8 hours</fact4> if she spends <fact5>two-fourths of the time running</fact5> and <fact6>one-half of the time walking</fact6>?

Answer: Since Tara can skip at <fact3>4 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>two-fifths as fast as running</fact2>, we can calculate her running speed as follows: 
Let's denote her running speed as R. We know that 2/5 * R = <fact3>4 miles per hour</fact3>. 
So, R = <fact3>4</fact3> / (2/5) = <fact3>4</fact3> * (5/2) = 10 miles per hour.

Given that Tara can run <fact1>two times faster than she can walk</fact1>, her walking speed is 10 / 2 = 5 miles per hour.

In <fact4>8 hours</fact4>, Tara spends <fact5>two-fourths of the time running</fact5> which is 2/4 * <fact4>8</fact4> = 4 hours, and <fact6>one-half of the time walking</fact6> which is 1/2 * <fact4>8</fact4> = 4 hours.

So, the distance she travels running is 10 miles per hour * 4 hours = 40 miles, and the distance she travels walking is 5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.

Therefore, the total distance Tara travels in <fact4>8 hours</fact4> is 40 + 20 = 60 miles.

Answer: Since Daphne can skip at <fact3>6 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>three-sixths as fast as running</fact2>, we can find her running speed by dividing 6 by 3/6, which is the same as multiplying by 6/3. So, her running speed is 6 * (6/3) = 12 miles per hour.

Since Daphne can run <fact1>eight times faster than she can walk</fact1>, her walking speed is 12 / 8 = 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends <fact5>one-half of the time running</fact5>, which is <fact4>4 hours</fact4> * 0.5 = 2 hours. She also spends <fact6>two-fourths of the time walking</fact6>, which is <fact4>4 hours</fact4> * 0.5 = 2 hours.

So, the distance she travels running is 2 hours * 12 miles per hour = 24 miles. The distance she travels walking is 2 hours * 1.5 miles per hour = 3 miles.

Therefore, the total distance she travels is 24 + 3 = 27 miles.

Answer: Since Mia can skip at <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>one-third as fast as running</fact2>, she can run at 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour. 
Since Mia can run <fact1>four times faster than she can walk</fact1>, she can walk at 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour. 
In <fact4>10 hours</fact4>, she spends <fact5>three-fifths of the time running</fact5>, which is (3/5) * 10 = 6 hours. 
In 6 hours of running, she can travel 6 * 6 = 36 miles.

Answer: Since Winnie can skip at <fact3>6 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>1/2 as fast as running</fact2>, she can run at 6 * 2 = 12 miles per hour. 
Since Winnie can run <fact1>six times faster than she can walk</fact1>, she can walk at 12 / 6 = 2 miles per hour. 
In <fact4>6 hours</fact4>, she spends <fact5>one-half of the time running</fact5> (3 hours) and <fact6>1/2 of the time walking</fact6> (3 hours).

Answer: Since Quinn can skip at <fact3>4 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>2/5 as fast as running</fact2>, we can set up the equation (2/5) * running speed = 4. Solving for running speed, we get running speed = 4 / (2/5) = 4 * (5/2) = 10 miles per hour.

Since Quinn can run <fact1>six times faster than she can walk</fact1>, her walking speed is 10 / 6 = 5/3 miles per hour.

Quinn spends <fact5>one-half of the time running</fact5> and <fact6>1/2 of the time walking</fact6>, so she runs for <fact4>6 hours</fact4> / 2 = 3 hours and walks for <fact4>6 hours</fact4> / 2 = 3 hours.

The distance she travels while running is 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles. The distance she travels while walking is (5/3) miles per hour * 3 hours = 5 miles.

The total distance Quinn travels is 30 miles + 5 miles = 35 miles.

Answer: First, we need to find out how long it takes Kayla to swim a mile on a warm day. Since it takes her <fact2>6 minutes more than thrice as long</fact2> as it does on a cold day, we need to first find out how long three times the cold day time is.

How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Mia wants to do with her friends. The cost of <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2> for each person is <fact5>₺10</fact5>. The cost of <fact4>the roller coaster seven times</fact4> for each person is <fact6>₺5</fact6> * 7 = ₺35. Additionally, each person will get <fact3>₺5 in pinball tokens</fact3>. So, the total cost per person is ₺10 + ₺35 + ₺5 = ₺50.

Since Mia's aunt has <fact1>₺300 budgeted for the party</fact1>, and Mia will also be participating in the activities, we need to subtract the cost of Mia's activities from the total budget. So, the remaining budget for her friends is ₺300 - ₺50 = ₺250.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find out how many friends Mia can invite. ₺250 / ₺50 = 5.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> at <fact5>€4</fact5> per round, so that's <fact5>€4</fact5> per person for mini-golf. Each person will also get <fact3>€10 in arcade tokens</fact3>, so that's <fact3>€10</fact3> per person for arcade tokens. Finally, each person will ride the <fact4>go-karts two times</fact4> at <fact6>€6</fact6> per ride, so that's <fact6>€6</fact6> * 2 = <fact6>€12</fact6> per person for go-karts. The total cost per person is <fact5>€4</fact5> + <fact3>€10</fact3> + <fact6>€12</fact6> = €26.

Now, let's divide the total budget of <fact1>€260</fact1> by the cost per person of €26 to find out how many people Isabella can invite. <fact1>€260</fact1> / €26 = 10. So, Isabella can invite 10 - 1 = 9 friends (since she's also counting herself).

The <fact6>go-karts cost €11 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the activities per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> at <fact5>€4 per round</fact5>, so that's <fact5>€4</fact5> per person for mini-golf. Each person will also get <fact3>€4 in arcade tokens</fact3>, so that's another <fact3>€4</fact3> per person. The <fact4>go-karts cost €11 a ride</fact4> and each person will ride the go-karts four times, so that's <fact6>€11</fact6> * 4 = <fact6>€44</fact6> per person for the go-karts. Therefore, the total cost per person is <fact5>€4</fact5> + <fact3>€4</fact3> + <fact6>€44</fact6> = €52 per person.

Since Chen's mom has <fact1>€260 budgeted for the party</fact1>, we can divide this amount by the cost per person to find out how many people she can invite. Let's assume Chen is also participating in the activities, so we'll subtract her cost from the total budget first. €260 - €52 = €208. Now we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person: €208 / €52 = 4. This means Chen can invite 4 friends to her party.

Answer: First, calculate the cost of Uma's activities. The cost of <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2> is <fact5>¥10</fact5>. The cost of <fact4>the roller coaster ten times</fact4> is <fact6>¥10</fact6> * 10 = ¥100. Add <fact3>¥10 in pinball tokens</fact3> for a total of ¥10 + ¥100 + ¥10 = ¥120 for Uma.

Each friend will cost <fact5>¥10</fact5> for <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2> and <fact6>¥10</fact6> * 10 = ¥100 for <fact4>the roller coaster ten times</fact4>, and <fact3>¥10 in pinball tokens</fact3> for a total of ¥10 + ¥100 + ¥10 = ¥120 per friend.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Xena wants to do with her friends. The cost of <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> for each person is <fact5>¥8</fact5>. The cost of <fact4>nine go-kart rides</fact4> for each person is <fact6>¥7</fact6> * 9 = ¥63. Additionally, each person gets <fact3>¥9 in arcade tokens</fact3>.

Since Xena's aunt has <fact1>¥160 budgeted for the party</fact1>, and Xena will also be participating in the activities, we can set up an equation to represent the situation: ¥80 * (number of friends + 1) = <fact1>¥160</fact1>.

How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities for Sophia. She will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> for <fact5>€4</fact5>, receive <fact3>€6 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and ride <fact4>the go-karts three times</fact4> for <fact6>€10</fact6> * 3 = €30. So, the total cost for Sophia is <fact5>€4</fact5> + <fact3>€6</fact3> + €30 = €40. 

Now, let's calculate how much money is left for her friends. <fact1>She had €120 budgeted for her birthday party</fact1>, and Sophia's activities cost €40, so there is €120 - €40 = €80 left for her friends.

Each friend will also play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> for <fact5>€4</fact5> and ride <fact4>the go-karts three times</fact4> for <fact6>€10</fact6> * 3 = €30, and receive <fact3>€6 in arcade tokens</fact3>. So, the total cost for each friend is <fact5>€4</fact5> + €30 + <fact3>€6</fact3> = €40.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend to find out how many friends Sophia can invite. €80 / €40 = 2.

The <fact6>bumper cars cost ₣6 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities for Roya. The cost of <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> is <fact5>₣9</fact5>. The cost of <fact4>bumper cars seven times</fact4> is <fact6>₣6</fact6> * 7 = ₣42. She also wants <fact3>₣4 in game room tokens</fact3>. So, the total cost for Roya is ₣9 + ₣42 + ₣4 = ₣55. 

Now, let's assume she invites x friends. The total cost for all of them will be ₣55 * (x + 1), since Roya is also participating in the activities. This total cost should not exceed the <fact1>₣220 budgeted for her birthday party</fact1>. 

So, we can set up the equation: ₣55 * (x + 1) = <fact1>₣220</fact1>. 

Solving for x, we get x = (<fact1>₣220</fact1> / ₣55) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.

Therefore, Roya can invite 3 friends to her birthday party.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the activities per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> at <fact5>¥5</fact5> per round, so that's <fact5>¥5</fact5> per person for bowling. Each person will also get <fact3>¥7 in game room tokens</fact3>, so that's <fact3>¥7</fact3> per person for tokens. Finally, each person will ride the <fact4>bumper cars two times</fact4> at <fact6>¥20</fact6> per ride, so that's <fact6>¥20</fact6> * 2 = ¥40 per person for bumper cars.

How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Gabrielle wants to do with her friends. The cost of <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2> for each person is <fact5>₺5</fact5>. The cost of <fact4>the roller coaster four times</fact4> for each person is <fact6>₺8</fact6> * 4 = ₺32. Additionally, each person will get <fact3>₺3 in pinball tokens</fact3>. Let's denote the number of friends Gabrielle can invite as x. Then, the total cost of the activities for Gabrielle and her friends is (<fact5>₺5</fact5> + <fact6>₺32</fact6> + <fact3>₺3</fact3>) * (x + 1), where x + 1 is the total number of people (Gabrielle and her friends).

The total cost should not exceed <fact1>₺120</fact1>. So, we can set up the inequality: (<fact5>₺5</fact5> + <fact6>₺32</fact6> + <fact3>₺3</fact3>) * (x + 1) ≤ <fact1>₺120</fact1>. Simplifying the inequality, we get (₺40) * (x + 1) ≤ ₺120.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Amelia wants to do. The cost of <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> is <fact5>₺7</fact5> per person. The cost of riding the <fact4>go-karts two times</fact4> is <fact6>₺7</fact6> * 2 = ₺14 per person. Additionally, each person will get <fact3>₺9 in arcade tokens</fact3>. Let's denote the number of friends Amelia can invite as x. Then, the total number of people (including Amelia) is x + 1.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities that Sofia wants to do with her friends. The cost of <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2> for each person is <fact5>$6</fact5>. The cost of <fact4>the roller coaster eight times</fact4> for each person is <fact6>$11</fact6> * 8 = $88. Additionally, each person will get <fact3>$6 in pinball tokens</fact3>. 

Let's denote the number of friends Sofia can invite as x. Then, the total number of people (including Sofia) is x + 1. The total cost of the activities is (<fact5>$6</fact5> + <fact6>$88</fact6> + <fact3>$6</fact3>) * (x + 1).

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the activities per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> at <fact5>$3 per round</fact5>, so that's <fact5>$3</fact5> per person for mini-golf. Each person will also get <fact3>$3 in arcade tokens</fact3>, so that's another <fact3>$3</fact3> per person. The <fact4>go-karts cost $10 a ride</fact4> and each person will ride the go-karts 5 times, so that's <fact6>$10</fact6> * 5 = $50 per person for the go-karts. Therefore, the total cost per person is <fact5>$3</fact5> + <fact3>$3</fact3> + $50 = $56.

Since Nia's uncle said she has <fact1>$280 budgeted for her birthday party</fact1>, we can divide the total budget by the cost per person to find out how many people she can invite. Let's assume Nia is also participating in the activities, so we'll subtract her cost from the total budget first. $280 - $56 = $224. Now we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person: $224 / $56 = 4. Therefore, Nia can invite 4 friends to her birthday party.

The cost of <fact4>the roller coaster three times</fact4> for each person is <fact6>¥11</fact6> * 3 = ¥33. Additionally, each person will get <fact3>¥7 in pinball tokens</fact3>. So, the total cost per person is <fact5>¥6</fact5> + ¥33 + <fact3>¥7</fact3> = ¥46.

Since Camila also wants to participate in these activities, we need to subtract her cost from the total budget. The total budget is <fact1>¥230</fact1>, and Camila's cost is ¥46, so the remaining budget for her friends is <fact1>¥230</fact1> - ¥46 = ¥184.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2>, have <fact3>₺7 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the go-karts four times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of mini-golf is ₺5</fact5>. <fact6>The go-karts cost ₺7 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Gabrielle wants to do. The cost of <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> is <fact5>₺5</fact5> per person. The cost of riding <fact4>the go-karts four times</fact4> is <fact6>₺7</fact6> per ride, so the total cost is 4 x <fact6>₺7</fact6> = ₺28 per person. Additionally, each person will get <fact3>₺7 in arcade tokens</fact3>. Let's denote the number of friends Gabrielle can invite as x. Then, the total cost of the activities will be (<fact5>₺5</fact5> + ₺28 + <fact3>₺7</fact3>) * (x + 1), since Gabrielle will also participate in the activities. This expression should be equal to or less than <fact1>₺120</fact1>, which is the budget for the party. So, we can set up the inequality: (₺5 + ₺28 + ₺7) * (x + 1) ≤ ₺120. Simplifying the inequality, we get: ₺40 * (x + 1) ≤ ₺120. Dividing both sides by ₺40, we get: x + 1 ≤ 3. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get: x ≤ 2. Therefore, Gabrielle can invite 2 friends to her party.

She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>€5 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster five times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of laser tag is €8</fact5>. <fact6>The roller coaster cost €9 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities that Valentina wants to do with her friends. The cost of <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2> for each person is <fact5>€8</fact5>. The cost of <fact4>the roller coaster five times</fact4> for each person is <fact6>€9</fact6> * 5 = €45. Additionally, each person will get <fact3>€5 in pinball tokens</fact3>. Let's denote the number of friends Valentina can invite as x. Then, the total cost of the activities for Valentina and her friends is (x + 1) * (<fact5>€8</fact5> + €45 + <fact3>€5</fact3>). This total cost should not exceed <fact1>€290</fact1>. We can set up the inequality (x + 1) * (€8 + €45 + €5) ≤ €290 and solve for x.

(x + 1) * €58 ≤ €290

x * €58 + €58 ≤ €290

x * €58 ≤ €232

x ≤ €232 / €58

x ≤ 4

So, Valentina can invite 4 friends to her birthday party.

How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> at <fact5>€9</fact5>, receive <fact3>€3 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and ride the go-karts three times at <fact6>€14 per ride</fact6>, for a total of 3 * <fact6>€14</fact6> = €42. The total cost per person is <fact5>€9</fact5> + <fact3>€3</fact3> + €42 = €54.

Now, we can divide the total budget of <fact1>€270</fact1> by the cost per person of €54 to find the number of people Keisha can invite, including herself. <fact1>€270</fact1> / €54 = 5.

Since Keisha is one of the 5 people, she can invite 5 - 1 = 4 friends.

The <fact6>bumper cars cost ¥11 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the activities Uma wants to do. The cost of <fact2>one round of bowling</fact2> is <fact5>¥5</fact5> per person. The cost of riding the <fact4>bumper cars nine times</fact4> is <fact6>¥11</fact6> * 9 = ¥99 per person. Additionally, each person gets <fact3>¥6 in game room tokens</fact3>. Let's denote the number of friends Uma can invite as x. Then, the total cost of the activities is (<fact5>¥5</fact5> + ¥99 + <fact3>¥6</fact3>) * (x + 1), since Uma is also participating. This total cost should not exceed <fact1>¥220</fact1>. So, we can set up the inequality: (¥5 + ¥99 + ¥6) * (x + 1) ≤ ¥220. Simplifying the inequality, we get ¥110 * (x + 1) ≤ ¥220. Dividing both sides by ¥110, we get x + 1 ≤ 2. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get x ≤ 1. Therefore, Uma can invite at most 1 friend.

The <fact6>go-karts cost $12 a ride</fact6>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: To determine how many friends Kayla can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> at <fact5>$3 per round</fact5>, receive <fact3>$3 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and ride the <fact4>go-karts two times</fact4> at <fact6>$12 per ride</fact6>. The total cost per person is <fact5>$3</fact5> + <fact3>$3</fact3> + 2 * <fact6>$12</fact6> = $3 + $3 + $24 = $30. 

Since Kayla's dad said she has <fact1>$210 budgeted for her birthday party</fact1>, we can divide the total budget by the cost per person to find the number of people she can invite. $210 / $30 = 7. However, this includes Kayla herself, so the number of friends she can invite is 7 - 1 = 6.

How many friends can she invite?

Answer: To determine how many friends Kayla can invite, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities and subtract that from her budget. The cost of laser tag for Kayla and her friends will be <fact5>$3 per person</fact5> * (number of friends + 1). The cost of the roller coaster will be <fact6>$7 per ride</fact6> * <fact4>4 rides</fact4> * (number of friends + 1). The cost of pinball tokens will be <fact3>$4 per person</fact3> * (number of friends + 1). Let's represent the number of friends as x. Then the total cost will be <fact5>$3</fact5> * (x + 1) + <fact6>$7</fact6> * <fact4>4</fact4> * (x + 1) + <fact3>$4</fact3> * (x + 1). This simplifies to 3x + 3 + 28x + 28 + 4x + 4 = 35x + 35.

Answer: To find the total number of eggs needed, we need to calculate the number of eggs eaten during the two periods. For the first period, <fact1>Theo eats 3 eggs a day</fact1> for <fact2>107 days</fact2>, so the total number of eggs eaten is <fact1>3 eggs/day</fact1> * <fact2>107 days</fact2> = 321 eggs. For the second period, <fact3>Theo eats 5 eggs a day</fact3> for <fact4>87 days</fact4>, so the total number of eggs eaten is <fact3>5 eggs/day</fact3> * <fact4>87 days</fact4> = 435 eggs. The total number of eggs needed is 321 + 435 = 756 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of dozens needed is 756 / 12 = 63.

Answer: Viktor will eat <fact1>5 eggs a day</fact1> * <fact2>108 days</fact2> = 540 eggs during the first period. He will eat <fact3>6 eggs a day</fact3> * <fact4>38 days</fact4> = 228 eggs during the second period. So, in total, Viktor will eat 540 + 228 = 768 eggs. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Viktor will need 768 / 12 = 64 dozen eggs. Note that <fact5>146 days</fact5> is indeed the total number of days, which is <fact2>108 days</fact2> + <fact4>38 days</fact4>, so the calculation is correct.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of eggs Pavel eats in the first 45 days. Since <fact1>Pavel eats 2 eggs a day for 45 days</fact1>, the total number of eggs is 2 * 45 = 90 eggs.

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggs Pavel eats in the next 95 days. Since <fact2>Pavel eats 6 eggs a day for 95 days</fact2>, the total number of eggs is 6 * 95 = 570 eggs.

Now, let's add the total number of eggs Pavel eats in both periods: 90 + 570 = 660 eggs.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the number of dozens: 660 / 12 = 55.

Therefore, Pavel will need 55 dozens of eggs for <fact3>140 days</fact3>.

Answer: To find the total number of eggs Xena needs, we need to calculate the number of eggs she eats in the first <fact2>36 days</fact2> and the next <fact4>39 days</fact4>. 
In the first <fact2>36 days</fact2>, she eats <fact1>3 eggs a day</fact1> * <fact2>36 days</fact2> = 108 eggs. 
In the next <fact4>39 days</fact4>, she eats <fact3>4 eggs a day</fact3> * <fact4>39 days</fact4> = 156 eggs.
