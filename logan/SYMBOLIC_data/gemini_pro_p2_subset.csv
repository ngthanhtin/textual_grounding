Then, <fact4>1/2 of the remoras swam away</fact4>. Later, Yara saw another <fact5>10-foot whale</fact5> with <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches</fact7> long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each whale's body length is covered by the remoras?

**Answer:**

First, we need to consider the first whale.  It started with <fact2>16 remoras</fact2>, and then <fact4>half swam away</fact4>, leaving 16 / 2 = 8 remoras.  Each remora is <fact3>12 inches</fact3> long, which is equivalent to 1 foot (since there are 12 inches in a foot).  So, the total length of the remaining remoras is 8 remoras * 1 foot/remora = 8 feet. The <fact1>first whale is 32 feet</fact1> long, so the percentage of its length covered by remoras is (8 feet / <fact1>32 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 25%.

Next, we consider the second whale. There are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches</fact7> long.  The total length of the remoras is 6 remoras * <fact7>8 inches/remora</fact7> = 48 inches.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, this is equivalent to 48 inches * (1 foot / 12 inches) = 4 feet.  The <fact5>second whale is 10 feet</fact5> long, so the percentage of its length covered by remoras is (4 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5>) * 100% = 40%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 40%) / 2 = 32.5%.

The answer is {32.5}.

Then, <fact4>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact4>. Later, Ali saw another <fact5>10-foot whale</fact5> with <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches long</fact7>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each whale's body length is covered by the remoras?


**Answer:**

First, we need to calculate the total length of remoras on the 30-foot whale.  There were initially <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, each <fact3>15 inches</fact3> long. So, their total length was 18 * 15 = 270 inches. Since <fact4>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, 18 * (1/3) = 6 remoras left.  This means there are now 18 - 6 = 12 remoras remaining on the <fact1>30-foot whale</fact1>. The total length of the remaining remoras is 12 * <fact3>15 inches</fact3> = 180 inches.  To compare this to the whale's length, we convert it to feet: 180 inches / 12 inches/foot = 15 feet. The percentage of the <fact1>30-foot whale's</fact1> length covered by remoras is (15 feet / <fact1>30 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 50%.


Next, we calculate the total length of remoras on the <fact5>10-foot whale</fact5>. There are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches</fact7> long.  Their total length is 6 * <fact7>8 inches</fact7> = 48 inches. Converting this to feet: 48 inches / 12 inches/foot = 4 feet.  The percentage of the <fact5>10-foot whale's</fact5> length covered by remoras is (4 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5>) * 100% = 40%.


Finally, to find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (50% + 40%) / 2 = 45%.


So, on average, 45% of each whale's body length is covered by remoras.

On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?


**Answer:**

First, we need to convert the remoras' lengths to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the remoras on the first dolphin are <fact3>12 inches</fact3> / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot long each. After <fact4>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, there were <fact2>24 remoras</fact2> * (1 - <fact4>1/3</fact4>) = 16 remoras remaining on the first dolphin. These remoras cover a total of 16 remoras * 1 foot/remora = 16 feet of the first dolphin's <fact1>32-foot</fact1> length.

The remoras on the second dolphin are <fact7>6 inches</fact7> / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet long each. The <fact6>4 remoras</fact6> cover a total of <fact6>4</fact6> remoras * 0.5 feet/remora = 2 feet of the second dolphin's <fact5>8-foot</fact5> length.

To find the average percentage of each dolphin's body length covered by remoras, we calculate the percentage for each dolphin and then average those percentages.

For the first dolphin, the percentage covered is (16 feet / <fact1>32 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 50%.

For the second dolphin, the percentage covered is (2 feet / <fact5>8 feet</fact5>) * 100% = 25%.

The average percentage covered is (50% + 25%) / 2 = 37.5%.

On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

**Answer:**

First, we need to convert inches to feet.  Each remora on the first dolphin is <fact3>18 inches</fact3> long, which is 18/12 = 1.5 feet long.  After <fact4>a third of the <fact2>24</fact2> remoras swam away</fact4>, there were 24 * (2/3) = 16 remoras left. The total length of these remoras is 16 * 1.5 feet = 24 feet.  This covers 24/<fact1>48</fact1> = 0.5 or 50% of the first <fact1>48-foot</fact1> dolphin.

Each remora on the second dolphin is <fact7>8 inches</fact7> long, which is 8/12 = 0.667 feet (approximately). The <fact6>6 remoras</fact6> have a total length of 6 * 0.667 = 4 feet (approximately). This covers 4/<fact5>10</fact5> = 0.4 or 40% of the second <fact5>10-foot</fact5> dolphin.

To find the average percentage covered, we average the percentages for each dolphin: (50% + 40%) / 2 = 45%.  So, on average, 45% of each dolphin's body length is covered by remoras.  The answer is {45}.

Then, <fact4>1/2 of the remoras swam away</fact4>. Later, Pavel saw another <fact5>10-foot whale</fact5> with <fact6>4 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>3 inches</fact7> long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each whale's body length is covered by the remoras?

**Answer:**

First, we need to convert inches to feet.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the remoras on the first whale are each <fact3>12 inches</fact3> / 12 inches/foot = 1 foot long. After <fact4>half the remoras swam away</fact4>, there were <fact2>18</fact2> * <fact4>1/2</fact4> = 9 remoras left on the <fact1>first whale</fact1>. These 9 remoras covered a total of 9 remoras * 1 foot/remora = 9 feet of the <fact1>45-foot whale</fact1>. This is (9 feet / <fact1>45 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 20% of the <fact1>first whale's</fact1> length.

The remoras on the <fact5>second whale</fact5> were <fact7>3 inches</fact7> long, which is <fact7>3</fact7> / 12 = 0.25 feet. The <fact6>4 remoras</fact6> covered a total of <fact6>4</fact6> * 0.25 feet = 1 foot of the <fact5>second whale</fact5>.  This is (1 foot / <fact5>10 feet</fact5>) * 100% = 10% of the <fact5>second whale's</fact5> length.

To find the average percentage covered, we add the percentages for each whale and divide by the number of whales: (20% + 10%) / 2 = 15%.  So, on average, 15% of each whale's body length was covered by remoras. The answer is {15}.

The first shark was <fact1>33 feet</fact1> long, which is equal to 33 * 12 = 396 inches.  Initially, there were <fact2>12 remoras</fact2> attached to it, each <fact3>22 inches</fact3> long.  So, the total length of the remoras was 12 * 22 = 264 inches.
Then, <fact4>a quarter of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so 12 * (1/4) = 3 remoras left.  This means 12 - 3 = 9 remoras remained. The total length of the remaining remoras was 9 * <fact3>22</fact3> = 198 inches. The percentage of the first shark's length covered by remoras is (198 / 396) * 100% â‰ˆ 50%.

1,"**Reformatted Question:** A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> to cover every <fact2>3 miles</fact2> of the city. However, we know that the <fact3>wind speed is going to be halved in one hour (60 minutes)</fact3>. If the <fact4>city is 72 miles across</fact4> from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact5>a quarter of the city</fact5>?

**Answer:**

The fog initially covers <fact2>3 miles</fact2> every <fact1>30 minutes</fact1>, meaning its speed is <fact2>3 miles</fact2> / <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> = 0.1 miles/minute.

A quarter of the city is <fact4>72 miles</fact4> / 4 = <fact5>18 miles</fact5>.

Since the wind speed is halved in <fact3>60 minutes</fact3> (1 hour), we need to determine if the fog reaches a quarter of the city (<fact5>18 miles</fact5>) before or after the wind speed change.

At the initial speed of 0.1 miles/minute, it would take <fact5>18 miles</fact5> / 0.1 miles/minute = 180 minutes to cover a quarter of the city.  Since 180 minutes is longer than the <fact3>60 minutes</fact3> it takes for the wind speed to change, we know the wind speed will be halved before the fog covers <fact5>18 miles</fact5>.

So, the fog travels for the first <fact3>60 minutes</fact3> at 0.1 miles/minute, covering 0.1 miles/minute * <fact3>60 minutes</fact3> = 6 miles.

Then, the wind speed halves, so the new speed is 0.1 miles/minute / 2 = 0.05 miles/minute.

The fog still needs to cover <fact5>18 miles</fact5> - 6 miles = 12 miles.  At the reduced speed, this will take 12 miles / 0.05 miles/minute = 240 minutes.

The total time is the initial <fact3>60 minutes</fact3> plus the additional 240 minutes, which equals 300 minutes.

Therefore, it will take 300 minutes for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city. The answer is {300}.

If the city is <fact4>72 miles</fact4> across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact5>1/4</fact5> of the city?


**Answer:**

The fog bank covers <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in <fact1>75 minutes</fact1>.  This means it covers 1 mile in <fact1>75</fact1>/<fact2>10</fact2> = 7.5 minutes.

We want to know how long it takes to cover <fact5>1/4</fact5> of the city. The city is <fact4>72 miles</fact4> across, so <fact5>1/4</fact5> of the city is (<fact5>1/4</fact5>) * <fact4>72</fact4> = 18 miles.

The problem mentions a change in wind speed after <fact3>one hour (60 minutes)</fact3>.  However, since we are calculating the time to cover only 18 miles, and at the initial speed the fog covers 10 miles in 75 minutes (which is more than an hour), the change in wind speed is irrelevant for this part of the question.  The change would only be a factor if we were calculating a time greater than 75 minutes since it takes longer than an hour to reach the first 10 miles.

Therefore, to cover 18 miles, it will take 18 miles * 7.5 minutes/mile = 135 minutes. The answer is {135}.

If the <fact4>city is 72 miles across</fact4> from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact5>1/3 of the city</fact5>?

**Answer:**

The fog bank covers <fact2>6 miles</fact2> in <fact1>60 minutes</fact1>, meaning its speed is <fact2>6</fact2> miles / <fact1>60</fact1> minutes = 0.1 miles per minute.  

We want to know how long it takes to cover <fact5>1/3</fact5> of the <fact4>72-mile city</fact4>, which is (<fact5>1/3</fact5>) * <fact4>72</fact4> miles = 24 miles.

Since the wind speed halves after <fact3>one hour (60 minutes)</fact3>, the fog will cover 0.1 miles/minute * 60 minutes = 6 miles in the first hour.

After the first hour, the speed becomes 0.1 miles/minute / 2 = 0.05 miles per minute.

We need to cover an additional 24 miles - 6 miles = 18 miles.

At the reduced speed, it will take 18 miles / 0.05 miles/minute = 360 minutes to cover the remaining distance.

If the <fact4>city is 54 miles across</fact4> from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact5>1/2 of the city</fact5>?

**Answer:**

First, we determine the initial speed of the fog bank.  It covers <fact2>5 miles</fact2> in <fact1>25 minutes</fact1>, so its speed is <fact2>5</fact2>/<fact1>25</fact1> = 0.2 miles per minute.

Half of the <fact4>city</fact4> is <fact4>54</fact4> * <fact5>1/2</fact5> = 27 miles.

At the initial speed, it would take 27 miles / 0.2 miles/minute = 135 minutes to cover half the city.  However, we know the <fact3>wind speed will be halved in one hour (60 minutes)</fact3>.  So, we need to figure out how far the fog travels in the first 60 minutes, and then calculate the remaining time at the reduced speed.

In the first 60 minutes, the fog travels 0.2 miles/minute * 60 minutes = 12 miles.

This leaves 27 - 12 = 15 miles to be covered at the reduced speed. The reduced speed is 0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles/minute.

The time it takes to cover the remaining 15 miles is 15 miles / 0.1 miles/minute = 150 minutes.

Therefore, the total time to cover half the city is 60 minutes (at the initial speed) + 150 minutes (at the reduced speed) = 210 minutes.

**Answer:**

The fog bank covers <fact2>3 miles</fact2> in <fact1>90 minutes</fact1>. This means the speed of the fog bank is <fact2>3 miles</fact2> / <fact1>90 minutes</fact1> = 1/30 miles per minute.

Since the wind speed is halved after 60 minutes (or 1 hour as stated in <fact3>), we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the first portion of the city before the wind speed change and then the remaining portion after the wind change.

* **Before wind change:** The fog travels for 60 minutes at a speed of 1/30 miles per minute, covering a distance of (1/30) * 60 = 2 miles.

* **After wind change:** The speed is halved, becoming (1/30) / 2 = 1/60 miles per minute. The fog still needs to cover 26 - 2 = 24 miles.  At the reduced speed, this will take 24 miles / (1/60 miles/minute) = 1440 minutes.

Answer: 
A <fact1>d4 die</fact1> has four possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For the first scenario (<fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>):
* The numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, and 4.  So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4.
* The probability of this happening twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

For the second scenario (<fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>):
* The odd numbers on a d4 are 1 and 3. So there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2.
* The probability of this happening four times in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

The numbers <fact2>greater than 5</fact2> are 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.  There are 5 such numbers.  The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 <fact3>twice in a row</fact3> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

The <fact4>even numbers</fact4> on a d10 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. There are 5 such numbers.  The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%.  The probability of rolling four even numbers <fact5>in a row</fact5> is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16 = 6.25%.

The difference in percentage points is 25% - 6.25% = 18.75 percentage points.

Answer:
The numbers on a standard <fact1>d6 die</fact1> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. This means there are 3 outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes where the roll is greater than 3. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2> is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

The odd numbers on a <fact1>d6 die</fact1> are 1, 3, and 5.  This means there are 3 outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes where the roll is odd. So the probability of rolling an odd number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.
The probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/16 = 6.25%.

The difference in percentages is 25% - 6.25% = 18.75 percentage points.

**Answer:**

1. **Students who hike:** The number of students who like to hike is <fact8>5 less than twice the number</fact8> who like to play <fact5>cricket</fact5>.  Since <fact5>39 students like cricket</fact5>, twice that number is 39 * 2 = 78. Five less than that is 78 - 5 = 73 students. So, <fact7>73 students like to hike</fact7>.

2. **Students with other hobbies:** The total number of students with hobbies other than video games and hiking is <fact2>12 (painting)</fact2> + <fact3>8 (chess)</fact3> + <fact4>13 (swimming)</fact4> + <fact5>39 (cricket)</fact5> = 72 students.

3. **Students who play video games or hike:** The total number of students is <fact1>290</fact1>. Subtracting the students with other hobbies (72) leaves 290 - 72 = 218 students who either play video games or hike.

4. **Students who play video games:**  Since 73 students like to <fact7>hike</fact7>, and 218 students <fact6>play video games or hike</fact6>, the number of students who play video games is 218 - 73 = 145 students.

5. **Percentage of students who play video games:**  The percentage of students who <fact6>play video games</fact6> is (145 students / <fact1>290 total students</fact1>) * 100% = 50%.

What percentage of the students like to <fact6>play video games</fact6> if the number of the students that like to <fact7>play music</fact7> is <fact8>7 less than two times the number that prefer playing volleyball</fact8>?

**Answer:**

First, let's figure out the number of students who like to play music.  <fact8>Two times the number of students who like volleyball</fact8> is 2 * <fact5>32</fact5> = 64. Seven less than this is 64 - <fact8>7</fact8> = 57. Therefore, 57 students like to play music.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of students with hobbies other than video games or music. This includes those who like to <fact2>dance</fact2>, <fact3>play chess</fact3>, <fact4>swim</fact4>, and <fact5>play volleyball</fact5>. That's <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>32</fact5> = 58 students.

Now, we can determine how many students like to play video games or music. The total number of students is <fact1>230</fact1>, and we've accounted for 58 with other hobbies, so there are <fact1>230</fact1> - 58 = 172 students who either play video games or music.

Since we know 57 of these students <fact7>play music</fact7>, the remaining students must <fact6>play video games</fact6>: 172 - 57 = 115 students.

Finally, to find the percentage of students who like to play video games, we divide the number of students who play video games (115) by the total number of students (<fact1>230</fact1>) and multiply by 100: (115/<fact1>230</fact1>) * 100 = 50%.

What percentage of the students like to dance if <fact7>the number of the students that like to read is 2 less than two times the number that prefer playing football</fact7>?

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the number of students who like to read:**
   Two times the number of students who like football is 2 * <fact5>17</fact5> = 34.
   The number of students who like to read is 34 - <fact7>2</fact7> = 32.

2. **Calculate the combined number of students with hobbies other than dancing or reading:**
   The total is <fact2>20</fact2> (paint) + <fact3>8</fact3> (chess) + <fact4>13</fact4> (swim) + <fact5>17</fact5> (football) = 58 students.

3. **Calculate the number of students who like to dance or read:**
   The total number of students is <fact1>150</fact1>. Subtracting those with other hobbies, we get 150 - 58 = 92 students who like to either dance or read.

4. **Calculate the number of students who like to dance:**
   We know 32 students like to read, and 92 like to either read or dance. So, 92 - 32 = 60 students like to dance.

5. **Calculate the percentage of students who like to dance:**
   The percentage is (60/<fact1>150</fact1>) * 100 = 40%.

What percentage of the students like to paint if <fact6>the number of the students that like to play video games is 3 less than two times the number that prefer playing football</fact6>?


**Answer:**

First, let's find the number of students who like to play video games.  <fact6>The question tells us this is 3 less than two times the number who like football</fact6>. Since <fact5>9 students like football</fact5>, two times that number is 9 * 2 = 18. Three less than 18 is 18 - 3 = 15 students.  So, 15 students like to play video games.

Next, let's figure out how many students like to either paint or play video games. We know the total number of students is <fact1>150</fact1>, and we are given the numbers for various hobbies: <fact2>music (27)</fact2>, <fact3>chess (8)</fact3>, <fact4>swimming (13)</fact4>, and <fact5>football (9)</fact5>. The total number of students engaged in these hobbies is 27 + 8 + 13 + 9 = 57.

The remaining students must like to paint or play video games. This number is <fact1>150 (total students)</fact1> - 57 = 93.

Since we know 15 students like video games, the number of students who like to paint is 93 - 15 = 78.

Finally, we need to find the percentage of students who like to paint. This is calculated as (78 / <fact1>150</fact1>) * 100% = 52%.  Therefore, 52% of the students like to paint.

What percentage of the students like to dance <fact7>if the number of the students that like to play music is 5 less than ten times the number that prefer playing cricket</fact7>?

**Answer:**

First, let's figure out the number of students who like to play music.  Since <fact5>2 students like cricket</fact5>, and <fact7>the music lovers are 5 less than ten times that number</fact7>, there are 10 * <fact5>2</fact5> - <fact7>5</fact7> = 15 students who enjoy music.

Next, we calculate the total number of students with hobbies other than dancing or music.  This is <fact2>14 (hiking)</fact2> + <fact3>8 (chess)</fact3> + <fact4>13 (swimming)</fact4> + <fact5>2 (cricket)</fact5> = 37 students.

Since there are <fact1>100 students in total</fact1>, and <fact6>the remaining students like either dancing or music</fact6>, the combined number of dancers and music lovers is <fact1>100</fact1> - 37 = 63 students.

We know 15 students like music, so the number of students who like to dance is 63 - 15 = 48 students.

Finally, to express this as a percentage, we divide the number of dancers by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (48 / <fact1>100</fact1>) * 100 = 48%.  Therefore, 48% of the students like to dance.  The answer is {48}.

What percentage of the students like to read if the number of the students that like to paint is <fact6>4 less than thrice the number that prefer playing football</fact6>?

**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out the number of students who like to paint.  Since <fact5>23 students like football</fact5>, and the number of painters is <fact6>4 less than thrice that number</fact6>, we have 3 * <fact5>23</fact5> - <fact6>4</fact6> = 69 - 4 = 65 students who prefer painting.

Next, we need to determine the number of students accounted for by the given hobbies (excluding reading and painting). This is <fact2>17 (baking)</fact2> + <fact3>8 (chess)</fact3> + <fact4>13 (swimming)</fact4> + <fact5>23 (football)</fact5> = 61 students.

The total number of students in the class is <fact1>150</fact1>. We know that 61 students pursue the listed hobbies and 65 students prefer painting. So, the number of students who like to read is <fact1>150</fact1> - 61 - 65 = 24 students.

Finally, to calculate the percentage of students who like to read, we divide the number of readers by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (24 / <fact1>150</fact1>) * 100 = 16%.  Therefore, 16% of the students like to read.  The answer is {16}.

She also uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 5 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

**Answer:**

Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (51:5)</fact1>, we have s/w = 51/5.
From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (7 tablespoons milk : 5 cups water)</fact2>, we have m/w = 7/5.
From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons cream : 1 teaspoon sugar)</fact3>, we have c/s = 2/1 or c = 2s.

We are given that the total quantity of ingredients is <fact4>220</fact4>:  s + w + m + c = 220.

We can express w, m, and c in terms of s:

* w = (5/51)s
* m = (7/5)w = (7/5) * (5/51)s = (7/51)s
* c = 2s

Now substitute these into the total quantity equation:

s + (5/51)s + (7/51)s + 2s = 220

Combine the terms with 's':

(1 + 5/51 + 7/51 + 2)s = 220
(3 + 12/51)s = 220
(3 + 4/17)s = 220
(55/17)s = 220

Now, solve for s:

s = (220 * 17) / 55
s = (4 * 17)
s = 68

Therefore, Olivia used 68 teaspoons of sugar.  The answer is {68}.

She also uses <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer:
Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (48:10)</fact1>, we have s/w = 48/10. This simplifies to w = (10/48)s = (5/24)s.

From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (6 tablespoons for every 10 cups)</fact2>, we have m/w = 6/10. This means m = (3/5)w. Substituting the expression for 'w' in terms of 's', we get m = (3/5)*(5/24)s = (1/8)s.

From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons for every teaspoon)</fact3>, we have c/s = 2/1. So, c = 2s.

We are given that <fact4>the total quantity of ingredients used is 210</fact4>. Therefore, s + w + m + c = 210. Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get:
s + (5/24)s + (1/8)s + 2s = 210

Multiplying throughout by 24 to eliminate fractions:
24s + 5s + 3s + 48s = 5040
70s = 5040
s = 5040 / 70
s = 72

Therefore, Olga used 72 teaspoons of sugar. The answer is {72}.

She used a total of <fact4>240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer:
Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.
From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (54:12)</fact1>, we can simplify it to 9:2. So, s = (9/2)w.
From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (7 tablespoons for every 2 cups)</fact2>, we have m = (7/2)w.
From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons for every teaspoon)</fact3>, we have c = 2s.
The total quantity is <fact4>240</fact4>, so s + w + m + c = 240.
Substituting the expressions for s, m, and c in terms of w into the total quantity equation:
(9/2)w + w + (7/2)w + 2s = 240
(9/2)w + w + (7/2)w + 2*(9/2)w = 240
(9/2)w + (2/2)w + (7/2)w + (18/2)w = 240
(9+2+7+18)/2 * w = 240
(36/2)w = 240
18w = 240
w = 240/18
w = 40/3

Now, substitute the value of w back into the equation for s:
s = (9/2)w
s = (9/2) * (40/3)
s = (9*40) / (2*3)
s = 360/6
s = 60

Therefore, Gabrielle used 60 teaspoons of sugar.  The answer is {60}.

She also uses <fact2>9 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>170 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

**Answer:**

Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (48:7)</fact1>, we know s = (48/7)w.
From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (9:7)</fact2>, we know m = (9/7)w.
From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2:1)</fact3>, we know c = 2s.

We are given that the total quantity of ingredients is <fact4>170</fact4>, so s + w + m + c = 170.

Substituting the expressions for s, m, and c in terms of w, we get:

(48/7)w + w + (9/7)w + 2(48/7)w = 170

Simplifying the equation:
(48/7)w + (7/7)w + (9/7)w + (96/7)w = 170
(160/7)w = 170
w = (170 * 7) / 160
w = 7.4375

Now we can find the amount of sugar (s) using the ratio from <fact1>48:7</fact1>:
s = (48/7)w
s = (48/7) * 7.4375
s â‰ˆ 51

Since the question asks for teaspoons of sugar, and we must assume whole numbers of ingredients, we can round the value of 's' to the nearest whole number, which is 51. 

To check this, if s=51:
w â‰ˆ 7.4375, which we'll round to 7.
m = (9/7) * 7 = 9
c = 2 * 51 = 102
Total: 51 + 7 + 9 + 102 = 169, which is very close to 170. It's possible that very small rounding errors during the calculations caused the slight discrepancy, but 51 is the most reasonable answer.

She used a total of <fact8>240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact8>. How many <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> did she use?

**Answer:**

Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact3>the ratio of sugar to water</fact3>, we have s/w = 55/44.  So w = (44/55)s.

From <fact4>milk to water ratio</fact4>, we have m/w = 6/24 = 1/4.  So m = (1/4)w. Substituting w = (44/55)s, we get m = (1/4)*(44/55)s = (11/55)s.

From <fact6>cream to sugar ratio</fact6>, we have c/s = 2/1.  So c = 2s.

We are given that the total quantity of ingredients is <fact8>240</fact8>. Thus, s + w + m + c = 240. Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get:

s + (44/55)s + (11/55)s + 2s = 240

Multiplying through by 55 to eliminate fractions:

55s + 44s + 11s + 110s = 13200
220s = 13200
s = 13200 / 220
s = 60

From <fact1>the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water</fact1>, we have s:w = 45:5, which simplifies to s:w = 9:1, or s = 9w.
From <fact2>the ratio of tablespoons of milk to cups of water</fact2>, we have m:w = 8:4, which simplifies to m:w = 2:1, or m = 2w.
From <fact3>the ratio of tablespoons of cream to teaspoons of sugar</fact3>, we have c:s = 2:1, or c = 2s.
We are given that the total quantity used is <fact4>210</fact4>, so s + w + m + c = 210.
Substituting the expressions for s, m, and c in terms of w, we get:

The <fact6>grapes can be harvested every 4 months</fact6>. <fact7>In the span of two years</fact7>, how many more apricots does Hiroshi harvest than grapes?

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of apricots harvested per hectare. Since there are <fact2>28 apricots per two-fourths (or one-half) hectare</fact2>, there are 28 * 2 = 56 apricots per full hectare.  Hiroshi has <fact1>20 hectares of apricot fields</fact1>, so he harvests 56 * <fact1>20</fact1> = 1120 apricots per harvest.  Since he harvests <fact3>every 6 months</fact3>, and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he harvests 24/<fact3>6</fact3> = 4 times in two years. This means he harvests a total of 1120 apricots/harvest * 4 harvests = 4480 apricots in two years.

Next, let's calculate the number of grapes harvested. Hiroshi's <fact4>12-hectare grape field</fact4> produces <fact5>14 grapes per hectare</fact5>, for a total of <fact4>12</fact4> * <fact5>14</fact5> = 168 grapes per harvest. He harvests grapes <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>, so in <fact7>two years (24 months)</fact7>, he harvests 24/<fact6>4</fact6> = 6 times. This gives him a total of 168 grapes/harvest * 6 harvests = 1008 grapes in two years.

Finally, the difference in the number of apricots and grapes harvested in two years is 4480 apricots - 1008 grapes = 3472. The answer is {3472}.

The <fact6>apples can be harvested every 4 months</fact6>. <fact7>In the span of two years</fact7>, how many more grapes does Oliver harvest than apples?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of grapes harvested per hectare. Since there are <fact2>15 grapes per 1/3 hectare</fact2>, there are 15 * 3 = 45 grapes per full hectare. Oliver has <fact1>15 hectares</fact1> of grape fields, so he harvests 45 * <fact1>15</fact1> = 675 grapes in total per harvest.

Next, let's find out how many grape harvests occur in <fact7>two years</fact7>. Since there are 12 months in a year, two years is 12 * 2 = 24 months.  <fact3>Grapes are harvested every 4 months</fact3>, so there are 24 / <fact3>4</fact3> = 6 harvests in two years.  This means Oliver harvests 675 grapes * 6 harvests = 4050 grapes in two years.


Now, let's calculate the number of apples harvested. Oliver's <fact4>9-hectare</fact4> apple field produces <fact5>16 apples per hectare</fact5>, so he harvests <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact5>16</fact5> = 144 apples per harvest.

Similar to the grape harvests, apples are also harvested <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>.  Over <fact7>two years (24 months)</fact7>, there are 24 / <fact6>4</fact6> = 6 apple harvests. This means Oliver harvests 144 apples * 6 harvests = 864 apples in two years.


Finally, to find the difference, subtract the total number of apples harvested from the total number of grapes harvested: 4050 grapes - 864 apples = 3186.

Therefore, Oliver harvests 3186 more grapes than apples in two years.

The apricots can be harvested <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more grapes does Mohammed harvest than apricots?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of grapes harvested per square meter. Since there are <fact2>12 grapes per 2/3 of a square meter</fact2>, there are 12 / (2/3) = 12 * (3/2) = 18 grapes per square meter.

Next, let's find the total number of grapes in Mohammed's <fact1>35 square meter grape field</fact1>: 18 grapes/square meter * <fact1>35 square meters</fact1> = 630 grapes.

Since Mohammed harvests his grapes <fact3>every 6 months</fact3>, and there are two 6-month periods in a year, he harvests twice a year. Over <fact7>two years</fact7>, he harvests 2 harvests/year * <fact7>2 years</fact7> = 4 times.

The total number of grapes harvested in <fact7>two years</fact7> is 630 grapes/harvest * 4 harvests = 2520 grapes.


Now let's calculate the number of apricots harvested. Mohammed's <fact4>11-square meter apricot field</fact4> produces <fact5>18 apricots per square meter</fact5>, for a total of <fact4>11</fact4> * <fact5>18</fact5> = 198 apricots per harvest.

Since the apricots are harvested <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>, and there are three 4-month periods in a year, he harvests three times a year.  Over <fact7>two years</fact7>, he harvests 3 harvests/year * <fact7>2 years</fact7> = 6 times.

The total number of apricots harvested in <fact7>two years</fact7> is 198 apricots/harvest * 6 harvests = 1188 apricots.

Finally, the difference in the number of grapes and apricots harvested is 2520 grapes - 1188 apricots = 1332.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more watermelons does Yusuf harvest than grapes?


**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many watermelons Yusuf harvests per square yard. Since there are <fact2>19 watermelons per two-sixths of a square yard</fact2>, there are 19 * (6/2) = 57 watermelons per square yard.  With a <fact1>10 square yard watermelon field</fact1>, he harvests 57 * <fact1>10</fact1> = 570 watermelons per harvest.

Over <fact7>two years (24 months)</fact7>, and harvesting <fact3>every 2 months</fact3>, Yusuf harvests watermelons 24/<fact3>2</fact3> = 12 times.  This means he harvests a total of 12 * 570 = 6840 watermelons.

Next, let's determine the grape harvest.  Yusuf's <fact4>9-square yard grape field</fact4> produces <fact5>14 grapes per square yard</fact5>, yielding 9 * <fact5>14</fact5> = 126 grapes per harvest.

Over <fact7>two years (24 months)</fact7>, harvesting <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>, he harvests grapes 24/<fact6>4</fact6> = 6 times. This results in a total of 6 * 126 = 756 grapes.

Finally, to find the difference, subtract the total number of grapes harvested from the total number of watermelons harvested: 6840 - 756 = 6084.  Therefore, Yusuf harvests 6084 more watermelons than grapes in two years.  The answer is {6084}.

The apricots can be harvested <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more bananas does Ravi harvest than apricots?

**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many bananas are produced per square yard.  Since <fact2>36 bananas grow in four-fifths of a square yard</fact2>, we can set up a proportion: 36 bananas / (4/5) square yards = x bananas / 1 square yard.  Solving for x, we get x = 45 bananas per square yard.

Next, calculate the total banana production per harvest. Ravi has <fact1>10 square yards</fact1> and produces 45 bananas per square yard, so he harvests 10 * 45 = 450 bananas each harvest.

Now, calculate the total apricot production per harvest. Ravi's apricot field is <fact4>13 square yards</fact4> and produces <fact5>12 apricots per square yard</fact5>, yielding 13 * 12 = 156 apricots per harvest.

Since there are 12 months in a year, <fact7>two years</fact7> is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 months. Both bananas and apricots are harvested <fact3>every 4 months</fact3> and <fact6>every 4 months</fact6> respectively, meaning there are 24 / 4 = 6 harvests in two years.

Over two years, Ravi harvests 450 bananas/harvest * 6 harvests = 2700 bananas.  He also harvests 156 apricots/harvest * 6 harvests = 936 apricots.

The difference between the number of bananas and apricots harvested is 2700 - 936 = 1764. Therefore, Ravi harvests 1764 more bananas than apricots in two years.

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the number of oranges Thiago harvests per harvest. Since there are <fact2>23 oranges per one-fourth of a square yard</fact2>, there are 23 * 4 = 92 oranges per square yard. Thiago has <fact1>25 square yards</fact1> of orange field, so he harvests 92 * <fact1>25</fact1> = 2300 oranges per harvest.  He harvests oranges <fact3>every 12 months</fact3>, and since there are two 12-month periods in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he harvests oranges twice.  Therefore, in two years, he harvests 2300 oranges/harvest * 2 harvests = 4600 oranges.

Next, let's calculate the number of grapes Thiago harvests per harvest.  He has a <fact4>9-square yard</fact4> grape field that yields <fact5>13 grapes per square yard</fact5>, so each harvest yields <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact5>13</fact5> = 117 grapes.  He harvests grapes <fact6>every 4 months</fact6>. Since there are twelve months in a year, he harvests grapes 12 months/year / <fact6>4 months/harvest</fact6> = 3 times per year.  Over <fact7>two years</fact7>, that's 3 harvests/year * <fact7>2 years</fact7> = 6 harvests. This means he harvests a total of 117 grapes/harvest * 6 harvests = 702 grapes.

If the <fact9>farmer has three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total weight of hay: <fact1>6 boxes * 3 pounds/box</fact1> = 18 pounds.

Next, the total weight of cucumbers: <fact2>15 bags * 8 pounds/bag</fact2> = 120 pounds.

Then, the total weight of apples: <fact3>34 packs * 43 pounds/pack</fact3> = 1462 pounds.

The total weight of wheat: <fact4>18 sacks * 15 pounds/sack</fact4> = 270 pounds.

Now, let's add the weight of groceries (<fact5>43 pounds</fact5>), tools (<fact6>27 pounds</fact6>), and wood (<fact7>100 pounds</fact7>): 43 + 27 + 100 = 170 pounds.

Adding all the weights together: 18 + 120 + 1462 + 270 + 170 = 2040 pounds.

Since each truck can carry <fact8>170 pounds</fact8> and the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, the total carrying capacity per trip is 170 pounds/truck * <fact9>3 trucks</fact9> = 510 pounds.

Finally, to find the number of trips, divide the total weight by the carrying capacity per trip: 2040 pounds / 510 pounds/trip = 4 trips.

The bin of stuffed animals has <fact2>5 stuffed animals</fact2> inside. The number of action figures in the action figure pack is <fact3>twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined</fact3>. The crayon box has <fact4>12 different colors of crayon</fact4>, and the sticker book has <fact5>6 pages, each with 9 stickers</fact5>. The tower of stacking rings has <fact6>34 multicolored rings</fact6> on it. Mia recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing <fact7>her total number of items for her brother up to 290</fact7>. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?


Answer:
The number of action figures is <fact3>twice the combined number of blocks and stuffed animals</fact3>, which is 2 * (<fact1>42</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2>) = 2 * 47 = 94 action figures.

The sticker book has <fact5>6 pages with 9 stickers each</fact5>, for a total of 6 * 9 = 54 stickers.

Adding up all the individual toys, excluding the bouncy balls, we have: <fact1>42 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>5 stuffed animals</fact2> + 94 action figures + <fact4>12 crayons</fact4> + 54 stickers + <fact6>34 rings</fact6> = 241 items.

Since Mia has a <fact7>total of 290 items</fact7>, and 241 are accounted for, the tube of bouncy balls must contain 290 - 241 = 49 bouncy balls. 

The answer is {49}.

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes: <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>14 ounces/cube</fact2> = 126 ounces.

Next, the medium cubes: <fact9>15 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>6 ounces/cube</fact3> = 90 ounces.

Then, the small cubes: <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>0.5 ounces/cube</fact4> = 7 ounces.

Now, let's figure out how many tiny cubes there are.  He made a total of <fact6>50 ice cubes</fact6>, and we know he made <fact7>9</fact7> + <fact9>15</fact9> + <fact8>14</fact8> = 38 cubes of other sizes. Therefore, he made <fact6>50</fact6> - 38 = 12 tiny cubes.

Since <fact5>tiny cubes are half the size of small cubes</fact5>, each tiny cube uses <fact4>0.5 ounces</fact4> / 2 = 0.25 ounces. So, the tiny cubes used 12 cubes * 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces.

The total water used is 126 + 90 + 7 + 3 = 226 ounces.

Alejandro started with <fact1>309 ounces</fact1> and used 226 ounces, so he has <fact1>309</fact1> - 226 = 83 ounces left.

2. **Medium cubes:** He used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>4 ounces/cube</fact3> = 48 ounces of water.

3. **Small cubes:** He used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 ounces/cube (or 0.5 ounces)</fact4> = 7 ounces of water.

4. **Tiny cubes:** Since there are <fact6>48 total cubes</fact6> and he made <fact7>10 giant</fact7> + <fact9>12 medium</fact9> + <fact8>14 small</fact8> = 36 cubes of other sizes, he must have made <fact6>48</fact6> - 36 = 12 tiny cubes.  Each tiny cube uses <fact5>half the water of a small cube</fact5>, or <fact4>2/4</fact4> / 2 = 1/4 (or 0.25) ounce of water. Therefore, he used 12 tiny cubes * 1/4 ounce/cube = 3 ounces of water.

**Answer:**

Each bowl can hold <fact2>four times</fact2> the number of almonds a plate can hold, meaning each bowl holds <fact1>20</fact1> * 4 = 80 almonds.

Initially, Gabriel had <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 broke</fact6>, leaving him with <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 bowl. This bowl can hold 80 almonds.  He also has <fact4>9 plates</fact4>, each holding <fact1>20 almonds</fact1>, for a total capacity of <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact1>20</fact1> = 180 almonds.

Gabriel started with <fact3>675 almonds</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth</fact7> of them, meaning he ate <fact3>675</fact3> * (1/5) = 135 almonds.

The number of almonds remaining is <fact3>675</fact3> - 135 = 540 almonds.

Since Gabriel's plates and bowl can hold 260 almonds, he needs additional capacity for 540 - 260 = 280 almonds.

1. **Calculate the capacity of a plate:** Each plate can hold <fact2>two times</fact2> the capacity of a bowl, which means each plate holds <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact1>40 crackers</fact1> = 80 crackers.

2. **Calculate the initial total capacity:** Ali starts with <fact4>8 bowls</fact4> * <fact1>40 crackers/bowl</fact1> = 320 crackers' worth of bowl space.  He also has <fact5>5 plates</fact5> * 80 crackers/plate = 400 crackers' worth of plate space. The total initial capacity is 320 + 400 = 720 crackers.

3. **Account for broken plates:** <fact6>Two plates break</fact6>, reducing the plate capacity by 2 * 80 crackers/plate = 160 crackers. The new total capacity is 720 - 160 = 560 crackers.

4. **Calculate crackers remaining after eating:** Ali eats <fact7>one-ninth</fact7> of his <fact3>675 crackers</fact3>, meaning he eats (<fact7>1/9</fact7>) * <fact3>675</fact3> = 75 crackers. He has 675 - 75 = 600 crackers remaining.

5. **Calculate crackers that won't fit:**  Ali has 600 crackers and a total capacity of 560, meaning 600 - 560 = 40 crackers won't fit.

6. **Calculate additional bowls needed:**  Since each bowl holds <fact1>40 crackers</fact1>, and 40 crackers don't fit, he needs 40 crackers / <fact1>40 crackers/bowl</fact1> = 1 more bowl.

Therefore, Ali needs 1 more bowl. The answer is {1}.

12,"**Reformatted Question:** Sanjay places almonds on bowls and plates. <fact1>Each bowl can hold 30 almonds</fact1> while <fact2>each plate can hold three times that</fact2>. Sanjay has <fact3>675 almonds</fact3>, <fact4>12 bowls</fact4> and <fact5>3 plates</fact5>. Unfortunately, <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>. Sanjay then <fact7>eats one-ninth of all the almonds</fact7>. <fact8>How many more bowls does Sanjay need</fact8> so he can place all the remaining almonds?


**Answer:**

First, let's figure out the capacity of each plate: each plate holds <fact2>three times</fact2> the number of almonds a bowl holds, so each plate can hold <fact1>30</fact1> * 3 = 90 almonds.

Initially, Sanjay had <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 broke</fact6>, leaving him with <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 plate.  This plate can hold 90 almonds.  He also has <fact4>12 bowls</fact4>, each holding <fact1>30 almonds</fact1>, for a total capacity of <fact4>12</fact4> * <fact1>30</fact1> = 360 almonds.  Together, the bowls and plate can hold 90 + 360 = 450 almonds.

Sanjay started with <fact3>675 almonds</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-ninth</fact7> of them, so he ate <fact3>675</fact3> / 9 = 75 almonds.  This leaves him with <fact3>675</fact3> - 75 = 600 almonds.

Since his remaining bowls and plate can only hold 450 almonds, he needs additional containers for 600 - 450 = 150 almonds. Since <fact8>he needs more bowls</fact8>, and each bowl holds <fact1>30 almonds</fact1>, he'll need 150 / <fact1>30</fact1> = 5 more bowls.

Carlos then <fact7>eats one-fifth of all the crackers</fact7>. How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining crackers?


**Answer:**

Each table can hold <fact2>three times</fact2> the number of crackers a bowl can hold, which is 3 * <fact1>20</fact1> = 60 crackers.

Initially, Carlos had <fact5>4 tables</fact5>, but <fact6>2 broke</fact6>, leaving him with <fact5>4</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 2 tables. These 2 tables can hold 2 * 60 = 120 crackers.

Carlos started with <fact3>525 crackers</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth</fact7> of them, meaning he ate <fact3>525</fact3> * (1/5) = 105 crackers.

This leaves him with <fact3>525</fact3> - 105 = 420 crackers.

After placing crackers on the tables, he has 420 - 120 = 300 crackers remaining.

Carlos has <fact4>13 bowls</fact4> which can hold <fact4>13</fact4> * <fact1>20</fact1> = 260 crackers.

Since he has 300 crackers left and the bowls can only hold 260, he needs space for an additional 300 - 260 = 40 crackers.

Since <fact1>each bowl holds 20 crackers</fact1>, he needs 40 / <fact1>20</fact1> = 2 more bowls.

Benjamin then <fact7>eats one-eighth of all the crackers</fact7>. <fact8>How many more bowls does Benjamin need</fact8> so he can place all the remaining crackers?

**Answer:**

1. **Plate Capacity:** Each plate can hold <fact2>two times</fact2> the number of crackers a bowl can hold, so each plate holds 2 * <fact1>21</fact1> = 42 crackers.

2. **Initial Crackers:** Benjamin starts with <fact3>720 crackers</fact3>.

3. **Crackers Eaten:** Benjamin eats <fact7>one-eighth</fact7> of the crackers, which is (<fact7>1/8</fact7>) * <fact3>720</fact3> = 90 crackers.

4. **Remaining Crackers:** After eating, Benjamin has <fact3>720</fact3> - 90 = 630 crackers left.

5. **Surviving Plates:** <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, leaving <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 plate.

6. **Crackers on the Plate:** The remaining plate holds 1 * 42 = 42 crackers.

7. **Crackers for Bowls:** After filling the plate, there are 630 - 42 = 588 crackers left to put in bowls.

8. **Existing Bowl Capacity:** Benjamin has <fact4>9 bowls</fact4>, which can hold <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact1>21</fact1> = 189 crackers.

How many more bowls does Wei need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer:
A plate can hold <fact2>four</fact2> times the number of crackers a bowl can hold, which is <fact2>4</fact2> * <fact1>25</fact1> = 100 crackers.
Wei originally had <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 broke</fact6>, leaving him with <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 plate.
Wei starts with <fact3>630 crackers</fact3> and eats <fact7>one-sixth</fact7> of them, so he eats <fact3>630</fact3> / <fact7>6</fact7> = 105 crackers.
The number of crackers remaining is <fact3>630</fact3> - 105 = 525 crackers.
The remaining 1 plate holds 1 * 100 = 100 crackers.
Wei has <fact4>12 bowls</fact4> which can hold <fact4>12</fact4> * <fact1>25</fact1> = 300 crackers.
The total number of crackers the existing bowls and plate can hold is 100 + 300 = 400 crackers.
Wei has 525 crackers remaining, and his bowls and plate can hold 400, leaving 525 - 400 = 125 crackers that need to be placed in additional bowls.
Since each bowl holds <fact1>25 crackers</fact1>, Wei needs 125 / <fact1>25</fact1> = 5 more bowls.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at <fact4>three times</fact4> the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, <fact5>Emma's speed has decreased by half</fact5> both on the beach and sidewalk. If <fact6>56 minutes</fact6> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk, in minutes?


**Answer:**

Before the injury, Emma walked 14 kilometers on the beach in some amount of time *t*.  Since her speed is halved after the injury (<fact5>), she now takes twice as long, 2*t, to walk the same distance on the beach (<fact2>). We are told this time is <fact6>56 minutes</fact6>. So, 2*t = <fact6>56 minutes</fact6>, which means t = 28 minutes. This was her time on the beach *before* the injury.

Her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was three times her speed on the beach (<fact4>).  So, if it took her 28 minutes to walk the 14 km on the beach, it would have taken her 28 / 3 = 9.33 minutes to walk 14 km on the sidewalk at that faster pace (before the injury).

Since the sidewalk portion of her walk is 18 km (<fact3>), not 14 km, we can set up a proportion to find the pre-injury sidewalk time:

(9.33 minutes / 14 km) = (x minutes / 18 km)

Solving for x, we get approximately 12 minutes. This was her sidewalk time before the injury.

After the injury, her speed was halved on *both* the beach and the sidewalk (<fact5>). So, her beach time is now 28 minutes * 2 = 56 minutes (as given - <fact6>).  Her sidewalk time is now 12 minutes * 2 = 24 minutes.

Therefore, her total walking time after the injury is 56 minutes + 24 minutes = 80 minutes. The answer is {80}.

If <fact6>65 minutes</fact6> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 29-mile walk, in minutes?


**Answer:**

Since Olivia walks <fact2>13 miles</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>65 minutes</fact6>, her original speed on the beach (before the injury, <fact5>which halved her speed</fact5>) was 13 miles / (65/2 minutes) = 13 miles / 32.5 minutes = 0.4 miles per minute.

<fact4>On the sidewalk, she walks four times faster</fact4>, so her original sidewalk speed was 4 * 0.4 miles per minute = 1.6 miles per minute.  Her current sidewalk speed (after the injury, <fact5>which halved her speed</fact5>) is 1.6 / 2 = 0.8 miles per minute.

She walks <fact3>16 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk at 0.8 miles per minute, so it takes her 16 miles / 0.8 miles/minute = 20 minutes on the sidewalk.

Therefore, her total walking time is <fact6>65 minutes</fact6> (beach) + 20 minutes (sidewalk) = 85 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Fatima walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach.

If <fact6>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-mile walk, in minutes?


**Answer:**

Before the injury, let's say Fatima's speed on the beach was 'x' miles per minute. This means she walked at 3x miles per minute on the sidewalk (<fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4>).

After the injury, her speeds were halved (<fact5>Fatima's speed has decreased by half</fact5>). So, her beach speed became x/2 miles per minute, and her sidewalk speed became 3x/2 miles per minute.

We know she spends <fact6>44 minutes on the beach</fact6> covering <fact2>11 miles</fact2>.  So her post-injury beach speed is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles per minute (x/2). This means her pre-injury beach speed was x = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 miles per minute.  

Therefore, her pre-injury sidewalk speed was 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 miles per minute, and her post-injury sidewalk speed is 1.5 / 2 = 0.75 miles per minute.

She walks <fact3>15 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 0.75 miles per minute. So, the time she takes on the sidewalk is <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 0.75 miles/minute = 20 minutes.

The total time for her walk is the time spent on the beach plus the time spent on the sidewalk, which is <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> + 20 minutes = 64 minutes.

Therefore, it takes her 64 minutes to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>. The answer is {64}.

However, <fact5>due to a recent injury, Rania's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>42 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-kilometer walk, in minutes?

**Answer:**

Rania spends <fact6>42 minutes</fact6> walking <fact2>14 kilometers on the beach</fact2>.  Because her speed on the beach has been halved <fact5>due to injury</fact5>, it would have taken her 42 / 2 = 21 minutes to walk the 14 kilometers on the beach at her original speed.

<fact4>Rania walks twice as fast on the sidewalk compared to the beach</fact4>. So, at her original speed, the 14 kilometers on the sidewalk would have taken her 21 / 2 = 10.5 minutes.

Since her speed on the sidewalk is also halved <fact5>due to the injury</fact5>, the 14 kilometers on the sidewalk now takes her 10.5 * 2 = 21 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Rania takes to complete her <fact1>28-kilometer walk</fact1> is the time spent on the beach (<fact6>42 minutes</fact6>) + the time spent on the sidewalk (21 minutes) = 63 minutes.  The answer is {63}.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5> both on the beach and sidewalk. If <fact6>40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?


**Answer:** 
Ananya spends <fact6>40 minutes</fact6> walking <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach.  Due to her injury, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, meaning it now takes her twice as long to cover the same distance.  Without the injury, it would have taken her <fact6>40</fact6> / 2 = 20 minutes to walk those <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach.

Since she walks at <fact4>twice the speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, without the injury she would have taken 20 / 2 = 10 minutes to walk the <fact3>10 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk.

With the injury, her speed is halved on both surfaces. So, the sidewalk portion now takes her 10 * 2 = 20 minutes.

In total, with the injury, Ananya takes <fact6>40 minutes</fact6> (beach) + 20 minutes (sidewalk) = 60 minutes to complete her <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1>. The answer is {60}.

On the sidewalk, Keisha walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, <fact5>Keisha's speed has decreased by half</fact5> both on the beach and sidewalk. If <fact6>51 minutes</fact6> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 33-mile walk, in minutes?


**Answer:**

Before her injury, it took Keisha <fact6>51 minutes</fact6> to walk <fact2>17 miles</fact2> on the beach.  Because her speed has decreased by half (<fact5>), it now takes her twice as long to walk the same distance on the beach. So, it takes her <fact6>51</fact6> * 2 = 102 minutes to walk the <fact2>17 miles</fact2> on the beach.

Since Keisha walks at two times the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach (<fact4>), before the injury, the 16 miles on the sidewalk would have taken half the time it took her to walk the 17 miles on the beach.  With her injury, it takes her 102 minutes to walk the 17 miles on the beach. So, before the injury, it would have taken her 102/2=51 minutes to walk 17 miles on the beach. Because her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach, it would have taken her 51/2=25.5 minutes to walk 16 miles on the sidewalk. Since her speed has decreased by half due to her injury, it now takes her 25.5 * 2 = 51 minutes to walk the <fact3>16 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk.

The total time it takes Keisha to complete her walk is the time spent on the beach plus the time spent on the sidewalk. Therefore, it takes her 102 + 51 = 153 minutes to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>.

What is the least amount Leon can spend on everything?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total cost of the school supplies before any discounts.

* **Crayons:** <fact1>8 crayons</fact1> * <fact2>Â¥7.0/crayon</fact2> = Â¥56
* **Notebooks:** <fact3>8 notebooks</fact3> * <fact4>Â¥13.75/notebook</fact4> = Â¥110
* **Bond paper:** <fact5>1 ream</fact5> * <fact6>Â¥10/ream</fact6> = Â¥10
* **Folders:** <fact7>4 folders</fact7> * <fact8>Â¥11/folder</fact8> = Â¥44

Total cost before discount: Â¥56 + Â¥110 + Â¥10 + Â¥44 = Â¥220

Now let's calculate the cost with the membership discount:

* **Discount:** Â¥220 * <fact10>20%</fact10> = Â¥44
* **Price after discount:** Â¥220 - Â¥44 = Â¥176
* **Total cost with membership (including fee):** Â¥176 + <fact9>Â¥20</fact9> = Â¥196

Next, let's calculate the cost with the non-membership discount:

* **Discount:** Â¥220 * <fact11>5%</fact11> = Â¥11
* **Total cost without membership:** Â¥220 - Â¥11 = Â¥209

Comparing the two options, the least amount Leon can spend is Â¥196 with the membership. The answer is {196}.

On <fact1>Wednesday and Thursday</fact1>, he <fact2>watched 4-hour episodes</fact2> of his favorite show each night. On <fact3>Friday</fact3>, he <fact4>watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show</fact4>. On Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a <fact5>5-hour episode</fact5> and a <fact6>15-minute show</fact6>. On Sunday, he <fact7>watched four 3-hour episodes</fact7>. On Monday, he <fact8>watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact8>. If he <fact9>watched 28 hours of TV in all</fact9>, how many <fact3>30-minute episodes</fact3> did he watch on <fact3>Friday</fact3>?

**Answer:**

Here's how we can break down Faisal's TV watching:

* **Wednesday/Thursday:** He watched two <fact2>4-hour episodes</fact2> each day, totaling 2 nights * 2 episodes/night * 4 hours/episode = 16 hours.
* **Saturday:** He watched a <fact5>5-hour episode</fact5> and a <fact6>15-minute show</fact6>, totaling 5 hours + 0.25 hours = 5.25 hours.
* **Sunday:**  He watched <fact7>four 3-hour episodes</fact7>, totaling 4 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 12 hours.
* **Monday:** He watched <fact8>three 45-minute episodes</fact8>, totaling 3 episodes * 0.75 hours/episode = 2.25 hours.

So far, he's watched 16 + 5.25 + 12 + 2.25 = 35.5 hours.  However, the question states that he watched a total of <fact9>28 hours</fact9>. There appears to be an issue with the information provided as the calculated total hours exceed the stated total hours watched. 

If we disregard the initial total and only focus on finding how many shows he watched on Friday based on a 28 hour total, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate known watch time:** Subtract the watch time from all other days from the total watch time: 28 hours - (16 hours + 5.25 hours + 12 hours + 2.25 hours) = -7.5 hours.  This negative result reinforces the contradictory information.

2. **Assuming 28 hours is correct,** Friday's watch time must make up the difference, which is 28 total hours â€“ (Weds/Thurs total + Sat total + Sun total + Mon total).

However, since the times given add up to more than 28 hours, there is a contradiction in the problem, making it unsolvable as written. If the 28-hour total is correct, then the individual times must be reevaluated.

**Answer:**

Here's how we can figure out how many 30-minute episodes Thiago watched on Thursday:

1. **Calculate total time spent watching TV (excluding Thursday):**
    * <fact1>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact1>: <fact2>5 hours/night</fact2> * 2 nights = 10 hours
    * <fact5>Friday</fact5>: <fact7>5 hours + 30 minutes</fact7> = 5.5 hours
    * <fact8>Saturday</fact8>: <fact10>Three 4-hour episodes</fact10> = 12 hours
    * <fact11>Sunday</fact11>: <fact12>Two 15-minute episodes</fact12> = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours
    * Total (excluding Thursday): 10 + 5.5 + 12 + 0.5 = 28 hours

2. **Calculate time spent watching TV on <fact15>Thursday</fact15>:**
    * <fact13>Total time watched</fact13> - Time watched on other days = Time watched on Thursday
    * 31 hours - 28 hours = 3 hours

3. **Calculate the number of <fact14>30-minute episodes</fact14> watched on <fact15>Thursday</fact15>:**
    * Time spent watching on Thursday / Length of each episode = Number of episodes
    * 3 hours * (60 minutes/hour) / <fact4>30 minutes/episode</fact4> = 6 episodes

Therefore, Thiago watched 6 thirty-minute episodes on Thursday.  The answer is {6}.

**Answer:** Let 'x' be the number of forks Valentina initially bought <fact1>.  Her husband brought <fact2>19</fact2> more forks, making the total x + 19.  She then <fact3>used</fact3> <fact3>6</fact3> and <fact4>discarded</fact4> <fact4>8</fact4> forks, reducing the total to (x + 19) - 6 - 8 = x + 5. Her guests brought <fact5>2 packs of 8 forks</fact5>, or 2 * 8 = 16 forks. This brought the total to x + 5 + 16 = x + 21.  Finally, we know <fact6>she had 49 forks</fact6>, so x + 21 = 49. Solving for x, we get x = 49 - 21 = 28.  Therefore, Valentina initially bought 28 forks.  The answer is {28}.

**Answer:**

Let's denote the number of spoons Uma initially bought as 'x'.

* Uma's husband brought <fact1>11 spoons</fact1>.  
* Uma used <fact2>7 spoons</fact2> and discarded <fact3>5 defective spoons</fact3>.
* The guests brought <fact4>2 packs * 5 spoons/pack = 10 spoons</fact4>.

How many plates were in the package that Sakura bought?

**Answer:**

Let 'x' be the number of plates in the package Sakura initially bought <fact1>.  At this point, Sakura has 'x' plates.

Her husband gives her <fact2>7 more plates</fact2>. Now she has x + 7 plates.

She <fact3>uses 8</fact3> and <fact4>discards 15</fact4> defective plates. This means she now has x + 7 - 8 - 15 = x - 16 plates.

Her guests bring <fact5>2 packs of 15 plates</fact5>, totaling 2 * 15 = 30 plates.  So now she has x - 16 + 30 = x + 14 plates.

Finally, we know she <fact6>has 56 plates</fact6>.  Therefore, x + 14 = 56.

**Answer:**

Let 'x' represent the number of forks in the package Isabella initially bought <fact1>.  Her husband brought <fact2>14</fact2> more forks.  So, she had x + <fact2>14</fact2> forks.

She then used <fact3>7</fact3> forks and discarded <fact4>7</fact4> more. This means she had x + <fact2>14</fact2> - <fact3>7</fact3> - <fact4>7</fact4> = x + 0 or just 'x' forks remaining.

Answer:
For each grandchild, Sakura needs <fact7>5</fact7> (vest) + <fact8>4</fact8> (cardigan) + <fact9>10</fact9> (shawl) + <fact10>12</fact10> (gloves) + <fact11>9</fact11> (mittens) = 40 skeins of wool.

For herself, she needs <fact12>2 jackets</fact12> * <fact13>4 skeins/jacket</fact13> = 8 skeins.

In total, she needs 160 + 8 = 168 skeins.

Since <fact14>a dozen skeins cost $9</fact14>, and she needs 168 skeins, she needs 168 / 12 = 14 dozens. The total cost before the discount is 14 * $9 = $126.

The store has a promotion where customers <fact15>receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100</fact15>. How much should Valeria pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total skeins needed for the grandchildren's winter wear.  For each grandchild, Valeria needs:

* <fact2>Tunic</fact2>: <fact7>6 skeins</fact7>
* <fact3>Hat</fact3>: <fact8>6 skeins</fact8>
* <fact4>Shawl</fact4>: <fact9>12 skeins</fact9>
* <fact5>Booties</fact5>: <fact10>12 skeins</fact10>
* <fact6>Gloves</fact6>: <fact11>13 skeins</fact11>

This is a total of 6 + 6 + 12 + 12 + 13 = 49 skeins per grandchild. Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 49 * 4 = 196 skeins for them.

For her <fact12>own jackets</fact12>, she needs <fact13>4 skeins</fact13> * 2 = 8 skeins.

In total, Valeria needs 196 + 8 = 204 skeins of wool.

Now let's figure out the cost.  Since <fact14>a dozen skeins costs $9</fact14>, each skein costs $9 / 12 = $0.75.  Therefore, 204 skeins will cost 204 * $0.75 = $153.

Since her total cost is over $100, she gets a <fact15>$20 discount</fact15>.  So, Valeria should pay $153 - $20 = $133.

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total skeins needed for the grandchildren's winter wear. For each grandchild, Valentina needs <fact7>5</fact7> + <fact8>3</fact8> + <fact9>9</fact9> + <fact10>10</fact10> + <fact11>11</fact11> = 38 skeins. Since she has <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 38 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 190 skeins for them.

Next, let's calculate the skeins needed for her own jackets. She needs <fact12>2 jackets</fact12> * <fact13>7 skeins/jacket</fact13> = 14 skeins.

Adding the skeins for her grandchildren and herself, Valentina needs a total of 190 + 14 = 204 skeins.

Now, let's calculate the cost. Since <fact14>a dozen skeins costs $7</fact14>, each skein costs $7/12.  Therefore, 204 skeins cost (204 * $7) / 12 = $119.

Finally, let's factor in the discount. Since $119 is over $100, Valentina gets a <fact15>$20 discount</fact15>. So, she should pay $119 - <fact15>$20</fact15> = $99.

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the total skeins needed for the grandchildren.  For each grandchild, Uma needs <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>3</fact3> + <fact4>12</fact4> + <fact5>11</fact5> + <fact6>15</fact6> = 46 skeins. Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 46 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 184 skeins for them.

For her own jackets, she needs <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>10 skeins/jacket</fact8> = 20 skeins.

In total, Uma needs 184 + 20 = 204 skeins of wool.

Since <fact9>a dozen skeins costs $9</fact9>, each skein costs $9/12 = $0.75.  Therefore, the total cost for 204 skeins is 204 * $0.75 = $153.

The store has a promotion where customers <fact15>receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100</fact15>. How much should Roya pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate the wool needed for the grandchildren's winter wear. For each grandchild, Roya needs <fact7>5</fact7> (cardigan) + <fact8>3</fact8> (poncho) + <fact9>8</fact9> (sweater) + <fact10>10</fact10> (socks) + <fact11>14</fact11> (mittens) = 40 skeins. Since she has <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 40 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 200 skeins for them.

Next, let's calculate the wool needed for Roya's jackets. She needs <fact12>2 jackets</fact12> * <fact13>8 skeins/jacket</fact13> = 16 skeins.

In total, Roya needs 200 + 16 = 216 skeins of wool.

Now, let's figure out the cost. Since <fact14>a dozen (12) skeins cost $8</fact14>, each skein costs $8 / 12 = $0.67 (approximately).  So, 216 skeins would cost 216 * $0.67 = $144.72.

Finally, since the total cost is over $100, Roya gets a <fact15>$20 discount</fact15>. So, the final price she pays is $144.72 - $20 = $124.72.


Since the question asks how much she *should* pay, we could also calculate the price per dozen. 216 skeins is 216/12 = 18 dozens. This costs 18 * $8 = $144.  After the $20 discount, the final price is $144 - $20 = $124.

The slight difference is due to rounding in the per-skein calculation. Either $124.72 or $124 are acceptable depending on how the store handles partial dozens and rounding. If they only sell by the dozen she would need 18 and so the answer would be $124.

How many more ounces of breads does Carlos need to consume than Zahra?

**Answer:**

Carlos's daily calorie target is <fact5>200 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 3000 calories.  Since he <fact7>burned 150 calories</fact7>, his net target is 3000 + <fact7>150</fact7> = 3150 calories. He has <fact6>already consumed 900 calories</fact6>, so he needs to consume 3150 - <fact6>900</fact6> = 2250 more calories.

Zahra's daily calorie target is <fact8>150 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 2250 calories.  She has <fact9>consumed 900 calories in food</fact9> and <fact10>225 calories in ice cream</fact10>, for a total of <fact9>900</fact9> + <fact10>225</fact10> = 1125 calories.

Answer:
Ibrahim's daily calorie target is <fact5>190 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 2850 calories.  Considering his consumed and burned calories (<fact6>950</fact6> - <fact7>200</fact7>), he needs 2850 - (950 - 200) = 2100 more calories.

Priya's daily calorie target is <fact8>170 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 2550 calories. Considering her food and ice cream intake (<fact9>1100</fact9> + <fact10>250</fact10>), she needs 2550 - (1100 + 250) = 1200 more calories.

A bag of popcorn has <fact1>300 calories/serving</fact1> * <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 1500 calories total. Since a bag weighs <fact2>325 grams</fact2>, each calorie corresponds to 325 grams / 1500 calories = 0.2167 grams/calorie.

The healthy daily calorie target is <fact4>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact4>. <fact5>Yuki weighs 210 lbs</fact5>, and he has <fact6>already consumed 1050 calories</fact6> and <fact7>burned 150 calories through exercise</fact7>. <fact8>Jasmine weighs 140 lbs</fact8>, and she has <fact9>already consumed 900 in food</fact9> and <fact10>200 calories in ice cream</fact10>. How many more ounces of breads does Yuki need to consume than Jasmine?


**Answer:**

1. **Yuki's target calorie intake:** <fact5>Yuki weighs 210 lbs</fact5>, so his daily calorie target is <fact5>210 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 3150 calories.

2. **Yuki's remaining calorie needs:** Yuki has <fact6>consumed 1050 calories</fact6> and <fact7>burned 150 calories</fact7>, so his net intake is <fact6>1050</fact6> - <fact7>150</fact7> = 900 calories.  Therefore, he needs 3150 - 900 = 2250 more calories.

3. **Jasmine's target calorie intake:** <fact8>Jasmine weighs 140 lbs</fact8>, so her daily calorie target is <fact8>140 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 2100 calories.

4. **Jasmine's remaining calorie needs:** Jasmine has <fact9>consumed 900 calories in food</fact9> and <fact10>200 calories in ice cream</fact10>, for a total of <fact9>900</fact9> + <fact10>200</fact10> = 1100 calories. She needs 2100 - 1100 = 1000 more calories.

5. **Ounces of bread per calorie:** A <fact2>350-ounce</fact2> bag has <fact3>5 servings</fact3>, and each serving has <fact1>250 calories</fact1>. So, the bag has <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>250</fact1> = 1250 calories.  This means there are <fact2>350 ounces</fact2> / 1250 calories = 0.28 ounces of bread per calorie.

6. **Ounces of bread Yuki needs:** Yuki needs 2250 calories * 0.28 ounces/calorie = 630 ounces of bread.

7. **Ounces of bread Jasmine needs:** Jasmine needs 1000 calories * 0.28 ounces/calorie = 280 ounces of bread.

8. **Difference in bread consumption:** Yuki needs 630 - 280 = 350 more ounces of bread than Jasmine.


Therefore, Yuki needs to consume 350 more ounces of bread than Jasmine.

The healthy daily calorie target is <fact4>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact4>. <fact5>Theo weighs 250 lbs</fact5>, and he has <fact6>already consumed 1100 calories</fact6> and <fact7>burned 150 calories through exercise</fact7>. <fact8>Sakura weighs 130 lbs</fact8>, and she has <fact9>already consumed 900 in food</fact9> and <fact10>175 calories in ice cream</fact10>. How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura?

**Answer:**

Theo's daily calorie target is <fact5>250 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 3750 calories.  He has a net calorie consumption of <fact6>1100 calories</fact6> - <fact7>150 calories</fact7> = 950 calories. This means he can still consume 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.

Sakura's daily calorie target is <fact8>130 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 1950 calories. She has consumed <fact9>900 calories</fact9> + <fact10>175 calories</fact10> = 1075 calories. This means she can still consume 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Each serving of cookies has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a bag contains <fact3>5 servings</fact3>, totaling 175 * 5 = 875 calories per bag.  Since a bag is <fact2>125 oz</fact2>, each serving is 125 oz / 5 servings = 25 oz.

Theo can consume 2800 more calories, so he can eat 2800 calories / 175 calories/serving = 16 servings of cookies. This translates to 16 servings * 25 oz/serving = 400 oz of cookies.  Since a bag is 125 oz, this is more cookies than we have information for.  So we focus on how much he *can* eat from what is available: 125 oz.

Sakura can consume 875 more calories, which is exactly the number of calories in a <fact2>125 oz</fact2> bag of cookies (<fact3>5 servings</fact3> at <fact1>175 calories/serving</fact1>). Therefore, Sakura can eat 125 oz of cookies.

The difference in the amount of cookies they can consume is 125 oz (Theo) - 125 oz (Sakura) = 0 oz.


Thus, from the available bag of cookies, Theo can consume exactly the same amount as Sakura can, so Theo needs to consume 0 more oz of cookies than Sakura. The answer is {0}.

How many more grams of popcorn does Arash need to consume than Mei?

**Answer:**

Arash's daily calorie target is <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> * <fact5>200 lbs</fact5> = 3000 calories.  He has a net intake of <fact6>1200 calories</fact6> - <fact7>150 calories</fact7> = 1050 calories. So, he can still consume 3000 - 1050 = 1950 more calories.

Mei's daily calorie target is <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> * <fact8>180 lbs</fact8> = 2700 calories.  She has consumed <fact9>900</fact9> + <fact10>175</fact10> = 1075 calories. So, she can still consume 2700 - 1075 = 1625 more calories.

One serving of popcorn has <fact1>325 calories</fact1>. One <fact2>100-gram bag</fact2> has <fact3>4 servings</fact3>, meaning the bag has <fact1>325</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 1300 calories.

Arash can eat 1950 / <fact1>325</fact1> = 6 servings of popcorn.  This is 6 * (<fact2>100</fact2>/<fact3>4</fact3>) = 150 grams of popcorn.

Mei can eat 1625 / <fact1>325</fact1> = 5 servings of popcorn. This is 5 * (<fact2>100</fact2>/<fact3>4</fact3>) = 125 grams of popcorn.

Arash needs to consume 150 - 125 = 25 more grams of popcorn than Mei. The answer is {25}.

How many more grams of popcorn does Arjun need to consume than Elena?

**Answer:**

Arjun's daily calorie target is <fact5>210 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 3150 calories.  Since he <fact7>burned 100 calories</fact7> through exercise, he can consume an additional 100 calories.  So his adjusted target is 3150 + 100 = 3250 calories. He has <fact6>already consumed 1000 calories</fact6>, so he can still consume 3250 - 1000 = 2250 calories.

Elena's daily calorie target is <fact8>180 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 2700 calories. She has <fact9>consumed 900 calories in food</fact9> and <fact10>150 calories in ice cream</fact10>, totaling 900 + 150 = 1050 calories.  Therefore, she can still consume 2700 - 1050 = 1650 calories.

A bag of popcorn has <fact2>300 grams</fact2> and contains <fact3>5 servings</fact3>, so each serving is 300 / 5 = 60 grams. Each serving has <fact1>150 calories</fact1>.

Arjun can consume 2250 calories of popcorn, which is equivalent to 2250 / <fact1>150 calories/serving</fact1> = 15 servings. This is 15 servings * 60 grams/serving = 900 grams of popcorn.

Elena can consume 1650 calories of popcorn, which is equivalent to 1650 / <fact1>150 calories/serving</fact1> = 11 servings. This is 11 servings * 60 grams/serving = 660 grams of popcorn.

Therefore, Arjun needs to consume 900 - 660 = 240 more grams of popcorn than Elena.  The answer is {240}.

Also, <fact8>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact8>. How many students are leaving early to the competition?


**Answer:**

1. **Soccer Players Going:** There are <fact1>100 students</fact1> total, and <fact2>46% are soccer players</fact2>, meaning there are 100 * 0.46 = 46 soccer players. However, <fact7>half of them are sick</fact7>, so 46 / 2 = 23 soccer players are going to the competition.

2. **Remaining Students:**  If 46 students are soccer players, then <fact3>the remaining class</fact3> has 100 - 46 = 54 students.

3. **Robotics/Dancers Going:** <fact4>50% of the remaining students</fact4> are robotics club members or dancers, so 54 * 0.50 = 27 students from these groups are going.

Also, <fact8>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact8>. <fact9>How many students are leaving early to the competition?</fact9>


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the number of soccer players in the class: <fact1>150 students</fact1> * <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60 soccer players.  However, <fact7>half of these soccer players are absent</fact7>, so 60 / 2 = 30 soccer players are going to the competition.

Next, we determine the number of students who are not soccer players: <fact1>150 students</fact1> - 60 soccer players = 90 students.  Of these <fact3>remaining students</fact3>, <fact4>30% are dancers or choir members</fact4>: 90 students * <fact4>30%</fact4> = 27 dancers/choir members.

So, the total number of students from the <fact5>three groups</fact5> (<fact6>leaving early for the competition</fact6>) is 30 soccer players + 27 dancers/choir members = 57 students.

Finally, we add the cheerleaders:  <fact5>3 groups</fact5> * <fact8>3 cheerleaders/group</fact8> = 9 cheerleaders.

Therefore, the total number of people <fact6>leaving early for the competition</fact6> is 57 students + 9 cheerleaders = 66 people. Since the question asks for the number of *students* leaving early, the answer is 57.

How many sushi rolls does this family eat in <fact10>two months</fact10>?


**Answer:**

1. **First month's consumption:**
   - The grandfather and partner eat <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2> = 25 sushi rolls per day.
   - The son eats <fact3>(4/5)</fact3> * 25 = 20 sushi rolls per day.
   - The family eats 25 + 20 = 45 sushi rolls per day.
   - Assuming a 30-day month, they eat 45 * 30 = 1350 sushi rolls in the <fact4>first month</fact4>.

2. **Second month's consumption (first half):**
   - They reduce consumption by <fact6>20%</fact6>, so they eat 45 * (1 - 0.20) = 36 sushi rolls per day.
   - In <fact7>half the month (15 days)</fact7>, they eat 36 * 15 = 540 sushi rolls.

3. **Second month's consumption (second half):**
   - They reduce consumption by an additional <fact8>25%</fact8> from the already reduced amount (36 rolls). So the new reduction is 36 * 0.25 = 9 rolls.
   - They eat 36 - 9 = 27 sushi rolls per day.
   - In the <fact9>second half of the month</fact9> (<fact9>15 days</fact9>), they eat 27 * 15 = 405 sushi rolls.

4. **Total consumption for two months:**

**Answer:**

1. **Daily Consumption:** The father and wife eat <fact1>20</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 25 pizzas per day. The daughter eats (<fact3>1/5</fact3>) * 25 = 5 pizzas per day.  The family's total daily consumption is 25 + 5 = 30 pizzas.

2. **First Month's Consumption:** Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 30 pizzas/day * 30 days = 900 pizzas in <fact4>the first month</fact4>.

3. **Second Month - First Half:**  Their consumption is reduced by <fact6>20%</fact6>, so they eat 30 pizzas/day * (1 - <fact6>0.20</fact6>) = 24 pizzas/day. For <fact7>the first half of the month</fact7> (15 days), they eat 24 pizzas/day * 15 days = 360 pizzas.

**Answer:**

1. **Daily consumption:** The father and wife eat <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact2>20</fact2> = 45 hamburgers per day. The daughter eats (<fact3>2/3</fact3>) * 45 = 30 hamburgers per day.  The family's total daily consumption is 45 + 30 = 75 hamburgers.

2. **First month's consumption:** Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 75 hamburgers/day * 30 days/<fact4>month</fact4> = 2250 hamburgers in the first month.

3. **Second month's consumption (first half):** They reduce their consumption by <fact6>20%</fact6>, meaning they eat 100% - <fact6>20%</fact6> = 80% of their usual amount.  So, they eat 75 hamburgers/day * 0.80 = 60 hamburgers per day.  For the <fact7>first half of the month</fact7> (15 days), they consume 60 hamburgers/day * 15 days = 900 hamburgers.

Sanjay <fact5>work overtime on the last day</fact5> so he can respond to <fact6>20% more emails than usual</fact6>.


**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many emails Sanjay receives that *do* require a response each day. Since <fact2>25% don't require a response</fact2>, that means 100% - 25% = 75% *do* require a response.  So, he needs to respond to 0.75 * <fact1>32 emails</fact1> = 24 emails.

Next, we find out how many of those emails he *can* respond to. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails requiring responses, which is (24 / 2) - <fact3>2</fact3> = 10 emails per day.

For the first three days of his <fact4>four-day work week</fact4>, Sanjay responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails.

On the last day (<fact5>due to overtime</fact5>), Sanjay responds to <fact6>20% more</fact6> than usual.  This means he responds to an additional 0.20 * 10 emails = 2 emails.  So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails.

Leon <fact5>work overtime on the last day</fact5> so he can respond to <fact6>50% more emails than usual</fact6>.

**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many emails Leon receives each day that *do* require a response. Since <fact2>20% don't require a response</fact2>, that means 80% do.  80% of <fact1>30 emails</fact1> is (0.80 * <fact1>30</fact1>) = 24 emails.

Next, we need to determine how many of those 24 emails Leon actually *can* respond to. He can respond to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of them. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is (12 - <fact3>2</fact3>) = 10 emails.

So, on a normal day, Leon responds to 10 emails.  For the first 5 days of his <fact4>6-day work week</fact4>, he responds to 10 emails/day * 5 days = 50 emails.

On the last day (<fact5>due to overtime</fact5>), Leon responds to <fact6>50% more emails</fact6> than usual. 50% of 10 emails is (0.50 * 10) = 5 emails.  Adding that to his usual 10, he responds to 10 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 15 emails on the last day.

Therefore, over the entire <fact4>6-day work week</fact4>, Leon responds to 50 + 15 = 65 emails.  The answer is {65}.

**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many emails Oliver receives that *do* require a response each day. Since <fact2>25% don't require a response</fact2>, that means 100% - 25% = 75% do require a response.  So, he receives <fact1>32 emails</fact1> * 0.75 = 24 emails requiring a response each day.

Next, we need to determine how many of these he *can* respond to. He can respond to <fact3>1/2 of those emails minus 2</fact3>. That's (24 / 2) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 emails per day.

For the first three days of his <fact4>four-day work week</fact4>, Oliver responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails.

**Answer:**

1. **Occupied rooms:** The care facility has <fact1>1800</fact1> rooms, and <fact2>1/6</fact2> are occupied. So, the number of occupied rooms is (<fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/6</fact2>) = 300 rooms.

Answer:
Diego's current age is <fact1>21</fact1>.
In <fact2>5 years</fact2>, Priya will be 2 * <fact1>21</fact1> = 42 years old.
This means Priya's current age is 42 - <fact2>5</fact2> = 37 years old.
Qasim's current age is <fact1>21</fact1> - <fact4>9</fact4> = 12 years old.
Mia's current age is 12 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 22 years old.

In <fact6>4 years</fact6>:
Diego will be <fact1>21</fact1> + <fact6>4</fact6> = 25

The store offers a <fact14>10% discount on paint for members</fact14>. How much more money does Valeria have left than Viktor after they leave the store?

**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Valeria's total spending.  She buys <fact4>15 anchors</fact4> at <fact7>â‚£0.35</fact7> each, costing her 15 * 0.35 = â‚£5.25.  Her <fact5>8 nails</fact5> cost her 8 * <fact6>â‚£0.64</fact6> = â‚£5.12. We don't know the price of paint for non-members like Valeria, so we'll leave that as 8P (where P is the price per gallon).  Her total spending is 5.25 + 5.12 + 8P = 10.37 + 8P.  Subtracting this from her starting amount (<fact3>â‚£97.37</fact3>), Valeria has 97.37 - (10.37 + 8P) = 87 - 8P left.

Now, let's calculate Viktor's spending. He buys <fact10>10 gallons of paint</fact10> at <fact11>â‚£7.0</fact11> each, totaling 10 * 7.0 = â‚£70.  Since Viktor <fact1>is a member</fact1>, he receives a <fact14>10% discount</fact14>, making the paint cost 70 * 0.9 = â‚£63. His <fact12>4 pencils</fact12> cost him 4 * <fact13>â‚£2</fact13> = â‚£8. His total spending is 63 + 8 = â‚£71.  Subtracting this from his starting amount (<fact9>â‚£90</fact9>), Viktor has 90 - 71 = â‚£19 left.

We are asked how much *more* Valeria has than Viktor.  This is (87 - 8P) - 19 = 68 - 8P.  Since we don't know the price of the paint, we cannot determine the exact difference. 
 * **If we assume the price of paint is the same for members and non-members (â‚£7),** Valeria's paint costs 8*<fact11>7</fact11> = â‚£56. Thus, Valeria would have 87-56 = â‚£31 left. The difference would be 31 - 19 = â‚£12.
 * **However, it is plausible that the member discount also applies to the base cost of the paint, meaning the original price could be higher than â‚£7.** This would change both calculations.

Without the price of paint for non-members, we cannot definitively answer the question.

The store offers a <fact14>10% discount on paint for members</fact14>. How much more money does Gabrielle have left than Arash after they leave the store?


Answer:
Gabrielle's expenses:

* **Nails:** <fact4>15 nails</fact4> * <fact7>â‚¬0.21/nail</fact7> = â‚¬3.15
* **Washers:** <fact5>8 washers</fact5> * <fact6>â‚¬0.64/washer</fact6> = â‚¬5.12
* **Paint:**  Since the price of paint isn't given, we can't calculate this part of Gabrielle's cost. We'll assume the cost of her paint is 'x'.

Gabrielle's total expenses: â‚¬3.15 + â‚¬5.12 + x = â‚¬8.27 + x
Gabrielle's remaining money: <fact3>â‚¬92.27</fact3> - (â‚¬8.27 + x) = â‚¬84 - x

Arash's expenses:

* **Pencils:** <fact12>3 pencils</fact12> * <fact13>â‚¬3/pencil</fact13> = â‚¬9
* **Paint:** <fact10>12 gallons</fact10> * <fact11>â‚¬7.5/gallon</fact11> = â‚¬90.  Since <fact1>Arash is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact14>10% discount</fact14>: â‚¬90 * 0.10 = â‚¬9 discount.  So, Arash pays â‚¬90 - â‚¬9 = â‚¬81 for the paint.

Arash's total expenses: â‚¬9 + â‚¬81 = â‚¬90
Arash's remaining money: <fact9>â‚¬100</fact9> - â‚¬90 = â‚¬10

Difference in remaining money: (â‚¬84 - x) - â‚¬10 = â‚¬74 - x

Since the price of Gabrielle's paint is not provided, we can only express the difference in their remaining money as â‚¬74 - x, where 'x' is the cost of Gabrielle's 8 gallons of paint.  If the price of Gabrielle's paint were given, we could calculate a numerical answer.

* **Washers:** <fact5>9 washers</fact5> * <fact6>Â¥0.65/washer</fact6> = Â¥5.85
* **Paint:** Since the problem doesn't give a price for Kimia's paint, we'll assume it's the same Â¥7.0 as Yusuf's (before discount). So, <fact8>8 gallons</fact8> * Â¥7.0/gallon = Â¥56.00
* **Total:** Â¥6.40 + Â¥5.85 + Â¥56.00 = Â¥68.25

Yusuf's expenses:

* **Paint:** <fact10>10 gallons</fact10> * <fact11>Â¥7.0/gallon</fact11> = Â¥70.00.  With the <fact1>member</fact1> <fact14>10% discount</fact14>, the cost is Â¥70.00 * 0.90 = Â¥63.00

* **Washers:** <fact5>9 washers</fact5> * <fact6>Â¥0.59/washer</fact6> = Â¥5.31
* **Paint:**  The price of paint is not given for non-members, so we cannot calculate Valentina's paint cost. We'll represent it with 'P'.

The store offers a <fact14>10% discount on paint for members</fact14>. How much more money does Quinn have left than Faisal after they leave the store?


**Answer:**

First, let's calculate Quinn's total spending.  The cost of the nuts is <fact4>17 nuts</fact4> * <fact7>â‚£0.31/nut</fact7> = â‚£5.27. The cost of the anchors is <fact5>9 anchors</fact5> * <fact6>â‚£0.68/anchor</fact6> = â‚£6.12. We don't know the price of paint, so we can't calculate Quinn's paint cost yet.  However, her spending on nuts and anchors is â‚£5.27 + â‚£6.12 = â‚£11.39. Subtracting this from her initial amount, <fact3>â‚£98.39</fact3>, leaves her with â‚£98.39 - â‚£11.39 = â‚£87.00 before buying paint.

Next, let's calculate Faisal's spending. Faisal's paint would cost <fact10>10 gallons</fact10> * <fact11>â‚£7.0/gallon</fact11> = â‚£70.00. However, because Faisal is <fact1>a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact14>10% discount</fact14>, so the paint actually costs â‚£70.00 * (1 - 0.10) = â‚£63.00. The cost of the pencils is <fact12>3 pencils</fact12> * <fact13>â‚£2/pencil</fact13> = â‚£6.  His total spending is â‚£63.00 + â‚£6.00 = â‚£69.00. Starting with <fact9>â‚£80.00</fact9>, Faisal has â‚£80.00 - â‚£69.00 = â‚£11.00 left.

The question does not provide the price of paint for non-members like Quinn.  Therefore, we cannot determine exactly how much money Quinn has left after buying paint and consequently can't determine how much more she has than Faisal. We can only say that before buying paint, Quinn has â‚£87.00, which is â‚£76.00 more than Faisal's remaining â‚£11.00.  However, the question asks about the amounts after *leaving* the store, which presumably means after Quinn buys paint as well.


**Partial Answer (due to missing information):** Before buying paint, Quinn has â‚£76.00 more than Faisal.  Without the price of paint for Quinn, we cannot calculate the final difference.

We don't know the price of paint for non-members, so we'll represent the price per gallon as 'p'. Therefore, <fact8>8 gallons of paint</fact8> will cost 8p.  Kayla's total spending is 5.27 + 4.96 + 8p = 10.23 + 8p.  Starting with <fact3>â‚£90.23</fact3>, Kayla has 90.23 - (10.23 + 8p) = 80 - 8p left.

Now, let's calculate Luca's spending.  <fact10>10 gallons of paint</fact10> at <fact11>â‚£7.0 each</fact11> would normally cost 10 * 7 = â‚£70. However, <fact1>Luca is a member</fact1> and gets a <fact14>10% discount</fact14>, so the paint costs 70 * 0.9 = â‚£63.  <fact12>4 carpenter pencils</fact12> at <fact13>â‚£2 each</fact13> cost 4 * 2 = â‚£8. Luca's total spending is 63 + 8 = â‚£71. Starting with <fact9>â‚£80</fact9>, Luca has 80 - 71 = â‚£9 left.

The question asks how much more Kayla has left than Luca.  This is (80 - 8p) - 9 = 71 - 8p.  Since we do not know the cost of paint for non-members, we cannot determine an exact numerical answer. The answer is **{71 - 8p}**, where 'p' is the price of one gallon of paint for non-members.

Ravi and Leilani are currently <fact2>10 years apart</fact2>. <fact3>Ravi</fact3>, who is <fact4>younger than Pavel</fact4> but <fact5>older than Leilani</fact5>, <fact6>will be 47 in 8 years</fact6>. How much younger is Leilani than the average age of all three?


**Answer:**

Since <fact3>Ravi</fact3> <fact6>will be 47 in 8 years</fact6>, his current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old.

<fact5>Leilani is younger than Ravi</fact5> and they are <fact2>10 years apart</fact2>, so Leilani is currently 39 - 10 = 29 years old.

<fact4>Pavel is older than Ravi</fact4> and they are <fact1>22 years apart</fact1>, so Pavel is currently 39 + 22 = 61 years old.

The sum of their ages is 39 + 29 + 61 = 129 years.
The average age of the three is 129 / 3 = 43 years.

Leilani is 43 - 29 = 14 years younger than the average age.

The answer is {14}.

How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Uma's average weekly signature collection rate during the first <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>. She collected <fact2>29 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>, meaning she collected 29 / 6 â‰ˆ 4.83 signatures per week.

Next, we determine how many signatures Uma will collect during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Due to her reduced collection ability, she will collect 4.83 - <fact6>5</fact6> = -0.17 signatures per week.  Since she can't collect negative signatures, we can assume she collects 0 signatures in the last <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her total collected will remain at <fact2>29</fact2>.

Now we calculate how many signatures Zahra needs to collect in total.  Together they want <fact5>130</fact5> signatures, and Uma will have <fact2>29</fact2>, so Zahra needs to collect 130 - 29 = 101 signatures in total.

Finally, we figure out Zahra's required weekly collection rate.  She already has <fact3>37</fact3> signatures, so she needs to collect an additional 101 - 37 = 64 signatures over the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. This means she needs to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

**Answer:**

Daphne collected 17 signatures in the first <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, meaning she was collecting 17 / <fact1>3</fact1> = 5.67 signatures per week (approximately).

Due to only collecting signatures on weekends, her collection rate will decrease by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, resulting in 5.67 - <fact6>5</fact6> = 0.67 signatures per week (approximately). 

Over the next <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>, Daphne will therefore collect 0.67 * <fact4>3</fact4> = 2 signatures (approximately).  Adding this to her existing <fact2>17</fact2>, Daphne will have 17 + 2 = 19 signatures by the end of the break.

**Answer:**

Ava collected <fact2>30 signatures</fact2> in <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, meaning she collected 30 / 3 = 10 signatures per week.  Her collection rate will decrease by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6> for the next <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, so she'll collect 10 - 5 = 5 signatures per week.

How many signatures will Haruka need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Mei's current collection rate.  She collected <fact2>24 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, so her current rate is 24 / <fact1>5</fact1> = 4.8 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate Mei's reduced collection rate.  Due to only collecting signatures on weekends, her rate decreases by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so her new rate will be 4.8 - <fact6>5</fact6> = -0.2 signatures per week.  Since she can't collect negative signatures, we assume she collects 0 signatures during these weeks.

Now, let's determine how many signatures Mei will collect in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.  At her reduced collection rate, she collects 0 signatures/week * <fact4>3 weeks</fact4> = 0 signatures. 

We know they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> total. They currently have <fact2>24</fact2> (Mei) + <fact3>51</fact3> (Haruka) = 75 signatures. So, they need <fact5>135</fact5> - 75 = 60 more signatures.

Since Mei will collect 0 additional signatures, Haruka needs to collect all the remaining 60 signatures in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.  Therefore, Haruka needs to collect 60 / <fact4>3</fact4> = 20 signatures per week.

During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. <fact1>After 3 weeks</fact1>, <fact2>Uma has 25 signatures in her book</fact2>, and <fact3>Olga has 59</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>2 more weeks of summer break</fact4>, and they decide they want to <fact5>reach 140 signatures between them</fact5> by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>, <fact6>Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week</fact6>, while <fact7>Olga decides to increase her weekly collection</fact7>. How many signatures will Olga need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to determine Uma's weekly collection rate during the first three weeks.  She collected <fact2>25 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>, so she averaged 25/3 = 8.33 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate how many signatures Uma will collect in the remaining two weeks. Since her collection rate reduces by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, her new rate will be 8.33 - 5 = 3.33 signatures per week. Over the remaining <fact4>two weeks</fact4>, she will collect 3.33 * 2 = 6.66 signatures, which we'll round down to 6 since you can't have a fraction of a signature.

Now, we calculate how many signatures they have in total so far.  Uma has <fact2>25</fact2> and Olga has <fact3>59</fact3>, for a combined total of 25 + 59 = 84 signatures.

Then, we figure out how many more signatures they need to reach their <fact5>goal of 140 signatures</fact5>. They need 140 - 84 = 56 more signatures.

Since Uma will collect an estimated 6 more signatures, Olga needs to collect the remaining 56 - 6 = 50 signatures.

Finally, we determine how many signatures Olga needs to collect per week for the remaining <fact4>two weeks</fact4>. She needs to collect 50 / 2 = 25 signatures per week.


Therefore, Olga needs to collect 25 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 140 signatures.

The sisters have <fact4>4 more weeks</fact4> of winter break, and they decide they want to <fact5>reach 140 signatures between them</fact5> by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Chen's weekly collection rate during the first <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>.  She collected a total of <fact2>36 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, meaning she averaged <fact2>36</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 7.2 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate how many signatures Chen will collect in the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her collection rate is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so she will now collect 7.2 - <fact6>5</fact6> = 2.2 signatures per week. Over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, she'll collect 2.2 * <fact4>4</fact4> = 8.8 signatures.  Since signatures must be whole numbers, we round this down to 8 signatures.

Now, let's determine how many signatures they have in total so far.  <fact2>Chen has 36</fact2> and <fact3>Tara has 32</fact3>, totaling <fact2>36</fact2> + <fact3>32</fact3> = 68 signatures.

Adding Chen's expected 8 additional signatures from the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, they will have 68 + 8 = 76 signatures.

They want to reach <fact5>140 signatures total</fact5>.  This means Tara needs to collect the remaining <fact5>140</fact5> - 76 = 64 signatures.

Finally, since Tara has <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> left, she needs to collect 64 / <fact4>4</fact4> = 16 signatures per week to meet their goal.

He also paid <fact5>$390000</fact5> for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and <fact6>$10000</fact6> for closing costs. Dr. Miller used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact7>10%</fact7> each year for <fact8>two years</fact8>. How much were Dr. Miller's net proceeds after two years?


**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the legal fees:** <fact2>1%</fact2> of <fact1>$490000</fact1> is (1/100) * <fact1>490000</fact1> = $4900

2. **Calculate the realtor fees:** <fact4>5%</fact4> of <fact1>$490000</fact1> is (5/100) * <fact1>490000</fact1> = $24500

3. **Calculate total expenses:** Legal fees ($4900) + Realtor fees ($24500) + Loan amount (<fact5>$390000</fact5>) + Closing costs (<fact6>$10000</fact6>) = $429400

4. **Calculate net proceeds from the sale:** Selling price (<fact1>$490000</fact1>) - Total expenses ($429400) = $60600

5. **Calculate the return after the first year:** Net proceeds ($60600) * <fact7>10%</fact7> = $6060.  Add this to the initial investment: $60600 + $6060 = $66660

6. **Calculate the return after the second year:**  Current value ($66660) * <fact7>10%</fact7> = $6666. Add this to the current value: $66660 + $6666 = $73326

1. **Calculate Total Fees:** Mr. Martinez paid a total of <fact2>3%</fact2> + <fact3>6%</fact3> = 9% of the <fact1>selling price ($690,000)</fact1> in fees. This amounts to 0.09 * <fact1>$690,000</fact1> = $62,100.

2. **Calculate Initial Net Proceeds:**  Subtract the <fact2>transfer fees</fact2>, <fact3>brokerage fee</fact3>, <fact4>loan amount</fact4>, and <fact5>closing costs</fact5> from the <fact1>selling price</fact1> to find the initial <fact6>net proceeds</fact6>: <fact1>$690,000</fact1> - $62,100 - <fact4>$590,000</fact4> - <fact5>$5,000</fact5> = $32,900.

3. **Calculate First Year's Gain:**  The <fact7>stocks gained 10%</fact7> in the first year, so the <fact6>net proceeds</fact6> increased by 0.10 * $32,900 = $3,290.  The total after the first year is $32,900 + $3,290 = $36,190.

The total cost for food is <fact1>2</fact1> days * <fact3>Â¥30/day</fact3> = Â¥60, but Leon's <fact6>friends are covering this cost</fact6>, so Leon doesn't have to pay for it.

Ibrahim has also applied for help from the school, which <fact8>has decided to cover a quarter of the remaining cost of the conference</fact8>. How much money is Ibrahim still missing?


Answer: The total cost per day is <fact3>$200</fact3> (hotel) + <fact4>$30</fact4> (food) + <fact5>$30</fact5> (transportation) = $260.
The total cost for the <fact1>2-day</fact1> conference is $260 * <fact1>2</fact1> = $520.
Since friends are covering the food cost (<fact7>), we subtract the food cost for both days: $520 - <fact4>$30</fact4>*<fact1>2</fact1> = $520 - $60 = $460.
The school is covering a quarter (<fact8>) of the remaining cost: $460 * (1/4) = $115.
So, the amount Ibrahim needs to cover is $460 - $115 = $345.
Ibrahim has <fact6>$95</fact6>.
Therefore, Ibrahim is still missing $345 - <fact6>$95</fact6> = $250.

After a <fact6>20% discount</fact6>, she paid a total of <fact7>$1540</fact7>. What was the cost of <fact8>mini cheesecakes per dozen</fact8>?

**Answer:**

1. **Donuts:** Nadia bought <fact1>60 donuts</fact1>, which is <fact1>60</fact1> / 12 = 5 dozens.  At <fact2>$14 per dozen</fact2>, the donuts cost 5 * <fact2>$14</fact2> = $70.

3. **Total before discount and cheesecakes:** The cost of donuts and cupcakes combined is $70 + $125 = $195.

4. **Total before discount:**  Since Nadia paid <fact7>$1540</fact7> after a <fact6>20% discount</fact6>, this amount represents 80% of the original price. Therefore, the total cost before the discount was <fact7>$1540</fact7> / 0.80 = $1925.

**Answer:**

Nia bought <fact1>60 croissants</fact1>, which is 60 / 12 = 5 dozens.  These cost her 5 dozens * <fact1>$19/dozen</fact1> = $95.

She bought <fact2>72 macarons</fact2>, which is 72 / 12 = 6 dozens. These cost her 6 dozens * <fact2>$20/dozen</fact2> = $120.

The cost of the croissants and macarons before the discount was $95 + $120 = $215.

Since Nia paid <fact5>$1330</fact5> after a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, the price before the discount was $1330 / (1 - 0.05) = $1330 / 0.95 = $1400.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$980</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>muffins per dozen</fact3>?

**Answer:**

Ava bought <fact1>36 eclairs</fact1>, which is <fact1>36</fact1>/12 = 3 dozens. The cost of the eclairs was 3 dozens * <fact1>$13/dozen</fact1> = $39.  She also bought <fact2>60 cookies</fact2>, which is <fact2>60</fact2>/12 = 5 dozens.  The cost of the cookies was 5 dozens * <fact2>$26/dozen</fact2> = $130.

Let 'm' be the price of a dozen muffins. Ava bought <fact3>24 muffins</fact3>, which is <fact3>24</fact3>/12 = 2 dozens. The cost of the muffins was 2 * m.

The total cost before the discount was $39 + $130 + 2m = $169 + 2m.  Ava received a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, so she paid 80% of the original price. This means 0.8 * ($169 + 2m) = <fact5>$980</fact5>.

Simplifying the equation:
$135.20 + 1.6m = $980
1.6m = $980 - $135.20
1.6m = $844.80
m = $844.80 / 1.6
m = $528

Therefore, the cost of muffins per dozen was $528.

Let 'x' be the cost of a dozen brownies.  Aisha bought <fact5>24 brownies</fact5>, which is <fact5>24</fact5> / 12 = 2 dozen brownies. So, the cost of the brownies before the discount was 2x.

The total cost of all the baked goods before the discount was $104 + 2x.

The amount she paid, <fact7>$1520</fact7>, is equal to 80% of the total pre-discount cost: 0.80 * ($104 + 2x) = <fact7>$1520</fact7>.

Solving for x:

3. **Calculate the total pre-discount cost of donuts and cupcakes:** The combined pre-discount cost of donuts and cupcakes is $76 + $96 = $172.

4. **Calculate the total pre-discount cost of everything:** Since Sophia paid <fact7>$1440</fact7> after a <fact6>25% discount</fact6>, this means $1440 represents 75% of the original price. Therefore, the total pre-discount cost was $1440 / 0.75 = $1920.

First, let's figure out how much each person eats:

* **Kimia:** Kimia eats <fact2>3 portions/day</fact2>.
* **Fatima:** Fatima eats <fact3>three times</fact3> as much as Kimia, so she eats 3 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 9 portions/day.
* **Daphne:** Daphne eats <fact4>four times</fact4> as much as Fatima, so she eats 4 * 9 = 36 portions/day.

Now let's see how many portions are eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>:

* **Kimia:** In 2 days, Kimia eats 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 portions.
* **Fatima:** In 2 days, Fatima eats 2 * 9 = 18 portions.
* **Daphne:** In 2 days, Daphne eats 2 * 36 = 72 portions.

Total portions eaten in the first 2 days: 6 + 18 + 72 = 96 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Daphne eats <fact6>half as much</fact6>, meaning she eats 36 / 2 = 18 portions/day.

Now let's find out how many portions they eat together per day after Daphne's diet change:

Kimia (3) + Fatima (9) + Daphne (18) = 30 portions/day.

Since there are 30 portions remaining and they eat 30 portions/day together, it will take 30 / 30 = 1 additional day to finish the cake.

Therefore, the total number of days to eat the entire cake is <fact5>2</fact5> + 1 = 3 days. The answer is {3}.

A muffin costs <fact2>1/4</fact2> the price of a loaf of sourdough, which is (<fact2>1/4</fact2>) * <fact1>Â¥15</fact1> = Â¥3.75.

Since <fact6>8 muffins</fact6> is more than <fact3>6 muffins</fact3>, the <fact4>20% discount</fact4> applies.  The discount per muffin is <fact4>0.20</fact4> * Â¥3.75 = Â¥0.75.

The discounted price of a muffin is Â¥3.75 - Â¥0.75 = Â¥3.

Thus, <fact6>8 muffins</fact6> cost Â¥3 * <fact6>8</fact6> = Â¥24.

The difference in cost between <fact5>5 loaves of sourdough</fact5> and <fact6>8 muffins</fact6> is Â¥75 - Â¥24 = Â¥51.

**Answer:**

The cost of one loaf of bread is <fact1>â‚¬10</fact1>. Therefore, <fact5>5 loaves</fact5> cost <fact1>10</fact1> * <fact5>5</fact5> = â‚¬50.

One bagel costs <fact2>1/8</fact2> the price of a loaf, which is (<fact2>1/8</fact2>) * <fact1>â‚¬10</fact1> = â‚¬1.25.

Since the customer is buying <fact6>8 bagels</fact6>, which is more than <fact3>7</fact3>, they qualify for the <fact4>10% discount</fact4>.  The discount amount is <fact4>10%</fact4> of â‚¬1.25, which is (0.10) * 1.25 = â‚¬0.125.

Answer:
The cost of a muffin is <fact2>one-eighth</fact2> the price of <fact3>a loaf of sourdough</fact3>, which costs <fact1>â‚£10</fact1>.  So, one muffin costs <fact1>10</fact1> * (<fact2>1/8</fact2>) = â‚£1.25.

Sakura then donated <fact7>â‚¬5</fact7> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Sakura have left?


**Answer:**

1. **Cost of Taffy:** Sakura bought 22 kgs of taffy. The first 16 kgs cost â‚¬22 per kg, totaling 16 * <fact2>â‚¬22</fact2> = â‚¬352.  The remaining (22 - 16 = 6 kgs) were not part of the deal since it was only for the first 16 + 4 kg, which is a total of 20kgs. Since the deal was for 4 kg being 1/4 off and 22kg is greater than 20kgs, we calculate the remaining 2 kg with the regular price. Therefore, she would have paid regular price for 2 of those kgs: 2 * <fact2>â‚¬22</fact2> = â‚¬44. The sale applied to the first 4 kg, meaning 4 kg * (1 - 1/4) * â‚¬22/kg = 4kg * 3/4 * â‚¬22/kg = â‚¬66. Thus, the total cost of the taffy is â‚¬352 + â‚¬44 + â‚¬66 = â‚¬462.
2. **Cost of Keychains:** She bought <fact5>12 keychains</fact5> at <fact6>â‚¬20</fact6> each, costing 12 * <fact6>â‚¬20</fact6> = â‚¬240.

Since the sale applies to <fact2>6 kgs</fact2>, only 6 kgs get the discount. The discount is (2/3) * 22 = â‚º14.67 (approximately) per kg. So, the discounted 6 kgs cost 6 * 14.67 = â‚º88. The remaining 1 kg is at full price, costing â‚º22. Therefore, the total cost of rock candy is 352 + 88 + 22 = â‚º462.

**Answer:**

Ava bought 17 pounds of cotton candy at the regular price of <fact2>$22</fact2> per pound, costing her 17 * <fact2>$22</fact2> = $374.

Since Ava bought <fact4>23</fact4> pounds of cotton candy, she got a discount on 23 - 17 = 6 pounds. However, the offer is only valid for <fact3>4 pounds</fact3>, so she receives a discount on 4 pounds. The discount is half the price, which is <fact2>$22</fact2>/2 = $11 per pound.  So, the discount amounts to 4 pounds * $11/pound = $44.

The cost of the discounted cotton candy is 6 * <fact2>$22</fact2> = $132.

Since she only gets a discount of $44, the cost of these extra 6 pounds is actually $132 - $44 = $88.

The total cost of the cotton candy is $374 + $88 = $462.

The total cost of the pins is <fact6>18</fact6> * <fact7>$20.5</fact7> = $369.

Ava's total spending is $462 (cotton candy) + <fact5>$11</fact5> (coral) + $369 (pins) + <fact8>$5</fact8> (donation) = $847.

Ava started with <fact1>$1400</fact1> and spent $847, so she has <fact1>$1400</fact1> - $847 = $553 left.

**Answer:**

There are <fact1>8 pink tiles</fact1>.  There are <fact2>twice as many green tiles as pink tiles</fact2>, so there are 2 * <fact1>8</fact1> = 16 green tiles.

Together, the pink and green tiles total <fact1>8</fact1> + 16 = 24 tiles.

Bodhi also decides to buy himself <fact6>a cookie for $1</fact6>. How much does Bodhi have to pay?


Answer: Bodhi uses <fact4>2 pounds of rice per day</fact4>, so for <fact3>a week (7 days)</fact3>, he needs 2 * 7 = 14 pounds of rice.  The more expensive rice costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the <fact1>$15 per pound</fact1> normal brand. So, the expensive rice costs 15 * 1.20 = $18 per pound. The <fact5>store discount applies to the first 10 pounds</fact5>.  So, 10 pounds of rice will cost 10 * $18 * 0.80 = $144. The remaining 4 pounds (14 - 10) will be at the regular price of the expensive brand: 4 * $18 = $72.  Therefore, the total cost of the rice is $144 + $72 = $216.

Oliver also decides to buy himself <fact6>a muffin for â‚£4</fact6>. How much does Oliver have to pay?


**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive flour:** The more expensive flour costs <fact2>25%</fact2> more than <fact1>â‚£16</fact1>, so the increased price is â‚£16 * 0.25 = â‚£4.  The total cost per kilogram of the expensive flour is â‚£16 + â‚£4 = â‚£20.

2. **Calculate the total flour needed:** Oliver uses <fact4>2 kilograms of flour per day</fact4> for <fact3>a week</fact3> (7 days), so he needs 2 * 7 = 14 kilograms of flour.

3. **Calculate the cost of the first 10 kg of flour:** The first 10 kilograms of flour have a <fact5>5% discount</fact5>, so the price per kilogram is â‚£20 * (1 - 0.05) = â‚£20 * 0.95 = â‚£19. The cost for the first 10 kilograms is 10 * â‚£19 = â‚£190.

4. **Calculate the cost of the remaining flour:** Oliver needs 14 - 10 = 4 more kilograms of flour, which will be sold at the regular price of â‚£20 per kilogram.  The cost for this flour is 4 * â‚£20 = â‚£80.

5. **Calculate the total cost of flour:**  The total cost of the flour is â‚£190 + â‚£80 = â‚£270.

6. **Calculate the total cost:** Oliver also bought <fact6>a muffin for â‚£4</fact6>, so the total cost is â‚£270 + â‚£4 = â‚£274.

Answer:
Arjun uses <fact4>2 kg of tea per day</fact4> and buys tea for <fact3>a week (7 days)</fact3>, so he buys 2 * 7 = 14 kilograms of tea.

The normal price is <fact1>Â¥10 per kilogram</fact1>. The more expensive brand costs <fact2>40% more</fact2>, which means it costs Â¥10 * 1.40 = Â¥14 per kilogram.

For the first 10 kilograms, Arjun gets a <fact5>10% discount</fact5>.  So, he pays Â¥14 * 0.90 = Â¥12.60 per kilogram for the first 10 kilograms.  This totals Â¥12.60 * 10 = Â¥126.

The remaining 14 - 10 = 4 kilograms are sold at the regular price of the more expensive brand, which is Â¥14 per kilogram. This costs him Â¥14 * 4 = Â¥56.

The cost of the tea is Â¥126 + Â¥56 = Â¥182.  He also buys a <fact6>muffin for Â¥4</fact6>.

How much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?


Answer:
The space each plant will take up in Kimia's flower bed is the width of the plant plus the required space between the plants. Therefore, each plant needs <fact2>7 feet</fact2> (the width) + <fact3>14 feet</fact3> (the space) = 21 feet.

Kimia's flower bed is <fact1>126 feet long</fact1>, so she can fit <fact1>126 feet</fact1> / 21 feet/plant = 6 plants.

Since Kimia already has <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 6 plants total - <fact4>6 flowers</fact4> she already owns = 0 plants from the store.

Because she doesn't need to buy any more plants, Kimia will spend â‚£0.  The answer is {0}.

However, <fact6>if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a $8 discount</fact6> on the entire purchase. How much money will Gabrielle spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the space each plant needs:** Each plant requires <fact2>3 meters</fact2> (for its width) plus <fact3>15 meters</fact3> of space between it and the next plant, totaling 3 + 15 = 18 meters.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit:**  The flower bed is <fact1>150 meters long</fact1>.  Divide the total length by the space needed for each plant: 150 / 18 = 8.33. Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, Gabrielle can fit a maximum of 8 plants.

3. **Calculate how many plants Gabrielle needs to buy:** Gabrielle already has <fact4>7 flowers</fact4> and needs 8 total, so she only needs to purchase 8 - 7 = 1 plant.

4. **Calculate the cost:** One plant costs <fact5>$3</fact5>. Since she's only buying one plant, she does *not* qualify for the <fact6>$8 discount</fact6> (as that requires purchasing more than 2 plants).

5. **Final cost:** Gabrielle will spend $3 at the store.

Answer:
Each plant and its required spacing will take up <fact2>4 meters</fact2> (the plant's width) + <fact3>12 meters</fact3> (the spacing) = 16 meters of the flower bed's length.

The flower bed is <fact1>120 meters long</fact1>.  Therefore, the flower bed can hold <fact1>120 meters</fact1> / 16 meters/plant = 7.5 plants. Since Mei can only have whole plants, she can fit a maximum of 7 plants.

Mei already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. She needs 7 plants total, so she needs to buy 7 - <fact4>6</fact4> = 1 plant.

Since she is buying only 1 plant, she won't qualify for the <fact7>$5 discount</fact7> (which applies only if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>).

Answer:
The space each plant will occupy in the flower bed is the width of the plant (<fact2>3 meters</fact2>) plus the space between plants (<fact3>13 meters</fact3>), which is 3 + 13 = 16 meters.

The flower bed is <fact1>117 meters long</fact1>, so it can hold 117 / 16 = 7 plants with some space left over (5 meters, which isn't enough for another plant).

Haruka already has <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. Since she can fit 7 plants and needs 1 more, she only needs to buy 7 - 6 = 1 plant from the store.

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the space needed per plant:** Each plant needs <fact2>7 feet</fact2> (width) + <fact3>18 feet</fact3> (space) = 25 feet.

2. **Determine the number of plants that can fit:** The flower bed is <fact1>144 feet long</fact1>.  So, <fact1>144 feet</fact1> / 25 feet/plant = 5.76 plants. Since Valentina can only plant whole plants, she can fit 5 plants in the flower bed.

2. **Washing time:**  Olga washes each clam for <fact4>19 seconds</fact4>.  For <fact3>180 clams</fact3>, this takes <fact3>180</fact3> * <fact4>19 seconds</fact4> = 3420 seconds.  Converting to minutes, 3420 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 57 minutes.

3. **SautÃ©ing time:** Olga can sautÃ© <fact2>30 clams in 9 minutes</fact2>.  To sautÃ© <fact3>180 clams</fact3>, it will take (<fact3>180</fact3>/<fact2>30</fact2>) * <fact2>9 minutes</fact2> = 54 minutes.

4. **Break time:**  Olga takes an <fact6>11-minute break</fact6> after peeling.

5. **Total time:** Because Olga works sequentially (<fact5>can't work in parallel</fact5>), the total time is the sum of washing, peeling, break, and sautÃ©ing times: 57 minutes + 15 minutes + <fact6>11 minutes</fact6> + 54 minutes = 137 minutes.

48,"**Reformatted Question:** Aisha can peel <fact1>10 clams a minute</fact1> and saute <fact2>30 clams in 6 minutes</fact2>. How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute <fact3>120 clams</fact3> if it takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4> to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that <fact5>Aisha can't work in parallel</fact5> and <fact6>needs to take a 7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautÃ©ing them</fact6>.

**Answer:**

First, we calculate the time it takes Aisha to peel <fact3>120 clams</fact3>.  She peels at a rate of <fact1>10 clams per minute</fact1>, so it will take her <fact3>120 clams</fact3> / <fact1>10 clams/minute</fact1> = 12 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we determine the time it takes to wash <fact3>120 clams</fact3>.  Each clam takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4> to wash.  Therefore, washing all the clams will take <fact3>120 clams</fact3> * <fact4>14 seconds/clam</fact4> = 1680 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we have 1680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 28 minutes.

Now, we figure out how long it takes Aisha to saute <fact3>120 clams</fact3>. She can saute <fact2>30 clams in 6 minutes</fact2>, so her rate is <fact2>30 clams</fact2> / <fact2>6 minutes</fact2> = 5 clams per minute. Therefore, sautÃ©ing <fact3>120 clams</fact3> will take <fact3>120 clams</fact3> / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes.

Since Aisha can't work in parallel (<fact5>), we need to add the time for each step sequentially.  The total time is the washing time + peeling time + break time + sautÃ©ing time. This equals 28 minutes + 12 minutes + <fact6>7 minutes</fact6> + 24 minutes = 71 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Aisha 71 minutes to peel and saute the clams.

Note that <fact5>Chen can't work in parallel</fact5> and <fact6>needs to take a 6-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautÃ©ing them</fact6>.

**Answer:**

First, we calculate the time it takes Chen to peel <fact3>120 clams</fact3>.  Since she peels <fact1>5 clams a minute</fact1>, it will take her <fact3>120</fact3>/<fact1>5</fact1> = 24 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to wash the <fact3>120 clams</fact3>. Since it takes <fact4>15 seconds</fact4> to wash each clam, it takes <fact3>120</fact3> clams * <fact4>15 seconds/clam</fact4> = 1800 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we have 1800 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 30 minutes.

Now, we calculate the time it takes Chen to saute <fact3>120 clams</fact3>. Since she can saute <fact2>20 clams in 16 minutes</fact2>, it takes her <fact2>16</fact2>/<fact2>20</fact2> = 0.8 minutes to saute one clam. Thus, it will take her 0.8 minutes/clam * <fact3>120</fact3> clams = 96 minutes to saute all the clams.

Because Chen <fact5>can't work in parallel</fact5>, we need to add the time for washing, peeling, the <fact6>6-minute break</fact6>, and sautÃ©ing. So, the total time is 30 minutes (washing) + 24 minutes (peeling) + <fact6>6</fact6> minutes (break) + 96 minutes (sautÃ©ing) = 156 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Chen 156 minutes to peel and saute <fact3>120 clams</fact3>.

Note that <fact5>Ava can't work in parallel</fact5> and <fact6>needs to take a 15-minute break after peeling the zucchinis before she can start sautÃ©ing them</fact6>.

**Answer:**

First, we calculate the time it takes Ava to peel <fact3>140 zucchinis</fact3>.  Since she peels <fact1>5 zucchinis per minute</fact1>, it takes her <fact3>140</fact3> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 28 minutes to peel all the zucchinis.

Next, we calculate the time it takes to wash the <fact3>140 zucchinis</fact3>. Since it takes <fact4>24 seconds</fact4> to wash each zucchini, and there are 60 seconds in a minute, it takes <fact4>24</fact4> / 60 = 0.4 minutes per zucchini. Therefore, washing all <fact3>140 zucchinis</fact3> takes 0.4 * <fact3>140</fact3> = 56 minutes.

Now we calculate the time it takes to saute the <fact3>140 zucchinis</fact3>.  She can saute <fact2>20 zucchinis in 6 minutes</fact2>, so it takes her (<fact3>140</fact3>/<fact2>20</fact2>) * 6 = 42 minutes to saute all the zucchinis.

Since Ava can't work in parallel (<fact5>), the total time is the sum of washing time, peeling time, break time (<fact6>), and sauteing time: 56 + 28 + <fact6>15</fact6> + 42 = 141 minutes.

Note that <fact5>Roya can't work in parallel</fact5> and <fact6>needs to take a 7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautÃ©ing them</fact6>.

**Answer:**

First, we calculate the time it takes Roya to peel <fact3>90 clams</fact3>.  Since she peels at a rate of <fact1>6 clams per minute</fact1>, it will take her <fact3>90</fact3>/<fact1>6</fact1> = 15 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we need to account for the time it takes to wash each clam.  Since each clam takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4> to wash, and there are <fact3>90 clams</fact3>, washing will take <fact3>90</fact3> * <fact4>14 seconds</fact4> = 1260 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we have 1260 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 21 minutes.

Since <fact5>Roya can't work in parallel</fact5>, the total time for peeling and washing will be the sum of these times. That is 21 minutes + 15 minutes = 36 minutes.

Now, we add the <fact6>7-minute break</fact6> Roya takes after peeling: 36 minutes + <fact6>7 minutes</fact6> = 43 minutes.

Finally, we calculate the time it takes Roya to saute the <fact3>90 clams</fact3>. Since she can saute <fact2>30 clams in 11 minutes</fact2>, it will take her (<fact3>90</fact3>/<fact2>30</fact2>) * 11 minutes = 3 * 11 minutes = 33 minutes to saute all the clams.

The total time to peel, wash, take a break, and saute is 43 minutes + 33 minutes = 76 minutes.  Therefore, it will take Roya 76 minutes to peel and saute the <fact3>90 clams</fact3>.

Note that <fact5>Kimia can't work in parallel</fact5> and <fact6>needs to take a 8-minute break after peeling the shrimps before she can start sautÃ©ing them</fact6>.

**Answer:**

1. **Washing:** Kimia needs to wash <fact3>60 shrimps</fact3> and each shrimp takes <fact4>15 seconds</fact4> to wash. This totals to <fact3>60</fact3> * <fact4>15 seconds</fact4> = 900 seconds, which is equal to 900/60 = 15 minutes.

2. **Peeling:** Kimia can peel <fact1>6 shrimps per minute</fact1>, so it takes her <fact3>60 shrimps</fact3> / <fact1>6 shrimps/minute</fact1> = 10 minutes to peel all the shrimp.

3. **Break:** Kimia takes an <fact6>8-minute break</fact6> after peeling.

4. **SautÃ©ing:** Kimia can saute <fact2>20 shrimps in 17 minutes</fact2>.  Therefore, to saute <fact3>60 shrimps</fact3>, it will take her (<fact3>60</fact3>/<fact2>20</fact2>) * 17 minutes = 3 * 17 minutes = 51 minutes.

5. **Total Time:**  Because Kimia <fact5>can't work in parallel</fact5>, the total time is the sum of the time spent washing, peeling, taking a break, and sautÃ©ing: 15 minutes + 10 minutes + <fact6>8 minutes</fact6> + 51 minutes = 84 minutes.
