47,"Reformatted Question: Yuki hid <fact1>5 dozen eggs</fact1> in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. <fact2>Gabriel finds 5 eggs</fact2>. <fact3>Sophia finds two times as many as Gabriel</fact3>. <fact4>Ali finds 4 less than Sophia</fact4>, and <fact5>Esteban finds a third as many as Ali</fact5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs were hidden in total. Since <fact1>5 dozen eggs</fact1> were hidden, and 1 dozen equals 12, then 5 x 12 = 60 eggs were hidden.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs each person found. We know that <fact2>Gabriel finds 5 eggs</fact2>. Since <fact3>Sophia finds two times as many as Gabriel</fact3>, then Sophia found 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.

Since <fact4>Ali finds 4 less than Sophia</fact4>, then Ali found 10 - 4 = 6 eggs.

Finally, since <fact5>Esteban finds a third as many as Ali</fact5>, then Esteban found 6 / 3 = 2 eggs.

Now, we can add up all the eggs that were found: 5 (Gabriel) + 10 (Sophia) + 6 (Ali) + 2 (Esteban) = 23 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden: 60 - 23 = 37 eggs.

31,"Reformatted Question: Amelia and Tara are currently <fact1>22 years apart in age</fact1>. If <fact2>Amelia, who is younger than Tara, is 37 years old</fact2>, what's the average of their ages?

Answer: Since <fact2>Amelia is 37 years old</fact2> and <fact1>22 years apart in age</fact1> from Tara, Tara must be 37 + <fact1>22</fact1> = 59 years old. To find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and divide by 2. The sum of their ages is 37 + 59 = 96. Dividing by 2, we get 96 / 2 = 48. Therefore, the average of their ages is 48.

Answer: To peel 100 shrimps, it will take Ava <fact3>100 shrimps</fact3> / <fact1>10 shrimps per minute</fact1> = 10 minutes. To saute 100 shrimps, it will take Ava (<fact2>18 minutes</fact2> / <fact2>20 shrimps</fact2>) * <fact3>100 shrimps</fact3> = (18/20) * 100 = 90 minutes. So, the total time it will take Ava to peel and saute 100 shrimps is 10 + 90 = 100 minutes.

Answer: Since there are <fact1>nine times as many caterpillars as ladybugs</fact1>, the number of caterpillars is <fact1>9</fact1> * <fact2>99 ladybugs</fact2> = 891 caterpillars. The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ladybugs and caterpillars, which is <fact2>99 ladybugs</fact2> + 891 caterpillars = 990 insects.

Due to the major accident, <fact3>35 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the medical center after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: The number of occupied wards initially is <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> * <fact2>1/10</fact2> = 160 wards. 
The number of unoccupied wards initially is <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> - 160 wards = 1440 wards.
There are <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> * 7 days/week = 28 days in 4 weeks.
The number of patients admitted in 4 weeks is <fact3>35 patients/day</fact3> * 28 days = 980 patients.
Assuming each patient occupies one ward, the number of occupied wards after 4 weeks is 160 wards + 980 wards = 1140 wards.
The number of unoccupied wards after 4 weeks is <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> - 1140 wards = 460 wards.

Answer: To find the number of grasshoppers, we need to multiply the number of wasps by 2/3. So, the number of grasshoppers is <fact2>144</fact2> * <fact1>2/3</fact1> = 96. The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of wasps and grasshoppers, which is <fact2>144</fact2> + 96 = 240.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls there are. Since <fact2>an eighth of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, we can calculate the number of tennis balls by dividing the total number of balls by 8. So, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>960</fact1> / 8 = 120. 

Next, we need to find out how many of these tennis balls are indigo. Since <fact3>1/5 of the tennis balls are indigo</fact3>, we can calculate the number of indigo tennis balls by dividing the number of tennis balls by 5 and then multiplying by 1. So, the number of indigo tennis balls is 120 / 5 = 24.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of orange cards. Since there are <fact2>76% more orange cards</fact2> than yellow cards, we can calculate the number of orange cards by finding 76% of the number of yellow cards and adding it to the number of yellow cards. 76% of <fact1>25 yellow cards</fact1> is 0.76 * 25 = 19. So, there are 25 + 19 = 44 orange cards.

Now, we know that <fact3>green cards are as many as the sum of yellow and orange cards</fact3>. Therefore, the number of green cards is <fact1>25 yellow cards</fact1> + 44 orange cards = 69 green cards.

To find the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we add the number of yellow, orange, and green cards: <fact1>25 yellow cards</fact1> + 44 orange cards + 69 green cards = 138 cards.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many golf balls there are. Since <fact2>half of the balls are golf balls</fact2>, we can calculate the number of golf balls by dividing the total number of balls by 2. So, the number of golf balls is <fact1>680</fact1> / 2 = 340.

Next, we need to find out how many of these golf balls are green. Since <fact3>1/5 of the golf balls are green</fact3>, we can calculate the number of green golf balls by multiplying the number of golf balls by 1/5. So, the number of green golf balls is 340 * 1/5 = 68.

Answer: Umar has <fact3>two-sixths as many tubes of black paint as Diego</fact3>, so Umar has (<fact1>18 tubes of black paint</fact1>)*(2/6) = 6 tubes of black paint. Umar also has <fact4>six times as many tubes of magenta paint as Diego</fact4>, so Umar has (<fact2>19 tubes of magenta paint</fact2>)*6 = 114 tubes of magenta paint. Therefore, Umar has 6 + 114 = 120 tubes of paint.

Answer: To find the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in one month, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls each person eats in a month and then add them together. 

Since there are approximately 30 days in <fact4>one month</fact4>, the father eats <fact1>7 sushi rolls per day</fact1> * 30 days = 210 sushi rolls per month. 

The wife eats <fact2>4 sushi rolls per day</fact2> * 30 days = 120 sushi rolls per month. 

The daughter eats <fact3>3 sushi rolls per day</fact3> * 30 days = 90 sushi rolls per month. 

Therefore, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in one month is 210 + 120 + 90 = 420 sushi rolls.

Answer: To find the perimeter of the room, we need to find the width of the room first. Since the area of the room is given as <fact1>810 square meters</fact1> and the area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width, we can set up the equation: <fact2>6 meters</fact2> * width = <fact1>810 square meters</fact1>. Solving for width, we get width = <fact1>810 square meters</fact1> / <fact2>6 meters</fact2> = 135 meters. Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the <fact3>perimeter of the room</fact3> using the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width). Plugging in the values, we get perimeter = 2 * (<fact2>6 meters</fact2> + 135 meters) = 2 * 141 meters = 282 meters.
