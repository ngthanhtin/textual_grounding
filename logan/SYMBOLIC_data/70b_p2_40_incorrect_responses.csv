1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> to cover every <fact2>3 miles</fact2> of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is <fact3>72 miles</fact3> across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city?

Answer: To cover a quarter of the city, the fog bank needs to cover <fact3>72 miles</fact3>/4 = 18 miles. Since it takes <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> to cover every <fact2>3 miles</fact2>, it will take <fact1>30 minutes</fact1> * (18/<fact2>3</fact2>) = 180 minutes to cover 18 miles. However, since the wind speed will be halved in one hour, the fog bank will cover half the distance in the second hour. So, it will take 180/2 = 90 minutes to cover the remaining distance. Therefore, it will take 90 minutes for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city.",300.0,0,1,p2,6,961

If the city is <fact3>72 miles</fact3> across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact4>1/4 of the city</fact4>?

Answer: To cover 1/4 of the city, the fog bank needs to cover <fact3>72 miles</fact3> * <fact4>1/4</fact4> = 18 miles. Since it takes <fact1>75 minutes</fact1> to cover every <fact2>10 miles</fact2>, it will take <fact1>75 minutes</fact1> * (18/<fact2>10</fact2>) = 135 minutes to cover 18 miles.

1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>60 minutes</fact1> to cover every <fact2>6 miles</fact2> of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is <fact3>72 miles</fact3> across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact4>1/3 of the city</fact4>?

Answer: The fog bank covers <fact2>6 miles</fact2> in <fact1>60 minutes</fact1>, so it covers 1 mile in <fact1>60</fact1>/<fact2>6</fact2> = 10 minutes. To cover <fact4>1/3 of the city</fact4>, the fog bank must cover <fact3>72</fact3>/<fact4>3</fact4> = 24 miles. At the original speed, it would take 24 * 10 = 240 minutes to cover 24 miles. However, the wind speed is halved after 60 minutes, so the fog bank will cover the first 12 miles in 120 minutes and the remaining 12 miles in 240 minutes. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/3 of the city is 120 + 240 = 360 minutes.",420.0,0,1,p2,9,1023

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a d10 die is 4/10 = 40% because there are 4 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and 10 total numbers. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row is 40% * 40% = 16%. The probability of rolling an even number on a d10 die is 5/10 = 50% because there are 5 even numbers on a d10 die (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) and 10 total numbers. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is 50% * 50% * 50% * 50% = 6.25%. Therefore, the difference in percentage points is 16% - 6.25% = 9.75%.

She also uses <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S, the number of cups of water as W, the number of tablespoons of milk as M, and the number of tablespoons of heavy cream as C. From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water</fact1>, we know that S/W = 48/10. From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water</fact2>, we know that M/W = 6/10 = 3/5. From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar</fact3>, we know that C/S = 2. We are also given that S + W + M + C = <fact4>210</fact4>. We can express W, M, and C in terms of S: W = (10/48)S, M = (3/5)W = (3/5)(10/48)S = (3/24)S, and C = 2S. Substituting these expressions into the equation S + W + M + C = 210, we get S + (10/48)S + (3/24)S + 2S = 210. Combining like terms, we get (1 + 10/48 + 3/24 + 2)S = 210. Simplifying, we get (1 + 5/24 + 1/8 + 2)S = 210. Converting to a common denominator, we get (24/24 + 10/24 + 3/24 + 48/24)S = 210. Combining like terms, we get (85/24)S = 210. Multiplying both sides by 24/85, we get S = 210 * (24/85) = 60. The answer is {60}.",63.0,0,1,p2,31,1449

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S, the number of cups of water as W, the number of tablespoons of milk as M, and the number of tablespoons of heavy cream as C. From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water</fact1>, we know that W = (5/45)S = S/9. From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water</fact2>, we know that M = (8/4)W = 2W = (2/9)S. From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar</fact3>, we know that C = 2S. We are also given that S + W + M + C = <fact4>210</fact4>. Substituting the expressions for W, M, and C in terms of S, we get S + S/9 + (2/9)S + 2S = 210. Combining like terms, we get (1 + 1/9 + 2/9 + 2)S = 210, which simplifies to (1 + 3/9 + 2)S = 210, and further simplifies to (1 + 1/3 + 2)S = 210, and further simplifies to (6/3 + 1/3 + 6/3)S = 210, and further simplifies to (13/3)S = 210. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 13S = 630. Dividing both sides by 13, we get S = 630/13 = 48.5. However, since S must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a teaspoon of sugar), we round down to the nearest integer. The answer is {48}.",63.0,0,1,p2,35,1500

If Mrs. Smith can get <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: The brokerage fee is <fact3>7%</fact3> of the selling price, which is <fact3>7%</fact3> * <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $35000. The transfer fee is <fact4>12%</fact4> of the selling price, which is <fact4>12%</fact4> * <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $60000. The total fees are $35000 + $60000 = $95000.

He also paid <fact4>$590000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount and <fact5>$5000</fact5> for closing costs. So, the total amount deducted from the selling price is $62100 + <fact4>$590000</fact4> + <fact5>$5000</fact5> = $656100. However, this amount is more than the selling price, so Mr. Martinez's net proceeds from selling the cottage is <fact1>$690000</fact1> - $656100 = $33900. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>, so the net proceeds after two years is $33900 * (1 + <fact6>10%</fact6>)^2 = $33900 * 1.21 = $41019. The answer is {41019}.",39809.0,0,1,p2,205,1474

He also paid <fact4>$670000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and <fact5>$20000</fact5> for closing costs. Prof. Miller used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: Prof. Miller's registration fees were <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$810000</fact1>, which is <fact1>$810000</fact1> * <fact2>3%</fact2> = $24300. His agent fee was also <fact3>3%</fact3> of <fact1>$810000</fact1>, which is <fact1>$810000</fact1> * <fact3>3%</fact3> = $24300. So his total fees were $24300 + $24300 = $48600.

Answer: Prof. Miller's registration fees were <fact1>$760000</fact1> * <fact2>3%</fact2> = $0.03 * 760000 = $22800. His agent fees were <fact1>$760000</fact1> * <fact3>4%</fact3> = $0.04 * 760000 = $30400. So his total fees were $22800 + $30400 = $53200.

Dr. Smith used the net proceeds from selling the house to invest in stocks. The stocks gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Dr. Smith's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: Dr. Smith's net proceeds from selling the house can be calculated by subtracting the costs from the selling price. The legal fees were <fact2>3% of the selling price</fact2>, which is <fact1>$590000</fact1> * 0.03 = $17700. The realtor fee was <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3>, which is <fact1>$590000</fact1> * 0.04 = $23600. The total costs were $17700 + $23600 + <fact4>$380000</fact4> + <fact5>$25000</fact5> = $443300. The net proceeds from selling the house were <fact1>$590000</fact1> - $443300 = $146700. Dr. Smith invested this amount in stocks, which gained <fact6>10% each year for two years</fact6>. After the first year, the investment grew to $146700 * 1.10 = $161370. After the second year, the investment grew to $161370 * 1.10 = $177607. Therefore, Dr. Smith's net proceeds after two years were $177607.",173877.0,0,1,p2,208,1384

Answer: Prof. Smith's registration fees were <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$560000</fact1>, which is 0.03 * 560000 = $16800. His agent fees were <fact3>4%</fact3> of <fact1>$560000</fact1>, which is 0.04 * 560000 = $22400. So his total fees were 16800 + 22400 = $39200.

Leon has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a <fact7>fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact7>. How much money is Leon still missing?

Answer: The total cost of the workshop is 2 * (<fact2>¥150</fact2> + <fact3>¥30</fact3> + <fact4>¥10</fact4>) = ¥580. Since his friends will cover the cost of all the <fact6>food for the workshop</fact6>, which is 2 * <fact3>¥30</fact3> = ¥60, the remaining cost is ¥580 - ¥60 = ¥520. The youth club will cover a <fact7>fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact7>, which is ¥520 / 5 = ¥104. So, the amount that Leon still needs to cover is ¥520 - ¥104 = ¥416.

Answer: The total cost of the conference is 2 * (<fact2>$200</fact2> + <fact3>$30</fact3> + <fact4>$30</fact4>) = $920. Ibrahim's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact6>food for the conference</fact6>, which is 2 * <fact3>$30</fact3> = $60. So the remaining cost is $920 - $60 = $860.

How much more do <fact5>5 loaves of bread</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 bagels</fact6>?

Answer: The cost of a bagel is <fact2>1/8 of a loaf of bread</fact2>, which is <fact1>€10</fact1>/<fact2>8</fact2> = €1.25 per bagel. Since 8 bagels is more than <fact3>7 bagels or more</fact3>, they get a <fact4>10% discount on bagels</fact4>. So the cost of 8 bagels is 8 * €1.25 * (1 - <fact4>10%</fact4>) = €10.
