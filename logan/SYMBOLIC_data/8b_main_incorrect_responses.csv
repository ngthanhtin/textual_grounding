1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 92 minutes to cover every 9 miles of the city</fact1>. If the city is <fact2>45 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: Since it takes <fact1>92 minutes</fact1> to cover <fact2>9 miles</fact2> of the city, we can calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile by dividing <fact1>92 minutes</fact1> by <fact2>9 miles</fact2>. This gives us 92/<fact2>9</fact2> = 10.22 minutes per mile.
To find the time it takes to cover the whole city, we need to multiply the time it takes to cover 1 mile by the total distance across the city, which is <fact2>45 miles</fact2>. This gives us 10.22 * <fact2>45</fact2> = 459 minutes.
The answer is {459}.",460,0,1,p2,58,835

If the city is <fact2>81 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections the city is divided into and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each 3-mile section. Since the city is <fact2>81 miles across</fact2>, we can divide that by <fact1>3 miles</fact1> to get the number of 3-mile sections: <fact2>81 miles</fact2> / <fact1>3 miles</fact1> = 27 sections. Now, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section: <fact1>27 sections</fact1> * <fact1>354 minutes/section</fact1> = 9546 minutes.",9558,0,1,p2,60,903

If the city is <fact2>63 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many sets of <fact1>3 miles</fact1> are in <fact2>63 miles</fact2>. We can do this by dividing <fact2>63 miles</fact2> by <fact1>3 miles</fact1>, which gives us <fact2>63</fact2>/<fact1>3</fact1> = 21 sets of <fact1>3 miles</fact1>. Since it takes <fact1>324 minutes</fact1> to cover every <fact1>3 miles</fact1>, it will take <fact1>324</fact1> * <fact2>21</fact2> = 6808 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.",6804,0,1,p2,61,841
1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>398 minutes to cover every 3 miles</fact1> of the city. If the city is <fact2>42 miles across</fact2> from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?

Answer: To find the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to first find out how many 3-mile segments the city is divided into. This can be calculated by dividing the total distance of the city by the distance covered by the fog bank in one segment. So, we have <fact2>42 miles</fact2> / <fact1>3 miles</fact1> = 14 segments.
Since it takes <fact1>398 minutes</fact1> to cover every 3 miles of the city, it will take the same amount of time to cover each of the 14 segments. Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city is <fact1>398 minutes</fact1> * <fact2>14 segments</fact2> = 5548 minutes.",5572,0,1,p2,67,978
1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 280 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>. If the city is <fact2>93 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the distance that the fog bank covers per 280 minutes. The fog bank covers <fact1>3 miles</fact1> every 280 minutes. So, the distance that the fog bank covers per minute is <fact1>3 miles</fact1> / <fact1>280 minutes</fact1> = <fact1>3/280</fact1> miles per minute. Now, we can divide the total distance of the city by the distance that the fog bank covers per minute to find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city. The total time is <fact2>93 miles</fact2> / <fact1>3/280 miles per minute</fact1> = <fact2>93</fact2> * <fact1>280</fact1> / <fact1>3</fact1> = 9240 minutes.",8680,0,1,p2,68,1046

If the city is <fact2>68 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance of the city by the distance the fog bank covers in 99 minutes. The total distance of the city is <fact2>68 miles</fact2>. The distance the fog bank covers in 99 minutes is <fact1>17 miles</fact1>. So, the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city is <fact2>68 miles</fact2> / <fact1>17 miles</fact1> * <fact1>99 minutes</fact1>. This is equal to 68/17 * 99 = 360 minutes.",396,0,1,p2,78,822

If the city is <fact2>30 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the total time it takes to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many 5-mile sections the city is divided into and multiply that number by the time it takes to cover each section. The city is <fact2>30 miles</fact2> across, and it takes <fact1>300 minutes to cover every 5 miles</fact1>. So, we can divide the total distance by the distance covered in each section: <fact2>30 miles</fact2> / <fact1>5 miles</fact1> = 6 sections. Since it takes <fact1>300 minutes to cover every 5 miles</fact1>, we can multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section: 6 sections * <fact1>300 minutes</fact1> = 1800 minutes. Therefore, it will take 1800 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.",1800,0,1,p2,79,1049

If the city is <fact2>58 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: The city is <fact2>58 miles</fact2> across, so the fog bank needs to cover <fact2>58 miles</fact2>/ <fact1>2 miles</fact1> = 29 sets of 2 miles.
The fog bank takes <fact1>204 minutes</fact1> to cover every 2 miles, so it will take the fog bank 29 * <fact1>204 minutes</fact1> = 5922 minutes to cover the whole city.

If the city is <fact2>91 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to find out how many sets of <fact1>13 miles</fact1> are there in the city. We can do this by dividing the total distance of the city by the distance covered in one set. This gives us <fact2>91 miles</fact2> / <fact1>13 miles</fact1> = 7 sets. Since it takes <fact3>349 minutes</fact3> to cover every set, we can find the total time it takes to cover the whole city by multiplying the number of sets by the time it takes to cover one set.

Answer: To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to first find out how many sets of 3 miles are there in the city. This can be calculated by dividing the total distance of the city by the distance covered by the fog bank in one set. So, the number of sets of 3 miles in the city is <fact2>99 miles</fact2> / <fact1>3 miles</fact1> = 33 sets. Since it takes <fact1>114 minutes</fact1> to cover every 3 miles of the city, it will take 33 sets * <fact1>114 minutes</fact1> = 3780 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.",3762,0,1,p2,98,880
1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>241 minutes to cover every 5 miles of the city</fact1>. If the city is <fact2>85 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to divide the total distance across the city by the distance that the fog bank covers in 241 minutes. This is because the fog bank covers 5 miles in 241 minutes, so we can find the distance it covers in 1 minute by dividing 5 miles by 241 minutes, and then multiply that by the total distance across the city. The distance the fog bank covers in 1 minute is 5/<fact1>241</fact1> = 0.0207 miles per minute. The total distance across the city is <fact2>85 miles</fact2>. Therefore, it will take the fog bank <fact2>85 miles</fact2> / 0.0207 miles per minute = 4091 minutes to cover the whole city.",4097,0,1,p2,99,1008

Answer: There are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>twelve-sided die</fact1>. The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a <fact2>4</fact2>, <fact2>5</fact2>, <fact2>6</fact2>, <fact2>7</fact2>, <fact2>8</fact2>, <fact2>9</fact2>, <fact2>10</fact2>, <fact2>11</fact2>, or <fact2>12</fact2>) divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact2>9</fact2> favorable outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> is <fact2>9</fact2>/<fact1>12</fact1> = <fact2>0.75</fact2>. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the first roll and an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the second roll) divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact3>6</fact3> <fact3>odd numbers</fact3> on a <fact1>twelve-sided die</fact1>, so the number of favorable outcomes is <fact3>6</fact3>*<fact3>6</fact3> = <fact3>36</fact3>. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is <fact3>36</fact3>/<fact1>12</fact1>*<fact1>12</fact1> = <fact3>0.3</fact3>. To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> from the probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2>: <fact2>0.75</fact2> - <fact3>0.3</fact3> = <fact4>0.45</fact4>.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Hiroshi is rolling a d10 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability that Hiroshi rolls a number greater than 2, we need to find the probability that he rolls a 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Since there are 10 possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, and 8 of these outcomes are greater than 2, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>8/10</fact1> = 0.8.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) out of the 10 possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, so the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact2>5/10</fact2> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also <fact2>5/10</fact2> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact2>0.5</fact2> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 0.25.
To find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling two odd numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55.
To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.55 * 100 = 55%.
Therefore, it is 55% more likely that Hiroshi rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.",55,0,1,p2,102,1588
2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Oscar is rolling a d10 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 5 and subtract it from 1. There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, and 5 of them are less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 5 is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is then 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll and an odd number on the second roll. There are <fact1>5</fact1> odd numbers out of <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, so the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also <fact1>5/10</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%. Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Oscar rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.",25,0,1,p2,104,1578
2,"Reformatted Question: Luis is rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: Since the die is <fact1>20-sided</fact1>, each number from 1 to 20 is equally likely to be rolled. This means that the probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> is the same as the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 2. Since there are 18 numbers greater than 2 and 2 numbers less than or equal to 2, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact4>18/20 = 9/10</fact4>. The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 2 is <fact5>2/20 = 1/10</fact5>. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is the same as the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row on the first two rolls. There are 10 odd numbers on the die, so the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact6>10/20 = 1/2</fact6>. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled on the first roll, is also <fact7>10/20 = 1/2</fact7>. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact8>(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4</fact8>. The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact9>9/10 - 1/4 = 7/20</fact9>. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: <fact10>(7/20) * 100 = 35%</fact10>. Therefore, it is 35% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Ibrahim is rolling a d4 die</fact1>. <fact2>How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row</fact2>?
Answer: There are <fact1>4 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a d4 die: 1, 2, 3, and 4. A number greater than 1 is 2, 3, or 4, so there are <fact2>3 possible outcomes</fact2> for rolling a number greater than 1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is <fact2>3/4</fact2> or 75%.
On the other hand, there are <fact3>2 possible outcomes</fact3> for rolling two odd numbers in a row: 1, 3 and 3, 1. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact3>2/16</fact3> or 12.5%.
The difference in probability is <fact2>75%</fact2> - <fact3>12.5%</fact3> = 62.5%.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>James is rolling a d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d20 die. A number greater than 2 can be rolled in <fact2>18</fact2> of those outcomes, because the numbers 1 and 2 are less than 2. The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is therefore <fact2>18/20</fact2> = 0.9 or 90%. 

To roll two even numbers in a row, James must roll an even number on the first roll and then an even number on the second roll. There are <fact3>10</fact3> even numbers on a d20 die, so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 0.5. If the first roll is even, there are <fact4>9</fact4> even numbers left on the die, so the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is <fact4>9/20</fact4>. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact3>10/20</fact3> * <fact4>9/20</fact4> = 0.045 or 4.5%.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 90% - 4.5% = 85.5%. Therefore, James is 85.5% more likely to roll a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.",65,0,1,p2,108,1329
2,"Reformatted Question: Wei is rolling a <fact1>6-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are <fact1>6</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 6-sided die, and 3 of them are greater than 3. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%.
To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number twice in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a 6-sided die. So the probability of rolling an even number is 3/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/<fact1>6</fact1>)*(3/<fact1>6</fact1>) = 0.25 or 25%.
To find the difference in probability, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. So the difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.
Therefore, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.",25,0,1,p2,110,1237

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6, which is <fact1>3</fact1>/<fact2>6</fact2> = 0.5 or 50%.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling two 2s, two 4s, or two 6s, which is 3/(6*6) = 1/12 or approximately 0.083 or 8.3%.
Therefore, the difference in probability is 50% - 8.3% = 41.7%.

Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a <fact2>ten-sided die</fact2>. The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact3>2</fact3> is the number of outcomes greater than <fact3>2</fact3> divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 8/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.8. The probability of rolling two <fact4>even numbers in a row</fact4> is the number of outcomes that are even divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. The difference in probability is 0.8 - 0.5 = 0.3. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 30%.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Leon is rolling a d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>1</fact2> than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1, we first need to know how many numbers on the die are greater than 1. On a d20, the numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. That's a total of 19 numbers. Since there are 20 possible outcomes when rolling a d20, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 19/20 = 0.95 or 95%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a d20 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18. That's a total of 9 even numbers. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 9/20. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 9/20. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (9/20) * (9/20) = 81/400 = 0.2025 or 20.25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The difference is 95% - 20.25% = 74.75%. To express this as a percentage, we need to convert it to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Therefore, the difference is 74.75% * 100 = 7475%.

2,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>James is rolling a d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability that James rolls a number greater than 2, we need to find the probability that he rolls a number less than or equal to 2 and subtract it from 1. There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d20 die. The numbers less than or equal to 2 are 1 and 2, so there are <fact2>2</fact2> possible outcomes where James rolls a number less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the probability that James rolls a number greater than 2 is 1 - <fact2>2</fact2>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.
To find the probability that James rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability that he rolls an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. There are <fact1>10</fact1> even numbers on a d20 die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) and <fact2>10</fact2> odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that James rolls an even number on the first roll is <fact1>10</fact1>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. The probability that he rolls an even number on the second roll is also <fact1>10</fact1>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability that James rolls two even numbers in a row is <fact1>0.5</fact1> * <fact1>0.5</fact1> = 0.25.
To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2. This is 0.9 - 0.25 = 0.65.
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.65 * 100 = 65%.
Therefore, James is 65% more likely to roll a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.",65,0,1,p2,119,1770
2,"Reformatted Question: Arjun is rolling a <fact1>12-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, which is <fact3>1/12</fact3> + <fact3>1/12</fact3> + <fact3>1/12</fact3> + <fact3>1/12</fact3> = 4/12 = 1/3. Since the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is also 1/3. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, which is <fact4>6/12</fact4>, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll, which is also <fact4>6/12</fact4>. So the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact4>6/12</fact4> * <fact4>6/12</fact4> = 36/144 = 1/4. Therefore, the difference in probability is 1/3 - 1/4 = 4/12 - 3/12 = 1/12.

Answer: A 4-sided die has 4 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
A number greater than 2 can be either 3 or 4, which are 2 possible outcomes. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>2</fact1>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 0.5 or 50%.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling two 2's in a row, which is <fact3>1</fact3>/<fact2>4</fact2> * <fact3>1</fact3>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 1/16 or 6.25%.
The difference between the two probabilities is 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.
Therefore, it is 43.75% more likely that Esteban rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Answer: To find the probability that Liam rolls a number greater than 4, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes. There are 16 numbers greater than 4 on a twenty-sided die (<fact1>1</fact1>, <fact1>2</fact1>, <fact1>3</fact1>, <fact1>4</fact1> are less than 4, and <fact1>5</fact1> to <fact1>20</fact1> are greater than 4). The total number of outcomes is 20. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is 16/20 = 0.8 or 80%.

Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die.
There are <fact2>6</fact2> numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 6/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.6 or 60%.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the same as the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, which is 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll, which is also 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.

Answer: To find the probability that Wei rolls a number greater than 5, we need to find the probability that he rolls a number greater than or equal to 6, which is <fact1>1/20</fact1> of the total outcomes, since there are 20 possible outcomes when rolling a 20-sided die and 14 of them are greater than or equal to 6.
To find the probability that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability that he rolls an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. There are <fact2>10</fact2> even numbers out of <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes for the first roll, and for the second roll, there are also <fact2>10</fact2> even numbers out of <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes.

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 20-sided die. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the number of outcomes greater than 5 divided by the total number of outcomes. There are 15 outcomes greater than 5 (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 15/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.75. 
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the number of outcomes that are even, divided by the total number of outcomes, multiplied by the number of outcomes that are even, divided by the total number of outcomes. There are 10 outcomes that are even (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/<fact1>20</fact1>)*(10/<fact1>20</fact1>) = 0.05.

The probability that <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> are rolled is <fact3>0.5 * 0.5</fact3> = 0.25. 
The probability that the first number rolled is greater than 4 is <fact1>10/20</fact1> = 0.5, because there are 10 numbers greater than 4 on the die. 
The probability that the second number rolled is greater than 4 is <fact1>11/20</fact1>, because there are 11 numbers greater than 4 on the die.

Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 10-sided die. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the number of outcomes that satisfy this condition. The outcomes that satisfy this condition are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. There are <fact1>8</fact1> such outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>8</fact1>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.8.
To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the number of outcomes that satisfy this condition. The outcomes that satisfy this condition are 2, 4, 6, and 8. There are <fact2>4</fact2> such outcomes. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact2>4</fact2>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.4.
To find the difference in the probabilities, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2. This gives us 0.8 - 0.4 = 0.4.

How many like to <fact4>play music</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>dance</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: The total number of students who like to hike or play hurling is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>34</fact3> = 41 students.
Since the rest of the students like to either play music or dance, the number of students who like to play music or dance is <fact1>189</fact1> - <fact2>41</fact2> = 148 students.
Let's assume the number of students who like to play hurling is x. Then, the number of students who like to dance is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>, which is 2x.
We know that the total number of students who like to dance or play music is 148. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 148.
Combine like terms: 3x = 148.
Divide both sides by 3: x = 49.33 (round down to 49 since we can't have a fraction of a student).
Now that we know x, we can find the number of students who like to dance: 2x = 2(49) = 98 students.
The number of students who like to play music is the total number of students who like to play music or dance minus the number of students who like to dance: 148 - 98 = 50 students.

How many like to <fact6>dance</fact6> if the number that like to <fact7>bake</fact7> is <fact8>twice the number that prefer playing tennis</fact8>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to paint or play tennis is <fact2>15</fact2> + <fact3>20</fact3> = 35.
Since there are <fact1>107</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to dance or bake is <fact1>107</fact1> - <fact2>35</fact2> = 72.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play tennis as x. Then, the number of students who like to bake is <fact8>twice the number that prefer playing tennis</fact8>, which is 2x.
Since the number of students who like to dance or bake is 72, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 72.
Combining like terms, we get 3x = 72.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 24.
This means that the number of students who like to play tennis is 24, and the number of students who like to bake is 2x = 2*24 = 48.
Since the number of students who like to dance or bake is 72, and the number of students who like to bake is 48, the number of students who like to dance is 72 - 48 = 24.

Answer: The number of students that like to read, play volleyball, or hike and play video games is <fact1>193</fact1>. The number of students that like to read is <fact2>108</fact2>. So the number of students that like to hike and play video games is <fact1>193</fact1> - <fact2>108</fact2> = 85. The number of students that like to play video games is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing volleyball</fact6>, so it is <fact3>7</fact3> * 2 = 14.

In the next 18 seconds, the kernels popped at <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, so <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>80</fact1> = 320 kernels popped.
In the final 18 seconds, the popping slowed down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact4>, so <fact4>half</fact4> of 320 popped, which is 320/<fact4>2</fact4> = 160 kernels popped.
In the final 18 seconds, a quarter of the kernels popped from residual heat, so a quarter of 160 popped, which is 160/<fact5>4</fact5> = 40 kernels popped.
So, in total, Noah has 80 + 160 + 320 + 160 + 40 = 660 kernels of popcorn to eat.

Answer: The ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> to <fact2>cups of water</fact2> is <fact3>164:78</fact3>. This means that for every 164 <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1>, there are 78 <fact2>cups of water</fact2>. The total number of parts in the ratio is 164 + 78 = 242. The total number of <fact4>teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4> used is 726. To find the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used, we need to find what fraction of the total number of parts the <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> represent. This is 164/242.

If she used a total of <fact4>1456 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact6>S</fact6> and the number of cups of water as <fact7>W</fact7>. According to the ratio, we have <fact3>83:99</fact3> = <fact6>S:W</fact6>. This means that for every 83 teaspoons of sugar, there are 99 cups of water. We can rewrite this as <fact6>S/W</fact6> = <fact3>83/99</fact3>. 

We are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact4>1456</fact4>. This means that <fact6>S + W</fact6> = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

We can use the ratio to express <fact7>W</fact7> in terms of <fact6>S</fact6>. From <fact6>S/W</fact6> = <fact3>83/99</fact3>, we can rewrite as <fact7>W</fact7> = <fact6>S</fact6> * <fact3>99/83</fact3>. 

Substituting this expression for <fact7>W</fact7> into the equation <fact6>S + W</fact6> = <fact4>1456</fact4>, we get <fact6>S</fact6> + <fact6>S</fact6> * <fact3>99/83</fact3> = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

Simplifying this equation, we get <fact6>S</fact6> * (1 + <fact3>99/83</fact3>) = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

<fact6>S</fact6> * (83 + 99)/83 = <fact4>1456</fact4>.

Answer: Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is <fact4>x</fact4> and the number of cups of water used is <fact5>y</fact5>. According to the ratio, <fact1>125x = 6y</fact1>. We also know that <fact2>x + y = 917</fact2>. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of <fact4>x</fact4>.

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact6>S</fact6> and the number of cups of water as <fact7>W</fact7>. According to the ratio, we have <fact6>S</fact6>/<fact7>W</fact7> = <fact3>197:28</fact3>. This can be rewritten as <fact6>S</fact6> = <fact3>197</fact3>*<fact7>W</fact7>/<fact3>28</fact3>. We are given that <fact4>S + W = 900</fact4>. Substituting the expression for <fact6>S</fact6> from the ratio, we get <fact3>197</fact3>*<fact7>W</fact7>/<fact3>28</fact3> + <fact7>W</fact7> = 900.

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact3>S</fact3> and the number of cups of water as <fact4>W</fact4>. We are given that the ratio of sugar to water is <fact1>28:54</fact1>, which can be written as <fact3>S/W = 28/54</fact3>. Since <fact2>the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 574</fact2>, we can set up the equation <fact3>S + W = 574</fact3>. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of <fact3>S</fact3>. First, we can rewrite the first equation as <fact3>S = 28/54*W</fact3>. Substituting this expression for <fact3>S</fact3> into the second equation, we get <fact3>28/54*W + W = 574</fact3>. Multiplying both sides by 54 to eliminate the fraction, we get <fact3>28W + 54W = 31152</fact3>. Combining like terms, we get <fact3>82W = 31152</fact3>.

Now that we have found the value of <fact4>W</fact4>, we can substitute it into the expression for <fact3>S</fact3> to find the value of <fact3>S</fact3>. We have <fact3>S = 28/54*380</fact3>. Multiplying 28 and 380, we get <fact3>10640</fact3>. Dividing this result by 54, we get <fact3>S = 197.037</fact3>.

If she used a total of <fact4>1188 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: The total number of parts in the ratio is <fact3>83</fact3> + <fact2>25</fact2> = 108 parts.
The number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is <fact3>83</fact3> parts out of the 108 parts, so the fraction of the total used is <fact3>83/108</fact3>.
The total number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is <fact4>1188</fact4> teaspoons, and the fraction of the total used is <fact3>83/108</fact3>, so we can set up the equation: <fact4>1188</fact4> = <fact3>83/108</fact3> * x, where x is the total number of parts in the ratio.
We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by <fact3>108/83</fact3>, which gives us: x = <fact4>1188</fact4> * <fact3>108/83</fact3> = 1554.
Since the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is <fact3>83</fact3> parts out of the 108 parts, we can multiply the total number of parts (1554) by the fraction of the total used by <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> (<fact3>83/108</fact3>): 1554 * <fact3>83/108</fact3> = 1188.
However, this is not the correct answer. We need to multiply the total number of parts (108) by the fraction of the total used by <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> (<fact3>83/108</fact3>): 108 * <fact3>83/108</fact3> = 83.
Therefore, the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is 83.",913,0,1,p2,276,1600

If she used a total of <fact4>600 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> she used.
Answer: The ratio of sugar to water is <fact3>80:70</fact3>. This means that for every <fact3>80</fact3> parts of sugar, there are <fact2>70</fact2> parts of water. The total number of parts is <fact3>80+70=150</fact3>. The fraction of the total mixture that is sugar is <fact1>80/150</fact1>. Since Elena used a total of <fact4>600</fact4> teaspoons of sugar and water, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is <fact1>80/150</fact1> * <fact4>600</fact4> = <fact1>80/150</fact1> * <fact4>600</fact4> = 16 * 600 / 3 = 16 * 200 = 3200 / 3 = 3200 / 3 * 1 = 3200/3 = 1066.67.

If she used a total of <fact4>635 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> she used.
Answer: The total parts in the ratio are <fact3>113+14=127</fact3>. 
Since <fact4>635</fact4> is the total number of parts used, we can set up a proportion to find the number of parts that represent <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1>. Let's call this number x. Then we have the proportion <fact3>113/127=x/635</fact3>.
We can solve for x by cross-multiplying to get <fact3>113*635=127x</fact3>, which simplifies to <fact3>71845=127x</fact3>.
Dividing both sides by 127 gives us <fact3>x=565</fact3>. This means that <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> represent 565 parts of the total.
Since the total number of parts used was <fact4>635</fact4>, we can find the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> used by dividing 565 by 113, which is the number of parts that represent <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> in the ratio. This gives us <fact3>565/113=5</fact3>.

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact3>S</fact3> and the number of cups of water as <fact4>W</fact4>. According to the given ratio, we have <fact1>91S = 86W</fact1>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is <fact2>1239</fact2>, we can write the equation <fact5>S + W = 1239</fact5>. Now we have a system of two equations:
<fact1>91S = 86W</fact1>
<fact5>S + W = 1239</fact5>
We can solve this system of equations by substituting <fact4>W</fact4> from the first equation into the second equation:
<fact5>S + (91S/86) = 1239</fact5>
Multiplying both sides of the equation by <fact6>86</fact6>, we get:
<fact7>86S + 91S = 1239 * 86</fact7>
<fact8>177S = 106514</fact8>

Answer: Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar is <fact4>x</fact4> and the number of cups of water is <fact5>y</fact5>. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 131:62, we can set up the following equation:
<fact1>131x = 62y</fact1>
We are also given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 579, so we can set up the following equation:
<fact2>x + y = 579</fact2>
We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. First, we can multiply the second equation by 62 to get:
<fact3>62x + 62y = 35958</fact3>
Now we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to get:
<fact4>62x - 131x = 35958 - 131x</fact4>
This simplifies to:
<fact5>-69x = 35958 - 131x</fact5>
Now we can add 131x to both sides to get:
<fact6>62x = 35958</fact6>
Now we can divide both sides by 62 to get:

If she used a total of <fact4>1108 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact1>S</fact1> and the number of cups of water as <fact2>W</fact2>. According to the given ratio, we have <fact3>S/W = 182/95</fact3>. We can rewrite this as <fact4>S = (182/95)W</fact4>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact5>1108</fact5>, we can write the equation <fact6>S + W = 1108</fact6>. Substituting the expression for <fact1>S</fact1> from <fact4>S = (182/95)W</fact4> into <fact6>S + W = 1108</fact6>, we get <fact7>(182/95)W + W = 1108</fact7>. Combining like terms, we have <fact8>(182 + 95)/95W = 1108</fact8>, which simplifies to <fact9>277/95W = 1108</fact9>.

Answer: Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let <fact3>s</fact3> be the number of teaspoons of sugar and <fact4>w</fact4> be the number of cups of water. We know that <fact1>197</fact1> : <fact4>94</fact4> = <fact3>s</fact3> : <fact4>w</fact4>, so we can write <fact5>197w = 94s</fact5>. We are also given that <fact2>1455 = s + w</fact2>. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of <fact3>s</fact3>. Rearranging the second equation, we get <fact6>w = 1455 - s</fact6>. Substituting this into the first equation, we get <fact7>197(1455 - s) = 94s</fact7>. Expanding and simplifying, we get <fact8>288,095 - 197s = 94s</fact8>.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pomegranates Jamal has in total. Since <fact1>there are 36 pomegranates per hectare</fact1> and Jamal has <fact1>25 hectares of pomegranate field</fact1>, we can calculate the total number of pomegranates as <fact2>36 pomegranates/hectare</fact2> * <fact1>25 hectares</fact1> = 900 pomegranates.

Since Jamal can harvest his pomegranates every <fact3>4 months</fact3>, we need to find out how many 4-month periods are there in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide 12 by 4 to get 3. This means that there are 3 four-month periods in a year.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pomegranates Jamal can harvest within a year by multiplying the total number of pomegranates by the number of four-month periods: <fact4>900 pomegranates</fact4> * <fact3>3 periods</fact3> = 2700 pomegranates.

However, this is not the correct answer because Jamal can only harvest the pomegranates that are mature enough to be picked. Since Jamal has 900 pomegranates in total, and he can harvest them every 4 months, he will harvest the pomegranates that are mature enough to be picked. Therefore, the correct answer is 900 pomegranates.

Answer: Since <fact1>Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months</fact1>, he can harvest them twice within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months. 
First, we need to find out how many apricots <fact2>Luis has in total</fact2>. Since <fact1>he has 15 square yards of apricot field</fact1> and <fact2>there are 43 apricots per square yard</fact2>, he has <fact1>15</fact1> * <fact2>43</fact2> = 645 apricots in total.
Now, we need to find out how many apricots <fact3>Luis can harvest in 6 months</fact3>. Since he has 645 apricots in total and he can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest 645/2 = 322.5 apricots in 6 months. However, since he cannot harvest a fraction of an apricot, we can assume that he can harvest 322 apricots in 6 months.
Now, we can find out how many apricots <fact4>Luis can harvest within a year</fact4>. Since <fact3>Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months</fact3>, he can harvest 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 * 322 = 644 apricots.

If he makes <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5>, <fact6>15 small cubes</fact6>, and <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7>, how many grams of water does he have left?
Answer: To find the total amount of water used, we need to find the total amount of water used for the giant cubes, the medium cubes, and the small cubes separately, and then add them together. The total amount of water used for the giant cubes is <fact2>12 grams per cube</fact2> * <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5> = 108 grams. The total amount of water used for the medium cubes is <fact3>11 grams</fact3> * <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7> = 132 grams. The total amount of water used for the small cubes is <fact4>4/5 of a gram</fact4> * <fact6>15 small cubes</fact6> = 6 grams. So the total amount of water used is 108 + 132 + 6 = 246 grams.

16,"Reformatted Question: Ibrahim is selling brownie and pear pie for a fundraiser. <fact1>On Sunday, he sold 21 boxes of brownie</fact1> and <fact2>14 fewer boxes of pear pie, than on Monday</fact2>. <fact3>On Monday, he sold 13 more boxes of brownies than on Sunday</fact3> and <fact4>22 boxes of pear pie</fact4>. If <fact5>the brownie cost $9</fact5> and <fact6>the pear pie cost $28</fact6>, how much did Ibrahim earn for two days?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many boxes of brownie and pear pie Ibrahim sold on Monday. 
On Monday, he sold <fact3>13 more boxes of brownies than on Sunday</fact3>, so he sold <fact1>21</fact1> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 34 boxes of brownie. 
On Monday, he sold <fact4>22 boxes of pear pie</fact4>. 
We are given that he sold <fact2>14 fewer boxes of pear pie on Sunday than on Monday</fact2>, so he sold <fact4>22</fact4> - <fact2>14</fact2> = 8 boxes of pear pie on Sunday. 
In total, he sold 34 + 22 = 56 boxes of brownie and 8 + 22 = 30 boxes of pear pie over the two days. 
He earned <fact5>$9</fact5> per box of brownie, so he earned 56 * <fact5>$9</fact5> = $504 from the brownie. 
He earned <fact6>$28</fact6> per box of pear pie, so he earned 30 * <fact6>$28</fact6> = $840 from the pear pie. 
Therefore, he earned a total of $504 + $840 = $1344.",1335,0,1,p2,808,1293

On <fact6>Monday</fact6>, he <fact7>sold 12 more boxes of cupcakes than on Sunday</fact7> and <fact8>25 boxes of apricot pie</fact8>. If the <fact9>cupcake cost ₺12</fact9> and the <fact10>apricot pie cost ₺31</fact10>, how much did <fact11>Xavier earn for two days</fact11>?
Answer: On <fact2>Sunday</fact2>, Xavier sold <fact3>27 boxes of cupcake</fact3> and <fact4>14 fewer boxes of apricot pie</fact4> than on <fact5>Monday</fact5>. This means he sold <fact3>27</fact3> - <fact4>14</fact4> = 13 boxes of apricot pie on <fact2>Sunday</fact2>. Since he sold <fact7>12 more boxes of cupcakes than on Sunday</fact7> on <fact6>Monday</fact6>, he sold <fact3>27</fact3> + <fact7>12</fact7> = 39 boxes of cupcake on <fact6>Monday</fact6>. On <fact6>Monday</fact6>, he also sold <fact8>25 boxes of apricot pie</fact8>. In total, on <fact6>Monday</fact6>, he sold 39 + 25 = 64 boxes of cupcake and apricot pie. On <fact2>Sunday</fact2>, he sold 13 boxes of apricot pie and <fact3>27 boxes of cupcake</fact3>, for a total of 13 + 27 = 40 boxes of cupcake and apricot pie. Thus, the total number of boxes of cupcake and apricot pie that Xavier sold is 40 + 64 = 104 boxes. The total amount of money Xavier earned from selling these boxes is the number of boxes sold multiplied by the cost of each box. Therefore, the total amount of money earned is 104 * <fact9>₺12</fact9> + 104 * <fact10>₺31</fact10> = 1248 + 3232 = 4480 ₺.",1908,0,1,p2,810,1666

If <fact5>the cookie cost €9</fact5> and <fact6>the banana pie cost €32</fact6>, how much did Yusuf earn for two days?

Answer: 
On <fact1>Monday</fact1>, Yusuf sold <fact1>29</fact1> boxes of cookie and <fact2>11 fewer boxes of banana pie</fact2>, than on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>. So, he sold <fact2>29 - 11</fact2> = 18 boxes of banana pie on <fact1>Monday</fact1>.
On <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>, he sold <fact3>11 more boxes of cookies</fact3> than on <fact1>Monday</fact1>, so he sold <fact1>29 + 11</fact1> = 40 boxes of cookie on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>.
On <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>, he sold <fact4>28 boxes of banana pie</fact4>.
In total, he sold <fact1>29</fact1> + <fact3>40</fact3> = 69 boxes of cookie and <fact2>18</fact2> + <fact4>28</fact4> = 46 boxes of banana pie.
He earned <fact5>€9</fact5> * 69 = €621 from the cookie and <fact6>€32</fact6> * 46 = €1472 from the banana pie.
So, he earned a total of €621 + €1472 = €2093.

Answer: On <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 boxes of cupcake</fact2> and <fact3>19 fewer boxes of grape pie, than on Friday</fact3>. So on <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 - <fact3>19</fact3> = 7 boxes of grape pie.
On <fact4>Friday, he sold 13 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday</fact4> and <fact5>28 boxes of grape pie</fact5>. So on <fact4>Friday, he sold 26 + <fact4>13</fact4> = 39 boxes of cupcake.

Answer: On <fact2>Friday, he sold 23 boxes of muffin</fact2> and <fact3>18 fewer boxes of kiwi pie, than on Saturday</fact3>. So, on <fact2>Friday, he sold 23 boxes of muffin</fact2> and <fact3>23 - 18 = 5 boxes of kiwi pie</fact3>. On <fact4>Saturday, he sold 11 more boxes of muffins than on Friday</fact4>, so he sold <fact4>23 + 11 = 34 boxes of muffin</fact4> and <fact5>26 boxes of kiwi pie</fact5>.

Answer: On <fact2>Friday</fact2>, Oscar sold <fact3>29 boxes of brownie</fact3> and <fact4>12 fewer boxes of kiwi pie</fact4> than on <fact5>Saturday</fact5>, so he sold <fact3>29</fact3> - <fact4>12</fact4> = 17 boxes of kiwi pie on <fact2>Friday</fact2>. On <fact6>Saturday</fact6>, he sold <fact7>11 more boxes of brownies</fact7> than on <fact2>Friday</fact2>, so he sold <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact7>11</fact7> = 40 boxes of brownie on <fact6>Saturday</fact6>. On <fact6>Saturday</fact6>, he also sold <fact8>26 boxes of kiwi pie</fact8>. The total number of boxes of brownie sold is <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact7>11</fact7> = 40 boxes on <fact6>Saturday</fact6> and 29 boxes on <fact2>Friday</fact2>, so the total number of boxes of brownie sold is 40 + 29 = 69 boxes. The total number of boxes of kiwi pie sold is 26 on <fact6>Saturday</fact6> and 17 on <fact2>Friday</fact2>, so the total number of boxes of kiwi pie sold is 26 + 17 = 43 boxes. Oscar sold 69 boxes of brownie at <fact9>¥11</fact9> each, so he earned 69 * <fact9>¥11</fact9> = ¥759 from the brownie. Oscar sold 43 boxes of kiwi pie at <fact10>¥27</fact10> each, so he earned 43 * <fact10>¥27</fact10> = ¥1,161 from the kiwi pie. In total, Oscar earned ¥759 + ¥1,161 = ¥1,920 for two days.",1839,0,1,p2,839,1769

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>24-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time it takes for Mia to walk 12 kilometers on the beach as <fact7>t minutes</fact7>. Since she walks at a constant speed, the time it takes for her to walk 12 kilometers on the sidewalk is <fact8>2t minutes</fact8>, because she walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. We know that the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 24-kilometer walk is <fact9>t + 2t = 3t minutes</fact9>. We are given that <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so <fact7>t = 60</fact7> minutes.

If <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>21-mile</fact1> walk, in minutes?
Answer: Since <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> of Xena's walk is spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is <fact1>21 miles</fact1> - <fact2>11 miles</fact2> = 10 miles, and <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> * <fact6>10 miles</fact6> / <fact2>11 miles</fact2> = 40 minutes.
Since Xena walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> / 2 = 22 minutes.

If <fact5>55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>29-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Quinn walks <fact2>11 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>18 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. The total distance she walks is <fact1>29 kilometers</fact1>, so she walks <fact2>11</fact2>/<fact1>29</fact1> = 11/29 of her walk on the beach and <fact3>18</fact3>/<fact1>29</fact1> = 18/29 of her walk on the sidewalk.
Quinn's speed on the beach is <fact5>11 kilometers</fact5> / <fact5>55 minutes</fact5> = 11/55 kilometers per minute.
Quinn's speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>two times</fact4> her speed on the beach, so it is 2 * (11/55) = 22/55 kilometers per minute.
Quinn walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> on the beach at a speed of <fact5>11/55 kilometers per minute</fact5>, so she spends <fact5>11</fact5> / (<fact5>11</fact5>/<fact5>55</fact5>) = 55 minutes walking on the beach.

If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Chen spends <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> on the beach, we can determine her rate of speed on the beach. We know that <fact2>13 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> took <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>, so we can find her rate of speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> = <fact6>1 mile / 4 minutes</fact6> (this is her rate of speed on the beach). Since Chen walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the beach</fact4> on the sidewalk, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is <fact6>1 mile / 2 minutes</fact6>. We know that <fact3>13 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> took an unknown amount of time, so we can find the time by dividing the distance by her rate of speed: <fact3>13 miles</fact3> / <fact6>1 mile / 2 minutes</fact6> = <fact7>26 minutes</fact7> (this is the time it took her to walk on the sidewalk).

Answer: We are given that <fact2>13 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> takes <fact5>65 minutes</fact5>. Since <fact1>Nia walks 28 miles every day</fact1>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> = 0.2 miles/minute. Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk as <fact4>three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, which is 3 * 0.2 = 0.6 miles/minute. Since <fact3>15 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> takes <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> / 0.2 * 0.6 = 195 minutes, we can calculate the total time taken to complete the entire 28-mile walk as <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> + 195 minutes = 260 minutes.",90,0,1,p2,865,1159

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: We know that Kayla walks <fact2>10 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>18 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> for a total of <fact1>28 kilometers</fact1> every day. We also know that <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. Let's assume that she walks at a speed of <fact6>x</fact6> kilometers per minute on the beach.

If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time spent walking on the beach as t minutes. Then, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is (25 - 11) / 2 * t = 7t minutes, since Yara walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk. We know that t + 7t = 44 minutes, so 8t = 44 minutes. Therefore, t = 44 / 8 = 5.5 minutes. This is the time spent walking on the beach. Now, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 7t = 7 * 5.5 = 38.5 minutes. The total time spent walking is 5.5 + 38.5 = 44 minutes for the beach and sidewalk, and 25 - 11 - 14 = 0 miles left for the remaining part of the walk.

If <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>29-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time spent on the beach as t. Then, the time spent on the sidewalk is 29 - 14 - t = 15 - t. Since the distance on the beach is 14 kilometers, the time spent on the beach can be calculated as 14 / v, where v is the speed on the beach. Similarly, the time spent on the sidewalk can be calculated as 15 / (2v), since Isabella walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk. We are given that 56 minutes of the walk is spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation 14 / v = 56 / 60. Solving for v, we get v = 14 * 60 / 56 = 15 km/h. Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk: 15 / (2 * 15) = 15 / 30 = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on the walk is 56 / 60 + 30 = 1.9333 hours = 115.2 minutes. However, this is the time spent on the walk, not the time it takes to complete the walk. We need to add the time it takes to walk the remaining 15 kilometers on the sidewalk, which is 15 / 15 = 1 hour = 60 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes to complete the walk is 115.2 + 60 = 175.2 minutes, which rounds to 175 minutes.

If <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Quinn walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, we can assume that she walks at 2x speed on the sidewalk and x speed on the beach. The distance covered on the sidewalk is <fact3>16 kilometers</fact3> and the distance covered on the beach is <fact2>15 kilometers</fact2>. The time taken to cover these distances can be represented as 16/2x and 15/x respectively. Since the time taken for both distances is the same, we can equate them and solve for x. 16/2x = 15/x. 32x = 30. x = 15/32. Since Quinn spends <fact5>45 minutes of her walk on the beach</fact5>, we can calculate the time taken to cover 15 kilometers on the beach as 45/(15/32) = 96 minutes.

17,"Reformatted Question: Uma walks <fact1>35 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>17 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>18 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Uma walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>35-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Uma spends walking on the beach as t minutes. Then, the time she spends walking on the sidewalk is (35 - 17) / 2 * t = 9t minutes (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk and covers 18 kilometers). We know that t + 9t = 51 minutes (from <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>), so 10t = 51, and t = 5.1 minutes. This means that Uma spends 5.1 * 17 = 86.7 minutes walking on the beach. The time she spends walking on the sidewalk is 51 - 5.1 = 45.9 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for Uma to complete the entire 35-kilometer walk is 86.7 + 45.9 = 132.6 minutes.",78,0,1,p2,883,1130

On the sidewalk, <fact4>Jasmine walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>32-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Since <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can determine the rate at which <fact2>Jasmine walks on the beach</fact2> by dividing the time spent on the beach by the distance walked on the beach. The distance walked on the beach is <fact2>14 miles</fact2>. So, the rate at which <fact2>Jasmine walks on the beach</fact2> is <fact5>56 minutes</fact5> / <fact2>14 miles</fact2> = 4 minutes per mile.
Since <fact4>Jasmine walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the rate at which <fact3>Jasmine walks on the sidewalk</fact3> is 2 * 4 minutes per mile = 8 minutes per mile.
The total time it takes for <fact1>Jasmine to walk the 32-mile trail</fact1> is the sum of the time it takes to walk on the beach and the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk. The time it takes to walk on the beach is <fact5>56 minutes</fact5> and the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk is <fact3>18 miles</fact3> * <fact3>8 minutes per mile</fact3> = 144 minutes.
Therefore, the total time it takes for <fact1>Jasmine to walk the 32-mile trail</fact1> is 56 + 144 = 200 minutes.

On the sidewalk, <fact4>Tara walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>25-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time spent on the sidewalk as x. Since the total time spent walking is 25/<fact2>11</fact2> + 25/<fact3>14</fact3> = 2.27 + 1.79 = 4.06 hours = 244 minutes, we can set up the following equation: 66 + x = 244. Solving for x, we get x = 178 minutes.

Since <fact4>Tara walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the time spent on the sidewalk is twice the time spent on the beach. Thus, the time spent on the sidewalk is 178/2 = 89 minutes. 

The time spent on the beach is 66 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent walking is 66 + 89 = 155 minutes.

However, this is not the total time spent walking, but the time spent walking on the beach and the sidewalk. We need to add the time it takes to walk the remaining 4 kilometers on the sidewalk. Since the time spent walking on the sidewalk is 89 minutes for 14 kilometers, the time spent walking 1 kilometer is 89/14 = 6.36 minutes. Therefore, the time spent walking the remaining 4 kilometers is 4 * 6.36 = 25.44 minutes.

The total time spent walking is 155 + 25.44 = 180.44 minutes.

On the sidewalk, <fact4>Olga walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>28-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time it takes Olga to walk on the beach as <fact7>t</fact7> minutes. Then, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is <fact8>3t</fact8> minutes, since she walks at three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk. We know that <fact5>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so <fact7>t</fact7> = 50 minutes. We also know that the total distance Olga walks is <fact6>28 kilometers</fact6>, which is equal to 28000 meters. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach and 18 kilometers on the sidewalk, we can set up the following equation: 10,000 * <fact7>t</fact7> + 18,000 * <fact8>3t</fact8> = 28000 * 1000. Substituting <fact7>t</fact7> = 50, we get: 10,000 * 50 + 18,000 * 150 = 28000 * 1000. Solving this equation, we get: 500,000 + 2,700,000 = 28,000,000. This equation is true, so we can find the total time it takes Olga to complete the entire 28-kilometer walk by adding the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk: <fact7>t</fact7> + <fact8>3t</fact8> = 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

On the sidewalk, <fact4>Rania walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed on the beach as x km/min. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 3x km/min. The time spent on the beach is 12/x km, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 18/(3x) = 6/x km. Since the total time spent on the beach is 48 minutes, we can set up the equation 12/x = 48/60 = 4/5. Solving for x, we get x = 12/4 = 3 km/min. Now, we can find the time spent on the beach: 12/x = 12/3 = 4 minutes. The time spent on the sidewalk is 18/(3x) = 18/(3*3) = 2 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on the entire 30-kilometer walk is 4 + 2 = 6 minutes for the beach and sidewalk, and 30 - 12 - 18 = 0 km for the remaining part of the walk. Since Rania only walks on the beach and sidewalk, we can ignore the remaining part of the walk. The total time spent on the walk is 6 + 0 = 6 minutes.",72,0,1,p2,898,1305

If <fact5>Leilani is sure to get 30% of the geography questions</fact5>, and <fact6>1/3 of the literature and biology questions correctly</fact6>, how many points is she sure to get?
Answer: First, let's determine how many geography questions there are. Since <fact2>60% of the questions are geography</fact2>, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage of geography questions: <fact1>150</fact1> * <fact2>0.6</fact2> = 90 geography questions.
Leilani is sure to get <fact5>30% of the geography questions</fact5>, which is <fact5>30%</fact5> * <fact1>90</fact1> = 27 geography questions.
Since the rest of the questions are equally divided between <fact3>literature</fact3> and <fact4>biology questions</fact4>, we can calculate the number of literature and biology questions by subtracting the number of geography questions from the total number of questions: <fact1>150</fact1> - <fact2>90</fact2> = 60 questions.
Since these 60 questions are equally divided between literature and biology, we can calculate the number of literature and biology questions by dividing the total number of questions by 2: <fact1>60</fact1> / <fact3>2</fact3> = 30 questions each.
Leilani is sure to get <fact6>1/3 of the literature and biology questions correctly</fact6>, which is <fact6>1/3</fact6> * <fact3>30</fact3> = 10 literature and biology questions.

Answer: The number of forks in the package that Camila bought is denoted by <fact6>Camila</fact6>. We know that <fact3>her husband also bought a package of 16 new forks</fact3> and gave them to Camila. Therefore, the total number of forks that Camila has is the sum of the forks in the package that she bought and the forks that her husband gave her. We are also given that <fact5>she had a total of 25 forks</fact5> when she went to set the table. Therefore, we can set up the equation: <fact6>Camila</fact6> + 16 = 25.

Answer: To determine how many ounces you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you still need to consume to reach your daily target. Since you have already consumed <fact5>1725 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>1905</fact4> - <fact5>1725</fact5> = 180 calories.

Since each serving of bread has <fact1>450 calories</fact1>, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to determine how many servings you can eat: <fact4>180</fact4> / <fact1>450</fact1> = 0.4 servings.

Since the <fact2>100 ounces bag</fact2> has <fact3>5 servings</fact3>, we can multiply the number of servings you can eat by the total ounces in the bag to determine how many ounces you can eat: 0.4 * <fact2>100</fact2> = 40 ounces.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories are in the bag of popcorn. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag and each serving has <fact1>400 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>400</fact1> = 2000 calories. 

Since you have already consumed <fact5>1375 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>2255</fact4> - <fact5>1375</fact5> = 880 calories. 

To find out how many servings you can eat, divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: <fact4>880</fact4> / <fact1>400</fact1> = 2.2 servings. 

Since you can't eat a fraction of a serving, you can eat 2 servings.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>425 calories</fact1>, we can calculate the total calories in the bag by multiplying the number of servings by the calories per serving: 5 * 425 = 2125 calories.
Since we have already consumed <fact5>1400 calories</fact5>, we need to find out how many calories are left for us to consume. This can be done by subtracting the calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target: 2250 - 1400 = 850 calories.
Now, we know that the bag of breads has a total of 2125 calories, and we need to consume 850 more calories. To find out how many servings we can eat, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 850 / 425 = 2 servings.
Since each serving is <fact3>5 servings</fact3> of the bag, and we can eat 2 servings, we can calculate the number of ounces we can eat by multiplying the number of servings we can eat by the total ounces in the bag: 2 * 150 = 300 ounces.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the 300 oz bag. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can multiply the number of calories per serving by the number of servings: <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> * <fact3>4 servings</fact3> = 1900 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>925 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>2350 - 925 = 1425 calories</fact4> to reach your daily target.
To find out how many servings you can eat, we can divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per serving: <fact4>1425 calories</fact4> / <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 3 servings.
Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, you can eat <fact3>4 - 3 = 1 serving</fact3> left in the bag.
Since there are <fact2>300 oz</fact2> in the bag and <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can find out how many oz are in each serving by dividing the total oz by the number of servings: <fact2>300 oz</fact2> / <fact3>4 servings</fact3> = 75 oz per serving.
Therefore, you can eat <fact3>1 serving</fact3> * <fact2>75 oz per serving</fact2> = <fact6>75 oz</fact6> of cookies.",225,0,1,p2,1226,1430

Answer: To determine how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we first need to calculate how many calories you have left for the day. Since your daily calorie target is <fact3>2300</fact3> and you have already consumed <fact4>800 calories</fact4>, you have <fact3>2300</fact3> - <fact4>800</fact4> = 1500 calories left.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact3>7 servings</fact3> in the bag and each serving has <fact1>475 calories</fact1>, the total calories in the bag are <fact3>7</fact3> * <fact1>475 calories</fact1> = 3325 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>1050 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>2000</fact4> - <fact5>1050</fact5> = 950 calories.
Now, let's find out how many ounces you can eat. Since the bag has 3325 calories and 350 ounces, we can find the calories per ounce by dividing the total calories by the total ounces: <fact1>475 calories</fact1> / <fact2>350 ounces</fact2> = <fact6>1.357 calories per ounce</fact6>.
Now, we can find out how many ounces you can eat by dividing the remaining calories you need to consume by the calories per ounce: <fact7>950 calories</fact7> / <fact6>1.357 calories per ounce</fact6> = 700 ounces.

Answer: To find out how many oz of cookies you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>175</fact1> = 875 calories.

Answer: To find out how many ounces you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 2375 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>1350 calories</fact5>, you still have a calorie deficit of <fact4>2205</fact4> - <fact5>1350</fact5> = 855 calories left to reach your daily target.
Now, we need to find out how many ounces of the breads you can eat to reach this calorie deficit. Since there are 2375 calories in the entire bag, and you want to know how many ounces you can eat to reach 855 calories, we can set up a proportion: 
<fact2>225 ounces</fact2> / <fact3>2375 calories</fact3> = <fact6>x ounces</fact6> / <fact7>855 calories</fact7>

Answer: To find the number of unoccupied wards, we first need to find the number of occupied wards. <fact2>2/5</fact2> of the wards are occupied, so the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>2/5</fact2> = 760 wards.
The number of unoccupied wards is then the total capacity minus the number of occupied wards, which is <fact1>1900</fact1> - <fact2>760</fact2> = 1140 wards.
Since the clinic admits <fact3>30 patients</fact3> each day, the total number of patients admitted in <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> is <fact3>30</fact3> * <fact5>7 days/week</fact5> * <fact6>4 weeks</fact6> = 840 patients.
However, this number does not affect the number of occupied wards, as the wards are already occupied. Therefore, the number of unoccupied wards remains <fact7>1140</fact7> wards.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many wards are occupied at the beginning. Since <fact2>2/5</fact2> of the wards are occupied, the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>2/5</fact2> = 760 wards.
The total number of unoccupied wards at the beginning is <fact1>1900</fact1> - 760 = 1140 wards.
Since <fact3>50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is <fact3>50</fact3> * 21 = 1050 patients.
However, we are only interested in the number of wards, not the number of patients. Since each ward can accommodate 2 patients (as the number of occupied wards is 2/5 of the total wards), the total number of wards occupied by these patients is 1050 / 2 = 525 wards.
So, the total number of unoccupied wards after 3 weeks is 1140 - 525 = 615 wards.

Answer: First, let's find out how many wards are occupied in the hospital. Since <fact2>1/9</fact2> of the wards are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied wards by multiplying the total number of wards by <fact2>1/9</fact2>. So, the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/9</fact2> = 200 wards.
Next, let's calculate the total number of wards that will be occupied after 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, there are 7 * 2 = 14 days in 2 weeks. Since <fact3>65 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 65 * 14 = 910 patients. However, we already have 200 wards occupied, so we need to add 910 - 200 = 710 more patients to the occupied wards.
Since each ward can accommodate 1 patient, the total number of occupied wards after 2 weeks will be 200 + 710 = 910 wards.
Now, let's calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the hospital after 2 weeks. We can do this by subtracting the number of occupied wards from the total number of wards. So, the total number of unoccupied wards is <fact1>1800</fact1> - 910 = 890 wards.

Due to the major accident, <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the medical center after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many beds are occupied initially. Since the medical center has a capacity of <fact1>1200 beds</fact1> and <fact2>1/8</fact2> of them are occupied, we can find the number of occupied beds by multiplying the total capacity by the fraction that is occupied: <fact1>1200</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 150 beds.
This means that there are <fact1>1200</fact1> - <fact3>150</fact3> = 1050 unoccupied beds initially.
Since <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, in a week, <fact3>20</fact3> * <fact4>7</fact4> = 140 patients are admitted.
In <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, <fact3>140</fact3> * <fact4>4</fact4> = 560 patients are admitted.
This means that the number of occupied beds will increase by <fact3>20</fact3> * <fact4>4</fact4> = 80 each week.
However, this is incorrect as the question states that 20 patients are admitted each day. So we should multiply this by the number of days in a week, which is 7. 
So the correct number of occupied beds after 4 weeks is <fact3>20</fact3> * <fact4>28</fact4> = 560.
Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> is <fact1>1200</fact1> - <fact5>560</fact5> = 640 beds.

Answer: Since the medical center has <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> and <fact2>1/10</fact2> of them are occupied, the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1600</fact1> * <fact2>1/10</fact2> = 160 wards. The number of unoccupied wards is <fact1>1600</fact1> - 160 = 1440 wards. 

Since <fact3>35 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, the number of patients admitted in <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> is <fact3>35</fact3> * 7 * 4 = 980 patients. 

However, since the medical center has a capacity of <fact1>1600 wards</fact1> and only <fact2>1/10</fact2> of them are occupied, the medical center can accommodate more than 160 patients.

Answer: The total price of the townhouse includes the <fact2>$320000</fact2> selling price, a <fact3>6%</fact3> brokerage fee, and a <fact4>12%</fact4> transfer fee. To find the total price, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

If he also paid <fact4>$310000 for the remaining loan amount of the condo</fact4>, how much is <fact5>Mr. Davis's net proceeds from selling the condo</fact5>?
Answer: First, we need to calculate the total amount of fees that Mr. Davis paid. The transfer fees amount to <fact2>3%</fact2> of the selling price, which is <fact1>$930000</fact1>. So, the transfer fees are <fact2>3%</fact2> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = <fact2>3/100</fact2> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = $27900. Similarly, the brokerage fee is also <fact3>3%</fact3> of the selling price, which is <fact1>$930000</fact1>. So, the brokerage fee is <fact3>3%</fact3> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = <fact3>3/100</fact3> * <fact1>$930000</fact1> = $27900.

Now, we need to subtract the total amount of fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price to find Mr. Davis's net proceeds. Mr. Davis's net proceeds are <fact1>$930000</fact1> - <fact4>$310000</fact4> - <fact6>$55800</fact6> = $930000 - $310000 - $55800 = $743000.",564200,0,1,p2,1702,1300

The total amount Dr. Miller paid for <fact2>legal fees</fact2> and <fact4>realtor fee</fact4> is $6300 + $12600 = $18900.
Dr. Miller's <fact7>net proceeds from selling the apartment</fact7> is the selling price minus the <fact2>legal fees</fact2> and <fact4>realtor fee</fact4>, which is <fact1>$630000</fact1> - $18900 = $611100.

If he also paid <fact4>$350000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount of the villa, how much is Mr. Rodriguez's net proceeds from selling the villa?
Answer: First, we need to calculate the transfer fees. The transfer fees are <fact2>3%</fact2> of the selling price, which is <fact1>$880000</fact1>. To calculate the transfer fees, we multiply the selling price by the percentage: <fact1>$880000</fact1> * <fact2>0.03</fact2> = $26400. The transfer fees are $26400.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee. The brokerage fee is <fact3>6%</fact3> of the selling price, which is <fact1>$880000</fact1>. To calculate the brokerage fee, we multiply the selling price by the percentage: <fact1>$880000</fact1> * <fact3>0.06</fact3> = $52800. The brokerage fee is $52800.

The total amount Mr. Rodriguez paid in fees is the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee: $26400 + $52800 = $79200.

To find Mr. Rodriguez's net proceeds from selling the villa, we need to subtract the total amount he paid in fees and the remaining loan amount from the selling price: <fact1>$880000</fact1> - <fact4>$350000</fact4> - <fact5>$79200</fact5> = <fact6>$760000</fact6>.

Answer: The total number of minutes in a day is <fact4>10 hours</fact4> * 60 minutes per hour = 600 minutes.
The total number of minutes spent cleaning floors is <fact1>210 floors</fact1> * <fact3>20 minutes per floor</fact3> = 4200 minutes.
The percentage of the day spent cleaning floors is (4200 minutes / 600 minutes) * 100% = 700%.
However, the question asks for the percentage of the day spent cleaning floors, not the percentage of the total time spent cleaning floors. To find the percentage of the day spent cleaning floors, we need to divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning floors by the total number of minutes in a day and multiply by 10 hours (the number of hours worked per day).
The percentage of the day spent cleaning floors is (4200 minutes / 600 minutes) * 10 hours = 7 hours.
To convert this to a percentage, we divide by the total number of hours in a day (24 hours) and multiply by 100%.

If they work <fact4>15 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of minutes the janitor spends cleaning floors. Since it takes them <fact3>30 minutes per floor</fact3> and there are <fact1>90 floors</fact1>, they spend a total of <fact3>30</fact3> * <fact1>90</fact1> = 2700 minutes cleaning floors.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of their day, on average, that the janitor spends cleaning floors. To do this, we'll divide the total number of minutes spent cleaning floors (2700) by the total number of minutes worked each day (900), and then multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage: (2700 / 900) * 100 = 300%.

If they work <fact4>15 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes the janitor works each day. Since they work <fact4>15 hours each day</fact4> and there are <fact5>60 minutes in an hour</fact5>, they work <fact4>15</fact4> * <fact5>60</fact5> = 900 minutes each day.

Next, we need to find out how many floors the janitor can clean in a day. Since it takes them <fact3>15 minutes per floor</fact3>, they can clean <fact6>900 minutes</fact6> / <fact3>15 minutes per floor</fact3> = 60 floors per day.

Since the janitor has to clean <fact1>210 floors</fact1> in <fact2>5 days</fact2>, they will clean 60 floors per day for 5 days. So, the total number of floors they will clean is 60 * 5 = 300 floors.

However, the janitor only has to clean 210 floors. So, they will finish cleaning the floors in less than 5 days. Let's assume they finish cleaning the floors in x days. Then, the total number of floors they will clean is 60x = 210. Solving for x, we get x = 210 / 60 = 3.5 days.

Since the janitor works <fact4>15 hours each day</fact4> and there are <fact5>60 minutes in an hour</fact5>, they work 15 * 60 = 900 minutes each day. They will work for 3.5 days, so the total number of minutes they will work is 900 * 3.5 = 3150 minutes.

The janitor spends 60 minutes per day cleaning floors. So, the percentage of their day, on average, that is spent cleaning floors is (60 / 900) * 100% = 6.67%.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total time it takes to clean all the floors. It takes them <fact3>30 minutes per floor</fact3> to clean one floor, and there are <fact1>120 floors</fact1> to clean. So, the total time it takes to clean all the floors is <fact3>30 minutes per floor</fact3> * <fact1>120 floors</fact1> = 3600 minutes.

Since they have <fact2>10 days</fact2> to get it done, and there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour, the total number of minutes in 10 days is 10 * 24 * 60 = 14400 minutes.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors. They work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, which is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes per day.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning floors, we can divide the total time spent cleaning floors (3600 minutes) by the total time spent working (600 minutes), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

Answer: Let's denote the number of orange tiles as <fact2>7x</fact2>, where x is a positive integer. The total number of tiles in the stack is the sum of the green tiles, orange tiles, and black tiles. We can write an equation to represent this: <fact1>2</fact1> + <fact2>7x</fact2> + <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>46</fact4>. Since we don't know the number of black tiles, we can represent it as <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>46</fact4> - <fact1>2</fact1> - <fact2>7x</fact2>. We can simplify this expression to <fact5>black tiles</fact5> = <fact4>44</fact4> - <fact2>7x</fact2>. Since the number of black tiles must be a non-negative integer, we can set up the inequality <fact4>44</fact4> - <fact2>7x</fact2> ≥ 0.

Answer: Let's denote the number of orange cubes as O and the number of purple cubes as P. We know that there are 2 green cubes and 7 times as many orange cubes, so we can write the equation 2 + 7O = total number of cubes. We also know that the total number of cubes is 39, so we can write the equation 2 + 7O + P = 39. We can simplify the first equation to 7O = 37, and solving for O, we get O = 37/7 = 5.28 (round down to 5 because we can't have a fraction of a cube). Now we can substitute O = 5 into the second equation: 2 + 7(5) + P = 39, which simplifies to 2 + 35 + P = 39. Solving for P, we get P = 39 - 37 = 2.

The total number of bricks is the sum of the number of <fact1>white bricks</fact1>, <fact2>purple bricks</fact2>, and <fact3>pink bricks</fact3>, which is <fact1>2</fact1> + 6 + x = <fact4>30</fact4>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact4>30</fact4> - 8 = 22. Therefore, there are <fact5>22</fact5> <fact3>pink bricks</fact3> in the building.",22,0,1,p2,2098,863
42,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Leon goes to the store to buy some rice</fact1>. <fact2>The normal brand of rice he buys costs $15 per kg</fact2>. <fact3>He had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more</fact3> since his favorite brand was sold out. <fact4>He decides to buy a week's worth of rice</fact4> and he uses <fact5>2 kg of rice per day</fact5>. <fact6>He also decided to buy himself a cookie for $1</fact6>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the normal brand of rice per week. Since <fact4>he decides to buy a week's worth of rice</fact4> and he uses <fact5>2 kg of rice per day</fact5>, he will need <fact5>2 kg</fact5> * 7 days = 14 kg of rice. The cost of the normal brand of rice per week is <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2> * 14 kg = $210.

Since <fact3>he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 40% more</fact3>, the cost of the more expensive brand per kg is <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2> + 40% of <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2>. To calculate 40% of <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2>, we multiply <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2> by <fact7>40/100</fact7> = 0.4. So, 40% of <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2> is <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2> * 0.4 = $6 per kg. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand per kg is <fact2>$15 per kg</fact2> + $6 per kg = $21 per kg.

The cost of the more expensive brand of rice per week is <fact3>$21 per kg</fact3> * 14 kg = $294.

The total cost of the rice per week is the sum of the cost of the normal brand of rice and the cost of the more expensive brand of rice, which is $210 + $294 = $504.

Finally, let's add the cost of the cookie, which is <fact6>$1</fact6>, to the total cost of the rice. The total cost is $504 + $1 = $505.

How much did everything cost?
Answer: To find out how much Bodhi spent on sugar, we first need to find out how much he spent on the normal brand of sugar and the more expensive brand of sugar. <fact2>The normal brand of sugar he buys costs €8 per kg</fact2>. <fact4>He decides to buy a week's worth of sugar</fact4>, which is 7 days. Since he uses <fact5>2 kg of sugar per day</fact5>, he will need 7 * 2 = 14 kg of sugar. The cost of the normal brand of sugar will be <fact2>€8 per kg</fact2> * 14 kg = €112. However, since <fact3>he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 25% more</fact3>, the cost of the more expensive brand will be 1.25 * €8 = €10 per kg. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar will be €10 * 14 kg = €140. The total cost of sugar will be €112 + €140 = €252. Finally, <fact6>he also decided to buy himself a muffin for €1</fact6>, so the total cost will be €252 + €1 = €253.",141,0,1,p2,2113,1346

How much did everything cost?
Answer: <fact4>A week is 7 days</fact4>, so Ali needs <fact5>2 kilogram of flour per day</fact5> * 7 days = 14 kilogram of flour. The normal brand of flour costs <fact2>¥10 per kilogram</fact2>, so the normal brand would cost 14 * <fact2>¥10</fact2> = ¥140. The more expensive brand costs <fact3>40% more</fact3> than the normal brand, which is <fact3>40% of ¥10</fact3> = ¥4. So the more expensive brand costs ¥10 + ¥4 = ¥14 per kilogram.

He decides to buy a week's worth of tea and he uses <fact4>2 kilogram of tea per day</fact4>. He also decided to buy himself a cookie for <fact5>₣2</fact5>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: To find out how much the tea costs, we need to find out how much tea James buys. Since James buys a week's worth of tea and he uses <fact4>2 kilogram of tea per day</fact4>, he buys <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact6>7 days</fact6> = <fact7>14 kilogram</fact7> of tea.
The normal brand of tea costs <fact2>₣15 per kilogram</fact2>, so the normal brand of tea costs <fact2>₣15</fact2> * <fact7>14 kilogram</fact7> = <fact8>₣210</fact8>.
The more expensive brand of tea costs <fact3>40% more</fact3> than the normal brand, so it costs <fact9>₣15</fact9> + <fact9>₣15</fact9> * <fact3>40%</fact3> = <fact9>₣21</fact9> per kilogram.
The more expensive brand of tea costs <fact9>₣21</fact9> * <fact7>14 kilogram</fact7> = <fact10>₣294</fact10>.
The total cost of the tea is <fact8>₣210</fact8> + <fact10>₣294</fact10> = <fact11>₣504</fact11>.

He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses <fact3>2 kg of rice per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a bagel for <fact4>€2</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: First, we need to find out how much the more expensive brand of rice costs. To do this, we need to find 40% of the normal brand's price and add it to the normal brand's price. 40% of <fact1>€5</fact1> is <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>€5</fact1> = <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>€5</fact1> / <fact5>100%</fact5> = €2. So, the more expensive brand of rice costs <fact1>€5</fact1> + <fact2>€2</fact2> = €7 per kg. Arash needs <fact3>2 kg of rice per day</fact3> for a week, so he needs <fact3>2 kg</fact3> * <fact4>7 days</fact4> = 14 kg of rice. The normal brand of rice would cost <fact1>€5</fact1> * <fact6>14 kg</fact6> = €70. The more expensive brand of rice would cost <fact2>€7</fact2> * <fact6>14 kg</fact6> = €98.

How much did everything cost?
Answer: A week is <fact3>7</fact3> days long. So, Jin needs <fact4>2 kg</fact4> * <fact3>7</fact3> = 14 kg of sugar.
The normal brand of sugar costs <fact1>₺5</fact1> per kg. So, the normal brand of sugar costs <fact1>₺5</fact1> * 14 = <fact1>₺70</fact1>.
The more expensive brand of sugar costs 40% more than the normal brand. This means it costs <fact2>1.4</fact2> * <fact1>₺5</fact1> = <fact2>₺7</fact2> per kg.
So, the more expensive brand of sugar costs <fact2>₺7</fact2> * 14 = <fact2>₺98</fact2>.

He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses <fact3>2 kg of rice per day</fact3>. He also decided to buy himself a muffin for <fact4>₣1</fact4>. How much did everything cost?
Answer: A week is <fact3>7 days</fact3> long. So, Gabriel needs <fact3>2 kg/day</fact3> * <fact3>7 days</fact3> = 14 kg of rice.
The normal brand of rice costs <fact1>₣24/kg</fact1> * 14 kg = ₣336.
The more expensive brand costs <fact1>₣24/kg</fact1> + <fact2>25%</fact2> of <fact1>₣24/kg</fact1> = <fact1>₣24/kg</fact1> + <fact2>0.25</fact2> * <fact1>₣24/kg</fact1> = <fact1>₣24/kg</fact1> + <fact2>₣6/kg</fact2> = ₣30/kg.

Answer: Let's denote the number of boys as <fact3>x</fact3>. Then, according to the information given, <fact2>two-sixths the number of boys</fact2> is equal to <fact3>x</fact3> * <fact4>2/6</fact4> = <fact3>x</fact3> * <fact5>1/3</fact5>. This means that the number of boys is <fact3>x</fact3> = 3 * <fact2>two-sixths the number of boys</fact2>. Since <fact2>two-sixths the number of boys</fact2> is equal to <fact3>39</fact3> * <fact5>1/3</fact5>, we have <fact3>x</fact3> = 3 * <fact3>39</fact3> * <fact5>1/3</fact5> = 39.

Answer: To find the number of boys, we need to find <fact2>two-fourths the number of boys</fact2>, which is equivalent to <fact2>1/2 * 2/4 * number of boys</fact2> = <fact2>1/4 * number of boys</fact2>. Let's call the number of boys ""x"". Then, the number of boys is <fact2>1/4 * x</fact2>. Since the number of boys is equal to <fact2>two-fourths the number of boys in the yard</fact2>, we can set up the equation: <fact1>22 = 1/4 * x</fact1>. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4, which gives us: <fact1>88 = x</fact1>. Therefore, the number of boys is 88. To find the total number of kids in the yard, we need to add the number of girls and the number of boys: <fact1>22 + 88 = 110</fact1>. So, there are 110 kids in the yard.

44,"Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>8 girls in the yard</fact1>. If there are <fact2>three-fourths the number of boys in the yard</fact2>, how many kids are in the yard?
Answer: Let's denote the number of boys as <fact3>b</fact3>. According to the information, <fact2>three-fourths the number of boys in the yard</fact2> is equivalent to <fact4>3/4*b</fact4>. Since the number of boys is equal to <fact4>3/4*b</fact4>, we can set up the equation <fact3>b</fact3> = <fact4>3/4*b</fact4>. However, this is a redundant equation as it is saying the same thing twice. The correct equation should be <fact5>8 = 3/4*b</fact5>. We can solve for <fact3>b</fact3> by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4/3, which gives us <fact6>b = 8*(4/3)</fact6>. Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get <fact7>b = 32/3</fact7>. Now, to find the total number of kids in the yard, we need to add the number of boys and the number of girls. The number of boys is <fact7>32/3</fact7>, and the number of girls is <fact1>8</fact1>. Therefore, the total number of kids in the yard is <fact8>32/3 + 8</fact8>. To add these two fractions, we need to find a common denominator, which is 3. So, we can rewrite 8 as <fact9>8 = 24/3</fact9>. Now, we can add the two fractions: <fact8>32/3 + 24/3 = 56/3</fact8>. Therefore, the total number of kids in the yard is <fact10>56/3</fact10>, which is approximately 18.67. Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we can round up to the nearest whole number to get the total number of kids in the yard.
