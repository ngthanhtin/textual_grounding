Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> is 5/8, since there are 5 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (4/8) * (4/8) = 16/64 = 1/4, since there are 4 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes, and the die is rolled twice.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 5/8 - 1/4 = 5/8 - 2/8 = 3/8.

To express this as a percentage, we divide 3/8 by 1/4 (the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row) and multiply by 100: (3/8) / (1/4) * 100 = 3/2 * 100 = 150%.

Answer: There are <fact1>4</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a four-sided die: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Of these, <fact2>2</fact2> of the outcomes are greater than 2: 3 and 4. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/<fact1>4</fact1> = 0.5. There are <fact1>2</fact1> odd numbers on a four-sided die: 1 and 3. So the probability of rolling an odd number is 2/<fact1>4</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Therefore, the difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.25 * 100% = 25%. The answer is {25}.",25,1,1,p2,139,852

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a twenty-sided die. Of these, <fact1>20</fact1> - 5 = 15 are greater than 5. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 15/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.75 or 75%. There are <fact1>20</fact1>/2 = 10 odd numbers on a twenty-sided die. So the probability of rolling an odd number is 10/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 3</fact2> is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a <fact1>d6 die</fact1> (4, 5, and 6). The probability of rolling an odd number is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 odd numbers on a <fact1>d6 die</fact1> (1, 3, and 5). The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. Therefore, the difference in probability is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> is 3/4, since there are 3 numbers greater than 1 on a <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> (2, 3, and 4) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.
The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since there are 2 even numbers on a <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> (2 and 4) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an even number twice in a row is the product of the probabilities of rolling an even number each time.
To find the difference in probabilities, subtract the probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> from the probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2>: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.

In the <fact4>final 14 seconds</fact4>, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 14 seconds, which is 360 / 2 = 180 kernels. After Arjun takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 14 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 180 / 4 = 45 kernels. Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 60 + 180 + 360 + 180 + 45 = 825 kernels.",825,1,1,p2,218,1400

If his farm truck can carry <fact5>160 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To find the total weight of feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together. 
The weight of hay is <fact1>six 6-kg boxes</fact1> = 6 * 6 = 36 kg.
The weight of carrots is <fact2>eleven 5-kg bags</fact2> = 11 * 5 = 55 kg.
The weight of wheats is <fact3>thirty five 39-kg packs</fact3> = 35 * 39 = 1365 kg.
The weight of oats is <fact4>sixteen 19-kg sacks</fact4> = 16 * 19 = 304 kg.
The total weight of feed is 36 + 55 + 1365 + 304 = 1760 kg.
To find the number of trips, we need to divide the total weight of feed by the weight that the farm truck can carry at a time, which is <fact5>160 kgs</fact5>. 
So, the number of trips is 1760 / 160 = 11. 
Since we cannot have a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number.

The total weight of the hay is <fact4>20 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>15 kg/sack</fact4> = 300 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the feed is 20 + 112 + 1248 + 300 = 1680 kg. To find the number of trips, divide the total weight of all the feed by the weight that the truck can carry per trip, which is <fact5>140 kg</fact5>. Therefore, the number of trips is 1680 / 140 = 12. The answer is {12}.",12,1,1,p2,397,1370
7,"Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, oats, beets and corns. Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys <fact1>four 7-kg boxes of them</fact1> for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact2>thirteen 6-kg bags</fact2>. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys <fact3>thirty five 39-kg packs</fact3>. Oats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys <fact4>seventeen 17-kg sacks</fact4>. If his farm truck can carry <fact5>160 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: The total weight of the corns is <fact1>4 boxes</fact1> * <fact1>7 kg/box</fact1> = 28 kg.
The total weight of the beets is <fact2>13 bags</fact2> * <fact2>6 kg/bag</fact2> = 78 kg.
The total weight of the apples is <fact3>35 packs</fact3> * <fact3>39 kg/pack</fact3> = 1365 kg.
The total weight of the oats is <fact4>17 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>17 kg/sack</fact4> = 289 kg.
The total weight of all the feed is 28 + 78 + 1365 + 289 = 1760 kg.
Since the farm truck can carry <fact5>160 kg</fact5> at a time, the farmer needs to make 1760/<fact5>160</fact5> = 11 trips.

Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys <fact1>seven 5-kg boxes of them</fact1> for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact2>twelve 8-kg bags</fact2>. Apples are the main diet of his horses, so he buys <fact3>thirty four 42-kg packs</fact3>. Corns are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys <fact4>nineteen 19-kg sacks</fact4>. If his farm truck can carry <fact5>120 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: The total weight of oats is <fact1>7 boxes</fact1> * <fact1>5 kg per box</fact1> = 35 kg.
The total weight of cucumbers is <fact2>12 bags</fact2> * <fact2>8 kg per bag</fact2> = 96 kg.
The total weight of apples is <fact3>34 packs</fact3> * <fact3>42 kg per pack</fact3> = 1428 kg.
The total weight of corns is <fact4>19 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>19 kg per sack</fact4> = 361 kg.
The total weight of all the feed is 35 + 96 + 1428 + 361 = 1920 kg.

On Monday, he sold <fact3>13 more boxes of cookies than on Sunday</fact3>, which means he sold <fact1>28</fact1> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 41 boxes of cookies on Monday. 
The total number of cookies sold is <fact1>28</fact1> + 41 = 69 boxes. The total number of plum pies sold is 9 + <fact4>26</fact4> = 35 boxes. 
The total amount earned from cookies is 69 * <fact5>₣11</fact5> = ₣759. The total amount earned from plum pies is 35 * <fact6>₣27</fact6> = ₣945.

Answer: Mohammed sold <fact1>23</fact1> boxes of muffin on Wednesday. On Thursday, he sold <fact3>13 more boxes of muffins than on Wednesday</fact3>, so he sold <fact1>23</fact1> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 36 boxes of muffin on Thursday. In total, he sold <fact1>23</fact1> + 36 = 59 boxes of muffin. Since the muffin cost <fact5>$10</fact5>, he earned <fact5>$10</fact5> * 59 = $590 from muffin sales.

Mohammed sold <fact2>18 fewer boxes of orange pie, than on Thursday</fact2>, so he sold <fact4>24</fact4> - <fact2>18</fact2> = 6 boxes of orange pie on Wednesday. On Thursday, he sold <fact4>24 boxes of orange pie</fact4>. In total, he sold 6 + <fact4>24</fact4> = 30 boxes of orange pie. Since the orange pie cost <fact6>$21</fact6>, he earned <fact6>$21</fact6> * 30 = $630 from orange pie sales.

In total, Mohammed earned $590 + $630 = $1220 from muffin and orange pie sales for two days.

Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x = 2 * (11 km / 66 min) = 22/66 = 1/3 km/min. 
Since Tara walks <fact3>14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>, the time she spends walking on the sidewalk is 14 km / (1/3 km/min) = 42 min. 
Therefore, the total time it takes for Tara to complete the entire <fact1>25-kilometer walk</fact1> is <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5> + 42 min = 108 min.",108,1,1,p2,893,1344
17,"Reformatted Question: Olga walks <fact1>28 kilometers</fact1> every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>10 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>18 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Olga walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer</fact1> walk, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Olga walks on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, according to <fact4>, her speed on the sidewalk is 3x kilometers per minute. We know that <fact5>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so the distance she covers on the beach is 50x kilometers. However, we also know from <fact2> that she walks 10 kilometers on the beach</fact2>, so we can set up the equation 50x = 10. Solving for x, we get x = 10/50 = 1/5 kilometers per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. The distance she covers on the sidewalk is <fact3>18 kilometers</fact3>, and her speed is 3x = 3/5 kilometers per minute. So, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 18 / (3/5) = 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer</fact1> walk is <fact5>50 minutes</fact5> + 30 minutes = 80 minutes.",80,1,1,p2,894,1409

On the sidewalk, Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Winnie's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2x miles per minute</fact4>. We know that Winnie walks <fact2>15 miles on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so we can set up the equation 15 = 45x. Solving for x, we get x = 15/45 = 1/3 miles per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes Winnie to walk on the sidewalk. We know that Winnie walks <fact3>12 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> and her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2x = 2/3 miles per minute</fact4>, so we can set up the equation 12 = (2/3)t, where t is the time in minutes. Solving for t, we get t = 12/(2/3) = 18 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes Winnie to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1> is <fact5>45 minutes</fact5> + 18 minutes = 63 minutes.",63,1,1,p2,896,1329

On the sidewalk, Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Winnie's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute, as stated in <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. 
We know that Winnie walks <fact2>13 miles on the beach</fact2> and it takes her <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> to do so. Therefore, her speed on the beach is 13 miles / 52 minutes = x miles per minute. 
Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x miles per minute. 
We also know that Winnie walks <fact3>17 miles on the sidewalk</fact3>. Therefore, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 17 miles / (2x miles per minute) = 17 / (2 * (13/52)) = 17 / (13/26) = 17 * 26 / 13 = 34 minutes. 
Since Winnie walks <fact1>30 miles every day</fact1>, the total time it takes her to complete the entire walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> + 34 minutes = 86 minutes.",86,1,1,p2,897,1469

If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed of Rania on the beach as x km/min. Then, according to <fact4>, her speed on the sidewalk is 3x km/min. We know that <fact2>12 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> takes <fact5>48 minutes</fact5>, so we can calculate her speed on the beach as 12 km / 48 min = 0.25 km/min. Thus, her speed on the sidewalk is 3 * 0.25 km/min = 0.75 km/min. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>18 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> as 18 km / 0.75 km/min = 24 min. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-kilometer walk</fact1> is <fact5>48 minutes</fact5> + 24 min = 72 min.",72,1,1,p2,898,1168

On the sidewalk, Amelia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>33-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Amelia spends walking on the sidewalk as x minutes. Since Amelia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, we can denote her speed on the beach as s and her speed on the sidewalk as 2s. The distance covered on the beach is <fact2>17 kilometers</fact2>, and the distance covered on the sidewalk is <fact3>16 kilometers</fact3>. We know that distance = speed * time. Since Amelia walks 17 kilometers on the beach in <fact5>51 minutes</fact5>, her speed on the beach is 17 km / 51 min = s. The time spent walking on the sidewalk is x minutes, and the distance covered is 16 kilometers. Therefore, 16 km = 2s * x. We can substitute the value of s from the beach into this equation: 16 km = 2 * (17 km / 51 min) * x. Solving for x, we get x = 51 * 16 / (2 * 17) = 24 minutes. The total time taken to complete the entire <fact1>33-kilometer walk</fact1> is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: <fact5>51 minutes</fact5> + 24 minutes = 75 minutes.",75,1,1,p2,899,1548

On <fact2>Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched five 2-hour episodes</fact4>. If he watched <fact5>24 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?

Answer: Luca watched 5 hours of TV on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 5 + 5 = 10 hours of TV on the weekend. On Tuesday, he watched 2 hours + 15 minutes = 2.25 hours of TV. On Wednesday, he watched 5 * 2 hours = 10 hours of TV. So, in total, Luca watched 10 + 2.25 + 10 = 22.25 hours of TV on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This means that he watched 24 - 22.25 = 1.75 hours of TV on Monday. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1.75 hours is equal to 1.75 * 60 = 105 minutes. Since each episode is 15 minutes long, Luca watched 105 / 15 = 7 episodes on Monday.

So, in total, he watched 6 + 6.75 + 16 = 28.75 hours of TV on <fact1>Saturday and Sunday</fact1>, <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>, and <fact4>Wednesday</fact4>. This means that on <fact2>Monday</fact2>, he watched <fact5>29 hours</fact5> - 28.75 hours = 0.25 hours of TV. Since each episode is <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> long, this is equivalent to 0.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour / <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> = 1 episode.",1,1,1,p2,1096,1248

Answer: On <fact1>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact1>, Arjun watched 6 hours * 2 nights = 12 hours of TV. On <fact3>Friday</fact3>, he watched 5 hours + 0.25 hours = 5.25 hours of TV. On <fact4>Saturday</fact4>, he watched 4 hours * 2 episodes = 8 hours of TV. So, in total, he watched 12 + 5.25 + 8 = 25.25 hours of TV on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. Since <fact5>he watched 26 hours of TV in all</fact5>, he must have watched 26 - 25.25 = 0.75 hours of TV on Thursday.

Then, her husband bought a package of <fact1>10 new spoons</fact1> and gave them to Zahra, so she had x + <fact1>10</fact1> spoons. While Zahra was making the beef stew, she used <fact2>six of the spoons</fact2>, so she had x + <fact1>10</fact1> - <fact2>6</fact2> spoons left. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact3>32 spoons</fact3>. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + <fact1>10</fact1> - <fact2>6</fact2> = <fact3>32</fact3>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact3>32</fact3> - <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact2>6</fact2> = <fact3>32</fact3> - <fact1>4</fact1> = 28.",28,1,1,p2,1141,1265

While Chen was making the stuffed peppers, <fact3>she used five of the plates</fact3> to sample her stuffed peppers. Later, when she went to set the table, <fact4>she had a total of 36 plates</fact4>. How many plates were in the package that Chen bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of plates in the package that Chen bought as x. Then, the total number of plates she had before using any was x + <fact2>13</fact2>. After using <fact3>5</fact3> plates, she had x + <fact2>13</fact2> - <fact3>5</fact3> = x + <fact2>13</fact2> - <fact3>5</fact3> = x + 8 plates.

It takes <fact3>12 skeins of wool to make a shawl</fact3>, <fact4>10 for a sweater</fact4>, <fact5>13 for a vest</fact5>, <fact6>17 for a pair of socks</fact6>, and <fact7>16 for a pair of mittens</fact7>. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of winter wear and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren (<fact1>3</fact1>). 
For a shawl, it takes <fact3>12 skeins of wool</fact3>, so for 3 grandchildren, it will take 12 * 3 = 36 skeins.
For a sweater, it takes <fact4>10 skeins of wool</fact4>, so for 3 grandchildren, it will take 10 * 3 = 30 skeins.
For a vest, it takes <fact5>13 skeins of wool</fact5>, so for 3 grandchildren, it will take 13 * 3 = 39 skeins.
For a pair of socks, it takes <fact6>17 skeins of wool</fact6>, so for 3 grandchildren, it will take 17 * 3 = 51 skeins.
For a pair of mittens, it takes <fact7>16 skeins of wool</fact7>, so for 3 grandchildren, it will take 16 * 3 = 48 skeins.
Now, we add up the total number of skeins required for all the winter wear: 36 + 30 + 39 + 51 + 48 = 204 skeins.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren (<fact1>2</fact1>). 
For the tunic, <fact7>17 skeins</fact7> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact7>17</fact7> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 34 skeins.
For the shawl, <fact8>9 skeins</fact8> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact8>9</fact8> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 18 skeins.
For the beanie, <fact9>7 skeins</fact9> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact9>7</fact9> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 14 skeins.
For the socks, <fact10>18 skeins</fact10> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact10>18</fact10> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 36 skeins.
For the mittens, <fact11>14 skeins</fact11> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact11>14</fact11> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 28 skeins.
Now, we add up the total number of skeins needed for all items: 34 + 18 + 14 + 36 + 28 = 130 skeins.

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the number of skeins required for each type of winter wear and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren (<fact1>5</fact1>).

For a beanie, it takes <fact7>17 skeins of wool</fact7>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact7>17</fact7> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 85 skeins.

For a hat, it takes <fact8>4 skeins of wool</fact8>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact8>4</fact8> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 20 skeins.

For a vest, it takes <fact9>14 skeins of wool</fact9>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact9>14</fact9> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 70 skeins.

For leg warmers, it takes <fact10>3 skeins of wool</fact10>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact10>3</fact10> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 15 skeins.

For mittens, it takes <fact11>10 skeins of wool</fact11>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact11>10</fact11> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 50 skeins.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of winter wear and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren (<fact1>5</fact1>). 
For a beanie, it takes <fact3>15 skeins of wool</fact3>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 75 skeins.
For a hat, it takes <fact4>12 skeins of wool</fact4>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact4>12</fact4> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 60 skeins.
For a shawl, it takes <fact5>14 skeins of wool</fact5>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact5>14</fact5> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 70 skeins.
For a pair of socks, it takes <fact6>18 skeins of wool</fact6>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact6>18</fact6> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 90 skeins.
For a pair of leg warmers, it takes <fact7>13 skeins of wool</fact7>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact7>13</fact7> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 65 skeins.
Now, we add up the total number of skeins required for each type of winter wear: 75 + 60 + 70 + 90 + 65 = 360 skeins.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>475 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact1>475</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 1900 calories.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact1>175</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 700 calories.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of bread. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>425 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact1>425</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 1700 calories. 

Since you have already consumed <fact5>650 calories</fact5> and your daily calorie target is <fact4>1925</fact4>, you can consume <fact4>1925</fact4> - <fact5>650</fact5> = 1275 calories from the bread. 

Now, we need to find out how many ounces of bread you can eat to get 1275 calories. Since the entire bag has 1700 calories and 300 ounces, the number of ounces you can eat to get 1275 calories is (<fact2>300</fact2> / 1700) * 1275 = 225 ounces.

Since <fact3>25% of the students are robotics club members or part of choir members</fact3> out of the remaining class, we first need to find out how many students are not basketball players. This is <fact1>144 students</fact1> - 36 students = 108 students. Then, we can calculate the number of robotics club members or part of choir members as <fact3>25%</fact3> of 108 students, which is 0.25 * 108 = 27 students.

Finally, we need to find out how many students are leaving early. This is the sum of the number of basketball players and the number of robotics club members or part of choir members, which is 36 students + 27 students = 63 students.

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25% of the students are dancers or part of debate team members</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are soccer players. This is <fact2>20%</fact2> of <fact1>130 students</fact1>, which is 0.2 * 130 = 26 students.
The remaining class is <fact1>130 students</fact1> - 26 students = 104 students.

Answer: The number of occupied wards is <fact1>1400</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 175 wards. 
The number of unoccupied wards is <fact1>1400</fact1> - 175 = 1225 wards. 
In <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>, which is 21 days, the number of patients admitted is <fact3>30 patients per day</fact3> * 21 days = 630 patients. 
So the number of unoccupied wards after 3 weeks is 1225 - 630 = 595 wards.

Answer: Mr. Smith's transfer fees are <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$720000</fact1>, which is <fact1>$720000</fact1> * <fact2>3%</fact2> = $21600.

He also paid <fact4>$510000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount. Therefore, his net proceeds from selling the house are <fact1>$720000</fact1> - $64800 - <fact4>$510000</fact4> = $720000 - $574800 = $145200.",145200,1,1,p2,1749,909

Mia finds <fact4>4 less than Isabella</fact4>, and Nia finds <fact5>a quarter as many as Mia</fact5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs Umar hid in total. Since <fact1>6 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 eggs, Umar hid 72 eggs in the yard.

Quinn finds <fact2>12 eggs</fact2>.

Isabella finds <fact3>two times as many as Quinn</fact3>, which is 2 * <fact2>12</fact2> = 24 eggs.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs Leilani hid in total. Since <fact1>9 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 9 * 12 = 108 eggs, we know that Leilani hid 108 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs each person found.

Now we can find the width of the room by dividing the area by the length: <fact1>918 square feet</fact1> / 18 feet = 51 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the length plus twice the width, so the perimeter of the room is 2 * 18 feet + 2 * 51 feet = 138 feet.",138,1,1,p2,2526,764
50,"Reformatted Question: The area of Arash's rectangular living room is <fact1>558 square feet</fact1>. If the length of his room is <fact2>6 yards</fact2>, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?

Answer: Since <fact2>1 yard</fact2> is equal to <fact2>3 feet</fact2>, the length of the room is <fact2>6 yards</fact2> * <fact2>3 feet/yard</fact2> = <fact2>18 feet</fact2>. The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. So, the width of the room is <fact1>558 square feet</fact1> / <fact2>18 feet</fact2> = <fact3>31 feet</fact3>. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to 2 times the sum of its length and width. Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 2 * (<fact2>18 feet</fact2> + <fact3>31 feet</fact3>) = 2 * <fact4>49 feet</fact4> = <fact4>98 feet</fact4>.

Answer: Since the length of the room is given in yards, we need to convert it to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length of the room is <fact3>5 yards</fact3> * 3 feet/yard = 15 feet. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula Area = Length * Width. We are given the area as <fact2>480 square feet</fact2> and the length as 15 feet, so we can solve for the width: <fact2>480 square feet</fact2> = 15 feet * Width, which gives us Width = <fact2>480 square feet</fact2> / 15 feet = 32 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values we have, the perimeter is 2 * (15 feet + 32 feet) = 2 * 47 feet = 94 feet.

If Yusuf sells <fact5>18 baskets of roses</fact5>, <fact6>28 baskets of sunflowers</fact6> and <fact7>35 baskets of daisies</fact7>, how much will he make?

Answer: Yusuf will sell his roses for $3 each, since $2.58 is closer to $3 than $2 (<fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>). So he will make <fact1>$2.58</fact1> → $3 * <fact5>18 baskets of roses</fact5> = $3 * 18 = $54 from selling roses.
Yusuf will sell his sunflowers for $5 each, since $5.13 is closer to $5 than $6 (<fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>). So he will make <fact2>$5.13</fact2> → $5 * <fact6>28 baskets of sunflowers</fact6> = $5 * 28 = $140 from selling sunflowers.
Yusuf will sell his daisies for $5 each, since $5.47 is closer to $5 than $6 (<fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>). So he will make <fact3>$5.47</fact3> → $5 * <fact7>35 baskets of daisies</fact7> = $5 * 35 = $175 from selling daisies.
Therefore, Yusuf will make $54 + $140 + $175 = $369.

If Ali sells <fact5>6 bouquets of orchids</fact5>, <fact6>24 bouquets of lilies</fact6> and <fact7>39 bouquets of daisies</fact7>, how much will he make?

Answer: Since Ali has decided to <fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>, the price of orchids will be rounded to ₣1, lilies to ₣5 and daisies to ₣5. 
He will make ₣1 * <fact5>6 bouquets of orchids</fact5> = ₣6 from selling orchids.
He will make ₣5 * <fact6>24 bouquets of lilies</fact6> = ₣120 from selling lilies.
He will make ₣5 * <fact7>39 bouquets of daisies</fact7> = ₣195 from selling daisies.
Therefore, Ali will make a total of ₣6 + ₣120 + ₣195 = ₣321.

But as I pour it, I <fact3>spill 5 liters of the peach drink</fact3>. How much water is in the remaining <fact4>30 liters</fact4>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the amount of water in the peach drink. Since the peach drink is three-sixths water, the amount of water in the peach drink is <fact1>19 liters</fact1> * (3/6) = <fact1>19</fact1> * (1/2) = 9.5 liters. 

However, <fact3>5 liters of the peach drink</fact3> were spilled, so the amount of water from the peach drink that was added is 9.5 - (5 * (1/2)) = 9.5 - 2.5 = 7 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the apple drink. Since the apple drink is 3/4 water, the amount of water in the apple drink is <fact2>16 liters</fact2> * (3/4) = 12 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water in the remaining <fact4>30 liters</fact4> is 7 + 12 = 19 liters.

Answer: According to <fact2>the information about the horses</fact2>, each horse needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs. Since <fact1>each alpaca needs 9 kg</fact1>, twice that amount is 9 * 2 = 18 kg. 6 kg less than that is 18 - 6 = 12 kg. So each horse needs 12 kg of hay.
