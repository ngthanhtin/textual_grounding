At least how many degrees is the second bottle?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the unknown bottle such that the mixture of water from both mugs is at least 40 degrees, allowing Donny to drink it.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Requirement:**<br>   - <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</span>.<br><br>2. **Water from the First Mug:**<br>   - <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One mug is 33 degrees</span>.<br>   - Donny pours 4 ounces from this mug.<br><br>3. **Water from the Second Mug:**<br>   - The temperature of the second mug is unknown.<br>   - Donny pours 1 ounce from this mug.<br><br>4. **Resulting Mixture:**<br>   - The total volume of the mixture is 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, totaling 5 ounces.<br>   - <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">He is now able to drink the water</span>, meaning the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>5. **Setting Up the Equation:**<br>   - Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug.<br>   - The average temperature of the mixture is given by the formula:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40<br>     \]<br><br>6. **Solving the Equation:**<br>   - Calculate the contribution from the first mug: \( 4 \times 33 = 132 \).<br>   - Set up the inequality:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40<br>     \]<br>   - Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:<br>     \[<br>     132 + T \geq 200<br>     \]<br>   - Solve for \( T \):<br>     \[<br>     T \geq 200 - 132<br>     \]<br>     \[<br>     T \geq 68<br>     \]<br><br>Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

How much money does Sally have left?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate her total spending and subtract it from the amount her parents gave her.<br><br>1. **Initial Amount**: Sally's parents gave her <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$10</span>.<br><br>2. **Cost of Taffy**: The taffy was on sale for <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">"Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."</span> Sally bought 2 pounds. <br>   - The first pound costs $3.<br>   - The second pound is half off, so it costs $1.50.<br>   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.<br><br>3. **Cost of Seashells**: Sally bought a <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">mixed bag of seashells for $1.50</span>.<br><br>4. **Cost of Magnets**: Sally bought <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">4 magnets that were $0.25 each</span>.<br>   - Total cost for magnets = 4 x $0.25 = $1.00.<br><br>5. **Total Spending**: Add up the costs of the items Sally bought.<br>   - Total cost = $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1.00 (magnets) = $7.00.<br><br>6. **Money Left**: Subtract the total spending from the initial amount.<br>   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.<br><br>Therefore, Sally has {3} dollars left.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>3</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 3</div></div>
