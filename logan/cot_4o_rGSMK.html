<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many games Steve has after 3 years, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step:

1. **Initial Games:**
   - Steve receives a console with 5 games for his birthday. 
   - Initial games = 5

2. **First Year:**
   - Steve saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month.
   - Games bought in the first year = 1 game/month * 12 months = 12 games
   - He also receives 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total games in the first year = 12 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 17 games

3. **Second Year:**
   - Steve starts buying 2 games per month.
   - Games bought in the second year = 2 games/month * 12 months = 24 games
   - He receives another 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total games in the second year = 24 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 29 games

4. **Third Year:**
   - Steve buys 4 games per month due to his new part-time job.
   - Games bought in the third year = 4 games/month * 12 months = 48 games
   - He receives another 5 games for Christmas.
   - Total games in the third year = 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 53 games

5. **Total Games After 3 Years:**
   - Initial games = 5
   - Games after the first year = 17
   - Games after the second year = 29
   - Games after the third year = 53
   - Total games = 5 (initial) + 17 (first year) + 29 (second year) + 53 (third year) = 104 games

Therefore, after 3 years, Steve has a total of 104 games.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting all 60 potatoes.

1. **Time to Peel One Potato:**
   - It takes Billy 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel one potato.

2. **Time to Cut One Potato:**
   - It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut one potato.

3. **Total Time to Prep One Potato:**
   - Total time per potato = Time to peel + Time to cut
   - Total time per potato = 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

4. **Total Time for 60 Potatoes:**
   - Total time for 60 potatoes = 60 potatoes × 95 seconds per potato
   - Total time for 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds

5. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - Total time in minutes = 5700 seconds ÷ 60 seconds per minute
   - Total time in minutes = 95 minutes

He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs he bought and compare it to the amount he received from selling the ones he didn't like.

1. **Calculate the cost of each CD:**
   - The original cost of each CD is $15.
   - James gets a 40% discount on each CD.
   - The discount amount per CD is 40% of $15, which is \(0.40 \times 15 = 6\).
   - Therefore, the discounted price per CD is \(15 - 6 = 9\).

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 CDs:**
   - James bought 10 CDs at the discounted price of $9 each.
   - The total cost for 10 CDs is \(10 \times 9 = 90\).

3. **Calculate the money received from selling 5 CDs:**
   - James sold 5 CDs for $40.
   - Therefore, he received $40 from selling the CDs.

4. **Calculate the net amount James is out:**
   - The total cost of the CDs was $90.

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students. The school auditorium has 4 rows of seats. How many students were there in the school auditorium?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students were in the school auditorium based on the seating arrangement.

1. **Calculate the total number of seats:**
   - There are 18 seats in each row and 4 rows.
   - Total seats = 18 seats/row * 4 rows = 72 seats.

2. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by administrators:**
   - One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators.
   - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 seats * (1/4) = 18 seats.

3. **Calculate the remaining seats after administrators:**
   - Remaining seats = Total seats - Seats occupied by administrators = 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

4. **Calculate the number of seats occupied by parents:**
   - One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents.
   - Seats occupied by parents = 54 seats * (1/3) = 18 seats.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make with the glass chips he has, and then use that to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be.

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:**
   - Each bag holds 72 glass chips.
   - Milo has two bags, so he has \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \) glass chips.

2. **Determine how many square inches of mosaic Milo can make:**
   - It takes 12 glass chips to make one square inch of the mosaic.
   - Therefore, the number of square inches Milo can make is \( \frac{144}{12} = 12 \) square inches.

3. **Calculate the length of the mosaic:**
   - The mosaic is three inches tall.
   - The area of the mosaic is the number of square inches, which is 12.
   - To find the length, use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Height × Length.
   - So, \( 12 = 3 \times \text{Length} \).
   - Solving for Length gives \( \text{Length} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) inches.

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Bernie has 4 dogs. The first needs to walk 1 mile. On average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. They each need a certain amount of exercise per day. The second needs to walk 4 miles. The third needs to walk 3 miles. How many miles does the last dog need?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we first need to calculate the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day. We know that, on average, the dogs need to walk 3 miles per day each. Since Bernie has 4 dogs, the total miles they need to walk per day is:

4 dogs x 3 miles/dog = 12 miles

Now, we know the distances the first three dogs need to walk:

- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Let's add up the miles for the first three dogs:

1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) = 8 miles

The total distance all four dogs need to walk is 12 miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk the remaining distance:

12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles

Thus, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

By the end of the day, they sell 5 of each of the vanilla scents and 2 of each of the fruity scents available. They already have 4 vanilla scents and 8 fruity scents available and they need to decide which kind of scent to focus on. They decide to focus on whichever scent sells the most and monitor their number of sales as part of their research. How many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared to the fruity scents, we need to calculate the total sales for each type of scent.

1. **Calculate the total sales for vanilla scents:**
   - There are 4 vanilla scents available.
   - They sell 5 of each vanilla scent.
   - Total vanilla scents sold = 4 scents × 5 sales per scent = 20 vanilla scents.

2. **Calculate the total sales for fruity scents:**
   - There are 8 fruity scents available.
   - They sell 2 of each fruity scent.
   - Total fruity scents sold = 8 scents × 2 sales per scent = 16 fruity scents.

3. **Determine how many more vanilla scents sold compared to fruity scents:**
   - Difference in sales = Total vanilla scents sold - Total fruity scents sold
   - Difference in sales = 20 - 16 = 4

Therefore, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to the fruity scents.

If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25 to fix it himself. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to compare the costs of fixing it himself versus the potential damage to his car if he doesn't fix it.

1. **Cost of fixing the pothole himself:**
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - Total cost for asphalt = 3 buckets x $25/bucket = $75.
   - Ron will be fined $120 for unauthorized road maintenance.
   - Total cost of fixing it himself = $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.

2. **Cost of not fixing the pothole:**
   - If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will cause $450 worth of damage to his car.

3. **Savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - Savings = Cost of not fixing the pothole - Cost of fixing it himself
   - Savings = $450 (damage) - $195 (fixing cost) = $255.

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Michael is replacing the carpet in his bedroom.  His bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.  His contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet, and $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.  The new carpet he's chosen costs $12 per square foot, plus $2 per square foot for padding underneath.  How much will it cost Michael to replace the carpet?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom, we need to calculate the costs for removing the old carpet, installing the new carpet, and purchasing the new carpet and padding.

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   - The bedroom measures 18 feet by 12 feet.
   - Area = 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

2. **Calculate the cost to remove the old carpet:**
   - The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.
   - Cost to remove = 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

3. **Calculate the cost to install the new carpet:**
   - The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.
   - Cost to install = 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7,344.

4. **Calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:**
   - The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
   - The padding costs $2 per square foot.
   - Total cost for carpet and padding = ($12 + $2) per square foot * 216 square feet = $14 * 216 = $3,024.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost to remove + Cost to install + Cost of carpet and padding
   - Total cost = $864 + $7,344 + $3,024 = $11,232.

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom is $11,232.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Let's break down the information given:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 30/2 = 15 apples.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples Joanne gathers:
- From the tallest trees: 30 apples
- From the shortest trees: 15 apples
- From the average trees: \( x \) apples

So, Joanne's total is \( 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x \).

Next, let's calculate how many apples her sister gathers:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
2. Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
3. Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, her sister's total is \( 60 + 45 = 105 \) apples.

The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500 apples. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 45 + x + 105 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Subtract 150 from both sides:

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]

\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how much money will Pat spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the width of each flower to feet:**  
   Since each flower grows 12 inches wide, and there are 12 inches in a foot, each flower is 1 foot wide.

2. **Calculate the total space each flower occupies:**  
   Each flower occupies 1 foot of width, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, each flower occupies 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet of space in the flower bed.

3. **Determine how many flowers fit in the flower bed:**  
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. To find out how many flowers fit, divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each flower occupies:  
   \( \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet per flower}} = 44.4 \)  
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, she can plant 44 flowers.

4. **Calculate how many more flowers Pat needs to buy:**  
   Pat already owns 17 flowers. Therefore, she needs to buy:  
   \( 44 - 17 = 27 \) flowers.

5. **Calculate the total cost for the additional flowers:**  
   Each flowering plant costs $6. Therefore, the total cost is:  
   \( 27 \times 6 = 162 \).

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing. He spent 30% of the time with the following events. He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities.

1. **Calculate the time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spent 6 hours boating.
   - He spent half of the boating time swimming, which is 6/2 = 3 hours swimming.

2. **Calculate the time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 shows, each lasting 2 hours.
   - Total time spent watching shows = 3 shows x 2 hours/show = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the total time spent on these activities:**
   - Total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows = 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 15 hours.

4. **Determine the percentage of time spent on these activities:**
   - These activities account for 30% of his total time.

5. **Calculate the total time spent on vacation:**
   - If 30% of the time is 15 hours, then the total time (T) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     0.30 \times T = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**
   - Sightseeing accounts for 40% of his total time.
   - Time spent sightseeing = 0.40 x 50 hours = 20 hours.

Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.

   Kim has 3 current clients and is confident about 5 potential clients, so he is planning for a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

2. **Calculate the expenses for each client:**  
   Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.  
   - Cost of bleach per client: 2 bottles x $2 = $4  
   - Cost of cloths per client: 1 pack x $5 = $5  
   - Total cost per client: $4 (bleach) + $5 (cloths) = $9

3. **Calculate the total expenses for all clients:**  
   Total expenses for 8 clients: 8 clients x $9 per client = $72

4. **Calculate the profit:**  
   Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.  
   Total income = $92  
   Total expenses = $72  
   Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim's weekly profit will be $20.

The choir decides to perform with just its female members.  The choir's 3 teachers decides to sing with them, because on the day of the performance, half the members supposed to perform can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down. How many people sang in the performance?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of girls in the choir:**
   - The choir has 52 members, with 50% being girls.
   - Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26 girls.

2. **Determine how many girls were supposed to perform:**
   - Initially, all 26 girls were supposed to perform.

3. **Account for the bus breakdown:**
   - Half of the girls can't make it to the show due to the bus breakdown.
   - Number of girls who can't make it = 26 / 2 = 13 girls.
   - Number of girls who can make it = 26 - 13 = 13 girls.

4. **Include the teachers:**
   - The choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls who can make it.
   - Total number of people singing = 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chalk the teacher has left after using 45% on Monday and then calculate how many days he can continue using 20% of the chalk each day before it becomes smaller than 2 inches.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher uses 45% of the chalk on Monday. 
   - 45% of 5 inches is calculated as: 
     \[
     0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Chalk remaining after Monday: 
     \[
     5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Daily Chalk Usage**: The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day.
   - 20% of the original 5 inches is:
     \[
     0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ inch}
     \]

4. **Determine Days Before Recycling**: The teacher will continue using 20% of the original chalk length (1 inch) each day until the chalk is less than 2 inches.
   - Chalk remaining after Monday is 2.75 inches.
   - After using 1 inch on Tuesday, the chalk will be:
     \[
     2.75 - 1 = 1.75 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Since 1.75 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after Tuesday.

Therefore, the teacher has 1 more day (Tuesday) before he has to recycle the chalk.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Mr. Smith measured and found the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. The pool company instructed them to measure to find the volume of the pool, then to multiply it by 5.9 to calculate how many gallons of water they need. The Smith family is getting ready for summer and needs to have their swimming pool filled. The cost for the pool company to come and fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. How much will it cost to fill the pool?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet and then convert that volume to gallons. Finally, we will calculate the cost based on the number of gallons.

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet:**
   - The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is:
     \[
     \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
     \]
   - Plug in the given dimensions:
     \[
     \text{Volume} = 25 \, \text{feet} \times 14 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons:**
   - According to the problem, multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert to gallons:
     \[
     \text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool:**
   - The cost is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Cost} = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per gallon} = 826 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake, so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back. She does this 34 times. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. How much farther does the winner run than the loser?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine who runs farther and by how much, we need to calculate the total distance each person runs.

**Kelly's Running:**

1. **First Back and Forth:**  
   - Kelly runs the full length of the field (100 yards) and back, which is 100 + 100 = 200 yards.

2. **40-yard Line Runs:**  
   - Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.  
   - Each trip to the 40-yard line and back is 40 + 40 = 80 yards.  
   - For 34 trips, she runs 34 x 80 = 2720 yards.

3. **Total Distance for Kelly:**  
   - Total distance = 200 (first back and forth) + 2720 (40-yard line runs) = 2920 yards.

**Blake's Running:**

1. **Back and Forth Runs:**  
   - Blake runs the full length of the field back and forth 15 times.  
   - Each back and forth is 100 + 100 = 200 yards.  
   - For 15 times, he runs 15 x 200 = 3000 yards.

**Comparison:**

- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2920 yards.

**Difference:**

- The difference in distance is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Therefore, Blake runs 80 yards farther than Kelly.

In the afternoon twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.  How many guests does the hotel have after dinner?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the number of guests the hotel has after dinner, let's break down the events step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Guests:** The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkout:** 24 guests elected an early checkout. Therefore, the number of guests after the early checkout is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests}
   \]

3. **Late Checkout:** 15 guests elected for a late checkout. These guests are still in the hotel until they check out later, so they do not affect the current count of guests.

4. **Check-ins After Dinner:** 7 more people checked in after dinner. Therefore, the number of guests after these check-ins is:
   \[
   76 + 7 = 83 \text{ guests}
   \]

5. **Afternoon Check-ins:** Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of people who checked in during the afternoon is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests}
   \]

6. **Total Number of Guests After All Check-ins:** Add the afternoon check-ins to the current number of guests:

The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate after sixty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of kernels that pop during each time interval and then sum them up.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - Three times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop.
   - 3 x 20 = 60 kernels pop.

3. **Next 30 seconds (60 to 90 seconds):**
   - The popping rate increases to four times the initial rate.
   - 4 x 20 = 80 kernels pop.

4. **Final 30 seconds (90 to 120 seconds):**
   - The popping slows down to half the rate of the previous 30 seconds.
   - Half of 80 = 40 kernels pop.

5. **After taking the pan off the heat:**
   - A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat.
   - 1/4 of 40 = 10 kernels pop.

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 60 kernels
- Next 30 seconds: 80 kernels
- Final 30 seconds: 40 kernels
- After taking off the heat: 10 kernels

Total kernels popped = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels

Therefore, Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

Dillon is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. Well's mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges at the local store. A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item and then calculate the total cost for all the items Dillon is buying.

1. **Cost of a Pepper:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.

2. **Cost of a Watermelon:**
   - A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
   - Therefore, the cost of a watermelon is 3 x $15 = $45.

The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the alarm rang each time it went off and then sum these values.

1. **First Alarm:**
   - The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.

2. **Second Alarm:**
   - The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang 4 x 3 = 12 times.

3. **Third Alarm:**
   - The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school over a school day that lasts 8 hours.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 stick after dinner.  How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with a 20 pack of gum.

2. **Gum Chewed at School**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces of gum at school}
   \]

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum on the way home from school.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**: Jim chews 1 piece of gum after dinner.

5. **Total Gum Chewed Before Giving to Sister**: 
   \[
   4 \text{ (at school)} + 1 \text{ (on the way home)} + 1 \text{ (after dinner)} = 6 \text{ pieces of gum}
   \]

6. **Gum Remaining Before Giving to Sister**: 
   \[
   20 \text{ (initial)} - 6 \text{ (chewed)} = 14 \text{ pieces of gum remaining}
   \]

7. **Gum Given to Sister**: Jim gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces of gum given to sister}
   \]

8. **Gum Remaining at the End of the Day**: 
   \[
   14 \text{ (remaining before giving to sister)} - 7 \text{ (given to sister)} = 7 \text{ pieces of gum left}
   \]

Therefore, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum them up.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - The farmer buys two 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 x 1 = 2 pounds.

2. **Oats:**
   - The farmer buys twenty 65-pound sacks of oats.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - The farmer buys forty-two 75-pound bales of hay.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 x 75 = 3150 pounds.

4. **Carrots:**
   - The farmer buys four 12-pound bags of carrots.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 x 12 = 48 pounds.

Now, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:

- Total weight = 2 (sugar cubes) + 1300 (oats) + 3150 (hay) + 48 (carrots) = 4500 pounds.

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number, since a partial trip still counts as a full trip:

- Number of trips = 4500 / 2250 = 2.

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed.

And at the end of the line sat a Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  Next to Affenpinscher sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher.  How much did the Mastiff weigh, in pounds?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of each dog based on the given relationships and then find the weight of the Mastiff.

1. **Affenpinscher's Weight**: The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.

2. **Dachshund's Weight**: The Dachshund is next to the Affenpinscher and weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. Therefore, the Dachshund weighs:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Papillon's Weight**: The Papillon is next to the Dachshund and weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. Therefore, the Papillon weighs:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Mastiff's Weight**: The Mastiff is at the end of the line and weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. Therefore, the Mastiff weighs:

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the first race, he lost $5. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. How much did he lose on average that day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Johnny's dad lost and then find the average loss.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Therefore, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - He won $11 in the second race, so he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

4. **Total Loss:**
   - Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
   - Total loss = \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\) dollars

5. **Average Loss:**
   - There are three races, so the average loss is the total loss divided by the number of races.

A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the collection and calculate the cost for each category of movies.

1. **Total Movies**: Mike has 600 movies.

2. **Movies in Series**: A third of the movies are in series. Therefore, the number of movies in series is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]

3. **Remaining Movies**: The remaining movies that are not in series are:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Older Movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies. Therefore, the number of older movies is:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]

5. **Newer Movies**: The remaining newer movies are:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]

6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - **Older Movies**: Each older movie costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for older movies is:
     \[
     160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Wanda and Ms. B decided to pump water from a pond to fill the tank in two days. On the first day, working in shifts, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, and Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, while Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then determine how much water is still needed to fill the tank.

**Day 1:**
- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity. The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons, so Wanda pumped:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda did on the first day. Therefore, Ms. B pumped:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Day 2:**
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. Therefore, on the second day, Wanda pumped:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. Therefore, on the second day, Ms. B pumped:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Total Water Pumped:**
- Total water pumped by Wanda over two days:
  \[
  4500 + 3000 = 7500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water pumped by Ms. B over two days:
  \[
  3375 + 1125 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water pumped into the tank:
  \[
  7500 + 4500 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Remaining Water Needed:**
- The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons, so the remaining water needed to fill the tank is:
  \[
  18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants. Each implant has a base price of $2000. The crown costs an extra $500. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain. He's already put down a deposit of $600. He makes $15 per hour at work. How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then figure out how many hours he needs to work to cover that cost.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the implants:**
   - Each implant has a base price of $2000.
   - George needs 2 implants, so the cost for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = 4000\).

2. **Calculate the cost of the crowns:**
   - Each crown costs an extra $500.
   - George wants one of the crowns to be made of porcelain, but the problem does not specify an additional cost for porcelain, so we assume it is included in the $500.
   - Therefore, the cost for the crowns is \(2 \times 500 = 1000\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the dental work:**
   - Total cost = Cost of implants + Cost of crowns = \(4000 + 1000 = 5000\).

4. **Subtract the deposit:**
   - George has already put down a deposit of $600.
   - Remaining amount to be paid = Total cost - Deposit = \(5000 - 600 = 4400\).

5. **Calculate the number of hours George needs to work:**
   - George makes $15 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $4400, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: 
   \[
   \frac{4400}{15} \approx 293.33
   \]
   - Since George cannot work a fraction of an hour, he needs to work 294 hours to cover the cost.

The second week, Boris only produces half as much as the first week. But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week. How much does he produce the fourth week?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to first calculate the production for the first three weeks and then use the total monthly production to find the fourth week's production.

1. **First Week Production:**
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production:**
   - The second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   - Second week production = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

3. **Third Week Production:**
   - The third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   - Third week production = 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**
   - Total for first three weeks = 8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.

5. **Total Monthly Production:**
   - Boris produces 50,000 bars each month.

6. **Fourth Week Production:**
   - To find the fourth week's production, subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production.
   - Fourth week production = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package of spoons.  Later, her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Before that when Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Julia ended up with a total of 12 spoons when setting the table.
2. Her husband contributed 5 spoons to this total.
3. Before setting the table, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.

Let's calculate the number of spoons Julia originally had before her husband added his 5 spoons:

- Total spoons when setting the table: 12
- Spoons added by her husband: 5

So, the number of spoons Julia had before her husband's contribution is:
\[ 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Now, we need to account for the 3 spoons Julia used to sample her stew. These spoons were part of her original count before setting the table:

- Spoons before sampling: 7
- Spoons used for sampling: 3

Therefore, the number of spoons Julia originally had before sampling is:
\[ 7 + 3 = 10 \]

Thus, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. How many jellyfish are in the tank?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank based on the information given about the large jellyfish and those that change color.

1. **Identify the number of large jellyfish that change color:**
   - We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
   - It is given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on.

2. **Calculate the total number of large jellyfish:**
   - Since 6 jellyfish represent a third of the large jellyfish, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times \text{(Number of large jellyfish)} = 6
     \]
   - Solving for the number of large jellyfish:
     \[
     \text{Number of large jellyfish} = 6 \times 3 = 18
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of jellyfish in the tank:**
   - A fifth of the total jellyfish are large. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times \text{(Total number of jellyfish)} = 18
     \]
   - Solving for the total number of jellyfish:
     \[
     \text{Total number of jellyfish} = 18 \times 5 = 90
     \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

Once at the park, her friends asked her if they could charge their phones. While charging her friends' phones, she noticed that her power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%. 5 hours after charging the battery started to lose instead 7% of the total capacity each hour for about 3 hours. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backward from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge:** The power bank had 28% charge remaining at the end.

2. **Last 3 Hours:** For the last 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, in 3 hours, it lost:
   \[
   3 \times 7\% = 21\%
   \]

3. **Charge Before Last 3 Hours:** Before these 3 hours, the charge was:
   \[
   28\% + 21\% = 49\%
   \]

4. **First 5 Hours:** For the first 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, it lost:
   \[
   5 \times 9\% = 45\%

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. She also drops 1 of these flowers.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.  How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals on the flowers that Rose puts in the vase after accounting for the flowers she drops.

1. **Initial Flowers Picked:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Flowers Dropped:**
   - Rose drops 1 flower from each of the first three groups:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: 
       \[
       5 \text{ petals}
       \]
     - 1 flower with 6 petals:
       \[
       6 \text{ petals}
       \]
     - 1 flower with 4 petals:
       \[
       4 \text{ petals}
       \]

3. **Flowers Picked Later:**
   - Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
     \[
     6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She drops 1 of these flowers:
     \[
     7 \text{ petals}
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Petals in the Vase:**
   - Total petals from the initial flowers:
     \[
     15 + 24 + 20 = 59 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Subtract the petals from the dropped flowers:
     \[
     59 - (5 + 6 + 4) = 59 - 15 = 44 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Add the petals from the later picked flowers, minus the dropped one:
     \[
     42 - 7 = 35 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Total petals in the vase:
     \[
     44 + 35 = 79 \text{ petals}

How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's break down the events step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - She sees 1/2 of the 30 bees return. 
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.

3. **Last 6 hours:**
   - Every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back. 
   - Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned in the second 6 hours, so 15 bees are still outside.

And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill.  Twice per month he writes a check to the church.  How many checks does Buford write per year?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check he writes:

1. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check every month for the gas bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the gas bill.

2. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly for the pest and lawn service. There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks for this service.

3. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check every month for the electric bill. Again, with 12 months in a year, he writes 12 checks for the electric bill.

4. **Church**: Buford writes a check twice per month to the church. Therefore, he writes 2 checks per month x 12 months = 24 checks for the church.

Now, we add up all the checks he writes in a year:

- Gas Bill: 12 checks

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. If he also paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total fees he paid and subtract them from the selling price, along with the remaining loan amount.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - Transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

2. **Calculate the brokerage fees:**
   - Brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fees = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

3. **Calculate the total fees:**
   - Total fees = Transfer fees + Brokerage fees = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

4. **Calculate the net proceeds:**
   - Net proceeds = Selling price - Total fees - Remaining loan amount.
   - Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time each wolf howls and then find the combined length of time in minutes.

1. **Tobias's Howling Time:**
   - Each of Tobias's howls lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howling Time:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howling time is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howling Time:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - The combined howling time of Tobias and Chikote is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howling time is 60 seconds.

4. **Total Howling Time:**
   - The total howling time for all three wolves is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much money will Joe have left after the purchase?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he buys and then subtract that from the $50 he has.

1. **Calculate the discount on the shirt:**
   - The original price of the shirt is $25.
   - The discount is 30% off, so the discount amount is 30% of $25.
   - Discount amount = 0.30 × $25 = $7.50.

2. **Calculate the sale price of the shirt:**
   - Sale price of the shirt = Original price - Discount amount.
   - Sale price of the shirt = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - The sale price of the shirt is $17.50.
   - The price of the shorts is $35.
   - Total cost = Sale price of the shirt + Price of the shorts.
   - Total cost = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

4. **Determine how much money Joe has left:**
   - Joe has $50 initially.
   - Total cost of the items is $52.50.
   - Since the total cost exceeds the amount Joe has, he cannot afford both items with the $50 he has.

Therefore, Joe will not have enough money to buy both the shirt and the shorts with the $50 he has. If he were to buy them, he would be short by $2.50. However, since he cannot make the purchase, he will have his original $50 left.

The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then find the difference.

**Day 1 (Tuesday):**
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- Total cost before discount = 20 pomegranates x $20 = $400.
- Clara had a $2 voucher, so she got $2 off.
- Final cost for Clara = $400 - $2 = $398.

**Day 2 (Wednesday):**
- The price per pomegranate increased to $30.
- Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each.
- Total cost before discount = 20 pomegranates x $30 = $600.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
- Discount amount = 10% of $600 = 0.10 x $600 = $60.
- Final cost for Sheila = $600 - $60 = $540.

**Difference in final prices:**
- Difference = Final cost for Sheila - Final cost for Clara = $540 - $398 = $142.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total number of books each shelf can hold.

1. **Middle Shelves:**
   - Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
   - There are 2 middle shelves, so they can hold a total of 2 x 10 = 20 books.

2. **Bottom Shelf:**
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - Since a middle shelf holds 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.

3. **Top Shelf:**
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Since the bottom shelf holds 20 books, the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

4. **Total Capacity of One Bookcase:**
   - Adding up the capacity of all the shelves in one bookcase: 
     - Middle shelves: 20 books
     - Bottom shelf: 20 books
     - Top shelf: 15 books
   - Total capacity of one bookcase = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

5. **Number of Bookcases Needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - Each bookcase can hold 55 books.
   - To find the number of bookcases needed, divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to determine the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the tube of bouncy balls and then subtract that from the total number of toys she has now.

1. Calculate the total number of toys before the bouncy balls:
   - Stacking rings: 9 rings
   - Building blocks: 31 blocks
   - Stuffed animals: 8 animals

   Total toys before bouncy balls = 9 + 31 + 8 = 48 toys

2. Sophie now has a total of 62 toys after buying the tube of bouncy balls.

3. To find the number of bouncy balls, subtract the total number of toys before the bouncy balls from the total number of toys now:
   - Number of bouncy balls = 62 - 48 = 14

After she returned an item, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00 and a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. She put both of these purchases on her credit card.  The returned item cost $15.00. What is the new balance on her credit card?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Charge:** Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. **Return of an Item:** She returned an item that cost $15.00. This means the amount charged on her credit card is reduced by $15.00.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Purchase of Frying Pan:** The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = 4.00
   \]
   The sale price of the frying pan is:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **Purchase of Towels:** The set of towels was 10% off $30.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day. The plane tickets cost $5000 each. If they are there for 3 days how much did the trip cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets separately and then add them together.

1. **Calculate the hotel cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500.
   - The hotel is 20% more expensive due to the busy weekend.
   - To find the increased price, calculate 20% of $1500: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 1500 = 300
     \]
   - Add this increase to the normal price to find the new price per day:
     \[
     1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total hotel cost is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

2. **Calculate the plane ticket cost:**
   - The cost of one plane ticket is $5000.
   - Since there are two people (Tom and his wife), the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

3. **Calculate the total trip cost:**
   - Add the total hotel cost and the total plane ticket cost:
     \[
     5400 + 10000 = 15400
     \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $15,400.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. He edits an equal number of sentences each week for the two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both Publisher A and Publisher B.

1. **Total Sentences Edited**: Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.

2. **Sentences per Publisher**: Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, he edits 1000/2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

3. **Earnings from Publisher A**: 
   - Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
   - Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 x 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

4. **Earnings from Publisher B**:
   - Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, which is 2 x 5 = 10 cents per sentence.
   - Therefore, for 500 sentences, Mark earns 500 x 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

How many friends can she invite?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost per person for the activities and then see how many people can be accommodated within the $90 budget.

1. **Cost per person for mini-golf:**  
   Each person plays one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.

2. **Cost per person for arcade tokens:**  
   Each person gets $5 in arcade tokens.

3. **Cost per person for go-karts:**  
   Each person rides the go-karts twice, and each ride costs $10.  
   So, the cost for go-karts per person is 2 rides x $10 = $20.

4. **Total cost per person:**  
   Add up all the costs:  
   $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30 per person.

5. **Determine how many people can be accommodated within the budget:**  
   Morgan has a total budget of $90.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 5% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. Mrs. Cruz is looking for a house that will not go beyond her $400 000 budget. How much more is the total price of the house than Mrs. Cruz's budget?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500.

2. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   - The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
   - Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000.

3. **Calculate the total price of the house:**
   - Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
   - Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

4. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   - Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000.

In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold is 400 points?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points collected by the students in class 3B and then determine how many more points are needed to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - 30% of Adam's points is \(0.30 \times 50 = 15\).
   - Therefore, Betty collected \(50 + 15 = 65\) points.

3. **Tom's Points:**
   - Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom collected \(65 - 30 = 35\) points.

4. **Martha's Points:**
   - Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha collected \(3 \times 35 = 105\) points.

5. **Total Points Collected by the Class:**
   - Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Tom's points + Martha's points
   - Total points = \(50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255\).

6. **Points Needed to Reach the Threshold:**
   - The class needs a minimum of 400 points to go on the trip.
   - Points missing = 400 - 255 = 145.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.

2. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 fish from the pet store.

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob found he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.
   - We know that \( w + o = 17 \) (since he bought 17 fish in total).

5. **Final Condition:**
   - After adding the fish, the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish.
   - Total white fish = \( 4 + w \)
   - Total orange fish = \( 3 + o \)
   - According to the condition: \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

6. **Solving the Equations:**
   - From \( w + o = 17 \), we can express \( o \) as \( o = 17 - w \).
   - Substitute \( o = 17 - w \) into the condition equation:
     \[
     3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     20 - w = 8 + 2w
     \]
   - Rearrange and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     20 - 8 = 2w + w
     \]
     \[
     12 = 3w
     \]
     \[
     w = 4
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.  How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Toys Needed**: The order is for 400 toys.

2. **Toys Remaining After Shift**: By the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed. This means 400 - 20 = 380 toys were produced during the shift.

3. **Shift Duration**: Each worker works a 10-hour shift.

4. **Workers' Production Rates**:
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.

5. **Calculate Total Production by the 4 Workers**:
   - The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour each will produce:  
     \(2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
   - The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour each will produce:  
     \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

6. **Total Production by the 4 Workers**:  
   \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

7. **Toys Produced by the Fifth Worker**:  
   Since 380 toys were produced in total, and the 4 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced:  
   \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

8. **Production Rate of the Fifth Worker**:

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.00.   Stephen added a $4.00 tip. Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final bill and charged him $3.00 in delivery fees.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the extra fees, we need to calculate each component step by step:

1. **Initial Bill**: Stephen's initial grocery bill was $40.00.

2. **Tip**: Stephen added a $4.00 tip. So, the total after the tip is:
   \[
   40.00 + 4.00 = 44.00
   \]

3. **Delivery Fee**: There is a $3.00 delivery fee. Adding this to the total gives:
   \[
   44.00 + 3.00 = 47.00
   \]

4. **Vendor Fee**: The vendor charges a 25% fee on the final bill (after the tip but before the delivery fee). The 25% fee is calculated on the $44.00:
   \[
   0.25 \times 44.00 = 11.00
   \]

5. **Total with Vendor Fee**: Adding the vendor fee to the total gives:
   \[
   47.00 + 11.00 = 58.00
   \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries, after all the extra fees, is $58.00.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches. He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing. He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red. The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans based on the information provided and compare it to the true number of red jelly beans.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   - The jar has a square base with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   - Volume of the jar = base area × height = 6 inches × 6 inches × 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

2. **Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans:**
   - The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume for jelly beans is 80% of the total volume.
   - Effective volume = 540 cubic inches × 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

3. **Calculate the total number of jelly beans:**
   - Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.
   - Total number of jelly beans = effective volume / volume of one jelly bean = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

4. **Estimate the number of red jelly beans:**
   - Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   - Estimated number of red jelly beans = 2880 jelly beans × 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

5. **Calculate how far off Tim's guess was:**
   - The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   - Difference = true number - estimated number = 900 - 864 = 36.

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by 36 red jelly beans.

Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. To keep Sandra's business, how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we need to first find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered.

We know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of pink calla lilies} = 5 \times \text{Number of white carnations} \]

Given that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, we have:

\[ 200 = 5 \times \text{Number of white carnations} \]

Solving for the number of white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of white carnations} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now that we know Sandra ordered 40 white carnations, we can find out how many red roses she ordered. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times \text{Number of white carnations} \]

Substituting the number of white carnations:

\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the original cost difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans.

3. **Determine the distribution of savings:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of $6, which is $6/3 = $2.
   - The remaining savings from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.

4. **Calculate the original cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - Since Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original cost of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.

5. **Determine the original cost difference:**
   - The original cost of the tattered jeans is $28.

He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  His house is worth $250,000. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the loan amount:**  
   John gets a loan worth 40% of his house's value.  
   The house is worth $250,000.  
   Loan amount = 40% of $250,000 = 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000.

2. **Calculate the amount used to pay off debts:**  
   John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts.  
   Amount used to pay debts = 60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000.

3. **Calculate the leftover amount:**  
   The leftover amount after paying debts = Total loan amount - Amount used to pay debts.

His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an extra gallon for him that was twice as tart as the other gallons.  How many lemons will Tim need?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to calculate the number of lemons required for both the regular lemonade and the extra tart lemonade.

1. **Regular Lemonade:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of regular lemonade.
   - Each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 4 gallons, Tim will need:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} \times 6 \text{ lemons per gallon} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

2. **Extra Tart Lemonade:**
   - Allen wants 1 extra gallon that is twice as tart.
   - This means the extra gallon requires 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, for 2 cups, Tim will need:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}

What is their average guess?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the average guess, we need to determine the guesses of each friend and then calculate the average.

1. **First Friend's Guess:**
   - The first friend says 80.

2. **Second Friend's Guess:**
   - The second friend says 20 more than half the first friend's guess.
   - Half of the first friend's guess is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \).
   - Adding 20 to this gives \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).

3. **Third Friend's Guess:**
   - The third friend says 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of the first friend's guess is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).

The next day they sold double that number of shoes. How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of tennis shoes sold over the weekend, including the returns.

1. **Friday Sales:**
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Therefore, they sold 14 x 2 = 28 pairs on Saturday.

3. **Sunday Sales:**
   - On the last day of the sale (Sunday), they sold half the amount they did on Saturday.
   - Therefore, they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs on Sunday.

4. **Total Sales Before Returns:**
   - Total pairs sold before returns = Friday sales + Saturday sales + Sunday sales
   - Total pairs sold = 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) = 56 pairs

5. **Returns:**
   - Six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit.
   - Therefore, the net sales after returns = Total pairs sold - Returns

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, given that he watched a total of 7 hours of TV throughout the week.

First, let's calculate the total time he spent watching TV on each day other than Wednesday:

- On Monday, he watched a 1-hour episode.
- On Tuesday, he watched another 1-hour episode.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, totaling 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV on these days:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total time from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV during the week. Therefore, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is:

7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) = 1.5 hours

Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, we can calculate the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday:

1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

How many fireworks will Hannah see in total?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to calculate the number of fireworks set off by the city and by Hannah, and then apply the visibility percentage for the city's fireworks.

1. **Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city:**
   - The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
   - Total city fireworks = 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks.

2. **Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the city's display:**
   - Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks.
   - Fireworks seen from the city = 40% of 300 = 0.40 * 300 = 120 fireworks.

3. **Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by Hannah:**
   - Hannah is setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
   - Total fireworks set off by Hannah = 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.

4. **Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:**

It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many skeins of wool Martha will need, we need to calculate the total skeins required for each type of winter wear for all three grandchildren.

1. **Hat**: It takes 2 skeins of wool to make one hat. For 3 grandchildren, she will need:
   \[
   2 \text{ skeins/hat} \times 3 \text{ hats} = 6 \text{ skeins}
   \]

2. **Scarf**: It takes 4 skeins of wool to make one scarf. For 3 grandchildren, she will need:
   \[
   4 \text{ skeins/scarf} \times 3 \text{ scarves} = 12 \text{ skeins}
   \]

3. **Sweater**: It takes 12 skeins of wool to make one sweater. For 3 grandchildren, she will need:
   \[
   12 \text{ skeins/sweater} \times 3 \text{ sweaters} = 36 \text{ skeins}
   \]

4. **Mittens**: It takes 1 skein of wool to make one pair of mittens. For 3 grandchildren, she will need:
   \[
   1 \text{ skein/pair of mittens} \times 3 \text{ pairs} = 3 \text{ skeins}
   \]

5. **Socks**: It takes 2 skeins of wool to make one pair of socks. For 3 grandchildren, she will need:
   \[
   2 \text{ skeins/pair of socks} \times 3 \text{ pairs} = 6 \text{ skeins}
   \]

Now, add up all the skeins needed for each type of winter wear:
\[
6 \text{ (hats)} + 12 \text{ (scarves)} + 36 \text{ (sweaters)} + 3 \text{ (mittens)} + 6 \text{ (socks)} = 63 \text{ skeins}
\]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy a total of 63 skeins of wool.

The charity raises a total of $175,000. $50,000 comes from organizations and the rest from the students. Each student earns the same amount.  How much did each student raise?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find out how much each student raised, we need to determine the total amount raised by the students and then divide it by the number of students.

1. **Calculate the total amount raised by the students:**
   - The total amount raised for the charity is $175,000.
   - $50,000 of this amount comes from organizations.
   - Therefore, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

2. **Determine how much each student raised:**
   - There are 20 students.
   - Each student raised an equal amount.
   - So, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

After getting home, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  He lost 10 bills while getting home.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal**: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. 
   - Number of $20 bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

2. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills**: Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   - Half of 50 bills = 50 / 2 = 25 bills.
   - Remaining bills after paying = 50 - 25 = 25 bills.

3. **Tripling the Money**: Thomas then triples his money.
   - Original amount of money after paying the bill = 25 bills * $20 = $500.
   - Tripled amount = $500 * 3 = $1500.

4. **Converting to $5 Bills**: Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills.
   - Number of $5 bills = $1500 / $5 = 300 bills.

5. **Losing 10 Bills**: Thomas loses 10 bills on his way home.

The drive from Bernadette\u2019s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne\u2019s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach the theater and account for Bernadette's desired arrival time.

1. **Wayne's Travel Time:**
   - Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes.

2. **Bernadette's Travel Time:**
   - Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's drive takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

3. **Desired Arrival Time:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

4. **Calculating Bernadette's Departure Time:**
   - Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes and she wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her desired arrival time.
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's departure time.

5. **Total Time Difference:**

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of trees Mr. Julius planted on each day and then sum them up.

**First Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
- He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. Therefore, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Second Day:**
- Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day. Therefore, he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.
- He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. Therefore, he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

**Total Trees Planted:**
- Total White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 White Oak trees.
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees.

He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both pricing options and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 10 am is 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
   - After 12 hours, Cameron stays an additional 5 hours (17 hours total - 12 hours = 5 hours).
   - Each additional hour costs 70 pesos.
   - Additional cost for 5 hours = 5 hours x 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost for this option = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay with additional hours.

3. **Sunday Morning:** 
   - The neighbors added 18 more pink flamingos to the collection.
   - Now, the total number of pink flamingos is 12 (from Saturday) + 18 (newly added) = 30 pink flamingos.

4. **At Noon on Sunday:**
   - There are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos on Sue's yard.

5. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. How many dollars did she make that day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - 5 people came by on bicycles.
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - Total bicycle tires = 5 people × 2 tires/person = 10 tires.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - 3 people came by on tricycles.
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - Total tricycle tires = 3 people × 3 tires/person = 9 tires.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - 1 person came by on a unicycle.
   - Each unicycle has 1 tire.
   - Total unicycle tires = 1 person × 1 tire/person = 1 tire.

4. **Total Tires:**
   - Total tires inflated = 10 (bicycle) + 9 (tricycle) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total earnings = 20 tires × $0.25/tire = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $5.00 that day.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens their feed in three separate meals. She feeds each of the chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to calculate the total amount of feed required for the entire day.

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement:**
   - Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Calculate the feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.
   - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon is \( 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Determine the feed needed for the final meal:**
   - The total feed required for the day is 60 cups.
   - Wendi has already given 40 cups.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Fred was preparing for a party to be held in four days.  So, he made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.  But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after all the incidents and then divide it by the number of people at the party.

1. **Initial Amount:** Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **First Incident (Children):** The children drank 4 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: 24 - 4 = 20 gallons

3. **Second Incident (Wife):** Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: 20 - 7 = 13 gallons

4. **Third Incident (Friend):** Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer: 13 - 5 = 8 gallons

5. **Party Day:** 3 people showed up for the party.

6. **Sharing the Root Beer:** The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 3 people at the party.
   - Amount per person: 8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, each person at the party had approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he might not have to turn it in:

1. **Normal Teacher with Class Extension**: There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. This means there's a 60% chance she won't give an extension.

2. **Substitute Teacher**: There's a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This means there's a 50% chance the normal teacher will be there.

3. **Personal Extension**: If the normal teacher is there and doesn't give a class extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension. This means there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Scenario 1**: The normal teacher is there and gives a class extension. Probability = 40%.

- **Scenario 2**: There is a substitute teacher. Probability = 50%.

- **Scenario 3**: The normal teacher is there, doesn't give a class extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension. Probability = 60% (chance no class extension) * 20% (chance of personal extension) = 12%.

The probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework is the sum of these probabilities:

40% (class extension) + 50% (substitute teacher) + 12% (personal extension) = 102%.

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, we need to consider overlapping scenarios. The overlapping scenario is when the substitute teacher is there, which already covers the case of not turning in homework, so we should not double count it with the class extension.

Thus, the correct calculation should be:

- **Probability of not turning in homework**: 50% (substitute teacher) + 30% (normal teacher with class extension and no substitute) + 12% (personal extension with normal teacher and no class extension) = 92%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:

100% - 92% = 8%.

A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to carefully track Lorraine's trades and conversions of stickers to buttons.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Large Stickers:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 
     - 50% of 40 large stickers = 20 large stickers.
     - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.
   - She trades the remaining 50% of her large stickers for small buttons.
     - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
     - Each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, so 20 large stickers give her 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons.

3. **Trading Small Stickers:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
     - 90% of 30 small stickers = 27 small stickers.
     - Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so 27 small stickers give her 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

4. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: She has 20 (from large stickers) + 9 (from small stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: She has 60 small buttons from trading large stickers.

Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the costs for each component and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the base cost for the frames is 44 x $20 = $880.
   - Each frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.
   - The additional cost for etching is 20% of $20, which is $4 per frame.
   - Therefore, the total cost for etching all frames is 44 x $4 = $176.
   - The total cost for the picture frames including etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.

2. **Cost of Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords that cost $12 each.
   - The number of officers is 44 / 4 = 11.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.

4. **Total Cost:**

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike currently has:**
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he currently has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.

2. **Calculate the total number of letters Mike writes per week:**
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week.
   - Since Mike responds in kind, he also writes 2 letters per week to each pen pal.
   - With 3 pen pals, Mike writes 3 x 2 = 6 letters per week.

3. **Determine the total number of pages Mike writes per week:**
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, Mike writes 6 letters x 5 pages = 30 pages per week.

4. **Calculate the time Mike spends writing:**
   - Mike writes a page every 6 minutes.
   - For 30 pages, he spends 30 x 6 = 180 minutes writing.

In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day. How many kilometers in total did Tom make during his two-week-long trip?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the trip into parts and calculate the distance for each part.

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first 4 days.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days = 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Over the next two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 800 kilometers.
   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 = 240 kilometers.

3. **Seventh Day:**
   - On the seventh day, Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance is 0 kilometers.

4. **Second Week (Next 7 Days):**
   - During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day.
   - Total distance for the second week = 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 kilometers.

5. **Total Distance:**
   - Add up all the distances: 
     - First 4 days: 800 kilometers
     - Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
     - Seventh day: 0 kilometers
     - Second week: 2100 kilometers

   - Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   - They each had one pizza, so they ate 2/3 of 3 pizzas.
   - Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 pizzas × 2/3 × 12 slices/pizza = 24 slices.

4. **Calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends:**
   - The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - They each had one pizza, so they ate 3/4 of 2 pizzas.
   - Slices eaten by the two remaining friends = 2 pizzas × 3/4 × 12 slices/pizza = 18 slices.

5. **Calculate the total slices eaten:**
   - Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (two remaining friends) = 42 slices.

6. **Calculate the slices left:**
   - Slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> James buys a plane. He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger to keep it in. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. The plane cost $150,000. How much did it cost him to get and maintain the plane for the first year?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total cost James incurred to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane cost $150,000.

2. **Monthly Hanger Rent:**
   - James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.
   - For one year (12 months), the total hanger rent is: 
     \[
     12 \times 5,000 = 60,000
     \]

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   - James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger rent.
   - Monthly fuel cost is: 
     \[
     2 \times 5,000 = 10,000
     \]
   - For one year (12 months), the total fuel cost is:
     \[
     12 \times 10,000 = 120,000
     \]

4. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   - Add the initial cost of the plane, the total hanger rent for the year, and the total fuel cost for the year:
     \[
     150,000 + 60,000 + 120,000 = 330,000
     \]

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs, but there are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left so he had to buy some more toys. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. Each dog needs one toy. How many toys in total does James need?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs. 
   - He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

3. **Second Situation:**
   - After buying the toys, James finds that there are twice as many dogs as when he left. 
   - Originally, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.

4. **Second Purchase:**
   - James needs 24 toys for 24 dogs.
   - He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 purchased), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

5. **Final Situation:**
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone, so there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.

6. **Adjustment:**
   - James needs 21 toys for 21 dogs.
   - He already has 24 toys, so he has 24 - 21 = 3 extra toys.

Therefore, James needs a total of 21 toys for the 21 dogs currently in the shelter.

Every year he also chops down 2 trees a year.  How many trees does he have left?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Trees and Planting:**
   - Tom starts with 50 trees.
   - He plants 10 trees each year for 10 years, so he plants a total of \(10 \times 10 = 100\) trees over 10 years.

2. **Total Trees Before Losses:**
   - The total number of trees before any losses is the initial trees plus the trees planted: \(50 + 100 = 150\) trees.

3. **Trees Chopped Down:**
   - Tom chops down 2 trees each year for 10 years, so he chops down a total of \(2 \times 10 = 20\) trees.

4. **Trees After Chopping:**
   - The number of trees after chopping down is \(150 - 20 = 130\) trees.

5. **Trees Dying:**
   - After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. We calculate 30% of 130 trees: \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

6. **Final Count of Trees:**
   - The final number of trees is the number of trees after chopping minus the trees that died: \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2. How much did everything cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total cost of Roger's purchase, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee and the donut.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee.
   - The normal brand costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand, calculate 20% of $5: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Add this to the original price to find the cost per pound of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
     \[
     7 \times 6 = 42
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S):**  
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.  
   - Therefore, 2 * 11 = 22 students need size small.

3. **Medium (M):**  
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.  
   - Therefore, 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

4. **Large (L):**  
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.  
   - Therefore, 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

5. **Extra-Large (XL):**  
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses in her salt scrub and specifically find out how many ounces of oil she uses.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) in ounces.
   - Since she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the total for zest and fragrance is \( 2z \).
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (and sugar) in ounces.
   - Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, the total for salt and sugar is \( 2s \).
   - She uses twice as much salt as zest, so \( s = 2z \).
   - She uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2s \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, so:
     \[
     z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
     \]
   - Simplifying, we have:
     \[
     2z + 4s = 10
     \]

3. **Substitute \( s = 2z \) into the Equation:**
   - Replace \( s \) with \( 2z \):
     \[
     2z + 4(2z) = 10
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     2z + 8z = 10
     \]
     \[
     10z = 10
     \]
   - Solve for \( z \):
     \[
     z = 1
     \]

4. **Calculate \( s \) and Oil:**
   - Since \( s = 2z \), then \( s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \).
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

Therefore, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

If they plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations, how many roses can they plant?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first, and then see how much soil is left for the roses.

1. **Calculate the soil used for sunflowers:**
   - Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 4 sunflowers.
   - Total soil for sunflowers = 4 sunflowers × 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds.

2. **Calculate the soil used for carnations:**
   - Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
   - They plant 10 carnations.
   - Total soil for carnations = 10 carnations × 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations:**
   - Total soil used = Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds.

4. **Calculate the remaining soil for roses:**
   - They started with a 30-pound bag of soil.
   - Remaining soil = Total soil - Soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds.

5. **Calculate how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil:**
   - Each rose needs 1 pound of soil.
   - Number of roses = Remaining soil / Soil per rose = 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

Therefore, Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses.

Kayla invited her 25 classmates and the 7 girls in her dance class, as well as 13 family members. Only 4 people said they could not come. The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Guests Invited:**
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - Additionally, she invited 13 family members.
   - Total invited guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Since Sasha has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the selling price of each type of board and then subtract the original cost from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the original cost:**
   - Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards cost $10 each. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is:
     \[
     10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards cost $16 each. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is:
     \[
     5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the selling price:**
   - The prices have gone up by 50%. Therefore, the selling price for each type of board is 150% of the original price.
   - Selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board:
     \[
     10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board:
     \[
     16 \times 1.5 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - Total selling price for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total selling price for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     5 \times 24 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total profit:**
   - Total selling price for all boards:
     \[
     150 + 120 = 270 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total original cost for all boards:
     \[
     100 + 80 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Profit is the total selling price minus the total original cost:
     \[
     270 - 180 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of $90.

   - To achieve a total of 465 points with the remaining scores, Brinley needs a sixth test score such that:
   \[
   367 + \text{sixth score} = 465
   \]
   - Solving for the sixth score:
   \[
   \text{sixth score} = 465 - 367 = 98
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 98 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages compared to the first day. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of bandages ordered:**
   - On the first day, they ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages.
   - Total bandages ordered over the three days = 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

2. **Calculate the number of bandages used each day:**
   - On the first day, they used 38 bandages.
   - On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
   - On the third day, they used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

3. **Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:**
   - Total used = 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.

4. **Determine the number of bandages left at the end of the third day:**
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

5. **Calculate the total number of bandages they had initially:**
   - Total bandages initially = Total used + Bandages left
   - Total bandages initially = 91 (used) + 78 (left) = 169 bandages.

Therefore, the nurses' station started with 169 bandages on the first day.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Bill is ordering a new truck.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and any other features are at extra cost. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each added feature and then add them to the base price of the truck.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000

2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500

3. **Leather Seats**: The cost of leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.  
   \[
   \text{Cost of Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500
   \]

4. **Running Boards**: The cost of running boards is $500 less than the cost of leather seats.  
   \[
   \text{Cost of Running Boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]

5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total cost of the truck:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 43,500
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute. If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to reach their homes.

1. **Convert miles to feet:**
   - 1 mile = 5280 feet
   - Tim lives 2 miles away, so he needs to travel \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet.
   - Steve lives 3 miles away, so he needs to travel \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet.

2. **Calculate the time taken for each:**
   - **Tim's time:** He rides his skateboard at 264 feet per minute.
     \[
     \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - **Steve's time:** He rides his bike at 440 feet per minute.
     \[
     \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> It takes Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore.

1. **Determine the distance to the shore:**
   - Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - To find the distance to the shore, we calculate how many 16-second intervals fit into 64 seconds: 
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals}
     \]
   - Since each interval covers 20 feet, the total distance to the shore is:
     \[
     4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - To find out how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet, we divide:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 8 \text{ segments}
     \]
   - Since each segment results in 2 liters of water, the total amount of water taken on is:
     \[
     8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Therefore, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water.

The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. On the fourth day of digging, they unearthed a treasure chest full of gold, jewels, and an aged hat. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes did the pirates dig on the fourth day before finding the treasure?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the first three days:**
   - On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
   - On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
   - On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes, so the net number of holes dug on the third day is 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

   Total holes by the end of the third day = 10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (third day) = 29 holes.

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:**
   - The problem states that the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, at the end of the fourth day, there should be 4 times 10 = 40 holes.

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - At the end of the third day, there were 29 holes.
   - At the end of the fourth day, there were 40 holes.
   - Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is 40 - 29 = 11 holes.

Thus, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bananas each monkey eats per day and then find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

1. **Determine the total number of days:**
   - Mr. Robles has enough bananas to feed his monkeys for a week, which is 7 days.

2. **Calculate the total number of bananas eaten per day by all monkeys:**
   - Mr. Robles has 315 bananas for 7 days.
   - Total bananas eaten per day = 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas per day.

3. **Determine the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

4. **Determine the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day.

5. **Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey:**
   - Total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys per day = 10 + 14 = 24 bananas.
   - Since the total bananas eaten per day by all monkeys is 45, the third monkey eats the remaining bananas.
   - Bananas eaten by the third monkey = 45 - 24 = 21 bananas per day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song, but only a third of them are his lines. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines he has in each part of his role.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - All 54 lines are his since it's a solo.

2. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are his.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

3. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines compared to the song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has 2 \times 54 = 108 lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are his.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

- Solo Song: 54 lines
- Second Scene: 48 lines
- First Scene: 36 lines

Total lines Sean has to memorize = 54 + 48 + 36 = 138 lines.

There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rats are in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed.

1. **Calculate the straw used by the hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 cages × 5 pieces of straw = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the straw used by the rabbits:**
   - The rabbits are given 20 pieces of straw in total.

3. **Calculate the total straw used by the rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used by hamsters and rabbits = 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70 pieces.
   - Straw used by rats = Total straw - Straw used by hamsters and rabbits = 160 - 70 = 90 pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 cages × \( x \) rats/cage × 6 pieces of straw/rat = 90 pieces.
   - Solving for \( x \): \( 3x \times 6 = 90 \).
   - \( 18x = 90 \).
   - \( x = 90 / 18 \).
   - \( x = 5 \).

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.

She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. The laptop Erika wants costs $600. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she has and compare it to the cost of the laptop after discounts and contributions.

1. **Initial Cost of the Laptop**: $600

2. **Discount from Trading in Old Laptop**: $200  
   - New cost of the laptop after trade-in: $600 - $200 = $400

3. **Contribution from Erika's Mom**: $80

4. **Earnings from Part-Time Job**: $150

5. **Total Money Needed After Discounts and Contributions**:  
   Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she is short by $50 after using all her available funds.

Let's calculate the total amount Erika has before needing the extra $50:

- Total cost after trade-in: $400
- Total contributions from mom and job: $80 + $150 = $230

If Erika is short by $50, it means she has $400 - $50 = $350 available.

Since $230 comes from her mom and job, the remaining amount must be from her purse:

- Money in her purse: $350 - $230 = $120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

How many yards of yarn did they use altogether?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah's grandma and Mariah used altogether, we need to calculate the amount of yarn each used and then add them together.

1. **Calculate the yarn used by Mariah's grandma:**
   - Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.
   - Since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Calculate the yarn used by Mariah:**
   - Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.
   - Since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total yarn used:**
   - Add the yarn used by Mariah's grandma and Mariah:
     \[
     182 + 91 = 273 \text{ yards}
     \]

Therefore, Mariah's grandma and Mariah used a total of 273 yards of yarn altogether.

Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore.  Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours. Calculate the total time they all took to do their chores altogether.</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time each person took to complete their chores and then sum these times to find the total time taken by all three.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog.
   - Therefore, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior took well over 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry.
   - Since "well over" is not a specific amount, we will assume it means at least 5 hours longer for calculation purposes.
   - Therefore, Dior took 4 + 5 = 9 hours.

4. **Total Time:**
   - Total time taken by all three is the sum of their individual times: 4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 9 (Dior) = 19 hours.

One notebook is sold at $1.50 each, a pen at $0.25 each, a calculator at $12 each, and a geometry set at $10.  How much does Daniel have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how much Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy, we need to calculate the total cost of each item before the discount, sum them up, and then apply the 10% discount.

1. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $1.50.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 notebooks × $1.50/notebook = $7.50.

2. **Calculate the cost of the pens:**
   - Daniel wants to buy 2 pens.
   - Each pen costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for pens = 2 pens × $0.25/pen = $0.50.

3. **Calculate the cost of the calculator:**
   - Daniel wants to buy 1 calculator.
   - The calculator costs $12.
   - Total cost for the calculator = 1 calculator × $12/calculator = $12.

Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many apples Lucy picked over the three days, we need to break down the information given:

1. **Monday:**
   - Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56.
   - Each apple is sold for $4.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Monday is calculated by dividing the total earnings by the price per apple: 
     \[
     \text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
     \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Number of apples on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
     \]

4. **Total apples picked over the three days:**
   - Add the number of apples picked each day:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = 14 \, (\text{Monday}) + 12 \, (\text{Tuesday}) + 24 \, (\text{Wednesday}) = 50

He gets 1 card that is worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.  In total, he bought 3 packs for $1800 each. How much money profit did he make?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine the profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total value of the cards he obtained and subtract the total cost of the packs he bought.

1. **Calculate the total value of the cards:**
   - The first card is worth $4000.
   - The second card is worth $1000.
   - There are 30 more cards, each worth an average of $50. Therefore, the total value of these 30 cards is 30 x $50 = $1500.

   Adding these values together gives the total value of all the cards:
   \[
   4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the packs:**
   - Mark bought 3 packs, each costing $1800. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   3 \times 1800 = 5400
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs:

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Pokemon cards Elaine collected over three months and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Second Month:**
   - She collected three times the number of cards she had initially.
   - Therefore, in the second month, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.

3. **Third Month:**
   - In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   - This statement seems to be a bit confusing because it contradicts the previous calculation. Let's assume it means she collected 20 fewer than the total she had by the end of the first month.
   - By the end of the first month, she had 20 cards.
   - In the second month, she collected 60 cards, so by the end of the second month, she had \(20 + 60 = 80\) cards.
   - In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   - The combined number of cards collected in the first and second months is \(20 + 60 = 80\).
   - Therefore, in the third month, she collected \(2 \times 80 = 160\) cards.

4. **Total Cards:**
   - Now, we sum up all the cards she has by the end of the third month:
   - Initial cards: 20
   - Second month collection: 60
   - Third month collection: 160
   - Total = \(20 + 60 + 160 = 240\)

Therefore, Elaine has a total of 240 Pokemon cards now.

   - Leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20/4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. The rink also has yellow cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each color of cars and then find out how many yellow cars there are.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars**: The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Blue Cars**: The number of blue cars is not directly given, but we know that the number of yellow cars is 3 times the number of blue cars. Let's denote the number of blue cars as \( b \).

4. **Yellow Cars**: The number of yellow cars is 3 times the number of blue cars, so:
   \[
   \text{Yellow Cars} = 3b
   \]

5. **Total Cars**: The total number of cars is 75. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   12 \, (\text{red}) + 10 \, (\text{green}) + b \, (\text{blue}) + 3b \, (\text{yellow}) = 75
   \]

6. **Simplify the Equation**: Combine like terms:
   \[
   12 + 10 + b + 3b = 75
   \]
   \[
   22 + 4b = 75
   \]

7. **Solve for \( b \)**:
   \[
   4b = 75 - 22
   \]
   \[
   4b = 53
   \]
   \[
   b = \frac{53}{4} = 13.25
   \]

Since the number of cars must be a whole number, it seems there was an error in the setup or interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem constraints or assumptions. 

Upon re-evaluation, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or missing information in the problem statement. However, based on the given setup, the calculation for \( b \) should yield a whole number, but it does not. Therefore, let's assume the problem constraints are correct and proceed with the calculation as is, acknowledging the discrepancy.

Given the setup, the number of yellow cars would be:
\[
3b = 3 \times 13.25 = 39.75
\]

This result is not feasible in a real-world scenario, indicating a potential error in the problem constraints or assumptions. However, based on the calculation, the closest whole number for yellow cars would be 39.

During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After five weeks, Carol and Jennifer compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. The sisters have three more weeks of summer vacation, and they decide they want to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer. Carol has 20 signatures in her book, and Jennifer has 44. How many signatures do the sisters need to collect to reach their goal?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures, we first need to calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.

1. Carol has 20 signatures.
2. Jennifer has 44 signatures.

Adding these together gives us the total number of signatures they currently have:

\[ 20 + 44 = 64 \]

Their goal is to have 100 signatures by the end of the summer. To find out how many more signatures they need to collect, we subtract the number of signatures they currently have from their goal:

\[ 100 - 64 = 36 \]

What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to determine the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Junebugs removed on Monday:**  
   Rita removed 39 Junebugs on Monday.

2. **Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday:**  
   On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.  
   So, on Tuesday, she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs.  
   On Wednesday, she also removed 78 Junebugs.

3. **Junebugs removed on Thursday:**  
   Rita removed 48 Junebugs on Thursday.

4. **Junebugs removed on Friday:**  
   Rita removed 57 Junebugs on Friday.

5. **Total Junebugs removed over the week:**  
   Total = 39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday)  
   Total = 300 Junebugs

6. **Number of days:**  
   Rita removed Junebugs over 5 days (Monday to Friday).

He can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, we need to break down James's swimming journey into parts and calculate the time taken for each part.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   - Distance swum initially = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time taken for the initial swim = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time on the island:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance of the lake = 20 miles.
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swum initially = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

5. **Calculate the time taken for the remaining swim:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour (since half of 2 miles per hour is 1 mile per hour).
   - Time taken for the remaining swim = Remaining distance / New speed = 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

1. **Cost of Taffy:**
   - The sale is "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."
   - For the first pound, she pays $3.
   - For the second pound, she pays half of $3, which is $1.50.
   - Total cost for 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. **Cost of Seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25.
   - She bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for magnets is 4 x $0.25 = $1.00.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total cost = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the costs of each venue.

1. **First Venue Cost:**
   - The first venue charges a flat fee of $200.
   - Additionally, Mark estimates that food will cost $5 per person.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue with \( x \) guests is: 
     \[
     \text{Cost for First Venue} = 200 + 5x
     \]

2. **Second Venue Cost:**
   - The second venue charges $25 per person, which includes food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue with \( x \) guests is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Second Venue} = 25x
     \]

3. **Set the Costs Equal:**
   - To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, set the two cost equations equal to each other:
     \[
     200 + 5x = 25x
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20} = 10
     \]

Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field, we need to calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer and the total number of bales picked up by the truck over the 6-hour period.

1. **Calculate the total number of bales produced by the farmer:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the farmer produces: 
     \[
     5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}

2. **Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the truck picks up:
     \[
     3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bales left in the field:**
   - The number of bales left in the field is the difference between the bales produced and the bales picked up:
     \[
     30 \text{ bales (produced)} - 18 \text{ bales (picked up)} = 12 \text{ bales}

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.
2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls in the third set.
3. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls in the first set.

According to the problem, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combine the terms:

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:

\[
2(2x + 4) + x = 38
\]

Simplify:

\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now, substitute back to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Greta wanted brownies for her birthday.  She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  Earlier, at her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?</div><div class='answer-text'><strong>Model Response:</strong><br>To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. Since one dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.

2. Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at the surprise party. Since one dozen equals 12, 4 dozen equals 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.

3. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since one dozen equals 12, 1 1/2 dozen equals 1.5 x 12 = 18 brownies.

4. At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. Since one dozen equals 12, 1/2 dozen equals 0.5 x 12 = 6 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Brownies she made: 12
- Brownies from her friends: 48
- Brownies from her office: 6

Total brownies = 12 + 48 + 6 = 66 brownies

Next, subtract the number of brownies that were eaten:

- Brownies eaten: 18

Brownies left over = 66 - 18 = 48

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.
