How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we need to analyze the information provided:<br><br>1. <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</span>. This means Claire earns 12 badges in a year (1 badge per month x 12 months).<br><br>2. <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</span>. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber takes 2 months to earn 1 badge. Therefore, Amber earns 6 badges in a year (12 months / 2 months per badge).<br><br>3. <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</span>. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 36 badges in a year (3 times 12).<br><br>Now, we calculate the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year:<br><br>Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. Therefore, Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.<br><br>The final answer is {30}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>30</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 30</div></div>

What are their combined weights in pounds?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate Alex's weight first and then add it to Grace's weight.<br><br>1. We know from <data1> that Grace weighs 125 pounds.<br><br>2. According to <data2>, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:<br>   - First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.<br>   - Then, subtract 2 pounds from this amount: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.<br><br>3. Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weight:<br>   - Grace's weight: 125 pounds<br>   - Alex's weight: 498 pounds<br>   - Combined weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.<br><br>Therefore, their combined weights in pounds are {623}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>623</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 623</div></div>

What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to consider the information given in the data tags.<br><br>1. According to <data1>, Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. This means that for the weeks not specified by <data2> and <data3>, he worked out for 4 hours.<br><br>2. <data2> states that Josh spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. Therefore, for these two weeks, he worked out a total of 5 + 5 = 10 hours.<br><br>3. <data3> indicates that Josh spent 6 hours in one week. Therefore, for this week, he worked out for 6 hours.<br><br>Now, let's calculate the total number of hours:<br><br>- Total weeks = 8<br>- Weeks with 5 hours = 2<br>- Week with 6 hours = 1<br>- Remaining weeks with 4 hours = 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks<br><br>Calculating the total hours:<br><br>- Hours for the 5 weeks with 4 hours each: 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours<br>- Hours for the 2 weeks with 5 hours each: 10 hours<br>- Hours for the 1 week with 6 hours: 6 hours<br><br>Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:<br><br>20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours<br><br>Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is {36}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>36</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 36</div></div>

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the data tags.<br><br>1. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).<br><br>2. According to <data1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).<br><br>3. According to <data2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).<br><br>4. According to <data3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:<br>   \[<br>   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>   \]<br><br>5. Simplifying the equation:<br>   \[<br>   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19<br>   \]<br><br>6. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:<br>   \[<br>   4x + x + 8 = 38<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   5x + 8 = 38<br>   \]<br><br>7. Subtract 8 from both sides:<br>   \[<br>   5x = 30<br>   \]<br><br>8. Divide by 5:<br>   \[<br>   x = 6<br>   \]<br><br>9. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \).<br><br>Thus, Rory retrieved {10} tennis balls in the first set.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>10</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 10</div></div>

This means that without the lace trim, the dress would be 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.<br><br>3. **Extension of the original length**: Shania extended the dress by <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">50% of its original length</span>. Let the original length be \( x \). The extension is \( 0.5x \).<br><br>4. **Equation setup**: The length of the dress after the extension but before adding the lace trim is the original length plus the extension, which is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).<br><br>5. **Solving for the original length**: We know that \( 1.5x = 120 \) (since 120cm is the length after the extension and before the lace trim).

Each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, as stated in <data3>.<br><br>- First runner: 60 seconds<br>- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds<br>- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds<br>- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds<br><br>Adding these times together gives the total time for the less well-rounded team:<br><br>60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.<br><br>**Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two teams.**<br><br>The well-rounded team takes 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team takes 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team (the well-rounded team) wins by:<br><br>222 - 220 = 2 seconds.<br><br>The faster team will win by {2} seconds.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>

How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.<br><br>1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">20 snowballs in an hour</span>. This means he builds 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (since 20 snowballs/hour divided by 4 quarters in an hour equals 5 snowballs per 15 minutes).<br><br>2. **Melting Rate**: <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes</span>.<br><br>3. **Net Gain**: Every 15 minutes, Jay builds 5 snowballs but loses 2 to melting, resulting in a net gain of 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.<br><br>4. **Time Calculation**: To find out how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs, we calculate how many 15-minute intervals are needed to accumulate 60 snowballs at a net gain of 3 snowballs per interval.<br><br>   - 60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.<br><br>5. **Total Time**: 20 intervals of 15 minutes each equals 300 minutes.<br><br>Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

This means she initially had 2 palettes * 4 colors = 8 colors from the palettes.<br>   - Additionally, she had <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each</span>. This means she had 3 sets * 6 colors = 18 colors from the makeup sets.<br><br>2. **Total Initial Colors:**<br>   - Combining the colors from both sources, Amy initially had 8 (from palettes) + 18 (from makeup sets) = 26 eyeshadow colors.<br><br>3. **After the Sister's Action:**<br>   - Her <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">sister steals one of the palettes</span>. Since each palette has 4 colors, Amy loses 4 colors. Therefore, she now has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.<br><br>4. **After Amy's Usage:**<br>   - <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set</span>. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of one set is 6 / 2 = 3 colors. Therefore, she uses up 3 colors.<br>   - Subtracting these used colors, Amy now has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.<br><br>Thus, after accounting for the stolen palette and the used colors, Amy has {19} eyeshadow colors left.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>19</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 19</div></div>

If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fish in each aquarium given the information about the snails and the relationship between the snails and fish.<br><br>1. First, identify the number of snails in each aquarium:<br>   - There are <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4 snails in one aquarium</span>.<br>   - There are <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">32 snails in another aquarium</span>.<br><br>2. Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:<br>   - The difference is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.<br><br>3. According to the problem, <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums</span>.<br><br>4. Let the number of fish in each aquarium be x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.<br><br>5. Set up the equation based on the given relationship:<br>   - 28 (the difference in snails) = 2 * (total number of fish in both aquariums)<br>   - 28 = 2 * 2x<br><br>6. Solve for x:<br>   - 28 = 4x<br>   - x = 28 / 4<br>   - x = 7<br><br>Therefore, there are {7} fish in each aquarium.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>7</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 7</div></div>

How many Pokemon has Stan caught?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon Stan has caught using the information provided in the data tags.<br><br>1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \( A \).<br><br>2. According to <data3>, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught can be expressed as:<br>   \[<br>   S = 4A - 13<br>   \]<br><br>3. According to <data2>, Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Alex has caught can be expressed as:<br>   \[<br>   X = S + 5<br>   \]<br><br>4. According to <data1>, together they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:<br>   \[<br>   A + S + X = 339<br>   \]<br><br>5. Substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) into the equation:<br>   \[<br>   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339<br>   \]<br><br>6.

The initial amount is 50 fruits, so a 10-year-old tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.<br><br>6. **8-year-old tree (continued)**: Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.<br><br>7. **9-year-old tree**: According to <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">during the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit</span>, so it produces 0 fruits.<br><br>Now, we sum up the fruits produced each year:<br><br>- 5-year-old: 50 fruits<br>- 6-year-old: 150 fruits<br>- 7-year-old: 350 fruits<br>- 8-year-old: 800 fruits<br>- 9-year-old: 0 fruits<br>- 10-year-old: 1000 fruits<br><br>Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.<br><br>Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is {2350}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2350</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2350</div></div>

Since there are three triplets, their combined age is \( 3t \).<br><br>According to <span class="data1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">one twin is 7 years older than one triplet</span>, we can express the age of one twin as \( t + 7 \).<br><br>Since there are two twins, their combined age is \( 2(t + 7) \).<br><br>The total combined age of the twins and triplets is given as <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">44</span>.<br><br>We can set up the equation for the total combined age:<br><br>\[ 3t + 2(t + 7) = 44 \]<br><br>Simplifying the equation:<br><br>\[ 3t + 2t + 14 = 44 \]<br><br>Combine like terms:<br><br>\[ 5t + 14 = 44 \]<br><br>Subtract 14 from both sides:<br><br>\[ 5t = 30 \]<br><br>Divide by 5:<br><br>\[ t = 6 \]<br><br>So, the age of one triplet is 6 years.<br><br>Now, we find the age of one twin:<br><br>\[ t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]<br><br>Therefore, one of the twins is {13} years old.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>13</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 13</div></div>
