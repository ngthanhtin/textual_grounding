When the object is far away from the earth, the frequency of these lights will move to the red end (low frequency) of the spectrum, referred to as \"red shift\" \"On the contrary, it is called\" blue shift \". The unique light emitted by the atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially the electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons it releases will also become higher, so the release and absorption frequencies will be blue-shifted. Conversely, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will be red-shifted. Astronomical observations have found that most galaxies have a redshift phenomenon.
