He has two mugs of water. <important2>One mug is 33 degrees</important2>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he <important3>pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</important3> into his water bottle and <important4>one ounce from the other bottle</important4>, <important5>he is now able to drink the water</important5>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?</div><div class='full-response'><span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</span>. He has two mugs of water. <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One mug is 33 degrees</span>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</span> into his water bottle and <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">one ounce from the other bottle</span>, <span class="important5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">he is now able to drink the water</span>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle that allows Donny to drink the water, given the conditions.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Requirement**: <br>   - <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</span>. This means the final mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>2. **Details of the Water Mugs**:<br>   - <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One mug is 33 degrees</span>. This is the temperature of the first mug.<br>   - The other mug has an unknown temperature, which we need to find.<br><br>3. **Mixing Process**:<br>   - Donny pours <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</span> into his water bottle.<br>   - He also pours <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">one ounce from the other bottle</span> into the water bottle.<br><br>4. **Final Condition**:<br>   - After mixing, <span class="important5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">he is now able to drink the water</span>, meaning the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>5. **Setting Up the Equation**:<br>   - Let \( x \) be the temperature of the second bottle.<br>   - The total volume of the mixture is 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, totaling 5 ounces.<br>   - The equation for the final temperature \( T \) of the mixture is:<br>     \[<br>     T = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5}<br>     \]<br>   - Since Donny can drink the water, \( T \geq 40 \).<br><br>6. **Solving the Equation**:<br>   \[<br>   \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5} \geq 40<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   (4 \times 33) + x \geq 200<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   132 + x \geq 200<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   x \geq 68<br>   \]<br><br>Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The answer is {68}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>68</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 68</div></div>

We know that <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls</span>.<br><br>2. According to <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey</span>, this means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did. Therefore, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.<br><br>3.

Each of these tickets costs <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$10</span>. Therefore, the cost for these movies is 5 x $10 = $50.<br>   - Colby saw <span class="important7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">8 movies on other days</span>. Each of these tickets costs <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">$7</span>. Therefore, the cost for these movies is 8 x $7 = $56.<br><br>2. **Calculate the cost of popcorn and candy he has already bought:**<br>   - Colby had <span class="important8" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">2 tubs of popcorn</span>. Each tub costs <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">$8</span>. Therefore, the cost for popcorn is 2 x $8 = $16.<br>   - Colby had <span class="important9" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">four boxes of candy</span>. Each box costs <span class="important5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">$2</span>. Therefore, the cost for candy is 4 x $2 = $8.<br><br>3. **Calculate the total amount spent so far:**<br>   - Total spent on movies = $50 (Friday/Saturday movies) + $56 (other days movies) = $106.<br>   - Total spent on snacks = $16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) = $24.<br>   - Total spent so far = $106 (movies) + $24 (snacks) = $130.<br><br>4. **Calculate the remaining budget:**<br>   - Colby's parents give him <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$150</span> each month. <br>   - Remaining budget = $150 - $130 = $20.<br><br>5. **Determine how many movies he can see on the last day:**<br>   - Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy on the last day, which will cost $8 (popcorn) + $2 (candy) = $10.<br>   - After buying snacks, he will have $20 - $10 = $10 left.<br>   - Since it is a Friday, the ticket costs <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$10</span>.<br>   - With $10 left, Colby can see 1 movie on the last day.<br><br>Therefore, Colby can see {1} movie on the last day of the month.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>1</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 1</div></div>

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the situation step by step using the key facts provided.<br><br>1. **Initial Setup**: <br>   - Ellen has a <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">case of 12 sodas</span>.<br>   - She <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">shook 3 of them up</span>.<br><br>2. **Ellen's Action**:<br>   - Ellen <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">took 1 unshaken soda for herself</span> and left.<br>   - This leaves 11 sodas in the case, with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.<br><br>3. **Brother's Action**:<br>   - Ellen's <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas</span>.<br>   - He also took <span class="important5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">2 of the unshaken sodas</span>.<br>   - After the brother's action, there are 10 sodas left: 2 shaken and 7 unshaken.<br><br>4. **Friend's Situation**:<br>   - Ellen's friend comes along and chooses from the remaining 10 sodas.<br>   - The probability that the friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.<br><br>5. **Calculation**:<br>   - There are 2 shaken sodas and 10 total sodas remaining.<br>   - Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas) = 2/10 = 0.2.<br><br>6. **Convert to Percentage**:<br>   - To express this probability as a percentage, multiply by 100.<br>   - 0.2 * 100 = 20%.<br><br>Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is {20%}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>20</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 25</div></div>

Therefore, he produces 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.<br><br>4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks:**<br>   Adding up the production for the first three weeks: 8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars.<br><br>5. **Total Monthly Production:**<br>   Boris <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month</span>.<br><br>6. **Fourth Week Production:**<br>   To find the production for the fourth week, subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.<br><br>Therefore, Boris produces {14,000} bars of chocolate in the fourth week.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>14000</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 14000</div></div>

How many lines does Sean have to memorize?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines he has in each part of his performance and then sum them up.<br><br>1. **Solo Song:**<br>   - Sean's solo song has <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">54 lines</span>. Since he has to memorize all the lines of his solo song, he needs to memorize 54 lines from the song.<br><br>2. **First Scene:**<br>   - The first scene has <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">twice the number of lines</span> as the solo song. Therefore, the first scene has 54 * 2 = 108 lines in total.<br>   - However, <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">only a third of them are his lines</span>. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.<br><br>3. **Second Scene:**<br>   - The second scene has <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">six more lines than the song</span>. Therefore, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines in total.<br>   - <span class="important5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">Four-fifths of them are his</span>. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.<br><br>Finally, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:<br>- Solo Song: 54 lines<br>- First Scene: 36 lines<br>- Second Scene: 48 lines<br><br>Total lines Sean has to memorize = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.<br><br>Therefore, Sean has to memorize {138} lines.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>138</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 138</div></div>

On Friday morning, the neighbors placed <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard</span>. On Saturday morning, the <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">neighbors took back one third of the flamingos</span>, <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">painted them white</span>, and put these newly painted white flamingos back out on Sue's front yard. Then, on Sunday morning, they <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">added another 18 pink plastic flamingos</span> to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pink and white flamingos on Sue's front yard at noon on Sunday and then find the difference between them.<br><br>1. **Initial Count of Pink Flamingos:**<br>   - On Friday morning, the neighbors placed <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard</span>.<br><br>2. **Saturday Morning Changes:**<br>   - On Saturday morning, the <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">neighbors took back one third of the flamingos</span>. <br>   - One third of 18 flamingos is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos.<br>   - These 6 flamingos were <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">painted white</span> and put back on the yard.<br><br>3. **Sunday Morning Additions:**<br>   - On Sunday morning, they <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">added another 18 pink plastic flamingos</span> to the collection.<br><br>4. **Final Count on Sunday Noon:**<br>   - Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.<br>   - After taking 6 flamingos to paint them white, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.<br>   - On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, making the total pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.<br>   - The number of white flamingos is 6, as they were painted and returned on Saturday.<br><br>5. **Difference Between Pink and White Flamingos:**<br>   - At noon on Sunday, the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.<br><br>Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were {24} more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>24</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 24</div></div>

When James came back yet again, <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">3 dogs were gone</span> so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many toys James needs in total, let's break down the situation step by step using the important information provided:<br><br>1. Initially, James has <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</span>. This means he has 1 toy per dog.<br><br>2. <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</span>. This means the total number of dogs is now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 12 toys in total. He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.<br><br>3. After buying the toys, James finds that <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</span>. When he left, there were 12 dogs. Now, there are twice as many, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. He needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 he bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.<br><br>4. When James comes back again, <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">3 dogs were gone</span>. This means there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. He needs 21 toys in total. He already has 24 toys (12 original + 12 he bought), so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, he needs 21 toys in total.<br><br>Thus, the total number of toys James needs is {21}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>21</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 33</div></div>

She put both of these purchases on her credit card. What is the new balance on her credit card?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to follow these steps:<br><br>1. **Initial Charge**: Sheila initially charged <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$85.00 worth of merchandise</span> on her credit card.<br><br>2. **Return of Item**: She returned an item that cost <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$15.00</span>. This means the amount of $15.00 will be deducted from her initial charge.<br><br>   New balance after return = $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00<br><br>3. **Purchase of Frying Pan**: Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">20% off $20.00</span>. To find the sale price, we calculate 20% of $20.00:<br><br>   Discount on frying pan = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00<br><br>   Sale price of frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00<br><br>4. **Purchase of Towels**: Sheila also bought a set of towels that was <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">10% off $30.00</span>. To find the sale price, we calculate 10% of $30.00:<br><br>   Discount on towels = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00<br><br>   Sale price of towels = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00<br><br>5. **Adding New Purchases**: Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance after the return:<br><br>   Total cost of new purchases = $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00<br><br>6. **Final Balance**: Add the total cost of new purchases to the balance after the return:<br><br>   New balance on credit card = $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00<br><br>Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is {113.00}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>113.00</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 113</div></div>

Therefore, the number of movies in series is:<br>   \[<br>   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}<br>   \]<br><br>3. **Cost of Series Movies**: These series movies can be bought for $6 each, which is <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">the cost of a normal movie</span>. Therefore, the cost for these 200 movies is:<br>   \[<br>   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}<br>   \]<br><br>4. **Remaining Movies**: After accounting for the series movies, the remaining number of movies is:<br>   \[<br>   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}<br>   \]<br><br>5. **Older Movies**: <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">40% of the remaining movies are older movies</span>.

How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, let's go through the information step by step:<br><br>1. **Initial Order of Sub Sandwiches**:<br>   - Sidney ordered <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches</span>. This means Sidney initially ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.<br><br>2. **Meatballs in Initial Order**:<br>   - Each sub sandwich contains <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4 meatballs</span>. Therefore, the initial order of 7 sub sandwiches contained 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.<br><br>3. **Sub Sandwiches Eaten by Mark**:<br>   - Mark ate <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches</span>. This means Mark ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.<br><br>4. **Remaining Sub Sandwiches After Mark Ate**:<br>   - After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.<br><br>5. **Additional Order of Sub Sandwiches**:<br>   - Sidney ordered <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">another three sub sandwiches</span>. This means Sidney added 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs to the remaining sub sandwiches.<br><br>6. **Total Remaining Meatballs**:<br>   - After Mark ate and Sidney ordered more, the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney had was 3 (remaining) + 3 (additional) = 6 sub sandwiches.<br>   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.<br><br>Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is {24}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>24</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 24</div></div>

After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob found that he now had <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">twice as many orange fish as white fish</span>.<br><br>Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish as \( y \).<br><br>- The total number of orange fish after the purchase is \( 3 + x \).<br>- The total number of white fish after the purchase is \( 4 + y \).<br><br>According to the condition <span class="important4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">twice as many orange fish as white fish</span>, we have:<br>\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]<br><br>We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17:<br>\[ x + y = 17 \]<br><br>Now, let's solve these equations:<br><br>1. From the equation \( x + y = 17 \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):<br>   \[ x = 17 - y \]<br><br>2. Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):<br>   \[ 3 + (17 - y) = 2(4 + y) \]<br>   \[ 20 - y = 8 + 2y \]<br>   \[ 20 - 8 = 2y + y \]<br>   \[ 12 = 3y \]<br>   \[ y = 4 \]<br><br>So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. Therefore, the answer is {4}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>4</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 4</div></div>

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the <important> tags.<br><br>1. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).<br><br>2. According to <important1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).<br><br>3. According to <important2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).<br><br>4. According to <important3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:<br>   \[<br>   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>   \]<br><br>5. Simplifying the equation:<br>   \[<br>   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>   \]<br>   \[<br>   2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19<br>   \]<br><br>6.

Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</span>. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</span>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the complementary probabilities of each event that would allow him not to turn it in.<br><br>1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**: <br>   - There's a <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</span>. <br>   - Therefore, there's a 50% chance that the regular teacher will be there.<br><br>2. **Extension for Everyone Scenario**:<br>   - If the regular teacher is there, there's a <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</span>.<br>   - Therefore, there's a 60% chance that she will not give an extension.<br><br>3. **Personal Extension Scenario**:<br>   - If the regular teacher is there and does not give an extension to everyone, there's a <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</span>.<br>   - Therefore, there's an 80% chance that he will not get a personal extension.<br><br>Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:<br><br>- The probability that the regular teacher is there and does not give an extension to everyone is 50% * 60% = 30%.<br>- The probability that Marcus does not get a personal extension is 30% * 80% = 24%.<br><br>Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is {24}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>24</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 24</div></div>

What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we can follow these steps:<br><br>1. **Initial Weight**: Jamaal starts with an <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">8-pound weight</span>.<br><br>2. **Increase by 50%**: He then <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">increases the weight that he uses by 50%</span>. To calculate this, we find 50% of 8 pounds:<br>   \[<br>   0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds}<br>   \]<br>   Adding this to the original weight gives:<br>   \[<br>   8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}<br>   \]<br><br>3. **Adjust for Too Heavy**: Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">uses a weight two pounds lighter than that</span>.

Since <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</span>, and <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">it takes Wayne four minutes</span>, Bernadette's drive will take 4 times 4 minutes, which is 16 minutes.<br><br>- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, she needs to complete her 16-minute drive and arrive 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.<br><br>- Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, if he leaves at time T, he will arrive at T + 4 minutes.<br><br>- To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at T - 1 minute (since T + 4 - 5 = T - 1).<br><br>- Therefore, Bernadette should start her 16-minute drive at T - 1 - 16 = T - 17 minutes.<br><br>- Thus, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.<br><br>The answer is {17}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>17</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 17</div></div>
