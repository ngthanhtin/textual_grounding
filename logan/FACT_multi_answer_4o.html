This means there is one medium yellow square in Block A.<br><br>3. <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">Block B contains one medium yellow square</span>. This means there is one medium yellow square in Block B.<br><br>4. <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">Block C has two medium blue squares and two other medium yellow squares</span>. This means Block C contains two medium yellow squares and two medium blue squares.<br><br>5. <span class="FACT6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">Below medium yellow square number two there is medium yellow square number one</span>. This indicates that medium yellow square number one is directly below medium yellow square number two within Block C.<br><br>6. Below medium blue square number two and medium yellow square number one, there is medium blue square number one. This means medium blue square number one is at the bottom of Block C.<br><br>7. Medium blue square number two is below medium yellow square number two. This confirms the order within Block C: medium yellow square number two is above medium blue square number two.<br><br>Now, let's determine which object is below a medium yellow square:<br><br>- Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one, as stated in <FACT6>. Therefore, medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.<br><br>- The medium yellow square in Block A is not mentioned to have anything below it, and since Block A is at the bottom, it is unlikely to have anything below it.<br><br>Thus, the object below a medium yellow square is medium yellow square number one, which is below medium yellow square number two. Therefore, the answer is {0}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>0</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>

We have three blocks: A, B, and C. Block A is below C, and Block C is to the right of B. Block A contains a medium blue square, Block B contains a medium black square, and Block C contains two medium yellow squares.<br><br>2. According to <FACT1>, there is one medium blue square touching the bottom edge of this block. Since Block A contains a medium blue square, it is likely that this is the block being referred to.<br><br>3. <FACT2> states that the medium blue square is below medium yellow square number one. This implies that the medium blue square is in Block A, and Block C, which contains the medium yellow squares, is above Block A.<br><br>4. <FACT3> states that medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two. This means that in Block C, medium yellow square number two is at the top, followed by medium yellow square number one, and then the medium blue square in Block A.<br><br>5. The question asks what is below the thing which is touching the bottom edge of a block. Since the medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of Block A, and there is no mention of anything below Block A, it implies that there is nothing below the medium blue square.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is {3}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>3</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 3</div></div>
