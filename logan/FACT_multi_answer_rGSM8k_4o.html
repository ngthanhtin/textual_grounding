At least how many degrees is the second bottle?</div><div class='full-response'><span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</span>. He has two mugs of water. <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One mug is 33 degrees</span>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</span> into his water bottle and <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">one ounce from the other bottle</span>, <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">he is now able to drink the water</span>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle that allows Donny to drink the water, given the conditions.<br><br>1. **Understanding the Requirement**: <br>   - <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</span>. This means the final mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>2. **Details of the Mugs**:<br>   - <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">One mug is 33 degrees</span>. This is the temperature of the first mug.<br>   - The temperature of the second mug is unknown, and we need to find the minimum temperature that makes the final mixture drinkable.<br><br>3. **Mixing Process**:<br>   - <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">He pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</span> into his water bottle.<br>   - <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">He pours one ounce from the other bottle</span> into his water bottle.<br><br>4. **Final Condition**:<br>   - <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">He is now able to drink the water</span>. This means the final temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.<br><br>5. **Calculating the Minimum Temperature**:<br>   - Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug.<br>   - The total volume of the mixture is 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, totaling 5 ounces.<br>   - The equation for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is:<br>     \[<br>     T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}<br>     \]<br>   - We need \( T_f \geq 40 \).<br><br>6. **Solving the Equation**:<br>   - Plug in the values:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{(4 \times 33) + T}{5} \geq 40<br>     \]<br>   - Simplify:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40<br>     \]<br>   - Multiply both sides by 5:<br>     \[<br>     132 + T \geq 200<br>     \]<br>   - Solve for \( T \):<br>     \[<br>     T \geq 200 - 132<br>     \]<br>     \[<br>     T \geq 68<br>     \]<br><br>Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

How many dollars did she make that day?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how much money Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert the total cost from cents to dollars.<br><br>1. **Bicycles**: According to <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated</span>. Each bicycle has 2 tires, so the total number of bicycle tires is 5 people * 2 tires/person = 10 tires.<br><br>2. **Tricycles**: According to <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated</span>.

Maria invited 4 of her friends, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).<br><br>2. Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons given to her friends is:<br>   \[<br>   4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons each} = 8 \text{ balloons}<br>   \]<br><br>3. Maria had one water balloon for herself, so initially, the total number of balloons is:<br>   \[<br>   8 \text{ (friends' balloons)} + 1 \text{ (Maria's balloon)} = 9 \text{ balloons}<br>   \]<br><br>4. Then, Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people, the total number of additional balloons is:<br>   \[<br>   5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons each} = 15 \text{ balloons}<br>   \]<br><br>5. Adding the additional balloons to the initial total gives:<br>   \[<br>   9 \text{ (initial total)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 24 \text{ balloons}<br>   \]<br><br>Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is {24}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>24</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 24</div></div>

How many boys are in the third class?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many boys are in the third class, let's analyze the information step by step using the key facts provided:<br><br>1. According to <FACT1>, each class in the school has 20 students.<br><br>2. There are 3 classes in total as per <FACT2>.<br><br>3. The school is evenly split between boys and girls, with 50% boys and 50% girls, as stated in <FACT3>.<br><br>4. The first class has 15 girls, according to <FACT4>. Since each class has 20 students, this means there are 20 - 15 = 5 boys in the first class.<br><br>5. The second class has 12 girls, as per <FACT5>. Therefore, there are 20 - 12 = 8 boys in the second class.<br><br>6. To find out how many boys are in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. Therefore, there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys in the entire school.<br><br>7. We already know there are 5 boys in the first class and 8 boys in the second class. So, the number of boys in the third class is 30 (total boys) - 5 (boys in the first class) - 8 (boys in the second class) = 17 boys.<br><br>Thus, the number of boys in the third class is {17}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>17</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 17</div></div>

How many buttons does she have by the end?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many buttons Lorraine has by the end, we need to follow the steps of her trades using the key facts provided.<br><br>1. **Initial Stickers:**<br>   - Lorraine starts with <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">30 small stickers</span> and <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">40 large stickers</span>.<br><br>2. **Trading Small Stickers:**<br>   - She trades <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">90% of her small stickers for large buttons</span>.<br>   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.<br>   - Each large button is worth three small stickers, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons from this trade.<br><br>3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**<br>   - After trading 90% of her small stickers, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.<br><br>4. **Trading Large Stickers:**<br>   - She trades <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">50% of her large stickers for large buttons</span>.<br>   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.<br>   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.<br><br>5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**<br>   - After trading 50% of her large stickers, she has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.<br><br>6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**<br>   - She trades the remaining <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">20 large stickers for small buttons</span>.<br>   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from this trade.<br><br>7. **Total Buttons:**<br>   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.<br>   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from remaining large stickers) = 63 small buttons.<br><br>Therefore, by the end, Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons. The total number of buttons is 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons.<br><br>The answer is {92}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>92</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 89</div></div>

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the situation step by step using the key facts provided.<br><br>1. **Initial Setup**: <br>   - Ellen has a <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">case of 12 sodas</span>.<br>   - Out of these, <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">3 sodas are shaken</span>.<br><br>2. **Ellen's Action**:<br>   - Ellen <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">took 1 unshaken soda for herself</span>.<br>   - This leaves 11 sodas in the case, with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.<br><br>3. **Brother's Action**:<br>   - Ellen's <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">brother took 1 of the shaken sodas</span>.<br>   - He also took <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">2 of the unshaken sodas</span>.<br>   - After the brother's action, the remaining sodas are:<br>     - Shaken: 3 - 1 = 2<br>     - Unshaken: 8 - 2 = 6<br>   - Total remaining sodas: 2 shaken + 6 unshaken = 8 sodas.<br><br>4. **Probability Calculation**:<br>   - Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random from the remaining 8 sodas.<br>   - The probability that the friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas.<br>   - Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas) = 2/8 = 1/4.<br><br>5. **Convert to Percentage**:<br>   - To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.<br>   - (1/4) * 100 = 25%.<br><br>Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is {25%}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>25</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 25</div></div>

How many guests does the hotel now have?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many guests the hotel now has, let's go through the key facts step by step:<br><br>1. Initially, the hotel was completely booked with <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">100 guests</span>.<br><br>2. <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">24 guests elected an early checkout</span>. This means 100 - 24 = 76 guests remained after the early checkout.<br><br>3. <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">15 elected for a late checkout</span>. This means 76 - 15 = 61 guests remained after the late checkout.<br><br>4. In the afternoon, <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</span>. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in.

In the first game, <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points</span>. This means Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.<br><br>2.

On the <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages</span> and <span class="FACT6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">only used half a pack</span>. They had <span class="FACT7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">78 bandages left at the end of the third day</span>. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days, and the number of bandages left at the end.<br><br>1. **Initial Setup:**<br>   - The nurses' station orders <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">bandages in bulk packs of 50</span>.<br><br>2. **First Day:**<br>   - They used <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">38 bandages</span>.<br>   - They ordered <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">one bulk pack of bandages</span>, which is 50 bandages.<br><br>3. **Second Day:**<br>   - They used <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">ten fewer bandages</span> than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.<br><br>4. **Third Day:**<br>   - They ordered <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">two bulk packs of bandages</span>, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.<br>   - They used <span class="FACT6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">only half a pack</span>, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.<br><br>5. **End of Third Day:**<br>   - They had <span class="FACT7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">78 bandages left at the end of the third day</span>.<br><br>Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered:<br><br>- Total bandages used over three days = 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.<br>- Total bandages ordered = 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.<br><br>Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day. The equation for the total bandages is:<br><br>\[ x - 91 + 150 = 78 \]<br><br>Solving for \( x \):<br><br>\[ x + 59 = 78 \]<br><br>\[ x = 78 - 59 \]<br><br>\[ x = 19 \]<br><br>Therefore, the nurses' station started with {19} bandages on the first day.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>19</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 19</div></div>

What is their average guess?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To find the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to calculate each friend's guess and then find the average.<br><br>1. The first friend's guess is straightforward: <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">One says 80</span>. So, the first guess is 80.<br><br>2. The second friend's guess is calculated as follows: <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Another says 20 more than half the first one</span>. Half of the first guess (80) is 40. Adding 20 to this gives us 40 + 20 = 60. So, the second guess is 60.<br><br>3. The third friend's guess is calculated as follows: <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">A third says 25% more than the first one</span>. 25% of the first guess (80) is 0.25 * 80 = 20.

Initially, <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</span>. This means he has 1 toy per dog.<br><br>2. <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</span>. This means there are now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs in total. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 12 toys in total. He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.<br><br>3. After buying the toys, <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</span>. When he left, there were 12 dogs. Now, there are twice as many, which means there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. He needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 he bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.<br><br>4. When James came back yet again, <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">3 dogs were gone</span>. This means there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. He needs 21 toys in total. He already has 24 toys, so he doesn't need to buy any more toys.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of shirts required for each size using the given key facts.<br><br>1. **Extra-Small Shirts**: According to <FACT1>, 11 students need size extra-small shirts.<br><br>2. **Small Shirts**: <FACT2> states that twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is 2 times 11, which is 22.<br><br>3. **Medium Shirts**: <FACT3> indicates that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Since there are 22 small shirts needed, the number of medium shirts needed is 22 - 4, which is 18.<br><br>4. **Large Shirts**: <FACT4> states that half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is half of 18, which is 9.<br><br>5. **Extra-Large Shirts**: <FACT5> indicates that six more students need size extra-large than large. Since there are 9 large shirts needed, the number of extra-large shirts needed is 9 + 6, which is 15.<br><br>Now, we sum up all the shirts needed for each size to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:<br><br>- Extra-Small: 11<br>- Small: 22<br>- Medium: 18<br>- Large: 9<br>- Extra-Large: 15<br><br>Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75<br><br>Therefore, Krissa needs to order a total of {75} shirts.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>75</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 75</div></div>

With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to consider both the flashlights and the candles separately.<br><br>1. **Flashlights:**<br>   - According to <FACT1>, there are 4 people living in the house.<br>   - According to <FACT2>, there is a flashlight for every person, so there are 4 flashlights for the people.<br>   - Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each room. According to <FACT3>, there are 8 rooms in the house.<br>   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights.<br>   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.<br><br>2. **Candles:**<br>   - According to <FACT3>, there are 8 rooms in the house.<br>   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, according to <FACT4>. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms.<br>   - Therefore, the total number of small candles is 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.<br>   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, according to <FACT5>. Again, half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms.<br>   - Therefore, the total number of medium candles is 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.<br>   - Total candles = 16 (small candles) + 20 (medium candles) = 36 candles.<br><br>3. **Total Candles and Flashlights:**<br>   - Total candles and flashlights = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.<br><br>Therefore, Brianna's family is using a total of {56} candles and flashlights when the lights go out.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>56</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 56</div></div>

Therefore, the number of movies in series is:<br>   \[<br>   \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ movies}<br>   \]<br><br>3. **Cost of Series Movies**: Mike can get these series movies for $6 each, which is <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">the cost of a normal movie</span>. Therefore, the cost for the series movies is:<br>   \[<br>   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}<br>   \]<br><br>4. **Remaining Movies**: After accounting for the series movies, the remaining number of movies is:<br>   \[<br>   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}<br>   \]<br><br>5. **Older Movies**: <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">40% of the remaining movies are older movies</span>. Therefore, the number of older movies is:<br>   \[<br>   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}<br>   \]<br><br>6. **Cost of Older Movies**: These older movies cost <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">$5</span> each.

During the party, <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten</span>. How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.<br><br>1. Greta made a batch for herself: <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies</span>. This means she initially had 12 brownies.<br><br>2. At her office, they gave her <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">1/2 a dozen brownies</span>. This adds 6 brownies to her total.<br><br>3. At her surprise party, her friends had <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">4 dozen brownies</span> waiting. This adds 48 brownies to her total.<br><br>4. During the party, <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten</span>. This means 18 brownies were consumed.<br><br>Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:<br><br>- Total brownies received: 12 (from her batch) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from the surprise party) = 66 brownies.<br><br>- Brownies eaten: 18 brownies.<br><br>Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:<br><br>66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten brownies) = 48 brownies.<br><br>So, Greta had {48} individual brownies left over from the entire day.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>48</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 48</div></div>

How much time did he spend sightseeing?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on all activities.<br><br>1. **Boating Time**: John spent <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">6 hours boating</span>.<br><br>2. **Swimming Time**: He spent <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">half that time swimming</span>, which is half of 6 hours. Therefore, he spent 3 hours swimming.<br><br>3. **Watching Shows**: John watched <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">3 different shows which were 2 hours each</span>.

What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the weight that Jamaal now uses, we can follow these steps:<br><br>1. **Initial Weight**: Jamaal starts with an <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">8-pound weight</span>.<br><br>2. **Increase by 50%**: He then <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">increases the weight that he uses by 50%</span>. To calculate this, we take 50% of 8 pounds, which is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. Adding this to the original weight gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.<br><br>3. **Adjust for Too Heavy**: Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">uses a weight two pounds lighter than that</span>.

If his <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</span>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying and then divide that by the truck's capacity.<br><br>1. **Calculate the total weight of each type of feed:**<br><br>   - **Sugar cubes:** The farmer buys <span class="FACT1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">two 1-pound boxes of them</span>. Therefore, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 pounds.<br><br>   - **Carrots:** The farmer buys <span class="FACT2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">four 12-pound bags</span>. Therefore, the total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds.<br><br>   - **Hay:** The farmer buys <span class="FACT3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">forty-two 75-pound bales</span>. Therefore, the total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.<br><br>   - **Oats:** The farmer buys <span class="FACT4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">twenty 65-pound sacks</span>. Therefore, the total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.<br><br>2. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**<br><br>   Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds.<br><br>3. **Determine the number of trips needed:**<br><br>   The truck can carry <span class="FACT5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">2250 pounds at a time</span>. Therefore, the number of trips required is the total weight divided by the truck's capacity, rounded up to the nearest whole number because the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip.<br><br>   Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips.<br><br>Therefore, the farmer needs to make {2} trips to transport all the feed.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>
