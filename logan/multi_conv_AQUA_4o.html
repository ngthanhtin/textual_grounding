Therefore, Train N takes 3.5 hours to travel from City B to City A.<br><br>2. **Determine the relative speeds of the trains:**<br>   - Since both trains travel the same distance between City A and City B, we can assume the distance is the same for both.<br>   - Let the distance be D. The speed of Train M is D/4, and the speed of Train N is D/3.5.<br><br>3. **Calculate the time when they meet:**<br>   - Train M starts at 5 am, and Train N starts at 7 am. Therefore, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours by the time Train N starts.<br>   - In those 2 hours, Train M covers a distance of (D/4) * 2 = D/2.<br>   - Now, the remaining distance to be covered by both trains together is D - D/2 = D/2.<br><br>4. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance:**<br>   - The combined speed of both trains is (D/4) + (D/3.5).<br>   - To find the time (T) it takes to cover the remaining D/2 distance, we use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time.<br>   - D/2 = [(D/4) + (D/3.5)] * T<br>   - Simplifying, we find T = (D/2) / [(D/4) + (D/3.5)].<br><br>5. **Solve for T:**<br>   - T = (1/2) / [(1/4) + (1/3.5)]<br>   - T = (1/2) / [(7/28) + (8/28)]<br>   - T = (1/2) / (15/28)<br>   - T = (1/2) * (28/15)<br>   - T = 28/30<br>   - T = 14/15 hours<br><br>6. **Convert T to minutes:**<br>   - 14/15 hours = 14/15 * 60 minutes = 56 minutes.<br><br>Therefore, the two trains cross each other 56 minutes after Train N starts at 7 am, which is at 7:56 am.

The number of factors of a number \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \) is given by \((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)\ldots(a_k + 1)\).<br>   - For \( Q \) to have exactly 5 factors, the product of these increments must equal 5.<br><br>2. **Analyzing the possibilities:**<br>   - The number 5 is a prime number, so the only way to achieve a product of 5 is if one of the increments is 5 and the rest are 1. This implies that \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This corresponds to statement II.<br><br>3. **Evaluating each statement:**<br>   - **Statement I:** \( Q \) is the square of a prime number. If \( Q = p^2 \), the number of factors would be \((2 + 1) = 3\), not 5. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.<br>   - **Statement II:** \( Q \) is the fourth power of a prime number. If \( Q = p^4 \), the number of factors would be \((4 + 1) = 5\), which matches the condition. Therefore, statement II is true.<br>   - **Statement III:** \( Q \) is the product of two prime numbers. If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), the number of factors would be \((1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4\), not 5. Therefore, statement III is not necessarily true.<br><br>4. **Conclusion:**<br>   - Only statement II must be true for \( Q \) to have exactly 5 factors.<br><br>Thus, the correct answer is {C)II only}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>c)ii only</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> b</div></div>

At this angle, the horizontal distance (d1) from the car to the base of the tower is equal to the height (h) of the tower because tan(45°) = 1, which implies h/d1 = 1, so d1 = h.<br>   - After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation changes to 60°. At this angle, the horizontal distance (d2) from the car to the base of the tower is h/√3 because tan(60°) = √3, which implies h/d2 = √3, so d2 = h/√3.<br><br>2. **Calculating the Distance Covered in 10 Minutes:**<br>   - The car covers the distance from d1 to d2 in 10 minutes. Therefore, the distance covered is d1 - d2 = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3).<br><br>3. **Calculating the Speed of the Car:**<br>   - The speed of the car is the distance covered divided by the time taken. So, speed = [h(1 - 1/√3)] / 10.<br><br>4. **Calculating the Remaining Distance to the Base:**<br>   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower when the angle is 60° is d2 = h/√3.<br><br>5. **Calculating the Time to Reach the Base:**<br>   - The time taken to cover the remaining distance d2 at the same speed is given by:<br>     Time = Remaining distance / Speed = (h/√3) / [h(1 - 1/√3) / 10] = 10 / (1 - 1/√3) * (1/√3).<br><br>6. **Simplifying the Expression:**<br>   - Simplifying the expression for time:<br>     Time = 10 * √3 / (1 - 1/√3) = 10 * √3 / [(√3 - 1)/√3] = 10 * √3 * √3 / (√3 - 1) = 10 * 3 / (√3 - 1) = 30 / (√3 - 1).<br><br>7. **Rationalizing the Denominator:**<br>   - To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 + 1):<br>     Time = (30 * (√3 + 1)) / ((√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1)) = (30 * (√3 + 1)) / (3 - 1) = 30 * (√3 + 1) / 2 = 15 * (√3 + 1).<br><br>8. **Matching with the Options:**<br>   - The calculated time is 15 * (√3 + 1), which does not match any of the given options directly.

This means M can be expressed as \(100a + 10b + c\).<br>   - <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">N = cba</span>. This means N can be expressed as \(100c + 10b + a\).<br><br>2. **Given Conditions:**<br>   - <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">M > N</span>. This implies \(100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a\).<br>   - Simplifying the inequality: \(99a > 99c\), which implies \(a > c\).<br><br>3. **Equation to Solve:**<br>   - <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">M - N + 396c = 990</span>.<br>   - Substituting the expressions for M and N, we get:<br>     \((100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990\).<br>   - Simplifying, we have:<br>     \(99a - 99c + 396c = 990\).<br>   - Further simplification gives:<br>     \(99a + 297c = 990\).<br><br>4. **Solving the Equation:**<br>   - Divide the entire equation by 99:<br>     \(a + 3c = 10\).<br><br>5. **Finding Possible Values:**<br>   - Since \(a\) and \(c\) are digits (0-9) and \(a > c\), we need to find pairs \((a, c)\) such that \(a + 3c = 10\) and \(a > c\).<br>   - Possible pairs are:<br>     - \(a = 7, c = 1\)<br>     - \(a = 8, c = 2\)<br>     - \(a = 9, c = 3\)<br><br>6. **Calculating Values of M:**<br>   - For each pair, calculate the possible values of M:<br>     - If \(a = 7, c = 1\), M = 710, 711, ..., 719 (10 values)<br>     - If \(a = 8, c = 2\), M = 820, 821, ..., 829 (10 values)<br>     - If \(a = 9, c = 3\), M = 930, 931, ..., 939 (10 values)<br><br>7. **Counting Values of M Greater than 300:**<br>   - All calculated values of M are greater than 300.<br>   - Total number of values = 10 (for \(a = 7, c = 1\)) + 10 (for \(a = 8, c = 2\)) + 10 (for \(a = 9, c = 3\)) = 30.<br><br>Therefore, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is {30}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>30</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> a</div></div>

From <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T</span>, we can express this relationship mathematically. Let's denote the ages of Q, R, and T as Q, R, and T respectively. The statement implies:<br>   - R - Q = Q - T<br><br>2. Rearranging the equation from step 1, we get:<br>   - R + T = 2Q<br><br>3. We are also given <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years</span>. Therefore:<br>   - R + T = 50<br><br>4. From steps 2 and 3, we have:<br>   - 2Q = 50<br><br>5. Solving for Q, we find:<br>   - Q = 25<br><br>6. Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age. From the equation R + T = 50 and R + T = 2Q, we know:<br>   - R + T = 50<br>   - R + T = 2Q = 50<br><br>7. Since we have already determined that Q = 25, we can substitute back to find R and T, but the problem only asks for the difference between R and Q.<br><br>8. From the equation R - Q = Q - T, we can substitute Q = 25:<br>   - R - 25 = 25 - T<br><br>9. Rearranging gives us:<br>   - R = 50 - T<br><br>10. Since R + T = 50, we can substitute R = 50 - T into this equation:<br>    - 50 - T + T = 50<br><br>11. This confirms that the relationship holds, but we need the difference R - Q:<br>    - R - Q = 25 - T<br><br>12. Since we don't have a specific value for T, we cannot determine a specific numerical difference between R and Q without additional information.<br><br>Therefore, the answer is {D) Cannot be determined}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>false</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> d</div></div>

To determine the highest interest rate they can afford, we need to calculate the interest on $19,200 for the remaining 70 days (100 - 30 days).<br><br>4. **Simple Interest Formula:**<br>   - The simple interest formula is:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}<br>     \]<br>   - Here, the principal is $19,200, the time is 70/365 years, and the interest should not exceed the $800 savings.<br><br>5. **Setting Up the Equation:**<br>   - We set up the equation to find the rate:<br>     \[<br>     800 = 19,200 \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{70}{365}<br>     \]<br>   - Solving for the rate:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Rate} = \frac{800 \times 365}{19,200 \times 70}<br>     \]<br><br>6. **Calculating the Rate:**<br>   - Performing the calculation:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Rate} = \frac{800 \times 365}{19,200 \times 70} \approx 0.21567<br>     \]<br>   - Converting to a percentage:<br>     \[<br>     \text{Rate} \approx 21.567\%<br>     \]<br><br>7. **Conclusion:**<br>   - The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is approximately 21.567%. Therefore, the closest answer option is {D)215.67}.<br><br>The answer is {D}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>d</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> a</div></div>

This means that if the total revenue is represented as 100%, then the revenue from novels is 34%.<br><br>2. **Calculate the remaining revenue:**<br>   - Since 34% of the revenue is from novels, the remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%.<br><br>3. **Calculate the revenue from biographies:**<br>   - According to <fact2>, 1/3 of the remaining revenue was from the sale of biographies. Therefore, the revenue from biographies is 1/3 of 66%, which is 66% / 3 = 22%.<br><br>4. **Determine how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies:**<br>   - The revenue from novels is 34%, and the revenue from biographies is 22%.<br>   - To find how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies, we divide the percentage of revenue from novels by the percentage of revenue from biographies: 34% / 22% = 1.545.<br><br>5. **Select the closest answer option:**<br>   - The closest option to 1.545 is 1.5.<br><br>Therefore, the company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately 1.5 times its revenue from the sale of biographies.

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have done neither is when the overlap is minimized.<br><br>- The correct calculation should be:<br>  - Total students = 200<br>  - Students who attended at least one event = 90 (prom night) + 70 (debating session) - overlap<br>  - Maximum students who did neither = 200 - (90 + 70 - overlap)<br><br>Since the overlap cannot be negative, the maximum number of students who did neither is when the overlap is minimized, which is 0.<br><br>Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - 90 - 70 = 40.<br><br>However, this does not match the options provided.

Now solve for \( x \):<br>   \[<br>   4x = 360 \implies x = \frac{360}{4} = 90<br>   \]<br><br>Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Let's denote the number of employees as \( n \).<br><br>2. According to <fact1>, the total contribution needed is Rs. 6 lakh. Therefore, the contribution per employee is \( \frac{600000}{n} \).<br><br>3. If each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, as per <fact2>, the new contribution per employee becomes \( \frac{600000}{n} + 60 \).<br><br>4. With this extra contribution, the total contribution becomes Rs. 6.24 lakh, as stated in <fact3>. Therefore, the equation for the total contribution with the extra amount is:<br>   \[<br>   n \left(\frac{600000}{n} + 60\right) = 624000<br>   \]<br><br>5.

This means 50% of 250 files were not infected by a virus, which is 125 files.<br><br>2. **Files Infected by Worms**:<br>   - Since 125 files are not infected by a virus, these files must be infected only by a worm because all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.<br><br>3. **Files Infected by Both**:<br>   - Let the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm be \( x \).<br>   - According to <fact2>, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both. Therefore, the number of files infected only by a worm is \( 2.5x \).<br><br>4. **Equation Setup**:<br>   - The total number of files infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both) is the sum of files infected only by a worm and files infected by both, which is \( 2.5x + x = 3.5x \).<br>   - We know from step 2 that 125 files are infected only by a worm, so \( 2.5x = 125 \).<br><br>5. **Solving for \( x \)**:<br>   - Solve \( 2.5x = 125 \) to find \( x \).<br>   - \( x = 125 / 2.5 = 50 \).<br><br>6. **Files Not Infected by a Worm**:<br>   - The number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is \( x = 50 \).<br>   - The total number of files infected by a worm is \( 3.5x = 3.5 \times 50 = 175 \).<br>   - Therefore, the number of files not infected by a worm is the total number of files minus those infected by a worm: \( 250 - 175 = 75 \).<br><br>Thus, the number of Sam's files that were not infected by a worm is {C)75}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>c)75</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> c</div></div>

However, based on the calculation, the length of the shuttle should be approximately 87.5 meters. <br><br>Since this is not an option, it indicates a potential error in the problem or options provided. Therefore, based on the calculation, the length of the shuttle is approximately 87.5 meters, but this does not match any of the given options. <br><br>Thus, the answer based on the calculation is not available in the options provided.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>meters</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> c</div></div>

We know that the <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons</span>. This means the total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.<br><br>2. After adding the new heavy-duty truck, the average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons. So, the new average is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.<br><br>3. With the new truck, there are now 11 vehicles. The total weight of these 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.<br><br>4. To find the weight of the heavy-duty truck, we subtract the original total weight of the 10 vehicles from the new total weight of the 11 vehicles: 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.<br><br>Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.

The sum of the digits of N is:<br># Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)11', 'C)12', 'D)13', 'E)14']<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \( N \) such that when both 2272 and 875 are divided by \( N \), they leave the same remainder. This implies that the difference between 2272 and 875 should be divisible by \( N \).<br><br>Let's calculate the difference:<br><br>\[ \text{Difference} = 2272 - 875 = 1397 \]<br><br>So, \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397.<br><br>Next, we need to find the divisors of 1397 that are 3-digit numbers. Let's check if 1397 is a prime number or if it has any 3-digit divisors.<br><br>First, we check if 1397 is divisible by smaller prime numbers:<br><br>- 1397 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).<br>- The sum of the digits of 1397 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20, which is not divisible by 3.<br>- 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.<br>- For 7, 11, and 13, we perform division:<br><br>  - 1397 ÷ 7 ≈ 199.57 (not an integer)<br>  - 1397 ÷ 11 ≈ 127 (exactly, so 11 is a divisor)<br>  - 1397 ÷ 13 ≈ 107.46 (not an integer)<br><br>Since 1397 is divisible by 11, we check if 11 is a 3-digit number. It is not, so we continue checking for other divisors.<br><br>Since 1397 ÷ 11 = 127, and 127 is a 3-digit number, we check if 127 is a divisor of 1397. It is, as 1397 ÷ 127 = 11.<br><br>Thus, 127 is a 3-digit divisor of 1397.<br><br>Now, we calculate the sum of the digits of 127:<br><br>\[ 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \]<br><br>Therefore, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 10.<br><br>The answer is {A)10}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>a)10</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> a</div></div>

Then, <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles, painted black, and then put back in</span>.

The area of a square is given by the formula:<br>   \[<br>   \text{Area of square} = \text{side}^2 = 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ cm}^2<br>   \]<br><br>2. **Calculate the area of one semicircle:**<br>   The diameter of each semicircle is the same as the side of the square, which is 20 cm. Therefore, the radius \( r \) of each semicircle is:<br>   \[<br>   r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ cm}<br>   \]<br>   The area of a full circle is given by \(\pi r^2\). Therefore, the area of one semicircle is:<br>   \[<br>   \text{Area of one semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (10)^2 = 50\pi \text{ cm}^2<br>   \]<br><br>3. **Calculate the total area of the two semicircles:**<br>   Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is:<br>   \[<br>   \text{Total area of semicircles} = 2 \times 50\pi = 100\pi \text{ cm}^2<br>   \]<br><br>4. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**<br>   Subtract the total area of the semicircles from the area of the square:<br>   \[<br>   \text{Area of remaining paper} = 400 - 100\pi<br>   \]<br><br>5. **Approximate the value of \(\pi\) to calculate the numerical answer:**<br>   Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\), we find:<br>   \[<br>   100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314 \text{ cm}^2<br>   \]<br>   Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is:<br>   \[<br>   400 - 314 = 86 \text{ cm}^2<br>   \]<br><br>However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the options provided, as they are not close to 86 cm². Let's re-evaluate the options and calculations:<br><br>Upon reviewing the options, it seems there might be a mistake in the options provided, as they are not close to the calculated area of 86 cm².

We know that <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">minor arc AC is 160°</span>. This means the total angle from point A to point C along the circle is 160°.<br><br>2. We are also given that <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">B bisects minor arc AC</span>. This means that point B divides arc AC into two equal parts. Therefore, each part is 160°/2 = 80°.<br><br>3. Since B bisects arc AC, we have arc AB = 80° and arc BC = 80°.<br><br>4.

This means the total angle from point B to point D along the circle is 150°.<br><br>5. To find the measure of minor arc AD, we need to add the measures of arcs AB and BD. Since arc AB is 80° and arc BD is 150°, the measure of arc AD is 80° + 150° = 230°.<br><br>However, since the options provided do not include 230°, we need to reconsider the circle's total angle, which is 360°. The measure of minor arc AD should be the remaining part of the circle after subtracting the known arcs.<br><br>6. The total circle is 360°, and we have:<br>   - Arc AC = 160°<br>   - Arc BD = 150°<br><br>7. The remaining arc, which is arc AD, is calculated as:<br>   360° - (arc AC + arc BD) = 360° - (160° + 150°) = 360° - 310° = 50°.<br><br>8.

This means that the 70% of the matches they played were won.<br><br>Let the total number of matches be \( x \).<br><br>Since they won 70% of their matches, we have:<br>\[ 0.7x = 20 \]<br><br>Step 2: Solve for \( x \).<br>\[ x = \frac{20}{0.7} \]<br>\[ x = \frac{200}{7} \]<br>\[ x \approx 28.57 \]<br><br>Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round 28.57 to the nearest whole number, which is 29.<br><br>Step 3: Calculate the number of matches lost.<br>If the total number of matches is 29, and they won 20 matches, then the number of matches they lost is:<br>\[ 29 - 20 = 9 \]<br><br>However, this does not match any of the answer options. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:<br><br>Step 4: Re-evaluate the percentage calculation.<br>If they lost 30% of their matches, then the number of matches lost is 30% of the total matches played.<br><br>Let \( y \) be the number of matches lost. Then:<br>\[ y = 0.3x \]<br><br>Since \( x = 29 \) (rounded from 28.57), we calculate:<br>\[ y = 0.3 \times 29 \]<br>\[ y = 8.7 \]<br><br>Rounding 8.7 to the nearest whole number gives us 9, which still does not match any of the answer options.

Let \( x \) be the total number of students in the school. We know that:<br>   - <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">There are more than 501 students</span>, so \( x > 501 \).<br><br>2. According to the problem:<br>   - <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">20% of them exactly took physics</span>, which means \( 0.2x \) students took physics.<br>   - <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">28% of them exactly took math</span>, which means \( 0.28x \) students took math.<br><br>3. We need to find the smallest integer \( x \) that satisfies these conditions and is more than 501.<br><br>4. Since the number of students must be a whole number, both \( 0.2x \) and \( 0.28x \) must also be whole numbers. This implies that \( x \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of 0.2 and 0.28, which are 5 and 25, respectively.<br><br>5. The LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, \( x \) must be a multiple of 25.<br><br>6. The smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501 is 525.<br><br>7. Checking the options, 525 is not listed, so we need to find the next multiple of 25 that is greater than 501 and matches one of the options.<br><br>8. The next multiple of 25 after 525 is 550, which is option A.<br><br>Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 550.

From <fact1>, we know that six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls. This can be expressed as:<br>   \[<br>   6 \text{ pita breads} = 2 \text{ rolls}<br>   \]<br>   Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as 3 pita breads.<br><br>2. From <fact2>, we know that three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. This can be expressed as:<br>   \[<br>   3 \text{ rolls} = 5 \text{ baguettes}<br>   \]<br>   Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as \(\frac{5}{3}\) baguettes.<br><br>3. We need to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. Let's first express the amount of falafel in one baguette in terms of rolls:<br>   \[<br>   1 \text{ baguette} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ rolls}<br>   \]<br>   Therefore, 2 baguettes contain:<br>   \[<br>   2 \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{6}{5} \text{ rolls}<br>   \]<br><br>4. Now, we convert the amount of falafel in \(\frac{6}{5}\) rolls to pita breads using the relationship from step 1:<br>   \[<br>   1 \text{ roll} = 3 \text{ pita breads}<br>   \]<br>   Therefore, \(\frac{6}{5}\) rolls contain:<br>   \[<br>   \frac{6}{5} \times 3 = \frac{18}{5} = 3.6 \text{ pita breads}<br>   \]<br><br>Thus, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads.

This means:<br>   - Sand = 30% of 10 kg = 3 kg<br>   - Clay = 70% of 10 kg = 7 kg<br><br>2. **Desired Composition**:  <br>   We want the mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, as stated in <fact2>. This means we need 5 kg of sand and 5 kg of clay in the final mixture.<br><br>3. **Adjusting the Mixture**:  <br>   To achieve this, we need to remove some of the current mixture and replace it with pure sand. Let \( x \) be the amount of the mixture we remove and replace with pure sand.<br><br>4. **Equation Setup**:  <br>   After removing \( x \) kg of the mixture, the remaining mixture will be \( 10 - x \) kg. The sand and clay in the remaining mixture will be:<br>   - Sand: \( 0.3(10 - x) \) kg<br>   - Clay: \( 0.7(10 - x) \) kg<br><br>   We replace \( x \) kg of the mixture with \( x \) kg of pure sand. Therefore, the total sand becomes:<br>   \[<br>   0.3(10 - x) + x = 5<br>   \]<br>   And the total clay becomes:<br>   \[<br>   0.7(10 - x) = 5<br>   \]<br><br>5. **Solving the Equations**:  <br>   From the clay equation:<br>   \[<br>   0.7(10 - x) = 5 \\<br>   7 - 0.7x = 5 \\<br>   0.7x = 2 \\<br>   x = \frac{2}{0.7} = \frac{20}{7}<br>   \]<br><br>   Therefore, the amount of the mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand is \(\frac{20}{7}\) kg.<br><br>The correct answer is {B)20/7}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>b)20/7</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> b</div></div>

The perimeter of the folded part is \( 2(\frac{l}{2} + w) = 48 \).<br>  Simplifying, we get:<br>  \[<br>  l + 2w = 48<br>  \]<br><br>- When folded along the width, the length remains the same, but the width is halved.
