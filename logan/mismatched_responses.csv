On 12 April 1925, an estimated 8,000 Rifians attacked this line and in two weeks <fact2>over 40 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned</fact2>.

Final French deaths from battle and disease, in what had now become a major war, were to total 8,628. How many French out-posts were still there?

Answer: According to the passage, there were originally <fact1>66 French posts</fact1>, and <fact2>over 40 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned</fact2>. To find the number of posts still there, we need to subtract the number of posts stormed or abandoned from the total number of posts. Since we are given a range (""over 40""), we can calculate the minimum number of posts still there by subtracting 40 from 66 and get 26. So the answer is {26}.",25.0

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000âlarger than the one facing the Japaneseâhad to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.

In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000âlarger than the one facing the Japaneseâhad to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the <fact3>Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3>. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time. How many revolutions did Russia suffer in the early 20th century?

Answer: According to the passage, there were <fact1>the Russian Revolution of 1905</fact1> and <fact2>the February Revolution of 1917</fact2>, which is also referred to as <fact3>the Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3>. However, <fact2>the February Revolution of 1917</fact2> and <fact3>the Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3> are the same event. Therefore, there were 2 revolutions in total. So the answer is {2}.",3.0

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison.

When they arrived on 7 December 1688 the gates were closed against them and the Siege of Derry began. While the Jacobites appeared to have great advantages in terms of numbers in Ireland, in fact, the troops raised by Tyrconnell were mainly hastily conscripted peasant bands, most of them poorly armed and trained.

The <fact1>average household size was 2.20</fact1> and the <fact2>average family size was 2.90</fact2>. How many percent higher was the average family size compared to the average household size?

Answer: According to the passage, the <fact2>average family size was 2.90</fact2> and the <fact1>average household size was 2.20</fact1>. To find the percentage difference, we need to calculate ((<fact2>2.90</fact2> - <fact1>2.20</fact1>) / <fact1>2.20</fact1>) * 100. ((<fact2>2.90</fact2> - <fact1>2.20</fact1>) = 0.70, 0.70 / <fact1>2.20</fact1> = 0.31818, 0.31818 * 100 = 31.818). So the answer is {31.82}.",0.0

Captain DÃ­az de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars CristÃ³bal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on DÃ­az's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima.

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as kicker <fact1>Taylor Mehlhaff got a 23-yard field goal</fact1>.  The 'Bolts would respond with kicker <fact2>Nate Kaeding getting a 33-yard field goal</fact2>.  In the second quarter, New Orleans regained the lead as QB Drew Brees (a former Charger) completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson (with a failed PAT) and RB Deuce McAllister getting a 1-yard TD run.  San Diego answered as QB Philip Rivers completed a 12-yard TD pass to RB LaDainian Tomlinson, but the Saints replied with Brees completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Lance Moore.  The Chargers closed out the half with Rivers completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates. In the third quarter, New Orleans increased its lead Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Mark Campbell, after a very controversial Pass interference call on cornerback Cletis Gordon put the Saints on the 1-yard line.

Answer: According to the passage, the poverty line is defined as being <fact1>60% of the median household income</fact1>. To find the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line, we need to find the percentage that is just above 60%. Since the question asks for the percentage points out of 100, we can conclude that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is 61%. However, the passage does not explicitly state this. But we can infer that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is anything above <fact1>60%</fact1>. So the answer is {61}.",60.0

Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives <fact1>2.307 million members in 1939</fact1>, including candidate members, compared with <fact2>1.535 million in 1929</fact2> and <fact3>6.3 million in 1947</fact3>. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million membersâapproximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly. How many more members did the party have in 1947 compared to 1929?

Answer: According to the passage, <fact3>the party had 6.3 million members in 1947</fact3> and <fact2>1.535 million in 1929</fact2>. <fact3>6.3 million</fact3> - <fact2>1.535 million</fact2> = 4.765 million. So the answer is {4765000}.",2800000.0
