How many French out-posts were still there?","Reformatted Question: In May 1924, the French Army had established a line of <fact1>out-posts north of the Oureghla River</fact1> in disputed tribal territory. On 12 April 1925, an estimated 8,000 Rifians attacked this line and in two weeks <fact2>over 40 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned</fact2>. French casualties exceeded 1,000 killed, 3,700 wounded and 1,000 missing - representing losses of over 20 percent of their forces deployed in the Rif. The French accordingly intervened on the side of Spain, employing up to 160,000 well trained and equipped troops from Metropolitan, Algerian, Senegalese and Foreign Legion units, as well as Moroccan regulars  and auxiliaries . With total Spanish forces now numbering about 90,000 the Rifian forces were now seriously outnumbered by their Franco-Spanish opponents. Final French deaths from battle and disease, in what had now become a major war, were to total 8,628. How many French out-posts were still there?

Answer: According to the passage, there were originally <fact1>66 French posts</fact1>, and <fact2>over 40 of 66 French posts had been stormed or abandoned</fact2>. To find the number of posts still there, we need to subtract the number of posts stormed or abandoned from the total number of posts. Since we are given a range (""over 40""), we can calculate the minimum number of posts still there by subtracting 40 from 66 and get 26. So the answer is {26}.",25.0

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917.

However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the <fact3>Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3>. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time. How many revolutions did Russia suffer in the early 20th century?

Answer: According to the passage, there were <fact1>the Russian Revolution of 1905</fact1> and <fact2>the February Revolution of 1917</fact2>, which is also referred to as <fact3>the Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3>. However, <fact2>the February Revolution of 1917</fact2> and <fact3>the Russian Revolution of 1917</fact3> are the same event. Therefore, there were 2 revolutions in total. So the answer is {2}.",3.0

The northern province of Ulster, which had the heaviest concentration of English and Scottish settlers, was the only part of Ireland where Talbot encountered significant resistance. An attempted rising by the Protestant inhabitants of Bandon in County Cork was quickly defeated by Jacobite forces. By November 1688, only the walled city of Derry had a Protestant garrison.

Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. <fact2>They set out from Mopán on 7 March</fact2> and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many days after Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán did they set out from Mopán leaving sick soldiers behind?

Answer: According to the passage, <fact1>Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696</fact1>, and <fact2>they set out from Mopán on 7 March</fact2>. The difference between <fact2>7 March</fact2> and <fact1>25 February</fact1> is 11 days. So the answer is {11}.",10.0

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima.

Answer: According to the passage, the poverty line is defined as being <fact1>60% of the median household income</fact1>. To find the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line, we need to find the percentage that is just above 60%. Since the question asks for the percentage points out of 100, we can conclude that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is 61%. However, the passage does not explicitly state this. But we can infer that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is anything above <fact1>60%</fact1>. So the answer is {61}.",60.0

Gross domestic product was nowhere near its 1991 level, but the Kosovo War of the basic infrastructure of the country and many factories, as well as a renewed embargo caused a further huge drop in GDP in relation to the 1991 level. The first sign of an economic recovery occurred in 2001 after the removal of Milošević on 5 October 2000.

The two republics initially formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992. The economics of Serbia and Montenegro entered a <fact1>prolonged decline in 1989</fact1>. Exacerbated by the economic embargo imposed during the Bosnian war, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) economy's downward spiral showed no real sign of recovery until 1995. Gross domestic product was nowhere near its 1991 level, but the Kosovo War of the basic infrastructure of the country and many factories, as well as a renewed embargo caused a further huge drop in GDP in relation to the 1991 level. The <fact2>first sign of an economic recovery occurred in 2001</fact2> after the removal of Milošević on 5 October 2000.  A vigorous team of economic reformers has worked to tame inflation (non-energy inflation is less than 9% in 2002, down from over 120% two years earlier) and rationalize the Serbia and Montenegro economy.
