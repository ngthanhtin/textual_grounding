He gets <key_fact5>charged $2 per mile driven</key_fact5> and he also gives his driver a <key_fact6>$150 bonus per month</key_fact6>. How much does he pay a year for driving?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate both the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonuses.<br><br>1. **Calculate the total miles driven per week:**<br>   - <key_fact1>His work is 30 miles away</key_fact1>, so he travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day.<br>   - Therefore, he drives 30 * 2 = 60 miles per day.<br>   - <key_fact3>He goes to work 5 days a week</key_fact3>, so he drives 60 * 5 = 300 miles per week.<br><br>2. **Calculate the total miles driven per year:**<br>   - <key_fact4>He works for 50 weeks a year</key_fact4>, so he drives 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles per year.<br><br>3. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**<br>   - <key_fact5>He gets charged $2 per mile driven</key_fact5>, so the cost for the miles is 15,000 * 2 = $30,000 per year.<br><br>4. **Calculate the total bonus paid per year:**<br>   - <key_fact6>He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month</key_fact6>.<br>   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is 150 * 12 = $1,800 per year.<br><br>5. **Calculate the total cost per year:**<br>   - Add the cost of the miles and the bonuses: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.<br><br>Therefore, John pays a total of {31,800} per year for driving.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>31800</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 31800</div></div>

If <key_fact3>Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls</key_fact3>, what is the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total number of basketballs, we need to calculate how many balls each of the three boys carried based on the given key facts.<br><br>1. We know from <key_fact3>Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls</key_fact3>.<br><br>2. According to <key_fact2>Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey</key_fact2>, this means Jeffrey carried half the number of balls Jason did. Therefore, Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball.<br><br>3. From <key_fact1>Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason</key_fact1>, this means Jordan carried 2 times the number of balls Jason did. Therefore, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.<br><br>4. Now, we add up the number of balls each boy carried: Jordan carried 4 balls, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jeffrey carried 1 ball.<br><br>5. The total number of balls is 4 (Jordan) + 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey) = 7 balls.<br><br>Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is {7}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>7</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 7</div></div>

Rounding $2.74 to the nearest dollar gives us $3.<br>   - <key_fact2>Petunias are usually sold for $1.87 per pot</key_fact2>. Rounding $1.87 to the nearest dollar gives us $2.<br>   - <key_fact3>Begonias are usually sold for $2.12 per pot</key_fact3>. Rounding $2.12 to the nearest dollar gives us $2.<br><br>2. **Calculating Revenue:**<br>   - For marigolds: Artie sells <key_fact5>12 pots of marigolds</key_fact5> at $3 per pot. So, the revenue from marigolds is 12 * $3 = $36.<br>   - For petunias: Artie sells <key_fact6>9 pots of petunias</key_fact6> at $2 per pot. So, the revenue from petunias is 9 * $2 = $18.<br>   - For begonias: Artie sells <key_fact7>17 pots of begonias</key_fact7> at $2 per pot. So, the revenue from begonias is 17 * $2 = $34.<br><br>3. **Total Revenue:**<br>   - Adding up the revenue from all the flowers: $36 (marigolds) + $18 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $88.<br><br>Therefore, Artie will make a total of {88} dollars.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>88</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 88</div></div>

Therefore, in a <key_fact4>10-hour shift</key_fact4>, these two workers produce:<br>     \[<br>     2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}<br>     \]<br><br>3. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:**<br>   - Total toys produced by the first four workers:<br>     \[<br>     120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}<br>     \]<br><br>4. **Determine the number of toys still needed:**<br>   - By the end of their shift, the manufacturer <key_fact5>still needs another 20 toys</key_fact5> to be able to ship the order. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers is:<br>     \[<br>     400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}<br>     \]<br><br>5. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**<br>   - The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:<br>     \[<br>     380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}<br>     \]<br><br>6. **Calculate the number of toys per hour the fifth worker produces:**<br>   - Since the fifth worker worked a <key_fact4>10-hour shift</key_fact4>, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:<br>     \[<br>     \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}<br>     \]<br><br>Therefore, the fifth worker produces {18} toys per hour.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>18</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 18</div></div>

The <key_fact2>second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size</key_fact2>. Therefore, the second player consumed 8 ounces of meat.<br><br>3. The <key_fact3>third player ate a one-pound steak</key_fact3>. Since one pound is equivalent to 16 ounces, the third player consumed 16 ounces of meat.<br><br>The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.<br><br>Now, we add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players:<br>6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.<br><br>Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is {30}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>30</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 30</div></div>

On average, how many branches did he climb per day?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to use the key facts provided:<br><br>1. <key_fact1>Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25</key_fact1>.<br>2. <key_fact2>During the week he made $105</key_fact2>.<br><br>First, we calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week. Since each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:<br><br>Total branches climbed = Total money earned / Cost per branch<br>= <key_fact2>$105</key_fact2> / <key_fact1>$0.25</key_fact1><br>= 420 branches<br><br>Next, we calculate the average number of branches climbed per day.

"Well over 4 hours" suggests a time significantly greater than 4 hours more than Amalia's time. If we assume "well over" means at least 5 hours more, then Dior took at least 4 + 5 = 9 hours to do the laundry.<br><br>Now, we sum the times for all three:<br><br>- Amalia: 4 hours<br>- Megan: 6 hours<br>- Dior: 9 hours<br><br>Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours.<br><br>Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is {19}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>19</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 18</div></div>

How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the petals for each type of flower Rose picked and then account for the flowers she dropped.<br><br>1. **Initial Petal Count:**<br>   - Rose picks <key_fact1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</key_fact1>. This gives her 3 * 5 = 15 petals.<br>   - She then picks <key_fact2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</key_fact2>.
