First, we identify the total cost of the trip: <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">the trip costs $300</span>.<br><br>2. The school has decided to cover half of the cost: <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">the school covers half the cost of the trip</span>. Therefore, the school's contribution is $300 / 2 = $150.<br><br>3. John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost. So, he needs to raise $300 - $150 = $150.<br><br>4. John already has $50: <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">he has $50</span>.<br><br>5. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he already has from the amount he needs to raise: $150 - $50 = $100.<br><br>Therefore, John is missing {100} dollars.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>100</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 100</div></div>

How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we need to calculate the number of badges each person earns in a year.<br><br>1. **Claire's Badge Earning Rate:**<br>   - According to <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</span>, Claire earns 1 badge per month.<br>   - In a year (12 months), Claire earns 12 badges.<br><br>2. **Amber's Badge Earning Rate:**<br>   - <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</span>. This means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months.<br>   - In a year (12 months), Amber earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.<br><br>3. **Wendy's Badge Earning Rate:**<br>   - <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</span>. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.<br><br>4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**<br>   - Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges in a year.<br>   - The difference is 36 - 6 = 30 badges.<br><br>Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.

What are their combined weights in pounds?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate each of their weights and then add them together.<br><br>1. We know from <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Grace weighs 125 pounds</span> that Grace's weight is 125 pounds.<br><br>2. According to <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs</span>, we need to calculate Alex's weight. First, we find 4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds. Then, we subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.<br><br>3. Now, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find their combined weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.<br><br>Therefore, their combined weights in pounds is {623}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>623</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 623</div></div>

At one point, he spent <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">5 hours each for two consecutive weeks</span>. Another time, he spent <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">6 hours in one week</span>. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to consider the information provided in the tags:<br><br>1. Josh spent <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4 hours working out every week</span> except on some occasions. This means that for the weeks not specified as exceptions, he worked out for 4 hours each.<br><br>2. There were <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each</span>. This accounts for 2 weeks where he worked out for 5 hours instead of 4.<br><br>3. There was <span class="important3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">one week where he spent 6 hours</span> working out.<br><br>Let's calculate the total hours:<br><br>- For the weeks where he worked out 4 hours: Since there are 8 weeks in total and 3 weeks are specified as exceptions (2 weeks at 5 hours and 1 week at 6 hours), there are 8 - 3 = 5 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each. So, 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.<br><br>- For the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each: 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.<br><br>- For the one week where he worked out 6 hours: 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours.<br><br>Adding these together gives the total number of hours:<br><br>20 hours (from the 4-hour weeks) + 10 hours (from the 5-hour weeks) + 6 hours (from the 6-hour week) = 36 hours.<br><br>Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is {36}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>36</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 36</div></div>

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To find out how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the tags.<br><br>Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).<br><br>According to <important1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).<br><br>According to <important2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).<br><br>According to <important3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:<br><br>\[<br>(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>\]<br><br>Simplifying the equation:<br><br>\[<br>2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>\]<br><br>Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:<br><br>\[<br>4x + 8 + x = 38<br>\]<br><br>Combine like terms:<br><br>\[<br>5x + 8 = 38<br>\]<br><br>Subtract 8 from both sides:<br><br>\[<br>5x = 30<br>\]<br><br>Divide by 5:<br><br>\[<br>x = 6<br>\]<br><br>Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:<br><br>\[<br>x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10<br>\]<br><br>Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

This means that without the lace trim, the dress would be 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.<br><br>3. **Considering the extension**: Shania made the dress <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">longer by extending the dress by 50% of its original length</span>.

Therefore, each stall receives:<br>\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]<br><br>Step 4: Calculate the total number of cows in each stall after the distribution.<br>Each stall initially had 20 cows, and now each receives 2 additional cows, so each stall now has:<br>\[ 20 \text{ initial cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]<br><br>Step 5: Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls.<br>Since each stall has 22 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:<br>\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows per stall} = 176 \text{ cows} \]<br><br>Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is {176}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>176</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 192</div></div>

According to <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day</span>. Therefore, in seven days, Sofie will walk:<br><br>\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]<br><br>Next, we use the information from <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian</span>.

How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.<br><br>1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">20 snowballs in an hour</span>. This means he builds 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (since 20 snowballs/hour divided by 4 quarters in an hour equals 5 snowballs per 15 minutes).<br><br>2. **Melting Rate**: <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes</span>.<br><br>3. **Net Gain of Snowballs**: Every 15 minutes, Jay builds 5 snowballs but loses 2 to melting, resulting in a net gain of 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.<br><br>4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs**: To find out how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs, we calculate how many 15-minute intervals are needed to accumulate 60 snowballs at a net gain of 3 snowballs per interval.<br><br>   - 60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.<br><br>5. **Total Time**: 20 intervals of 15 minutes each equals 300 minutes.<br><br>Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

How many Pokemon has Stan caught?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon Stan has caught using the information provided in the tags.<br><br>1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \( A \).<br><br>2. According to <important3>, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught can be expressed as:<br>   \[<br>   S = 4A - 13<br>   \]<br><br>3. According to <important2>, Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Alex has caught can be expressed as:<br>   \[<br>   X = S + 5<br>   \]<br><br>4. According to <important1>, together they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:<br>   \[<br>   A + S + X = 339<br>   \]<br><br>5.

Since <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">he has 3 cows</span>, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we can follow these steps:<br><br>1. Calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the farmer's cows:<br>   - The farmer extracts <span class="important1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">5 liters of milk a day from a cow</span>.<br>   - He has <span class="important2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">3 cows</span>.<br>   - Therefore, the total milk produced by the current cows is 5 liters/cow/day * 3 cows = 15 liters/day.<br><br>2. Determine the additional milk needed to reach the target of 25 liters/day:<br>   - The target is 25 liters/day.<br>   - The current production is 15 liters/day.<br>   - Therefore, the additional milk needed is 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day.<br><br>3.
