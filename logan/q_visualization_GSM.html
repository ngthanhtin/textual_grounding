To determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, we need to know the number of widgets each person completed and the time they worked. The key facts are:
1. Sam's rate of assembling widgets.
2. Jack's rate of assembling widgets when helping.
3. The total number of widgets completed by Sam and Jack.
4. The total number of widgets completed by all three.
5. The time Tony worked and the number of widgets he completed.

Question: Sam works at the Widget Factory, assembling Widgets. He can assemble <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">1 widget every 10 minutes</span>. Jack from the loading dock can help assemble widgets when he doesn't have anything else to do. When he helps, they put together <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">2 complete widgets every 15 minutes</span>. Recently the factory hired Tony to help assemble widgets. Being new to the job, he doesn't work as fast as Sam or Jack. Yesterday Sam worked for <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">6 hours</span> before he had to leave work early for a dentist appointment. Jack was able to help out for <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">4 hours</span> before he had to go back to the loading dock to unload a new shipment of widget materials. Tony worked the entire <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">8-hour shift</span>. At the end of the day, they had completed <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">68 widgets</span>. How long does it take Tony to assemble a Widget, in minutes?

Answer: Sam completes a widget every <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 minutes</span>. 
When Jack helps they finish <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">2 in 15 minutes</span>. Sam has finished 1 widget and has begun working on another one, and Jack finishes the second one at 15 minutes. So it takes Jack 15 minutes to complete a widget.
Sam worked for <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">6 hours</span> yesterday, so he was able to complete 6 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 10 minutes per widget = 36 widgets.
Jack worked for <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">4 hours</span>, so he was able to complete 4 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 15 minutes per widget = 16 widgets.
Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">68 widgets</span> together. So of those, Tony personally completed 68 widgets - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets.
It took Tony <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">8 hours</span> to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = 8*60/16=30 minutes per widget.

<span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">Jack worked for 4 hours</span>, so he was able to complete <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">4 hours</span> * 60 minutes per hour / <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15 minutes per widget</span> = 16 widgets.
Sam, Jack, and Tony were able to complete <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">68 widgets</span> together. So of those, Tony personally completed <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">68 widgets</span> - 36 widgets - 16 widgets = 16 widgets.
<span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">It took Tony 8 hours</span> to complete those 16 widgets, so he takes <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">8 hours</span> * 60 minutes per hour / 16 widgets = <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">8</span>*60/16=30 minutes per widget.

To determine how much money the family would receive, we need to focus on the conversion rates for cans and newspapers and the quantities collected. The essential facts are:
1. The conversion rate for cans: 12 cans = $0.50.
2. The conversion rate for newspapers: 5 kilograms = $1.50.
3. The number of cans collected: 144.
4. The number of kilograms of newspapers collected: 20.

These facts are necessary to calculate the total amount of money received. The calculations in the answer section directly use these facts to determine the total amount.

To determine the difference in total monthly costs between the two apartments, we need to consider the rent, utility costs, and driving-related costs for each apartment. The key details are the monthly rent and utility costs for both apartments, the distance driven to work from each apartment, the cost per mile driven, and the number of days driven per month. These details are essential to calculate the total monthly costs for each apartment and find the difference.

Question: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">first apartment costs $800 per month in rent</span> and will cost an <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">additional $260 per month in utilities</span>. The <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">second apartment costs $900 per month</span> and will cost an <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">additional $200 per month in utilities</span>. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">31 miles per day</span> to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">21 miles</span> to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">58 cents</span>. If the man must drive to work <span class="fact8" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">20 days each month</span>, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)?

Answer: The mileage cost for the first apartment will be <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">31</span>*<span class="fact8" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">20</span>*<span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">0.58</span> = $359.60
This makes the total monthly cost of the first apartment 359.60 + <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">800</span> + <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">260</span> = $1419.60
Similarly, the mileage cost for the second apartment will be <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">21</span>*<span class="fact8" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">20</span>*<span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">0.58</span> = $243.60
Thus, the total monthly cost of the second apartment is 243.60 + <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">900</span> + <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">200</span> = 1343.60
Therefore, the difference in total monthly costs is 1419.60 - 1343.60 = $76

In total, how many times did Sarah and Ellie see their reflections?

Answer: In the rooms with tall mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 reflections</span> * <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">3 passes</span> = 30 times.
In the rooms with wide mirrors, Sarah saw her reflection a total of <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">5 reflections</span> * <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">5 passes</span> = 25 reflections.
So Sarah saw her reflection a total of 30 + 25 = 55 times.
In the rooms with tall mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">6 reflections</span> * <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">3 passes</span> = 18 times.
In the rooms with wide mirrors, Ellie saw her reflection a total of <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">3 reflections</span> * <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">5 passes</span> = 15 times.
So Ellie saw her reflection a total of 18 + 15 = 33 times.
Therefore, Sarah and Ellie saw their reflections a total of 55 + 33 = 88 times.

To determine how many fewer peppers the curry house now buys, we need to compare the number of peppers bought previously with the number bought now. The key details involve the number of peppers required for each type of curry and the quantities of each type of curry both before and after the adjustment. Specifically, we need to focus on the number of peppers used for very spicy, spicy, and mild curries both before and after the change. The essential facts are the number of peppers per curry type and the quantities of each type of curry before and after the adjustment.

Question: A curry house sells curries that have varying levels of spice. Recently, a lot of the customers have been ordering very mild curries and the chefs have been having to throw away some wasted ingredients. To reduce cost and food wastage, the curry house starts monitoring how many ingredients are actually being used and changes their spending accordingly. The curry house needs <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">3 peppers for very spicy curries</span>, <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">2 peppers for spicy curries</span>, and <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">only 1 pepper for mild curries</span>. After adjusting their purchasing, the curry house now buys the exact amount of peppers they need. Previously, the curry house was buying enough peppers for <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">30 very spicy curries</span>, <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">30 spicy curries</span>, and <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 mild curries</span>. They now buy enough peppers for <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15 spicy curries</span> and <span class="fact8" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">90 mild curries</span>. They no longer sell very spicy curries. How many fewer peppers does the curry house now buy?

Answer: The curry house previously bought <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">3 peppers per very spicy curry</span> * <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">30 very spicy curries</span> = 90 peppers for very spicy curries.
They also bought <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">2 peppers per spicy curry</span> * <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">30 spicy curries</span> = 60 peppers for spicy curries.
They also bought <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">1 pepper per mild curry</span> * <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 mild curries</span> = 10 peppers for mild curries.
So they were previously buying 90 + 60 + 10 = 160 peppers.
They now buy <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">2 peppers per spicy curry</span> * <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15 spicy curries</span> = 30 peppers for spicy curries.
They also now buy <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">1 pepper per mild curry</span> * <span class="fact8" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">90 mild curries</span> = 90 peppers for mild curries.
So they now buy 30 + 90 = 120 peppers.
This is a difference of 160 peppers bought originally - 120 peppers bought now = 40 peppers.

To determine how far the flag moved up and down the pole, we need to focus on the specific instructions given to Harold throughout the day and the length of the flagpole. The key points are: the flagpole is 60 feet long, Harold initially raises the flag to the top, lowers it to half-mast, raises it back to the top, and finally lowers it completely. These movements are essential to calculate the total distance the flag moved.

Question: At the beginning of the day, Principal Kumar instructed Harold to <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">raise the flag up the flagpole</span>.  The <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">flagpole is 60 feet long</span>, and when fully raised, the flag sits on the very top of the flagpole.  Later that morning, Vice-principal Zizi instructed Harold to <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">lower the flag to half-mast</span>.  So, Harold lowered the flag halfway down the pole.   Later, Principal Kumar told Harold to <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">raise the flag to the top of the pole once again</span>, and Harold did just that.  At the end of the day, Vice-principal Zizi instructed Harold to <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">completely lower the flag</span>, take it off of the pole, and put it away for the evening.  Over the course of the day, how far, in feet, had the flag moved up and down the pole?

Answer: Half of the distance up the flagpole is <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">60/2 = 30 feet</span>.
Thus, Harold moved the flag <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">60 up</span> + <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">30 down</span> + <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">30 up</span> + <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">60 down</span> = 180 feet.

To determine the highest elevation reached by the balloon, we need to focus on the rates of ascent and descent, as well as the duration for which each action was performed. The key details are:
1. The rate of ascent when the lift chain is pulled.
2. The rate of descent when the chain is not pulled.
3. The duration for which the chain was pulled and released during the ride.

These details will allow us to calculate the net elevation change and determine the highest point reached.

Question: Jo-Bob hopped into the hot air balloon, released the anchor rope, and pulled on the lift chain, which ignited the flame and provided the warm air that caused the balloon to rise.  When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">50 feet per minute</span>.  But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 feet per minute</span>.  During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15 minutes</span>, then released the rope for <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 minutes</span>, then pulled the chain for another <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15 minutes</span>, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth.  During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?
Answer: The first <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15-minute</span> chain pull caused the balloon to rise <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">50*15=750 feet</span>.
Releasing the chain for <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 minutes</span> caused the balloon to descend <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10*10=100 feet</span>.
The second <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15-minute</span> chain pull caused the balloon to rise another <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">50*15=750 feet</span>.
Thus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750-100+750=1400 feet above the earth's surface.

During his balloon ride, he <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">pulled the chain for 15 minutes</span>, then <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">released the rope for 10 minutes</span>, then <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">pulled the chain for another 15 minutes</span>, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon?
Answer: The <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">first 15-minute</span> chain pull caused the balloon to rise <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">50</span>*<span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15</span>=750 feet.
Releasing the chain for <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10 minutes</span> caused the balloon to descend <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10</span>*<span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">10</span>=100 feet.
The <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">second 15-minute</span> chain pull caused the balloon to rise another <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">50</span>*<span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">15</span>=750 feet.
Thus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750-100+750=1400 feet above the earth's surface.
The answer is <span class="final-answer">1400</span>.</div></div></div>
