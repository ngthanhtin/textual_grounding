Since the small black circle is in the same block as the medium black square and not above it, this option is not correct.<br><br>- **The object that is touching the bottom edge of a block**: Refers to the medium black triangle in Block B, which is touching the bottom edge of Block B. Since Block B is above Block A, this medium black triangle is above the medium black square in Block A.<br><br>- **Both of them**: This would mean both the small shape and the object touching the bottom edge of a block are above the medium black square, but as reasoned, only the object touching the bottom edge of a block (medium black triangle) is above the medium black square.<br><br>- **None of them**: This would mean neither the small shape nor the object touching the bottom edge of a block is above the medium black square, which is incorrect as reasoned above.<br><br>Therefore, the correct answer is that the object touching the bottom edge of a block (the medium black triangle in Block B) is above the medium black square in Block A.

This means that anything in Block A is to the left of anything in Block B.<br><br>2. <span class="data2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Block A contains a small black circle</span>. This small black circle is in Block A.<br><br>3. <span class="data3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">To the left of the small black circle there is a big black circle</span>.

Block B contains a big blue circle, one small blue circle, and <span class="data4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">a big yellow triangle</span>. The big yellow triangle is in Block B.<br><br>5. <span class="data5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">The big yellow triangle is touching the right edge of this block</span>. This means the big yellow triangle is at the far right of Block B.<br><br>Since the big black circle is in Block A and Block A is to the left of Block B, the small black circle, which is also in Block A, is to the right of the big black circle. The big yellow triangle, being in Block B, is not directly to the right of the big black circle because it is in a different block.<br><br>Therefore, the object directly to the right of the big black circle is the small black circle.<br><br>The answer is {0}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>0</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>
