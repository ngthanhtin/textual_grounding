<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.

In the first year, he buys <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">1 game per month</span>, so he buys 1 x 12 = 12 games. He also receives <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">5 games for Christmas</span>. Therefore, in the first year, he has 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games. In the second year, he buys <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">2 games per month</span>, so he buys 2 x 12 = 24 games. He also receives <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">5 games for Christmas</span>. Therefore, in the second year, he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?</div><div class='full-response'>Reformatted_Question: <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes</span> <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">in preparation for making potato salad</span> <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">for his big family reunion barbecue</span>. <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">It's a big event</span>, <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">so he has 60 potatoes to get through</span>. <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato</span>, <span class="fact7" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">but only about 5 seconds to cut it up</span>. <span class="fact8" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; font-weight: bold;">The potatoes are roughly the same size</span>, <span class="fact9" style="background-color: lightseagreen; font-weight: bold;">so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one</span>. <span class="fact10" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes</span>?<br><br>Answer_Reasoning: Billy has <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">60 potatoes</span> to prepare.

Therefore, it takes him 90 + 5 = 95 seconds to peel and cut one potato. For all 60 potatoes, it will take him 60 x 95 = 5700 seconds. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60, resulting in 5700/60 = 95 minutes.

From <fact4>, John spent 6 hours boating. From <fact5>, he spent half of 6 hours swimming, which is 3 hours. From <fact6> and <fact7>, he watched 3 shows that were 2 hours each, totaling 6 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours. According to <fact3>, these activities account for 30% of his time. Therefore, 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. To find the total time, we calculate 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

Each wall is <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">10 x 8</span> = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet. Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls. Each wall is <span class="fact5" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">5 x 8</span> = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. Since <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</span>, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. The cost for the paint is 12 gallons x <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$12</span> per gallon = $144. Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.<br><br>Final_Answer: {144}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>144</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 144</div></div>

Jack can play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. According to <fact3>, Jack uses 1 quarter for every 20 minutes, so he uses 240/20 = 12 quarters. <br><br>For the two friends who are worse than Jack (<fact4> and <fact5>), they can only play half as long as Jack. Therefore, they play for 240/2 = 120 minutes each. Each of these friends uses 120/20 = 6 quarters. Since there are two friends, they use 6 x 2 = 12 quarters in total.<br><br>The friend who is better than Jack (<fact7> and <fact8>) can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. Therefore, this friend plays for 240 x 1.5 = 360 minutes. This friend uses 360/20 = 18 quarters.<br><br>Adding up all the quarters used: Jack uses 12 quarters, the two worse friends use 12 quarters, and the better friend uses 18 quarters. In total, they use 12 + 12 + 18 = 42 quarters.<br><br>Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is 42 x $0.25 = $10.50.<br><br>Final_Answer: {10.50}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>10.50</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 11</div></div>

From <fact4>, a third of the movies are in series, so 600/3 = 200 movies are in series. This means the remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies. According to <fact3>, 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so 0.4 x 400 = 160 older movies. The cost to replace these older movies is 160 x $5 = $800. The remaining non-series, non-older movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies, and the cost to replace these at the normal price is 240 x $10 = $2400. From <fact5>, the cost to replace the series movies is 200 x $6 = $1200. Therefore, the total cost to replace all the movies is $800 + $2400 + $1200 = $4400.<br><br>Final_Answer: {4400}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>4,400</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 4,400</div></div>

Rose initially picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each, so she has 3 x 5 = 15 petals from these flowers (<fact2>).<br>2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, adding 4 x 6 = 24 petals (<fact3>).<br>3. She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each, contributing 5 x 4 = 20 petals (<fact4>).<br>4. She drops 1 flower from each type she initially picked, which means she loses 1 flower with 5 petals, 1 flower with 6 petals, and 1 flower with 4 petals (<fact5>).<br>   - Petals lost: 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 petals.<br>5. After dropping these flowers, the remaining petals are 15 + 24 + 20 - 15 = 44 petals.<br>6. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, adding 6 x 7 = 42 petals (<fact6>).<br>7.

This is calculated as follows:<br><br>- Probability that the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.50 (probability normal teacher comes in) * 0.60 (probability no class extension) = 0.30.<br>- Probability that Marcus doesn't get a personal extension: 0.80.<br><br>Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 0.30 * 0.80 = 0.24 or 24%.<br><br>Final_Answer: {24}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>24</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 24</div></div>

According to <fact6>, it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit, which costs 2 x <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$6</span> = $12. According to <fact7>, it takes 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, which costs 1.5 x <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">$8</span> = $12. According to <fact8>, it takes 2 pounds of honey, which costs 2 x <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">$10</span> = $20. Therefore, the total cost to make one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44. According to <fact5>, each jar is sold for $50, so the profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6. To find the profit for 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 x 10 = $60. Therefore, the profit from selling 10 jars is $60.<br><br>Final_Answer: {60}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>60</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 60</div></div>

Normally, he has <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">6 periods</span> and <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">2 extra classes</span>, so he attends 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day. Each class is <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">40 minutes long</span>, so he spends 8 x 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Over <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">5 days a week</span>, he spends 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes in class. <br><br>Next, calculate the extra learning time on the weekend. He spends <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">1/16 of his weekly minutes</span> each on Saturday and Sunday. The total weekly minutes spent in class is 1600, so 1/16 of 1600 is 1600/16 = 100 minutes. Therefore, he spends 100 minutes on Saturday and 100 minutes on Sunday, totaling 200 minutes for the weekend.<br><br>Adding the weekday and weekend learning times, John spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning each week.

Since there are six tests and the lowest score is removed, the average is calculated over five tests. Therefore, the total score needed for an average of 93 is 93 x 5 = 465.<br><br>Brinley's current scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71, which will be removed. The sum of the remaining scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.<br><br>To achieve a total of 465, Brinley needs a score on the sixth test such that 367 + sixth score = 465.

According to <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">, 315 bananas are enough for all three monkeys for a week. Therefore, the total number of bananas eaten per day by all monkeys is 315/<fact3>7</span> = 45 bananas. <br><br>The first monkey eats <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">10 bananas each day</span>.

According to <fact3>, 30% of the <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">100 people</span> who apply receive interviews. So, 100 x 0.30 = 30 people receive interviews. Next, determine how many of these people receive a job offer. According to <fact7>, 20% of the <span class="fact6" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">people who receive interviews</span> receive a job offer. So, 30 x 0.20 = 6 people receive a job offer. Finally, calculate how many people accept the position. According to <fact5>, a third of the <span class="fact4" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">people who receive a job offer</span> accept the position. So, 6 x (1/3) = 2 people accept the position.<br><br>Final_Answer: {2}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>

The total number of balls retrieved is given by <fact3> as 19.
