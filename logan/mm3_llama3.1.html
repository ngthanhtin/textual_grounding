<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> We know that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber (D) and half that much white fiber, which is equivalent to 1/2 * 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. To find the total number of bolts required, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>3</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 3</div></div>

</div>
<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> The house was bought for <span class="D" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$80,000</span>. After the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%, which means it became 1.5 times its original price (C). Therefore, the new value is $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000.

To find Josh's profit, we subtract the total amount he spent ($80,000 + $50,000) from the new value:



The total cost is <span class="C" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$130,000</span>. Therefore, Josh's profit is $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.

However, since a negative profit doesn't make sense in this context, there must be some mistake in the given information. Perhaps we should re-evaluate the problem statement to see if we can find any alternative solution.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>0</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 70000</div></div>

</div>
<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Answer Reasoning:
Since James runs 3 times a week (B1), and each time he runs, he does 3 sprints (B2), we can calculate the total number of sprints per week by multiplying 3 times (the number of times he runs) by 3 (the number of sprints per run). This gives us 9 sprints per week.

Now, to find out how many meters James runs in a week, we multiply the number of meters he runs per sprint (C1) by the total number of sprints per week. Since he runs 60 meters each sprint (C1), and there are 9 sprints per week, we can calculate that James runs 540 meters per week.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>540</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 540</div></div>

</div>
<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is <span class="E" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">15</span> + <span class="F" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">25</span> = 40 cups of feed. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per meal, the chickens have been fed a total of <span class="G" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">20 * 3 * 2</span> = 120 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon meals combined (there are 2 meals). Since we want to find out how many cups Wendi needs for the final meal of the day, we should subtract from this amount. The number of cups Wendi needs for the final meal is <span class="D" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">120 - 40</span> = 80 cups of feed.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>80</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 20</div></div>
