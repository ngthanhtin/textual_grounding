<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> There are <span class="B2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">3 other bidders</span> who each make one bid before <span class="C3" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">Carmen wins</span>.  Since <span class="C2" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">Carmen bids after each of them</span>, this means she makes 3 bids. Including her acceptance of the <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">opening bid of $200</span>, she makes a total of 4 bids. Because the bids rise by <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$50 each time</span>, her winning bid will be $200 + (3 * $50) = $350.

It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Billy has to prepare <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">60 potatoes</span>.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> James bought <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">10</span> CDs at a discounted price.  Let's calculate the price he paid per CD:  <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">$15</span> x (<span class="C2" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">40</span>/100) = $6 discount, meaning he paid $15 - $6 = $9 per CD.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Boris produces <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">50,000</span> bars a month.  We know the production for weeks 1, 2, and 3. To find the amount produced in week 4, we can subtract the production of weeks 1-3 from the total monthly production.
We need to figure out the production for weeks 2 and 3 first.
<span class="C2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">Week 2 production is half that of week 1</span>, which is <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">8,000</span>/2 = 4,000 bars.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Bob started with <span class="B3" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4</span> white fish. After buying his new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let 'W' be the number of white fish Bob bought. After the purchase, he has <span class="B3" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4</span> + W white fish and 2 * (<span class="B3" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">4</span> + W) orange fish.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Frankie watched a total of <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">7 hours</span> of TV.  That is equivalent to 7 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 420 minutes. He watched two 1-hour shows on Friday, which is equivalent to 2 shows * 60 minutes/show = 120 minutes. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, totaling 2 shows * 60 minutes/show = 120 minutes. On Thursday, he watched one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute episode, totaling 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes. Therefore, Frankie watched 420 minutes - 120 minutes - 120 minutes - 90 minutes = 90 minutes of TV on Wednesday.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> First, figure out how long it takes each person to get home.  <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Steve lives 3 miles</span> away, which is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Angela needs to install <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">6 mirrors</span> and the package only includes <B2a> 4 mirrors</B2a>, so she needs <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">6</span> - <B2a>4</B2a> = 2 extra mirrors installed.
She also needs to install <span class="C2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">2 chandeliers</span> while the package only includes <B2c>1 chandelier</B2c>, meaning she needs <span class="C2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">2</span> - <B2c>1</B2c> = 1 more chandelier installed. 
Lastly the package includes <B2d>10 pictures</B2d> but she needs <span class="C3" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">20 pictures</span> installed so that's  <span class="C3" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">20</span> - <B2d>10</B2d> = 10 extra pictures.
In total she needs 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items installed.
The additional items cost <span class="D1" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">$15.00 per item</span>, so 13 items will cost $15.00 x 13 = $195.00
Therefore, the total cost will be <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$129.00</span> + $195.00 = $324.00</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>324</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 324</div></div>

</div>
<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Let's break down the problem.  We know from <span class="B" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Total Balls <B1>19</B1></span> that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total.  Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'.  <span class="C" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">In the third set <C1>he retrieved half as many as in the second set</C1></span>, which means he retrieved x/2 balls in the third set.  <span class="D" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">In the first set, <D1>Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set</D1></span>, meaning he retrieved x + 4 balls in the first set. 

Therefore the total number of balls retrieved can be represented as: x + 4 + x + x/2 = 19. Combining like terms, we get 2.5x + 4 = 19. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 2.5x = 15. Dividing both sides by 2.5 gives us x = 6.  Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Since the first set had 4 more balls than the second, he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>10</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 10</div></div>

</div>
<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> The hotel costs <span class="B2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">20%</span> more than normal, so each night costs 1 + 0.2 = 1.2 times the normal price. So, each night costs $<span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">1500</span> * 1.2 = $1800. The total cost of the hotel for <span class="D1" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">3 days</span> was $1800 * 3 = $5400.  The plane tickets cost $<span class="C1" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">5000</span> for each of them so the total cost is 2 * $5000 = $10000.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> There were <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">5 bicycles</span> that needed 2 tires inflated each, so that's 5*2 = 10 bicycle tires. There were <span class="B2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">3 tricycles</span> that needed 3 tires inflated each, so that's 3*3 = 9 tricycle tires. Lastly, there was <span class="B3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">1 unicycle</span> that needed its 1 tire inflated. In total there were 10+9+1= 20 tires that needed to be inflated.  Since each tire costs <span class="D1" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">25 cents</span> to inflate, Shawnda made 20*.25= $5.00.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>5</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 5</div></div>
