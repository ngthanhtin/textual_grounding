Which object is below a blue thing? medium yellow square number two or the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block?
0: medium yellow square  number two
1: the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2: both of them
3: none of them</div><div class='full-response'>To solve this problem, let's analyze the positions of the blocks and the squares within them:<br><br>1. **Block A**: <br>   - Contains one medium blue square.<br>   - Is above Block B and Block C.<br><br>2. **Block B**: <br>   - Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium black square.<br>   - Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block B.<br>   - Medium yellow square number two and the medium black square are above medium yellow square number one.<br>   - The medium black square is below medium yellow square number two.<br><br>3. **Block C**: <br>   - Contains a medium black square.<br>   - Is below Block A.<br><br>Now, let's determine which object is below a blue thing:<br><br>- The medium blue square is in Block A.<br>- Block B is below Block A, so all objects in Block B are below the medium blue square in Block A.<br>- Medium yellow square number two is in Block B, so it is below the medium blue square in Block A.<br>- The shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block B is medium yellow square number one. Since Block B is below Block A, medium yellow square number one is also below the medium blue square in Block A.<br><br>Therefore, both medium yellow square number two and the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium yellow square number one) are below the medium blue square in Block A.<br><br>Final answer: {2}</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>
