He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Reformulated Question:</strong> Jim spends <a style="background-color: yellow;">2 hours watching TV</a> and then decides to go to bed and <b style="background-color: lightblue;">reads for half as long</b>. He does this <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">3 times a week</c>. How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">4 weeks</d>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Each time Jim watches TV, he spends <a style="background-color: yellow;">2 hours</a>. He reads for half as long, which is <a style="background-color: yellow;">2 hours</a> * <b style="background-color: lightblue;">1/2</b> = 1 hour. So, each time, he spends 2 hours on TV and 1 hour reading, totaling 3 hours per session. He does this <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">3 times a week</c>, so in one week he spends 3 hours/session * 3 sessions = 9 hours. Over <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">4 weeks</d>, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours. The answer is 36.</div></div>
