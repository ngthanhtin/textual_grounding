How many kids are there in Soda?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Reformulated Question:</strong> In the city of Soda, there are exactly <a style="background-color: yellow;">23786 inhabitants</a>. They include <b style="background-color: lightblue;">8417 men</b> and <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">9092 women</c>. The rest of the population is made up of children. How many kids are there in Soda?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The total number of inhabitants is <a style="background-color: yellow;">23786</a>. The total number of adults is the sum of <b style="background-color: lightblue;">8417 men</b> and <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">9092 women</c>, which is 8417 + 9092 = 17509 adults. Therefore, the number of children is the total inhabitants minus the adults: <a style="background-color: yellow;">23786</a> - 17509 = **6277 kids**. The answer is **6277**.</div></div>
