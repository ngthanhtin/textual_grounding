    <div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Question: Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes. It took him twice as long to finish the second part. If he was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Reformulated Question:</strong> Leo's assignment was divided into three parts. He finished the <a style="background-color: yellow;">first part of his assignment in 25 minutes</a>. It took him <b style="background-color: lightblue;">twice as long to finish the second part</b>. If he was able to finish his assignment in <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">2 hours</c>, how many minutes did Leo finish the third part of the assignment?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>First, convert the total time from hours to minutes: <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">2 hours</c> = 120 minutes. Leo finished the <a style="background-color: yellow;">first part</a> in 25 minutes. The <b style="background-color: lightblue;">second part</b> took him twice as long as the first part, so it took 2 * 25 = 50 minutes. To find the time Leo spent on the third part, subtract the time for the first and second parts from the total time: 120 minutes - 25 minutes - 50 minutes = 45 minutes. Therefore, Leo finished the third part of his assignment in 45 minutes.</div></div>
    <div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Question: Did Donald Trump come up with the idea for the New York Harbor?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Reformulated Question:</strong> Did <a style="background-color: yellow;">Donald Trump</a> come up with the idea for <b style="background-color: lightblue;">the New York Harbor</b>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong><a style="background-color: yellow;">Donald Trump</a> is an American businessman born in 1946 who later became the 45th President of the United States. <b style="background-color: lightblue;">The New York Harbor</b> is a natural harbor discovered by Europeans in the early 16th century and has been a significant port since then. <a style="background-color: yellow;">Therefore, Donald Trump</a> did not come up with the idea for <b style="background-color: lightblue;">the New York Harbor</b>, as it existed long before he was born. So the answer is no.</div></div>
    <div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Question: In the city of Soda, there are exactly 23786 inhabitants. They include 8417 men and 9092 women. The rest of the population is made up of children. How many kids are there in Soda?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Reformulated Question:</strong> In the city of Soda, there are exactly <a style="background-color: yellow;">23786 inhabitants</a>. They include <b style="background-color: lightblue;">8417 men</b> and <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">9092 women</c>. The rest of the population is made up of children. How many kids are there in Soda?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>The total number of inhabitants is <a style="background-color: yellow;">23786</a>. The number of men and women together is <b style="background-color: lightblue;">8417</b> + <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">9092</c> = 17509. Therefore, the number of children is the total inhabitants minus the number of adults: <a style="background-color: yellow;">23786</a> - 17509 = 6277. The answer is 6277.</div></div>
    <div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> Question: Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  He does this 3 times a week.  How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?</div><div class='answer'><strong>Reformulated Question:</strong> Jim spends <a style="background-color: yellow;">2 hours watching TV</a> and then decides to go to bed and <b style="background-color: lightblue;">reads for half as long</b>. He does this <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">3 times a week</c>. How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">4 weeks</d>?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong>Each time Jim watches TV for <a style="background-color: yellow;">2 hours</a> and reads for half as long, which is <a style="background-color: yellow;">2 hours</a> × <b style="background-color: lightblue;">1/2</b> = 1 hour of reading. So, each session takes 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours total. He does this <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">3 times a week</c>, so each week he spends 3 hours/session × <c style="background-color: lightgreen;">3 sessions/week</c> = 9 hours per week. Over <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">4 weeks</d>, he spends 9 hours/week × <d style="background-color: lightcoral;">4 weeks</d> = **36 hours** in total.</div></div>
