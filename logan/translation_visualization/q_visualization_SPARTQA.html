To determine what is to the left of the black thing, we need to focus on the spatial arrangement of the blocks and the squares within them. The key information involves the position of Block C relative to Block B, and the arrangement of the squares within Block C. Specifically, we need to identify that Block C is to the left of Block B and contains two medium blue squares, with medium blue square number two being on top. This information is essential to answer the question about what is to the left of the black square in Block B.

### Reformatted Text
Question: We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block A has a medium blue square. Below block A is block B which has one <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">medium black square</span>. To the <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">left of block B</span> there is block C which has <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">two medium blue squares</span>. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two. A medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. What is to the left of the black thing? a medium blue square that is in block A or a medium blue square number two?
(a) medium blue square  that is in block A
(b) medium blue square  number two
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: Block A has a medium blue square, and Block B (below A) has a <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">black square</span>. Block C, to the <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">left of Block B</span>, has <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">two medium blue squares</span>, with blue square number two on top and number one below it. Since the blue squares in Block C are directly to the left of the black square in Block B.

The question asks which object is to the right of a small yellow triangle. To answer this, we need to identify the positions of the small yellow triangles and the objects in block B relative to them. The key facts are: 
1. Block A contains two small yellow triangles.
2. Block B is to the right of block A.
3. Block B contains a small blue triangle touching the bottom edge and a small blue circle to its right.

These facts are essential to determine that both the small blue circle and the small blue triangle are to the right of the small yellow triangles.

Question: We have two blocks. Lets call them A and B. There are <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">two small yellow triangles in block A</span>. Small yellow triangle number one is above and near to small yellow triangle number two.

The question asks what is above the big black triangle. To answer this, we need to understand the arrangement of the blocks and the shapes within them. The key information is the positioning of the blocks and the shapes they contain. Block B contains the big black triangle, and Block C is above Block B. Block C contains two big yellow triangles. Therefore, the essential facts are the contents of Block B and Block C, and their relative positions.

Question: There are three blocks. We call them A, B and C. Block A contains two big black circles. There is also a <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge of this block</span>. Big black circle number two is touching the right edge of this block. Big black circle number one is to the left of and near to big black circle number two. This shape is above the small yellow triangle. Above block A is block B with a <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">big black triangle in it</span>. Above block B there is block C. It contains <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">two big yellow triangles</span>. Big yellow triangle number one is touching the right edge of this block. It is above big yellow triangle number two. What is above the big black triangle? a small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block or a big yellow triangle?
(a) small yellow triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block
(b) big yellow triangle
(c) both of them
(d) none of them

Answer: Block A contains a <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">small yellow triangle touching the bottom edge</span>, and Block C (above Block B) contains <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">two big yellow triangles</span>, with big yellow triangle number one above big yellow triangle number two. Since Block C is directly above Block B (which contains the <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">big black triangle</span>), the object above the big black triangle is a big yellow triangle.

It is touching the bottom edge of this block. It also contains one small yellow square. The <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">big black square</span> is to the left of and near to the small yellow square.

The question asks what is to the right of the big blue square. To answer this, we need to know the position of the big blue square and the positions of the medium yellow circle and medium yellow square. The text states that the big blue square is in Block B, and Block C is below Block A. The medium yellow square and medium yellow circle are both in Block C. Therefore, neither the medium yellow circle nor the medium yellow square can be to the right of the big blue square in Block B. The key facts are the location of the big blue square and the location of the medium yellow circle and square.

Reformatted Question: There are three blocks. Let's call them A, B, and C. Block A contains a big blue circle and a medium black circle. The big blue circle is touching the bottom edge of this block. A big yellow circle is to the left of the medium black circle. The medium black circle is touching the right edge of this block. To the left of the medium black circle, there is the big blue circle. It is below the yellow object, which is to the left of the medium black circle. <span class="fact1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">To the left of block A, we have block B with a big blue square in it</span>. <span class="fact2" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">Below block A, there is block C, which has a medium yellow square</span>. This block also has one medium yellow circle. <span class="fact3" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 3px;">Above the medium yellow square, there is the medium yellow circle</span>. What is to the right of the big blue square? A medium yellow circle or a medium yellow square?
