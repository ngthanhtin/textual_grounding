The school has decided to cover half of the cost: <important_quote2>school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip</important_quote2>. Therefore, the school will contribute $300 / 2 = $150.<br><br>3. Subtract the school's contribution from the total cost to find out how much John needs to cover himself: $300 - $150 = $150.<br><br>4. John already has $50: <important_quote3>he has $50</important_quote3>.<br><br>5.

How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we need to analyze the information given in the important quotes.<br><br>1. According to <important_quote1>Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</important_quote1>. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns 12 badges.<br><br>2. <important_quote2>It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</important_quote2>. This means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Amber earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.<br><br>3. <important_quote3>Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</important_quote3>. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.<br><br>Now, we calculate how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:<br><br>Wendy's badges - Amber's badges = 36 - 6 = 30<br><br>Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.

What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to consider the information provided in the <important_quote> tags.<br><br>1. According to <important_quote1>, Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. This means that for the weeks not specified in the exceptions, he worked out for 4 hours.<br><br>2. <important_quote2> states that Josh spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. This means there are two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each.<br><br>3. <important_quote3> indicates that Josh spent 6 hours in one week. This is another exception to the 4-hour weeks.<br><br>Now, let's calculate the total hours:<br><br>- For the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each, the total is 5 + 5 = 10 hours.<br>- For the one week where he worked out 6 hours, the total is 6 hours.<br>- The remaining weeks (8 weeks total - 3 weeks of exceptions = 5 weeks) are 4 hours each, so 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.<br><br>Adding these together gives us the total workout hours:<br>10 hours (from the two 5-hour weeks) + 6 hours (from the one 6-hour week) + 20 hours (from the five 4-hour weeks) = 36 hours.<br><br>Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is {36}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>36</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 36</div></div>

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the important quotes.<br><br>Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).<br><br>According to <important_quote1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).<br><br>According to <important_quote2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).<br><br>According to <important_quote3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:<br><br>\[<br>(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>\]<br><br>Simplifying the equation:<br><br>\[<br>2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19<br>\]<br><br>To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:<br><br>\[<br>2(2x + 4) + x = 38<br>\]<br><br>\[<br>4x + 8 + x = 38<br>\]<br><br>Combine like terms:<br><br>\[<br>5x + 8 = 38<br>\]<br><br>Subtract 8 from both sides:<br><br>\[<br>5x = 30<br>\]<br><br>Divide by 5:<br><br>\[<br>x = 6<br>\]<br><br>Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:<br><br>\[<br>x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10<br>\]<br><br>Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

Greta made a batch for herself: <important_quote1>one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies</important_quote1>. Since one dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.<br><br>2. At her office, they sent her home with <important_quote2>1/2 a dozen brownies</important_quote2>. Half a dozen equals 6, so she received 6 brownies from her office.<br><br>3.

According to <important_quote3>, each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for the four runners are:<br><br>- First runner: 60 seconds<br>- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds<br>- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds<br>- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds<br><br>The total time for the less well-rounded team is:<br><br>\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]<br><br>**Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two teams.**<br><br>The well-rounded team completes the relay in 220 seconds, while the less well-rounded team completes it in 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team (the well-rounded team) wins by:<br><br>\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]<br><br>The faster team will win by {2} seconds.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2</div></div>

This means he builds 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (since 20 snowballs/hour divided by 4 quarters of an hour equals 5 snowballs per 15 minutes).<br><br>2. **Melting Rate**: <important_quote2>2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes</important_quote2>.<br><br>3. **Net Gain**: Every 15 minutes, Jay builds 5 snowballs but loses 2 to melting, resulting in a net gain of 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.<br><br>4. **Time Calculation**: To find out how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net gain per 15 minutes:<br>   - 60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.<br><br>5. **Total Time**: 20 intervals of 15 minutes each equals 300 minutes.<br><br>Therefore, it will take Jay 300 minutes to have 60 snowballs.

If <important_quote4>each chocolate bar weighs 40g</important_quote4>, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of both the chocolate bars and the candied apples.<br><br>1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars:**<br>   - According to <important_quote1>, Joe has 25 chocolate bars.<br>   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g as per <important_quote4>.<br>   - Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars is \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \) grams.<br><br>2. **Weight of Candied Apples:**<br>   - Joe has 80 candied apples as stated in <important_quote2>.<br>   - <important_quote3> tells us that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) grams.<br>   - Therefore, the total weight of the candied apples is \( 80 \times 20 = 1600 \) grams.<br><br>3. **Total Weight of the Bag:**<br>   - The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is the sum of the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples: \( 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \) grams.<br><br>Thus, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is {2600} grams.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>2600</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 2600</div></div>

How many Pokemon has Stan caught?<br>--------------- Extracted Question ---------------<br><br>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon Stan has caught using the information provided in the quotes.<br><br>1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).<br><br>2. From <important_quote3>Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught</important_quote3>, we can express Stan's count in terms of Adelwolfe's count:<br>   \[<br>   S = 4A - 13<br>   \]<br><br>3.

Since there are three triplets, their combined age is \( 3t \).<br><br>Step 2: Use the Information About the Twin<br>According to <important_quote1>one twin is 7 years older than one triplet</important_quote1>, the age of one twin is \( t + 7 \). Since there are two twins, their combined age is \( 2(t + 7) \).<br><br>Step 3: Set Up the Equation for Combined Ages<br>The combined ages of the twins and triplets is given as 44 in <important_quote2>combined ages are 44</important_quote2>. Therefore, we can set up the equation:<br><br>\[ 3t + 2(t + 7) = 44 \]<br><br>Step 4: Simplify and Solve the Equation<br>First, expand the equation:<br><br>\[ 3t + 2t + 14 = 44 \]<br><br>Combine like terms:<br><br>\[ 5t + 14 = 44 \]<br><br>Subtract 14 from both sides:<br><br>\[ 5t = 30 \]<br><br>Divide by 5:<br><br>\[ t = 6 \]<br><br>Step 5: Find the Age of One Twin<br>Since one twin is \( t + 7 \) years old, substitute \( t = 6 \):<br><br>\[ t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]<br><br>Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.<br><br>The final answer is {13}.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>13</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 13</div></div>
