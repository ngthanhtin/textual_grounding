How many people, in terms of percentage, were not solely White or solely African American?

Answer: According to the passage, <fact1>97.9% were White</fact1> and <fact2>0.56% were African American</fact2>. The percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American is <fact3>100% - (97.9% + 0.56%) = 1.54%</fact3>. However, this 1.54% includes <fact7>0.74% from two or more races</fact7> which may include White and/or African American. To find the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American, we need to subtract the percentage of people who were two or more races from the total percentage of people who were not White or African American: <fact3>1.54%</fact3> - <fact7>0.74%</fact7> is not correct since 0.74% is part of the 1.54%. Instead, we should consider that 0.74% from two or more races may include White and/or African American, and the remaining percentage is from other races: <fact3>0.15% Native American</fact3>, <fact4>0.28% Asian</fact4>, <fact5>0.02% Pacific Islander</fact5>, and <fact6>0.36% from other races</fact6>. The sum of these percentages is <fact3>0.15%</fact3> + <fact4>0.28%</fact4> + <fact5>0.02%</fact5> + <fact6>0.36%</fact6> = 0.81%. Adding the percentage of people who were two or more races (which may include White and/or African American) to this sum, we get: 0.81% + <fact7>0.74%</fact7> = 1.55%.

The forces consisted of 1,400 Portuguese soldiers and 3,000 Lascarins, who sailed with 43 ships and more than 200 small vessels. Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts, but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai. With the support of heavy firepower, the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land. The first-wave attack favoured the Portuguese, who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery, more than 300 muskets, various other weapons, and ammunition. The second wave, comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers, reached land, followed by the rest of the soldiers, who captured a storehouse and stationed at night. The next day, the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago, son-in-law of Puvirasa Pandaram.

How many more females per 100 age 18 and over were there than males?
Answer: According to the passage, for every 100 females age 18 and over, there were <fact2>173.2 males</fact2>. This means that for every 100 females, there were 173.2 males, so the number of females per 100 is 100, and the number of males per 100 is <fact2>173.2</fact2>. Since we want to know how many more females there are than males, we need to subtract the number of males from the number of females. However, since the number of males is greater than the number of females, we will get a negative number. To get the correct answer, we need to subtract the number of females from the number of males and then multiply by -1. So, 100 - <fact2>173.2</fact2> is -73.2. Then, multiplying by -1, we get 73.2.

To find the number of years between these two events, we need to subtract the year of the invasion from the year of the kingdom's formation.

How many people are there per 4 square miles?

Answer: According to the passage, the population density is <fact2>5,959.1 people per square mile</fact2>. To find the number of people per 4 square miles, we multiply the population density by 4. <fact2>5,959.1 people per square mile</fact2> * 4 = 23,836.4 people per 4 square miles.

Alem and the death of Aristóbulo del Valle. In 1897, Hipólito Yrigoyen, profoundly disagreeing with the direction of agreements imposed by Bernardo de Irigoyen, dissolved the Committee of the RCU in the province of Buenos Aires, due to which the radical party practically ceased to exist. The dissolution of the Radical Civic Union resulted in the formation of a core of radical elements that recognized as their leader Hipólito Yrigoyen. Onto this core - composed of young men, recruited from the middle class, professionals, businessmen, employees, ranchers of the old federal tradition, settlers and laborers from the countryside - was Yrigoyen able to impose discipline and enthusiasm. In this context, in 1903 Hipólito Yrigoyen began his revival and reorganization. On February 29 of 1904, after 7 years of inactivity, the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union said the electoral abstention of all the radicals of the Republic in the elections of representatives from the nation, senators from the capital, electors for president and vice president of the nation, and announced an armed resistance.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz.

In 1756, the oldest university library was finally closed down and its books, 2,787 volumes, were incorporated into the Court Library, of which Gerard van Swieten was then director. After the dissolution of the Jesuit order (1773), the new ""Academic Library"" was created out of the book collections of the five Lower Austrian Colleges and a large number of duplicates from the Court Library. This was opened on 13 May 1777, the birthday of Maria Theresa of Austria, in the building of the Academic College. Initially, the stock consisted of some 45,000 books and during Emperor Joseph IIs dissolution of the monasteries, this was soon considerably extended. In contrast to its antecedents, the new library was open to the general public. Between 1827 and 1829, it acquired the classicist extension (Postgasse 9) to the Academic College, in which it was to be accommodated until 1884. In this year, the main library, with some 300,000 books, moved to Heinrich von Ferstels new Main Building on the Ring, where stacks for some 500,000 volumes had already been prepared.

By 1632 the Dutch had established a post on a peninsula named Tayoan , which was separated from the main part of Formosa by a shallow lagoon historically referred to as the Taikang inland sea . The Dutch fortifications consisted of two forts along the bay: the first and main fortification was the multiple-walled Fort Zeelandia, situated at the entrance to the bay, while the second was the smaller Fort Provintia, a walled administrative office. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan for the Dutch East India Company, was stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men, while his subordinate, Valentyn, was in charge of Fort Provintia and its garrison of 500 men. In 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, son of Zheng Zhilong and leader of the Ming loyalist remnants, felt that the Qing Empire had consolidated their position in China sufficiently, while his troops needed more supplies and manpower. He began searching for a suitable location as his base of operations, and soon a Chinese man named He Bin , who was working for the Dutch East India Company in Formosa , fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided him with a map of Taiwan.

Answer: According to the passage, the poverty line is defined as being <fact1>60% of the median household income</fact1>. To find the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line, we need to find the percentage that is just above 60%. Since the question asks for the percentage points out of 100, we can conclude that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is 61%. However, the passage does not explicitly state this. But we can infer that the lowest percentage that is considered above the poverty line is anything above <fact1>60%</fact1>.
