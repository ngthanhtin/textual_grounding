Later, Oscar saw another <fact4>10-foot shark</fact4> with <fact5>6 remoras</fact5>, each <fact6>3 inches long</fact6>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras for each shark. For the first shark, there were originally <fact2>16 remoras</fact2>, but a quarter of them swam away, so there are <fact2>16</fact2> * 3/4 = 12 remoras left. The total length of the remoras for the first shark is 12 * <fact3>19 inches</fact3> = 228 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 228 inches / 12 = 19 feet.

For the second shark, the total length of the remoras is <fact5>6 remoras</fact5> * <fact6>3 inches</fact6> = 18 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 18 inches / 12 = 1.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first shark, the percentage is (19 feet / <fact1>38 feet</fact1>) * 100% ≈ 50%. For the second shark, the percentage is (1.5 feet / <fact4>10 feet</fact4>) * 100% = 15%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (50% + 15%) / 2 = 32.5%.

On average, what percentage of each whale's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each whale. For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/2 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>12</fact2> / 2 = 6 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>24 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * <fact3>24 inches</fact3> = 144 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 144 inches / 12 = 12 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>6 inches</fact7> = 36 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 36 inches / 12 = 3 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each whale's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first whale, the remoras cover 12 feet / <fact1>48 feet</fact1> = 0.25 or 25%. For the second whale, the remoras cover 3 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.3 or 30%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. There were originally <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/6 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>18</fact2> - <fact2>18</fact2>/<fact4>6</fact4> = 15 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>16 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 15 * <fact3>16 inches</fact3> = 240 inches. Since the shark is <fact1>40 feet long</fact1>, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet: 240 inches / 12 = 20 feet. 

The percentage of the shark's body length covered by the remoras is (20 feet / <fact1>40 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 50%.

Later, Nia saw another <fact4>10-foot dolphin</fact4> with <fact5>6 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras, each 12 inches long</fact2>, which is a total of <fact2>12</fact2> * 12 = 144 inches. Since <fact3>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact3>, the remaining remoras have a total length of 144 - (144 / 3) = 96 inches. We need to convert this to feet to match the length of the dolphin, so 96 inches / 12 = 8 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact5>6 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, which is a total of <fact5>6</fact5> * 3 = 18 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 18 inches / 12 = 1.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the remoras cover 8 feet / <fact1>40 feet</fact1> = 0.2 or 20%. For the second dolphin, the remoras cover 1.5 feet / <fact4>10 feet</fact4> = 0.15 or 15%.

Later, Sanjay saw another <fact4>10-foot shark</fact4> with <fact5>8 remoras</fact5>, each <fact6>6 inches long</fact6>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the remoras attached to the first shark are <fact3>22 inches</fact3> / 12 = 1.83 feet long. The remoras attached to the second shark are <fact6>6 inches</fact6> / 12 = 0.5 feet long.

A quarter of the remoras attached to the first shark swam away, so the number of remoras left is <fact2>12 remoras</fact2> - <fact2>12 remoras</fact2> / 4 = 9 remoras.

The total length of the remoras attached to the first shark is 9 remoras * 1.83 feet/remora = 16.47 feet. The total length of the remoras attached to the second shark is <fact5>8 remoras</fact5> * 0.5 feet/remora = 4 feet.

The percentage of the first shark's body length covered by the remoras is (16.47 feet / <fact1>33 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 49.9%. The percentage of the second shark's body length covered by the remoras is (4 feet / <fact4>10 feet</fact4>) * 100% = 40%.

The average percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras is (49.9% + 40%) / 2 = 44.95%. We can round this to 45%.

Later, Tariq saw another <fact4>10-foot dolphin</fact4> with <fact5>4 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras, each 12 inches long</fact2>, which is a total of <fact2>12</fact2> * 12 = 144 inches. Since <fact3>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact3>, the remaining remoras have a total length of 144 - (144 / 3) = 96 inches. For the second dolphin, the total length of the remoras is <fact5>4 remoras, each 3 inches long</fact5>, which is a total of <fact5>4</fact5> * 3 = 12 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the total length of the remoras for the first dolphin is 96 / 12 = 8 feet, and for the second dolphin, it is 12 / 12 = 1 foot.

The percentage of each dolphin's body length covered by the remoras can be calculated by dividing the total length of the remoras by the length of the dolphin and multiplying by 100. For the first dolphin, this is (8 / <fact1>40</fact1>) * 100 = 20%. For the second dolphin, this is (1 / <fact4>10</fact4>) * 100 = 10%.

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for both dolphins and divide by 2: (20 + 10) / 2 = 15%.

For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>18 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>1/2 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>18</fact2> / 2 = 9 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>16 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 9 * <fact3>16 inches</fact3> = 144 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 144 inches / 12 = 12 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>6 inches</fact7> = 36 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 36 inches / 12 = 3 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each whale's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first whale, the remoras cover 12 feet / <fact1>48 feet</fact1> = 0.25 or 25%. For the second whale, the remoras cover 3 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.3 or 30%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 30%) / 2 = 27.5%.

Then, <fact4>half of the remoras swam away</fact4>. Later, Bodhi saw another <fact5>10-foot shark</fact5> with <fact6>5 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark. For the first shark, there were originally <fact2>22 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>half of them swam away</fact4>, so there are 22/2 = 11 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>12 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 11 * 12 = 132 inches. Since the shark is <fact1>44 feet long</fact1>, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet as well. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 132 inches is equal to 132/12 = 11 feet.

For the second shark, there are <fact6>5 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is 5 * 6 = 30 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 30/12 = 2.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first shark, the remoras cover 11 feet out of the shark's total length of <fact1>44 feet</fact1>, so the percentage is (11/44) * 100% ≈ 25%. For the second shark, the remoras cover 2.5 feet out of the shark's total length of <fact5>10 feet</fact5>, so the percentage is (2.5/10) * 100% = 25%.

To find the average percentage, we add the percentages for the two sharks and divide by 2: (25% + 25%)/2 = 25%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>18 remoras</fact2> and each is <fact3>21 inches long</fact3>, the total length of the remoras is <fact2>18</fact2> * <fact3>21 inches</fact3> = 378 inches. Since <fact4>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, the remaining length of the remoras is 378 - (378 / 3) = 252 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so we divide by 12: 252 / 12 = 21 feet.

For the second shark, the total length of the remoras is <fact6>7 remoras</fact6> * <fact7>6 inches</fact7> = 42 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 42 / 12 = 3.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras. For the first shark, it's (21 / <fact1>42</fact1>) * 100% ≈ 50%. For the second shark, it's (3.5 / <fact5>10</fact5>) * 100% = 35%.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>20 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>half of them swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>20</fact2> / 2 = 10 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>12 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 10 * <fact3>12 inches</fact3> = 120 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 120 inches / 12 = 10 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>5 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact7>5 inches</fact7> = 30 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 30 inches / 12 = 2.5 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the remoras cover 10 feet / <fact1>40 feet</fact1> = 0.25 or 25%. For the second dolphin, the remoras cover 2.5 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.25 or 25%.

Later, Mohammed saw another <fact4>10-foot shark</fact4> with <fact5>6 remoras, each 6 inches long</fact5>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>18 remoras, each 15 inches long</fact2>, the total length of the remoras is 18 * 15 = 270 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so we divide by 12: 270 / 12 = 22.5 feet. After <fact3>a third of the remoras swam away</fact3>, there are 18 - 18/3 = 12 remoras left, with a total length of 12 * 15 = 180 inches, or 180 / 12 = 15 feet.

For the second shark, there are <fact5>6 remoras, each 6 inches long</fact5>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * 6 = 36 inches, or 36 / 12 = 3 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras. For the first shark, the percentage is (15 / <fact1>30</fact1>) * 100 = 50%. For the second shark, the percentage is (3 / <fact4>10</fact4>) * 100 = 30%.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>21 remoras</fact2> and each is <fact3>13 inches long</fact3>, the total length of the remoras is <fact2>21</fact2> * <fact3>13</fact3> = 273 inches. However, <fact4>1/7 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, so the remaining length of the remoras is 273 - (273 / 7) = 234 inches.

Next, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the second shark. Since there are <fact6>8 remoras</fact6> and each is <fact7>6 inches long</fact7>, the total length of the remoras is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact7>6</fact7> = 48 inches.

Now, we need to convert the length of the sharks from feet to inches. The first shark is <fact1>39 feet</fact1> long, which is 39 * 12 = 468 inches. The second shark is <fact5>8 feet</fact5> long, which is 8 * 12 = 96 inches.

To calculate the percentage of each shark's body length covered by the remoras, we divide the total length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100. For the first shark, the percentage is (234 / 468) * 100 = 50%. For the second shark, the percentage is (48 / 96) * 100 = 50%.

Since we are asked for the average percentage, we take the average of the two percentages: (50 + 50) / 2 = 50%.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras for each whale. For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>half of them swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>12</fact2>/2 = 6 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>14 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * <fact3>14 inches</fact3> = 84 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 84 inches / 12 inches per foot = 7 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact6>8 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>3 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact7>3 inches</fact7> = 24 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 24 inches / 12 inches per foot = 2 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each whale's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first whale, the remoras cover 7 feet / <fact1>35 feet</fact1> = 0.2 or 20%. For the second whale, the remoras cover 2 feet / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.2 or 20%.

Then, <fact4>half of the remoras swam away</fact4>. Later, Winnie saw another <fact5>10-foot dolphin</fact5> with <fact6>8 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>3 inches long</fact7>, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each dolphin. For the first dolphin, there were originally <fact2>12 remoras</fact2>, but <fact4>half of them swam away</fact4>, so there are <fact2>12</fact2>/2 = 6 remoras left. Each remora is <fact3>24 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * <fact3>24 inches</fact3> = 144 inches. Since the dolphin is <fact1>48 feet long</fact1>, we need to convert the length of the remoras to feet as well. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 144 inches is equal to 144/12 = 12 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact6>8 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>3 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact7>3 inches</fact7> = 24 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, which is 24/12 = 2 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the remoras cover 12 feet out of the dolphin's total length of <fact1>48 feet</fact1>, which is (12/<fact1>48</fact1>) * 100% ≈ 25%. For the second dolphin, the remoras cover 2 feet out of the dolphin's total length of <fact5>10 feet</fact5>, which is (2/<fact5>10</fact5>) * 100% = 20%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages together and divide by 2: (25% + 20%)/2 = 22.5%. Therefore, on average, the remoras cover approximately 22.5% of each dolphin's body length.

On average, what percentage of each shark's body length is covered by the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each shark. For the first shark, there were originally <fact2>24 remoras</fact2>, but a third of them swam away, so there are <fact2>24</fact2> * 2/3 = 16 remoras left. The total length of these remoras is 16 * <fact3>12 inches</fact3> = 192 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 192 inches / 12 = 16 feet.

For the second shark, there are <fact5>6 remoras</fact5>, each <fact6>6 inches long</fact6>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact5>6</fact5> * <fact6>6 inches</fact6> = 36 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 36 inches / 12 = 3 feet.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each shark's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first shark, the percentage is (16 feet / <fact1>32 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 50%. For the second shark, the percentage is (3 feet / <fact4>10 feet</fact4>) * 100% = 30%.

Each remora is <fact3>17 inches long</fact3>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * <fact3>17 inches</fact3> = 102 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so 102 inches / 12 inches per foot = 8.5 feet.

For the second dolphin, there are <fact6>4 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>3 inches long</fact7>, so the total length of the remoras is <fact6>4</fact6> * <fact7>3 inches</fact7> = 12 inches. Again, we need to convert this to feet, so 12 inches / 12 inches per foot = 1 foot.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of each dolphin's body length that is covered by the remoras. For the first dolphin, the remoras cover 8.5 feet / <fact1>34 feet</fact1> = 0.25 or 25%. For the second dolphin, the remoras cover 1 foot / <fact5>10 feet</fact5> = 0.1 or 10%.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to each whale. For the first whale, there were originally <fact2>18 remoras, each 20 inches long</fact2>, so the total length of the remoras was 18 * 20 = 360 inches. However, <fact3>1/3 of the remoras swam away</fact3>, so the remaining total length of the remoras is 360 - (360 / 3) = 240 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to feet by dividing by 12: 240 / 12 = 20 feet.

For the second whale, there are <fact5>6 remoras, each 5 inches long</fact5>, so the total length of the remoras is 6 * 5 = 30 inches. Converting this to feet, we get 30 / 12 = 2.5 feet.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total length of the remoras attached to the first shark. Since there are <fact2>15 remoras</fact2> and each is <fact3>23 inches long</fact3>, the total length of the remoras is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact3>23 inches</fact3> = 345 inches. Since <fact4>1/5 of the remoras swam away</fact4>, the remaining length of the remoras is 345 - (1/5 * 345) = 276 inches. We need to convert this to feet, so we divide by 12: 276 / 12 = 23 feet.

1,"Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 30 minutes to cover every 13 miles of the city</fact1>. However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If <fact3>the city is 78 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles the fog bank needs to cover to reach half of the city. Since <fact3>the city is 78 miles across</fact3>, half of the city would be 78 / 2 = 39 miles. 

Next, we need to find out how many 13-mile segments are there in 39 miles. 39 miles / 13 miles per segment = 3 segments.

Since <fact1>it takes 30 minutes to cover every 13 miles of the city</fact1>, it would take 30 minutes * 3 segments = 90 minutes to cover 39 miles at the initial wind speed.

However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, which is 60 minutes. Since 90 minutes is greater than 60 minutes, the wind speed will be halved before the fog bank covers 39 miles.

To find out how many miles the fog bank covers before the wind speed is halved, we can calculate the number of 13-mile segments it covers in 60 minutes. 60 minutes / 30 minutes per segment = 2 segments. 

So, the fog bank covers 2 segments * 13 miles per segment = 26 miles before the wind speed is halved.

After the wind speed is halved, it would take twice as long to cover the same distance. So, the new time it takes to cover 13 miles is 30 minutes * 2 = 60 minutes.

The fog bank still needs to cover 39 miles - 26 miles = 13 miles to reach half of the city. Since it takes 60 minutes to cover 13 miles at the new wind speed, it would take an additional 60 minutes to cover the remaining distance.

Therefore, the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover half of the city is 60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. If <fact3>the city is 96 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles a quarter of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 96 miles across</fact3>, a quarter of the city is 96 / 4 = 24 miles. 

Since <fact1>it takes 15 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>, we can find out how many sets of 3 miles are in 24 miles by dividing 24 by 3. 24 / 3 = 8. 

Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to determine if this will affect our time. However, since we are not given the exact time that the fog starts rolling in, and we are not told to consider the time after the wind speed is halved, we can assume that the time we are looking for is within the first hour.

If <fact3>the city is 78 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover half of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles the fog bank needs to cover to reach half of the city. Since <fact3>the city is 78 miles across</fact3>, half of the city would be 78 / 2 = 39 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 3 miles the fog bank needs to cover to reach 39 miles. Since <fact1>it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles</fact1>, we can divide 39 miles by 3 miles to get 39 / 3 = 13 sets of 3 miles.

However, we also know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. Since we don't know exactly when the wind speed will be halved, we will assume that the fog bank will cover the first half of the distance at the original speed.

If <fact3>the city is 44 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover half of the city at its original speed. Since <fact3>the city is 44 miles across</fact3>, half of the city is 44 / 2 = 22 miles. Since <fact1>it takes 40 minutes to cover every 4 miles</fact1>, it will take (22 / 4) * 40 = 220 minutes to cover half of the city at its original speed.

However, since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to find out how much of the city will be covered in the first hour. In the first hour, the fog bank will cover (60 / 40) * 4 = 6 miles. After the first hour, the wind speed will be halved, so it will take twice as long to cover the same distance. Therefore, the time it takes to cover the remaining 16 miles (22 - 6 = 16) will be (16 / 4) * 80 = 320 minutes.

Since the fog bank covers 6 miles in the first hour, it will take 60 minutes to cover the first 6 miles. To cover the remaining 16 miles, it will take 320 minutes. However, we are asked to find the time it takes to cover half of the city, which is 22 miles. So, the total time it takes to cover half of the city is 60 + (16 / 4) * 80 = 60 + 320 = 380 minutes for the remaining 16 miles at the reduced speed but it only needs 220 minutes at the original speed to cover the 22 miles so it will take 60 minutes at the original speed and then 160 minutes at the reduced speed to cover the 22 miles so 60 + 160 = 220 minutes.

If <fact3>the city is 60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city?

Answer: To cover 1/2 of the city, the fog bank needs to cover <fact3>60 miles</fact3>/2 = 30 miles. 
Since <fact1>it takes 30 minutes to cover every 6 miles of the city</fact1>, the fog bank can cover 30 miles in 30/<fact1>6</fact1> * <fact1>30</fact1> = 150 minutes at its original speed. 
However, since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, after 60 minutes, the speed of the fog bank will be halved. 
In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank can cover <fact1>6</fact1>/<fact1>30</fact1> * 60 = 12 miles at its original speed. 
This leaves 30 - 12 = 18 miles to be covered at the halved speed. 
Since the speed is halved, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance, so it will take 18/<fact1>6</fact1> * <fact1>30</fact1> * 2 = 180 minutes to cover the remaining 18 miles. 
However, this is the time it would take if the fog bank were moving at the halved speed from the beginning. 
Since it moved at its original speed for the first 60 minutes, we need to subtract 60 from the total time to get 180 + 60 - 60 = 180 minutes. 
But the first 60 minutes were already accounted for in the original 60 minutes, so we only need to add the time it took to cover the remaining 18 miles at the halved speed, which is 180 - 60 = 120 minutes. 
Therefore, the total time it will take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city is 60 + 120 = 180 minutes.

If <fact3>the city is 84 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles a quarter of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 84 miles across</fact3>, a quarter of the city is 84/4 = 21 miles. 
Since <fact1>it takes 60 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city</fact1>, the fog bank covers 1 mile every 60/3 = 20 minutes. 
Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, after 60 minutes, it will take the fog bank 20*2 = 40 minutes to cover 1 mile. 
In the first 60 minutes, the fog bank will cover 60/20 = 3 miles. 
After that, the fog bank still needs to cover 21 - 3 = 18 miles. 
Since it takes the fog bank 40 minutes to cover 1 mile, it will take the fog bank 18*40 = 720 minutes to cover the remaining 18 miles.

If <fact3>the city is 90 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles the fog bank needs to cover to reach half of the city. Since <fact3>the city is 90 miles across</fact3>, half of the city would be 90 / 2 = 45 miles. 

Next, we need to find out how many sets of 5 miles are in 45 miles. This is 45 / 5 = 9 sets of 5 miles. 

Since <fact1>it takes 10 minutes to cover every 5 miles</fact1>, it would take 9 x 10 = 90 minutes to cover 45 miles at the initial wind speed.

However, we know that <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>. Since 60 minutes (1 hour) is less than 90 minutes, the wind speed will be halved before the fog bank covers half of the city. 

To find out how many miles the fog bank covers in the first hour, we can divide 60 minutes by <fact1>10 minutes per 5 miles</fact1>, which gives us 60 / 10 = 6 sets of 5 miles. This is 6 x 5 = 30 miles.

After the wind speed is halved, it will take twice as long to cover each set of 5 miles. So, it will take 10 x 2 = 20 minutes to cover each set of 5 miles.

The fog bank still needs to cover 45 - 30 = 15 miles to reach half of the city. This is 15 / 5 = 3 sets of 5 miles.

At the reduced wind speed, it will take 3 x 20 = 60 minutes to cover the remaining 15 miles.

Therefore, the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover half of the city is 60 minutes (at the initial wind speed) + 60 minutes (at the reduced wind speed) = 120 minutes.

If <fact3>the city is 76 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a quarter of the city?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles a quarter of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 76 miles across</fact3>, a quarter of the city is 76/4 = 19 miles. 

Since <fact1>it takes 80 minutes to cover every 4 miles of the city</fact1>, the fog bank's speed is 4 miles / 80 minutes = 1/20 miles per minute. 

Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, and it takes less than an hour to cover a quarter of the city (as we will see), we can assume the wind speed is constant for the time being. 

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to cover 19 miles at a speed of 1/20 miles per minute.

If <fact3>the city is 95 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact4>1/5 of the city</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many miles 1/5 of the city is. Since <fact3>the city is 95 miles across</fact3>, 1/5 of the city is 95 / 5 = 19 miles. 

Since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to determine how far the fog bank will travel in the first hour and how far it will travel after the wind speed is halved. 

In the first hour, the fog bank travels <fact1>5 miles every 75 minutes</fact1>, so in 60 minutes, it will travel (60 / 75) * 5 = 4 miles. 

After the first hour, the wind speed is halved, so the fog bank will travel half the distance in the same amount of time. Therefore, it will take 75 * 2 = 150 minutes to travel 5 miles. 

Since the fog bank needs to travel 19 miles to cover <fact4>1/5 of the city</fact4>, and it travels 4 miles in the first hour, it needs to travel 19 - 4 = 15 miles after the wind speed is halved. 

It takes 150 minutes to travel 5 miles, so it will take (150 / 5) * 15 = 450 minutes to travel 15 miles. 

However, this is after the first hour, so we need to add the first hour to the total time. Therefore, the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover <fact4>1/5 of the city</fact4> is 60 + 450 = 510 minutes.

If <fact3>the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact3>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city?

Answer: To cover 1/4 of the city, the fog bank needs to cover 1/4 * <fact3>80 miles</fact3> = 20 miles. Since <fact1>it takes 60 minutes to cover every 4 miles</fact1>, the fog bank's original speed is 4 miles / 60 minutes. To cover 20 miles at this speed, it would take 20 miles / (4 miles / 60 minutes) = 300 minutes. However, since <fact2>the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour</fact2>, we need to consider the reduced speed. The fog bank will cover the first 4 miles in 60 minutes, but then the speed will be halved. The remaining distance to cover 1/4 of the city is 20 - 4 = 16 miles. At the reduced speed, it will take twice as long to cover the same distance, so it will take 2 * (16 miles / (4 miles / 60 minutes)) = 480 minutes to cover the remaining 16 miles. However, this is not the total time, as the fog bank already covered 4 miles in the first 60 minutes.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a single roll. Since there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a <fact1>10-sided die</fact1> (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), the probability is 5/10 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.5^2 = 0.25.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>. Since there are 5 even numbers on a <fact1>10-sided die</fact1> (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 5/10 = 0.5.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll. Since a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> has 8 sides, and 6 of them are greater than 2, the probability is 6/8 = 0.75. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.75^2 = 0.5625.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four odd numbers in a row</fact3>.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a single roll. Since a <fact1>d6 die</fact1> has 6 possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and 3 of them are greater than 3 (4, 5, 6), the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll. Since the die is <fact1>4-sided</fact1>, there are 2 numbers greater than 2 (3 and 4) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll. Since there are 3 numbers greater than 1 on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1> (2, 3, and 4), the probability is 3/4. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row is then (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

To calculate the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll. Since there are 2 even numbers on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1> (2 and 4), the probability is 2/4 = 1/2. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is then (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 twice in a row, we first need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a single roll. Since a <fact1>d12 die</fact1> has 12 sides, and 9 of them are greater than 3, the probability is 9/12 = 0.75. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 <fact2>twice in a row</fact2>, we square this probability: 0.75^2 = 0.5625.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling <fact3>four even numbers in a row</fact3>.

Since the number of students who like to play video games is <fact6>2 less than ten times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>, and <fact5>3 students like to play hurling</fact5>, the number of students who like to play video games is 10 * <fact5>3</fact5> - 2 = 28.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to dance, play chess, swim, or play hurling. This is <fact2>59</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>3</fact5> = 83.

The total number of students who like to play music or video games is <fact1>150</fact1> - 83 = 67.

Since 28 students like to play video games, the number of students who like to play music is 67 - 28 = 39.

To find the percentage of students who like to play music, divide the number of students who like to play music by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (39 / <fact1>150</fact1>) * 100 = 26%.

What percentage of the students like to paint if the number of the students that like to play music is <fact6>2 less than five times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to play music. We know that the number of students that like to play music is <fact6>2 less than five times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact6>. Since <fact5>21 students like to play tennis</fact5>, the number of students that like to play music is 5 * <fact5>21</fact5> - 2 = 103.

Next, we need to find the total number of students that like to read, play chess, swim, or play tennis. We know that <fact2>24 students like to read</fact2>, <fact3>8 students like to play chess</fact3>, <fact4>13 students like to swim</fact4>, and <fact5>21 students like to play tennis</fact5>. Therefore, the total number of students that like to read, play chess, swim, or play tennis is <fact2>24</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>21</fact5> = 66.

We also know that there are <fact1>260 students</fact1> in total. Therefore, the number of students that like to paint or play music is <fact1>260</fact1> - 66 = 194.

Since we know that 103 students like to play music, the number of students that like to paint is 194 - 103 = 91.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of students that like to paint by dividing the number of students that like to paint by the total number of students and multiplying by 100. Therefore, the percentage of students that like to paint is (91 / <fact1>260</fact1>) * 100 = 35%.

So, the total number of students that like to play music, chess, swim, or volleyball is <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>9</fact5> = 35.
We also know that there are <fact1>50 students</fact1> in total. So, the number of students that like to bake or paint is <fact1>50</fact1> - 35 = 15.
Since 14 students like to paint, the number of students that like to bake is 15 - 14 = 1.
To find the percentage of students that like to bake, we divide the number of students that like to bake by the total number of students and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of students that like to bake is (1 / <fact1>50</fact1>) * 100 = 2%.

What percentage of the students like to bake if the number of the students that like to play video games is <fact6>6 less than eight times the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to play video games. We know that the number of students that like to play video games is <fact6>6 less than eight times the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>. Since <fact5>7 students like to play basketball</fact5>, the number of students that like to play video games is 8 * <fact5>7</fact5> - 6 = 50.

Next, we need to find the total number of students that like to read, play chess, swim, or play basketball. We know that <fact2>57 students like to read</fact2>, <fact3>8 students like to play chess</fact3>, <fact4>13 students like to swim</fact4>, and <fact5>7 students like to play basketball</fact5>. Therefore, the total number of students that like to read, play chess, swim, or play basketball is <fact2>57</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>7</fact5> = 85.

What percentage of the students like to bake if the number of the students that like to play video games is <fact6>7 less than two times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the number of students that like to play video games. Two times the number that prefer playing hurling is 2 * <fact5>8</fact5> = 16. So, the number of students that like to play video games is 16 - <fact6>7</fact6> = 9. Now, let's find the number of students that like to bake. The total number of students that like to dance, play chess, swim, or play hurling is <fact2>16</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>8</fact5> = 45. Adding the 9 students that like to play video games, we have 45 + 9 = 54 students that do not like to bake. Therefore, the number of students that like to bake is <fact1>90</fact1> - 54 = 36.

What percentage of the students like to read if the number of the students that like to hike is <fact6>3 less than four times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to hike. Since the number of students that like to hike is <fact6>3 less than four times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact6>, we can calculate this as 4 * <fact5>7</fact5> - 3 = 25. Now, we can find the total number of students that like to bake, play chess, swim, play tennis, or hike as <fact2>32</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>7</fact5> + 25 = 85. Since there are <fact1>170 students</fact1> in total, the number of students that like to read is <fact1>170</fact1> - 85 = 85. To find the percentage of students that like to read, we can calculate this as (85 / <fact1>170</fact1>) * 100 = 50%.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to dance is <fact6>3 less than four times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to dance. Since the number of students that like to dance is <fact6>3 less than four times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact6>, we can calculate this as 4 * <fact5>17</fact5> - 3 = 68 - 3 = 65 students.

Now, we can find the total number of students that like to play music, chess, swim, or play tennis. This is <fact2>55</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>17</fact5> = 93 students.

Adding the number of students that like to dance, we have 93 + 65 = 158 students.

Since there are <fact1>200 students</fact1> in total, the number of students that like to play video games is 200 - 158 = 42 students.

To find the percentage of students that like to play video games, we can divide the number of students that like to play video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100. This gives us (42 / <fact1>200</fact1>) * 100 = 21%.

What percentage of the students like to bake if the number of the students that like to play music is <fact6>6 less than two times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to play music. We know that the number of students that like to play music is <fact6>6 less than two times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>. Since <fact5>38 students like to play hurling</fact5>, two times this number is 2 x <fact5>38</fact5> = 76. Then, 6 less than this number is 76 - 6 = 70. So, 70 students like to play music.

Next, we need to find the total number of students that like to read, play chess, swim, or play hurling. This is <fact2>67</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>38</fact5> = 126.

We also know that the total number of students in the class is <fact1>200</fact1>. So, the number of students that like to bake or play music is <fact1>200</fact1> - 126 = 74.

Since 70 students like to play music, the number of students that like to bake is 74 - 70 = 4.

Finally, to find the percentage of students that like to bake, we divide the number of students that like to bake (4) by the total number of students (<fact1>200</fact1>) and multiply by 100: (4 / <fact1>200</fact1>) x 100 = 2%.

What percentage of the students like to dance if the number of the students that like to play video games is <fact6>6 less than four times the number that prefer playing cricket</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the number of students that like to play video games. Since the number of students that like to play video games is <fact6>6 less than four times the number that prefer playing cricket</fact6>, we can calculate this as 4 * <fact5>14</fact5> - 6 = 56 - 6 = 50 students.
Now, let's find the total number of students that like to hike, play chess, swim, or play cricket. This is <fact2>56</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>14</fact5> = 91 students.
We also know that there are <fact1>150 students</fact1> in total. So, the number of students that like to dance or play video games is <fact1>150</fact1> - 91 = 59 students.
Since we already found that 50 students like to play video games, the number of students that like to dance is 59 - 50 = 9 students.
To find the percentage of students that like to dance, we can divide the number of students that like to dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100. This gives us (9 / <fact1>150</fact1>) * 100 = 6%.

What percentage of the students like to paint if the number of the students that like to hike is <fact6>3 less than six times the number that prefer playing cricket</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the number of students that like to hike. Since the number of students that like to hike is <fact6>3 less than six times the number that prefer playing cricket</fact6>, we can calculate this as 6 * <fact5>18</fact5> - 3 = 105. Now, let's find the total number of students that like to bake, play chess, swim, or play cricket. This is <fact2>44</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>18</fact5> = 83. The number of students that like to paint or hike is <fact1>200</fact1> - 83 = 117. Since 105 students like to hike, the number of students that like to paint is 117 - 105 = 12. To find the percentage, we can divide the number of students that like to paint (12) by the total number of students (<fact1>200</fact1>) and multiply by 100.

The number of students who like to play video games or hike is <fact1>200</fact1> - 116 = 84.
Since 76 students like to hike, the number of students who like to play video games is 84 - 76 = 8.

What percentage of the students like to paint if the number of the students that like to play music is <fact6>3 less than thrice the number that prefer playing cricket</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students that like to play music. Since the number of students that like to play music is <fact6>3 less than thrice the number that prefer playing cricket</fact6>, we can calculate it as 3 * <fact5>54</fact5> - 3 = 159.
Next, we need to find the total number of students that like to bake, play chess, swim, or play cricket. This is <fact2>32</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>54</fact5> = 107.
Now, we can find the number of students that like to paint or play music by subtracting the total number of students with other hobbies from the total number of students: <fact1>280</fact1> - 107 = 173.
Since we already know that 159 students like to play music, the number of students that like to paint is 173 - 159 = 14.

The kernels increase to <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate in the next 26 seconds</fact3>. In the final 26 seconds, the popping slows down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 26 seconds</fact4>. After DeShawn takes the skillet off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>. Deshawn gives <fact6>1/5 of the made popcorn to his brother Yusuf</fact6>. How many more pieces of popcorn does DeShawn have to eat than his brother?

Answer: In the first 26 seconds, <fact1>70 kernels popped</fact1>. In the next 26 seconds, <fact2>2 times that amount</fact2> popped, which is 2 * <fact1>70</fact1> = 140 kernels. In the next 26 seconds, the popping rate increased to <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, which is 4 * <fact1>70</fact1> = 280 kernels. In the final 26 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 26 seconds</fact4>, which is 280 / 2 = 140 kernels. After DeShawn took the skillet off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>, which is 140 / 4 = 35 kernels. So, the total number of kernels that popped is 70 + 140 + 280 + 140 + 35 = 665 kernels. Deshawn gives <fact6>1/5 of the made popcorn to his brother Yusuf</fact6>, which is 665 / 5 = 133 kernels. So, Deshawn has 665 - 133 = 532 kernels to eat, and his brother has 133 kernels to eat. Therefore, Deshawn has 532 - 133 = 399 more kernels to eat than his brother.

In the next 26 seconds, the popping rate increased to <fact3>6 times the initial rate</fact3>, so 6 x <fact1>100</fact1> = 600 kernels popped. In the final 26 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 26 seconds</fact4>, so (1/2) x 600 = 300 kernels popped. After taking the skillet off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds</fact5> also popped, which is (1/4) x 300 = 75 kernels. In total, 100 + 200 + 600 + 300 + 75 = 1275 kernels popped. Pavel gives <fact6>one-fifth of the made popcorn to his brother Faisal</fact6>, which is (1/5) x 1275 = 255 kernels. So, Pavel has 1275 - 255 = 1020 kernels to eat, and his brother has 255 kernels to eat. Therefore, Pavel has 1020 - 255 = 765 more kernels to eat than his brother.

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information in <fact1>the ratio of 48:12 for teaspoons of sugar to cups of water</fact1>. We can represent the number of teaspoons of sugar as 48x and the number of cups of water as 12x. 

From <fact2>the ratio of 7 tablespoons of milk to 7 cups of water</fact2>, we can represent the number of tablespoons of milk as (7/7)*12x = 12x. 

From <fact3>the ratio of 2 tablespoons of heavy cream to 1 teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, we can represent the number of tablespoons of heavy cream as 2*48x = 96x.

We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is <fact4>210</fact4>. So, we can set up the equation: 48x + 12x + 96x + 12x = 210.

Combine like terms: 168x = 210.

Divide both sides by 168: x = 210/168 = 1.25.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar: 48x = 48*1.25 = 60.

She used a total of <fact4>230 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information in <fact1>the ratio of 45:30 for teaspoons of sugar to cups of water</fact1>. We can write an equation based on this ratio: 
Let's assume that the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 45x and the number of cups of water used is 30x.
From <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 3 cups of water</fact2>, we can calculate the number of tablespoons of milk used as (6/3)*30x = 60x.
From <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, we can calculate the number of tablespoons of heavy cream used as 2*45x = 90x.
We know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk used is <fact4>230</fact4>. So, we can write the equation: 45x + 30x + 60x + 90x = 230.
Combine like terms: 225x = 230.
Divide both sides by 225: x = 230/225 = 1.0222 (approximately).
Since x is approximately 1.0222, we can calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar used as 45x = 45*1.0222 = 46 (approximately).

Answer: Let's assume Haruka used x teaspoons of sugar. According to <fact1>the ratio of 45:27</fact1>, she used (27/45)x cups of water. According to <fact2>the milk ratio</fact2>, she used ((27/45)x * 10)/10 = (27/45)x tablespoons of milk, but since the 10's cancel out, the milk ratio is actually the same as the water ratio, so she used (27/45)x tablespoons of milk. According to <fact3>the cream ratio</fact3>, she used 2x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is x + (27/45)x + (27/45)x + 2x, which equals <fact4>210</fact4>. We can now solve for x: x + (27/45)x + (27/45)x + 2x = 210. Combining like terms, we get (1 + 27/45 + 27/45 + 2)x = 210. Simplifying, we get (1 + 54/45 + 2)x = 210. Converting 1 and 2 into fractions with a denominator of 45, we get (45/45 + 54/45 + 90/45)x = 210. Adding the fractions, we get (189/45)x = 210. Multiplying both sides by 45, we get 189x = 9450.

She also uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 3 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information that Valeria used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. We can represent the number of teaspoons of sugar as ""s"", the number of cups of water as ""w"", the number of tablespoons of cream as ""c"", and the number of tablespoons of milk as ""m"". We know that s + w + c + m = 220.

From the ratio <fact1>60:6</fact1>, we can write an equation: s/w = 60/6, which simplifies to s/w = 10. We can rewrite this as s = 10w.

We also know that <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk are used for every 3 cups of water</fact2>, so m/w = 7/3.

Additionally, <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, so c/s = 2/1.

Now we can substitute these expressions into the original equation: s + w + c + m = 220. Substituting s = 10w, m = (7/3)w, and c = 2s, we get:

10w + w + 2(10w) + (7/3)w = 220

Combine like terms:

10w + w + 20w + (7/3)w = 220

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

30w + 3w + 60w + 7w = 660

Combine like terms:

100w = 660

Divide both sides by 100:

w = 6.6

Now that we know w, we can find s:

s = 10w
= 10(6.6)
= 66

So Valeria used 66 teaspoons of sugar.

She used a total of <fact4>180 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information in <fact1>the ratio of 45:5 for teaspoons of sugar to cups of water</fact1>. We can write an equation using this ratio: 45x + 5x, where x is a multiplier. 

We also know from <fact2>the ratio of milk to water</fact2> that 6 tablespoons of milk are used for every 3 cups of water. Since the water ratio is 5, we need to find a common multiple for 3 and 5, which is 15. So, the ratio of milk to water becomes 6*5:3*5 = 30:15. Now we can simplify this ratio to 6:3, and we can see that for every 5 cups of water, 10 tablespoons of milk are used. We can now add this to our equation: 45x + 5x + 10x.

Next, we know from <fact3>the ratio of heavy cream to sugar</fact3> that 2 tablespoons of heavy cream are used for every teaspoon of sugar. Since the sugar ratio is 45, we can add this to our equation: 45x + 5x + 10x + 90x.

Now we can set up an equation using the information in <fact4>the total amount of ingredients used</fact4>: 45x + 5x + 10x + 90x = 180. 

Combine like terms: 150x = 180. 

Divide both sides by 150: x = 180/150 = 6/5.

Since x is a multiplier, we can multiply it by the original sugar ratio to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 45 * (6/5) = 54.

According to <fact2>the milk ratio</fact2>, she used (9/10)*(10x/57) = 9x/57 tablespoons of milk. According to <fact3>the cream ratio</fact3>, she used 2x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is x + 10x/57 + 9x/57 + 2x = <fact4>220</fact4>. Solving for x, we get x + 10x/57 + 9x/57 + 2x = 220, which simplifies to x*(1 + 10/57 + 9/57 + 2) = 220. This further simplifies to x*(1 + 19/57 + 2) = 220, which is x*(3 + 19/57) = 220. Then x*(171/57 + 19/57) = 220, which is x*(190/57) = 220. Multiplying both sides by 57/190, we get x = 220*(57/190), which is x = 66.

She also uses <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 3 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>240 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information that Mia uses <fact1>teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 45:27</fact1>. We can represent the number of teaspoons of sugar as 45x and the number of cups of water as 27x, where x is a constant.

We also know that Mia uses <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 3 cups of water</fact2>. Since she uses 27x cups of water, she will use (27x/3)*6 = 54x tablespoons of milk.

Additionally, Mia uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. Since she uses 45x teaspoons of sugar, she will use 45x*2 = 90x tablespoons of heavy cream.

The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is <fact4>240</fact4>. We can set up the equation:

45x + 27x + 54x + 90x = 240

Combine like terms:

216x = 240

Divide by 216:

x = 240/216
x = 10/9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar:

45x = 45(10/9)
= 50

So, Mia used 50 teaspoons of sugar.

She used a total of <fact4>190 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's start by using the information that Winnie uses <fact1>teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in a ratio of 45:12</fact1>. We can write an equation based on this ratio: 
Let s be the number of teaspoons of sugar and w be the number of cups of water. 
We have s/w = 45/12, which simplifies to s = (15/4)w. 
We also know that Winnie uses <fact2>6 tablespoons of milk for every 24 cups of water</fact2>, so the number of tablespoons of milk is (6/24)w = (1/4)w. 
Additionally, Winnie uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, so the number of tablespoons of heavy cream is 2s. 
The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is given as <fact4>190</fact4>. 
We can write the equation: s + w + (1/4)w + 2s = 190. 
Substituting s = (15/4)w into this equation, we get (15/4)w + w + (1/4)w + 2*(15/4)w = 190. 
This simplifies to (15/4)w + w + (1/4)w + (15/2)w = 190. 
Combine like terms: (15/4 + 1 + 1/4 + 15/2)w = 190. 
This simplifies to (15/4 + 4/4 + 1/4 + 30/4)w = 190. 
Combine like terms: (50/4)w = 190. 
Multiply both sides by 4: 50w = 760. 
Divide both sides by 50: w = 760/50 = 15.2. 
Now that we have the value of w, we can find the value of s using the equation s = (15/4)w. 
Substituting w = 15.2, we get s = (15/4)(15.2) = 57. 
So, Winnie used 57 teaspoons of sugar.

Carlos has <fact1>80 square meters of kiwi field</fact1>. There are <fact2>29 kiwis per four-sixths of a square meter</fact2>. Carlos can harvest his kiwis every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. In addition, Carlos owns a <fact4>10-square meter apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>17 apricots per square meter</fact5>. The apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more kiwis does Carlos harvest than apricots?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many kiwis Carlos can harvest in two years. Since there are <fact2>29 kiwis per four-sixths of a square meter</fact2>, we need to find out how many four-sixths of a square meter are in <fact1>80 square meters of kiwi field</fact1>. To do this, we multiply 80 by 6/4 to get 120. Then we multiply 120 by <fact2>29 kiwis per four-sixths of a square meter</fact2> to get 3480 kiwis. Since Carlos can harvest his kiwis every <fact3>12 months</fact3> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Carlos can harvest 3480 kiwis twice in two years for a total of 6960 kiwis.

Next, we need to find out how many apricots Carlos can harvest in two years. Since Carlos owns a <fact4>10-square meter apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>17 apricots per square meter</fact5>, we multiply 10 by 17 to get 170 apricots. Since the apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Carlos can harvest 170 apricots 6 times in two years for a total of 1020 apricots.

Finally, we subtract the number of apricots from the number of kiwis to find out how many more kiwis Carlos harvests than apricots. 6960 - 1020 = 5940.

In addition, <fact4>DeShawn owns a 11-hectare orange field</fact4> that produces <fact5>14 oranges per hectare</fact5>. The oranges can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more bananas does DeShawn harvest than oranges?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas and oranges DeShawn can harvest in two years. 
Since <fact3>bananas can be harvested every 3 months</fact3>, in <fact7>two years</fact7> (24 months), DeShawn can harvest bananas 24 / 3 = 8 times. 
Since <fact6>oranges can be harvested every 4 months</fact6>, in <fact7>two years</fact7> (24 months), DeShawn can harvest oranges 24 / 4 = 6 times. 
Now, we need to find out how many bananas and oranges DeShawn can harvest in one harvest. 
Since there are <fact2>20 bananas per 2/4 of a hectare</fact2>, there are 20 * 2 = 40 bananas per hectare. 
So, in <fact1>10 hectares of banana field</fact1>, DeShawn can harvest 40 * 10 = 400 bananas per harvest. 
In <fact4>11-hectare orange field</fact4>, DeShawn can harvest <fact5>14 oranges per hectare</fact5> * 11 hectares = 154 oranges per harvest. 
Now, we can find out how many bananas and oranges DeShawn can harvest in two years. 
DeShawn can harvest bananas 8 times in two years, so he can harvest 400 * 8 = 3200 bananas in two years. 
DeShawn can harvest oranges 6 times in two years, so he can harvest 154 * 6 = 924 oranges in two years. 
Finally, we can find out how many more bananas DeShawn harvests than oranges in two years. 
DeShawn harvests 3200 - 924 = 2276 more bananas than oranges in two years.

The pineapples can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more grapes does DeShawn harvest than pineapples?

Answer: Since there are <fact2>33 grapes per one-eighth of a hectare</fact2>, there are 8 * <fact2>33</fact2> = 264 grapes per hectare. So, <fact1>Deshawn's 10 hectares of grape field</fact1> will produce 264 * 10 = 2640 grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. Since <fact7>two years</fact7> is 24 months, Deshawn will harvest his grapes twice in this time period, resulting in a total of 2640 * 2 = 5280 grapes.

On the other hand, <fact4>DeShawn's 10-hectare pineapple field</fact4> will produce <fact5>18 pineapples per hectare</fact5> * 10 hectares = 180 pineapples every <fact6>4 months</fact6>.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more pears does Noah harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the number of pears Noah harvests in two years. Since there are <fact2>13 pears per two-sixths of a hectare</fact2>, we need to calculate how many two-sixths of a hectare are in <fact1>85 hectares of pear field</fact1>. Two-sixths of a hectare is equal to 1/3 of a hectare. So, the number of two-sixths of a hectare in 85 hectares is 85 * 3 = 255. Therefore, the number of pears per harvest is 255 * <fact2>13 pears</fact2> = 3315 pears. Since Noah can harvest his pears every <fact3>12 months</fact3> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest pears twice in two years. So, the total number of pears harvested in two years is 3315 * 2 = 6630 pears.

Next, we need to calculate the number of apricots Noah harvests in two years. Since the apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest apricots 24 / 4 = 6 times in two years. The number of apricots per harvest is <fact4>11 hectares</fact4> * <fact5>12 apricots per hectare</fact5> = 132 apricots. So, the total number of apricots harvested in two years is 132 * 6 = 792 apricots.

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of pears and apricots harvested in two years. The difference is 6630 - 792 = 5838.

The oranges can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more kiwis does Oliver harvest than oranges?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of kiwis harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>15 kiwis per two-fourths of a hectare</fact2>, there are 15 * 2 = 30 kiwis per hectare. With <fact1>55 hectares of kiwi field</fact1>, the total number of kiwis harvested per cycle is 55 * 30 = 1650 kiwis. Since Oliver can harvest his kiwis every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, there are 2 * 12 / 6 = 4 harvest cycles in <fact7>two years</fact7>. So, the total number of kiwis harvested in two years is 1650 * 4 = 6600 kiwis.

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges harvested in two years. With <fact4>9-hectare orange field</fact4> and <fact5>12 oranges per hectare</fact5>, the total number of oranges harvested per cycle is 9 * 12 = 108 oranges.

The kiwis can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more pomegranates does Hiroshi harvest than kiwis?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pomegranates harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>30 pomegranates per one-half of a hectare</fact2>, there are 30 * 2 = 60 pomegranates per hectare. With <fact1>5 hectares of pomegranate field</fact1>, the total number of pomegranates per harvest is 60 * 5 = 300 pomegranates. Since Hiroshi can harvest his pomegranates every <fact3>1 month</fact3>, and there are 12 months in a year, he can harvest pomegranates 12 * <fact7>2</fact7> = 24 times in two years. So, the total number of pomegranates harvested in two years is 300 * 24 = 7200 pomegranates.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years. Since Luis can harvest his grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of grapes per square meter is <fact2>16 grapes per five-sixths of a square meter</fact2>, so the number of grapes per square meter is 16 / (5/6) = 16 * 6 / 5 = 96 / 5 = 19.2 grapes per square meter. Therefore, the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years is 2 * <fact1>60 square meters of grape field</fact1> * 19.2 grapes per square meter = 2 * 60 * 19.2 = 2304 grapes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more bananas does Mohammed harvest than oranges?

Answer: 
There are 10 one-tenths in one square meter, so Mohammed's banana field produces <fact2>22 bananas per one-tenth of a square meter</fact2> * 10 one-tenths per square meter * <fact1>5 square meters of banana field</fact1> = 1100 bananas every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. Since there are 12 months in a year, Mohammed harvests bananas <fact7>two years</fact7> * 12 months per year / <fact3>12 months</fact3> per harvest = 2 times. So, Mohammed harvests 1100 bananas per harvest * 2 harvests = 2200 bananas. 
Mohammed's orange field produces <fact5>17 oranges per square meter</fact5> * <fact4>13 square meters of orange field</fact4> = 221 oranges every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. Since there are 12 months in a year, Mohammed harvests oranges <fact7>two years</fact7> * 12 months per year / <fact6>4 months</fact6> per harvest = 6 times.

The apples can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more pineapples does Pavel harvest than apples?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pineapples Pavel can harvest in two years. Since there are <fact2>27 pineapples per 1/2 of a hectare</fact2>, we can multiply this by 2 to get the number of pineapples per hectare, which is 27 * 2 = 54 pineapples per hectare. Then, we can multiply this by the total number of hectares of pineapple field, which is <fact1>35 hectares</fact1>, to get the total number of pineapples: 54 * 35 = 1890 pineapples. Since Pavel can harvest his pineapples every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest his pineapples twice in two years. Therefore, the total number of pineapples Pavel can harvest in two years is 1890 * 2 = 3780 pineapples.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of apples Pavel can harvest in two years. Since the <fact4>10-hectare apple field</fact4> produces <fact5>15 apples per hectare</fact5>, the total number of apples per harvest is 10 * 15 = 150 apples. Since the apples can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Pavel can harvest his apples 24 / 4 = 6 times in two years. Therefore, the total number of apples Pavel can harvest in two years is 150 * 6 = 900 apples.

Finally, we can subtract the total number of apples from the total number of pineapples to find the difference: 3780 - 900 = 2880. Therefore, Pavel harvests 2880 more pineapples than apples in two years.

James can harvest his oranges every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. In addition, James owns a <fact4>10-square yard apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>18 apricots per square yard</fact5>. The apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more oranges does James harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of oranges James can harvest in two years. Since James can harvest his oranges every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of oranges per square yard is <fact2>22 oranges per three-fifths of a square yard</fact2>, so for <fact1>55 square yards of orange field</fact1>, the total number of oranges harvested per year is <fact2>22</fact2> * (<fact1>55</fact1> / (3/5)) = <fact2>22</fact2> * (<fact1>55</fact1> * (5/3)) = 22 * 91.67 = 2016.67. Since James can harvest twice in two years, the total number of oranges harvested in two years is 2016.67 * 2 = 4033.33.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of apricots James can harvest in two years. Since the apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, James can harvest 6 times in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of apricots per square yard is <fact5>18 apricots per square yard</fact5>, so for <fact4>10-square yard apricot field</fact4>, the total number of apricots harvested per harvest is <fact5>18</fact5> * <fact4>10</fact4> = 180. Since James can harvest 6 times in two years, the total number of apricots harvested in two years is 180 * 6 = 1080.

Finally, we subtract the total number of apricots harvested from the total number of oranges harvested to find the difference. The difference is 4033.33 - 1080 = 2953.33.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more plums does Benjamin harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of plums Benjamin harvests in two years. Since <fact3>Benjamin can harvest his plums every 6 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice a year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 2 * 2 = 4 times. 
Since there are <fact2>20 plums per one-seventh of a hectare</fact2>, there are 20 * 7 = 140 plums per hectare. 
<fact1>Benjamin has 10 hectares of plum field</fact1>, so he has 10 * 140 = 1400 plums per harvest. 
In 4 harvests, he will have 1400 * 4 = 5600 plums.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of apricots Benjamin harvests in two years. Since the <fact6>apricots can be harvested every 4 months</fact6>, he can harvest 3 times a year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 3 * 2 = 6 times. 
<fact4>Benjamin owns a 11-hectare apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>17 apricots per hectare</fact5>, so he has 11 * 17 = 187 apricots per harvest. 
In 6 harvests, he will have 187 * 6 = 1122 apricots.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>27 plums per 1/5 of a square yard</fact2>, there are 27 * 5 = 135 plums per square yard. With <fact1>30 square yards of plum field</fact1>, the total number of plums harvested per cycle is 135 * 30 = 4050 plums. Since Andre can harvest his plums every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, and there are <fact7>two years</fact7> (24 months), he can harvest plums twice, resulting in a total of 4050 * 2 = 8100 plums.

Next, we calculate the total number of oranges harvested in two years. With <fact4>8-square yard orange field</fact4> and <fact5>17 oranges per square yard</fact5>, the total number of oranges harvested per cycle is 8 * 17 = 136 oranges.

The kiwis can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more pears does Faisal harvest than kiwis?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pears Faisal harvests in two years. Since Faisal can harvest his pears every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of pears per square yard is <fact2>19 pears per 2/5 of a square yard</fact2>, which is equivalent to 19 / (2/5) = 19 * (5/2) = 47.5 pears per square yard. Since Faisal has <fact1>80 square yards of pear field</fact1>, the total number of pears he can harvest in one year is 47.5 * 80 = 3800 pears. Therefore, the total number of pears Faisal harvests in two years is 3800 * 2 = 7600 pears.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of kiwis Faisal harvests in two years. Since the kiwis can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Faisal can harvest 6 times in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of kiwis per square yard is <fact5>18 kiwis per square yard</fact5>.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pears Andre can harvest in two years. Since there are <fact2>35 pears per 2/3 of a square yard</fact2>, we can calculate the number of pears per square yard as <fact2>35</fact2> / (2/3) = 52.5 pears per square yard. With <fact1>5 square yards of pear field</fact1>, the total number of pears per harvest is 52.5 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 262.5 pears. Since Andre can harvest his pears every <fact3>3 months</fact3>, he can harvest 8 times in <fact7>two years</fact7> (24 months / <fact3>3 months</fact3> = 8).

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pomegranates Qasim harvests in two years. Since there are <fact2>20 pomegranates per four-sixths of a square meter</fact2>, we need to calculate how many four-sixths of a square meter are in <fact1>50 square meters</fact1>. To do this, we multiply 50 by 6/4 to get 75. Then, we multiply 75 by <fact2>20 pomegranates</fact2> to get 1500 pomegranates per harvest. Since Qasim can harvest his pomegranates every <fact3>12 months</fact3> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Qasim can harvest his pomegranates twice in two years. Therefore, the total number of pomegranates Qasim harvests in two years is 1500 * 2 = 3000.

Xavier can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>. In addition, Xavier owns a <fact4>11-square meter plum field</fact4> that produces <fact5>13 plums per square meter</fact5>. The plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apples does Xavier harvest than plums?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apples harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>13 apples per four-fifths of a square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the number of apples per square meter as 13 / (4/5) = 16.25 apples per square meter. With <fact1>65 square meters of apple field</fact1>, the total number of apples harvested in one round is 65 * 16.25 = 1056.25 apples. Since Xavier can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 4 times. So, the total number of apples harvested in two years is 1056.25 * 4 = 4225 apples.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With <fact4>11-square meter plum field</fact4> and <fact5>13 plums per square meter</fact5>, the total number of plums harvested in one round is 11 * 13 = 143 plums. Since the plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Xavier can harvest 3 times in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 6 times. So, the total number of plums harvested in two years is 143 * 6 = 858 plums.

Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of apples and plums harvested in two years. The difference is 4225 - 858 = 3367.

The plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apricots does Alejandro harvest than plums?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apricots harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>12 apricots per one-half of a square meter</fact2>, there are 12 * 2 = 24 apricots per square meter. With <fact1>85 square meters of apricot field</fact1>, Alejandro can harvest 85 * 24 = 2040 apricots every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. Since he can harvest apricots every 12 months, in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest apricots 2 times, resulting in a total of 2040 * 2 = 4080 apricots.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With <fact4>12-square meter plum field</fact4> and <fact5>14 plums per square meter</fact5>, Alejandro can harvest 12 * 14 = 168 plums every <fact6>4 months</fact6>.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more plums does Bodhi harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many plums Bodhi can harvest in 2 years. Since Bodhi can harvest his plums every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, he can harvest 2 times per year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 2 * 2 = 4 times. 
Since there are <fact2>36 plums per 1/7 of a square yard</fact2>, there are 36 * 7 = 252 plums per square yard. 
Bodhi has <fact1>5 square yards of plum field</fact1>, so he has 5 * 252 = 1260 plums. 
Since he can harvest 4 times in 2 years, he can harvest 1260 * 4 = 5040 plums in <fact7>two years</fact7>. 
Now, let's find out how many apricots Bodhi can harvest in 2 years. Since Bodhi can harvest his apricots every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, he can harvest 3 times per year. In <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 3 * 2 = 6 times. 
Bodhi's <fact4>10-square yard apricot field</fact4> produces <fact5>15 apricots per square yard</fact5>, so he has 10 * 15 = 150 apricots. 
Since he can harvest 6 times in 2 years, he can harvest 150 * 6 = 900 apricots in <fact7>two years</fact7>. 
Therefore, Bodhi harvests 5040 - 900 = 4140 more plums than apricots in <fact7>two years</fact7>.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more kiwis does Yusuf harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many kiwis Yusuf can harvest in 2 years. Since Yusuf can harvest his kiwis every <fact3>4 months</fact3> and there are <fact7>2 years</fact7> * 12 months/year / <fact3>4 months</fact3> = 6 harvests, we can multiply the number of kiwis he can harvest in one harvest by 6. There are <fact2>18 kiwis per 3/4 of a square yard</fact2>, so there are <fact2>18 kiwis</fact2> / (3/4) = 24 kiwis per square yard. Since Yusuf has <fact1>10 square yards of kiwi field</fact1>, he can harvest 24 kiwis/square yard * <fact1>10 square yards</fact1> = 240 kiwis every 4 months. In 2 years, he can harvest 240 kiwis * 6 = 1440 kiwis.

In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apricots does Theo harvest than pineapples?

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many apricots Theo can harvest in two years. Since there are <fact2>29 apricots per three-sixths of a square meter</fact2>, we need to find out how many three-sixths are in <fact1>5 square meters</fact1>. Since three-sixths is half, there are 2 three-sixths in 1 square meter. Therefore, there are 2 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 10 three-sixths in <fact1>5 square meters</fact1>. So, the total number of apricots that can be harvested in one month is <fact2>29</fact2> * 10 = 290 apricots.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes Ravi harvests in two years. Since there are <fact2>23 grapes per three-fifths of a square yard</fact2>, we need to calculate the number of three-fifths of a square yard in <fact1>85 square yards of grape field</fact1>. To do this, we multiply 85 by 3/5, which equals 51. Then, we multiply 51 by <fact2>23 grapes</fact2> to get 1173 grapes. Since Ravi can harvest his grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3> and there are 24 months in <fact7>two years</fact7>, Ravi can harvest his grapes twice in two years. Therefore, the total number of grapes Ravi harvests in two years is 1173 * 2 = 2346 grapes.

The weight of carrots is <fact2>fourteen 5-kg bags</fact2> = 14 * 5 = 70 kg. The weight of apples is <fact3>thirty one 37-kg packs</fact3> = 31 * 37 = 1147 kg. The weight of oats is <fact4>sixteen 17-kg sacks</fact4> = 16 * 17 = 272 kg. The weight of groceries is <fact5>43 kgs</fact5>, the weight of tools is <fact6>27 kgs</fact6>, and the weight of wood is <fact7>100 kgs</fact7>. So, the total weight is 21 + 70 + 1147 + 272 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 1680 kg.

Since each truck can carry <fact8>140 kgs at a time</fact8>, and there are <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, the total weight that can be carried in one trip is 3 * 140 = 420 kg. To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the weight that can be carried in one trip: 1680 / 420 = 4.

He also buys <fact5>43 pounds of groceries</fact5>, <fact6>27 pounds of tools</fact6>, and <fact7>100 pounds of wood</fact7>. So the total weight of all items is 36 + 84 + 1408 + 342 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 2040 pounds. Since each truck can carry <fact8>170 pounds at a time</fact8> and there are <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, the total weight that can be carried per trip is 3 * 170 = 510 pounds. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2040 / 510 = 4 trips to transport all the purchased items.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many golf balls and tennis balls there are. Since a <fact2>fifth of the balls are golf balls</fact2>, the number of golf balls is <fact1>240</fact1> / 5 = 48. The rest are tennis balls, so there are <fact1>240</fact1> - 48 = 192 tennis balls.

Next, we need to find out how many blue golf balls are marked. A <fact3>third of the golf balls are blue</fact3>, so there are 48 / 3 = 16 blue golf balls. A <fact4>quarter of these blue golf balls are marked</fact4>, so there are 16 / 4 = 4 marked blue golf balls.

Now, we need to find out how many orange tennis balls are marked. An <fact5>eighth of the tennis balls are orange</fact5>, so there are 192 / 8 = 24 orange tennis balls.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of golf balls. Since a <fact2>fifth of the balls are golf balls</fact2>, we can calculate the number of golf balls as <fact1>420</fact1> / 5 = 84 golf balls.

Next, we need to find the number of teal golf balls that are marked. We know that <fact3>1/4 of the golf balls are teal</fact3>, so the number of teal golf balls is 84 / 4 = 21. Since <fact4>1/3 of these teal golf balls are marked</fact4>, the number of marked teal golf balls is 21 / 3 = 7.

Now, we need to find the number of tennis balls. Since there are <fact1>420 balls</fact1> in total and 84 of them are golf balls, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>420</fact1> - 84 = 336.

We also know that <fact5>1/4 of the tennis balls are brown</fact5>, so the number of brown tennis balls is 336 / 4 = 84. Since all except <fact6>1/6 of these brown balls are marked</fact6>, the number of marked brown tennis balls is 84 - (84 / 6) = 84 - 14 = 70.

Since <fact3>the rest are golf balls</fact3>, the number of golf balls is <fact1>120</fact1> - 24 = 96. 
Now, we need to find out how many marked tennis balls there are. Since <fact4>1/6 of the tennis balls are orange</fact4>, the number of orange tennis balls is 24 * <fact4>1/6</fact4> = 4. 
Since <fact5>half of the orange tennis balls are marked</fact5>, the number of marked tennis balls is 4 * <fact5>1/2</fact5> = 2. 
Next, we need to find out how many marked golf balls there are. Since <fact6>1/8 of the golf balls are blue</fact6>, the number of blue golf balls is 96 * <fact6>1/8</fact6> = 12. 
Since <fact7>all except a quarter of those blue balls are marked</fact7>, the number of marked golf balls is 12 * <fact7>3/4</fact7> = 9. 
Finally, we add the number of marked tennis balls and golf balls to get the total number of marked balls: 2 + 9 = 11.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since <fact2>a third of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>600</fact1> / 3 = 200. This means that the number of golf balls is <fact1>600</fact1> - 200 = 400.

Next, we need to find out how many marked tennis balls there are. We know that <fact3>1/5 of the tennis balls are turquoise</fact3>, so the number of turquoise tennis balls is 200 / 5 = 40. Since <fact4>a quarter of these are marked</fact4>, the number of marked tennis balls is 40 / 4 = 10.

Now, we need to find out how many marked golf balls there are. We know that <fact5>1/3 of the golf balls are yellow</fact5>, so the number of yellow golf balls is 400 / 3 = 133.33 (round down to 133 since we can't have a fraction of a ball). Since all except <fact6>1/4 of these are marked</fact6>, the number of marked golf balls is 133 - (133 / 4) = 133 - 33.25 = 99.75 (round down to 99 since we can't have a fraction of a ball).

Finally, we add the number of marked tennis balls and golf balls to get the total number of marked balls: 10 + 99 = 109.

Answer: There are <fact1>200 balls</fact1> in total. <fact2>A tenth of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, so there are <fact1>200</fact1> * <fact2>1/10</fact2> = 20 tennis balls. The rest are golf balls, so there are <fact1>200</fact1> - 20 = 180 golf balls. 
Of the tennis balls, <fact3>1/10 of the tennis balls are teal</fact3>, so there are 20 * <fact3>1/10</fact3> = 2 teal tennis balls. Of those, <fact4>half are marked</fact4>, so there is 2 * <fact4>1/2</fact4> = 1 marked teal tennis ball.
Of the golf balls, <fact5>1/8 of the golf balls are magenta</fact5>, so there are 180 * <fact5>1/8</fact5> = 22.5 magenta golf balls.

If your total bill is more than <fact6>¥15</fact6>, you get a <fact7>10% discount on your total bill</fact7>. How much would a <fact8>80-minute call</fact8> cost?

Answer: The call can be divided into three parts: the first <fact2>10 minutes</fact2>, the next <fact4>30 minutes</fact4> - <fact2>10 minutes</fact2> = 20 minutes, and the remaining <fact8>80 minutes</fact8> - <fact4>30 minutes</fact4> = 50 minutes. 
For the first <fact2>10 minutes</fact2>, the cost is <fact1>¥0.8 per minute</fact1> * <fact2>10 minutes</fact2> = ¥8.
For the next 20 minutes, the cost is <fact3>¥0.6 per minute</fact3> * 20 minutes = ¥12.
For the remaining 50 minutes, the cost is <fact5>¥0.4 per two minutes</fact5> * (50 minutes / 2) = ¥10.
The total cost is ¥8 + ¥12 + ¥10 = ¥30.
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>¥15</fact6>, a <fact7>10% discount</fact7> is applied, making the final cost ¥30 - (¥30 * 0.1) = ¥27.

Answer: The call can be divided into three parts: the first <fact2>10 minutes</fact2>, the next <fact4>35</fact4> - <fact2>10</fact2> = 25 minutes, and the last <fact8>55</fact8> - <fact4>35</fact4> = 20 minutes. 
For the first <fact2>10 minutes</fact2>, the cost is <fact1>$0.7 per minute</fact1> * <fact2>10 minutes</fact2> = $7. 
For the next 25 minutes, the cost is <fact3>$0.4 per minute</fact3> * 25 minutes = $10. 
For the last 20 minutes, the cost is <fact5>$0.3 per two minutes</fact5> * (20/2) = $3. 
So the total cost before discount is $7 + $10 + $3 = $20. 
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>$15</fact6>, a <fact7>15% discount</fact7> is applied. 
The discount amount is $20 * <fact7>15%</fact7> = $3. 
So the final cost is $20 - $3 = $17.

Answer: To calculate the cost of the call, we need to break it down into three parts: the first 15 minutes, the next 20 minutes, and the remaining 70 minutes. 
The first <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> cost <fact1>€0.8 per minute</fact1>, so the total cost for this part is <fact1>€0.8</fact1> * <fact2>15</fact2> = €12.
The next 20 minutes cost <fact3>€0.7 per minute</fact3>, so the total cost for this part is <fact3>€0.7</fact3> * 20 = €14.
The remaining 70 minutes are charged at a rate of <fact5>€0.4 per two minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to €0.2 per minute. So, the total cost for this part is €0.2 * 70 = €14.
The total cost of the call is €12 + €14 + €14 = €40.
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>€15</fact6>, we get a <fact7>20% discount on the total bill</fact7>. The discount amount is €40 * 0.2 = €8.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. The giant cubes use <fact2>13 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> = 117 ounces. The medium cubes use <fact3>3 ounces</fact3> * <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 36 ounces. The small cubes use <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> * <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> = 7 ounces.

Answer: Mateo used <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7> = 120 ounces to make the giant cubes.
He used <fact3>6 ounces</fact3> * <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 72 ounces to make the medium cubes.
He used <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> * <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> = 7 ounces to make the small cubes.

Answer: To find out how many ounces of water Ali has left, we first need to calculate how many ounces of water he used to make the ice cubes. He made <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7> using <fact2>16 ounces per cube</fact2>, so he used <fact7>10</fact7> * <fact2>16</fact2> = 160 ounces of water for the giant cubes. He made <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> using <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> per cube, so he used <fact9>12</fact9> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 48 ounces of water for the medium cubes.

Since Ali made <fact6>48 total ice cubes</fact6> and we already know he made <fact7>10 giant cubes</fact7>, <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8>, and <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9>, the number of tiny cubes he made is <fact6>48</fact6> - <fact7>10</fact7> - <fact8>14</fact8> - <fact9>12</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use <fact4>0.5</fact4> / 2 = 0.25 ounces per cube. So, he used 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces of water for the tiny cubes.

In total, Ali used 160 + 48 + 7 + 3 = 218 ounces of water to make the ice cubes. Since he started with <fact1>331 ounces of water</fact1>, he has <fact1>331</fact1> - 218 = 113 ounces of water left.

Since he made a total of <fact6>50 ice cubes</fact6> and we already know he made <fact7>9</fact7> + <fact9>15</fact9> + <fact8>14</fact8> = 38 cubes of other sizes, he must have made 50 - 38 = 12 tiny cubes. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use <fact4>0.5</fact4> / 2 = 0.25 ounces per cube. So he used 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces of water for the tiny cubes.

He makes <fact6>47 total ice cubes</fact6>, including <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7>, <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8>, <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9>, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Viktor have left?

Answer: Viktor used <fact7>9 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2> = 108 ounces of water to make the giant cubes.
He used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> = 48 ounces of water to make the medium cubes.
He used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces of water to make the small cubes.
Since <fact6>47 total ice cubes</fact6> were made, the number of tiny cubes made is 47 - 9 - 14 - 12 = 12 tiny cubes.
Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 0.5 * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 0.25 ounces per cube.
So, Viktor used 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces per cube = 3 ounces of water to make the tiny cubes.
In total, Viktor used 108 + 48 + 7 + 3 = 166 ounces of water to make all the ice cubes.
Therefore, Viktor has <fact1>315 ounces of water</fact1> - 166 ounces of water = 149 ounces of water left.

Answer: Ravi used <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>13 ounces per cube</fact2> = 104 ounces of water to make the giant cubes.
He used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>4 ounces</fact3> = 48 ounces of water to make the medium cubes.
He used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>1/2 of a ounce</fact4> = 7 ounces of water to make the small cubes.
Since Ravi made <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6> and we know that he made <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> + <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> + <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 34 cubes, he must have made 46 - 34 = 12 tiny cubes.
Since the tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they must be 1/2 * <fact4>1/2 of a ounce</fact4> = 1/4 of an ounce.
So, Ravi used 12 tiny cubes * 1/4 of an ounce = 3 ounces of water to make the tiny cubes.
In total, Ravi used 104 + 48 + 7 + 3 = 162 ounces of water to make all the ice cubes.

How many ounces of water does DeShawn have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, DeShawn used <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> * <fact2>14 ounces per cube</fact2> = 112 ounces. For medium cubes, he used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>5 ounces</fact3> = 60 ounces. For small cubes, he used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 0.5 * <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> = 0.25 ounces per cube. We know that DeShawn made <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6>, so the number of tiny cubes is <fact6>46 total ice cubes</fact6> - <fact7>8 giant cubes</fact7> - <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> - <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> = 12 tiny cubes. The amount of water used for tiny cubes is 12 * 0.25 = 3 ounces. Now, we can calculate the total amount of water used: 112 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 182 ounces. Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: <fact1>327 ounces of water</fact1> - 182 ounces = 145 ounces.

Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use <fact4>2/4 of a ounce</fact4> / 2 = 0.25 ounces per cube. So, 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces per cube = 3 ounces. The total amount of water used is 176 + 48 + 7 + 3 = 234 ounces. To find out how many ounces of water Tariq has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount: <fact1>324 ounces of water</fact1> - 234 ounces = 90 ounces.

How many ounces of water does Ibrahim have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, <fact7>12 cubes</fact7> * <fact2>12 ounces per cube</fact2> = 144 ounces. For medium cubes, <fact9>12 cubes</fact9> * <fact3>5 ounces per cube</fact3> = 60 ounces. For small cubes, <fact8>14 cubes</fact8> * <fact4>2/4 ounces per cube</fact4> = 14 * 0.5 = 7 ounces. Since <fact6>50 total ice cubes</fact6> were made, and we know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes, we can find the number of tiny cubes: <fact6>50</fact6> - <fact7>12</fact7> - <fact9>12</fact9> - <fact8>14</fact8> = 12 tiny cubes. Since tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use <fact4>2/4</fact4>/2 = 1/4 ounces per cube. So, 12 tiny cubes use 12 * 1/4 = 3 ounces. Now, we can calculate the total amount of water used: 144 + 60 + 7 + 3 = 214 ounces. Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount: <fact1>318 ounces</fact1> - 214 ounces = 104 ounces.

How many more bowls does Carlos need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Carlos has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Carlos had <fact3>720 almonds</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the almonds</fact7>, he ate 720 / 5 = 144 almonds. So, he has 720 - 144 = 576 almonds left.

Next, we need to find out how many almonds the tables can hold. Since <fact2>each table can hold three times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, each table can hold 24 * 3 = 72 almonds. Since Carlos has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has 1 table left. So, the table can hold 72 almonds.

Now, we need to find out how many almonds the bowls can hold. Since Carlos has <fact4>7 bowls</fact4> and <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, the bowls can hold 7 * 24 = 168 almonds.

The total capacity of the tables and bowls is 72 + 168 = 240 almonds. Since Carlos has 576 almonds left, he needs to place 576 - 240 = 336 more almonds.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, Carlos needs 336 / 24 = 14 more bowls to place all the remaining almonds.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Arash has left after eating one-fourth of them. Since Arash had <fact3>600 crackers</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fourth of all the crackers</fact7>, he ate 600 / 4 = 150 crackers. So, he has 600 - 150 = 450 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers Arash can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact1>each table can hold 25 crackers</fact1> and Arash has <fact4>11 tables</fact4>, he can place 11 x 25 = 275 crackers on the tables. 

Since <fact2>each plate can hold six times</fact2> the number of crackers a table can hold, each plate can hold 6 x <fact1>25</fact1> = 150 crackers.

How many more bowls does Thiago need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Thiago has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the cookies</fact7>. Thiago started with <fact3>600 cookies</fact3> and ate <fact3>600</fact3>/<fact7>5</fact7> = 120 cookies. So, he has <fact3>600</fact3> - 120 = 480 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Thiago can place on the tables and bowls he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Thiago has <fact5>5 tables</fact5> - 2 = 3 tables left. Each table can hold <fact1>20 cookies</fact1> * 2 = 40 cookies (since <fact2>each table can hold two times that</fact2> of a bowl). So, Thiago can place 3 * 40 = 120 cookies on the tables.

Thiago also has <fact4>17 bowls</fact4> and each bowl can hold <fact1>20 cookies</fact1>. So, Thiago can place <fact4>17</fact4> * <fact1>20</fact1> = 340 cookies on the bowls.

In total, Thiago can place 120 + 340 = 460 cookies on the tables and bowls he has. Since he has 480 cookies left, he needs to place 480 - 460 = 20 more cookies.

Since each bowl can hold <fact1>20 cookies</fact1>, Thiago needs 1 more bowl to place the remaining cookies.

How many more plates does Yuki need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Yuki has left after eating two-fifths of them. Since Yuki started with <fact3>720 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>two-fifths of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 2/5 * <fact3>720</fact3> = 288 olives. So, he has <fact3>720</fact3> - 288 = 432 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives Yuki can place on the plates and bowls he has. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold two times</fact2> what <fact1>each plate can hold</fact1>, each bowl can hold 2 * <fact1>24</fact1> = 48 olives. Yuki has <fact4>11 plates</fact4> and <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 bowl left. He can place <fact1>24</fact1> * <fact4>11</fact4> = 264 olives on the plates and 1 * 48 = 48 olives on the bowl, for a total of 264 + 48 = 312 olives.

Since Yuki has 432 olives left and can place 312 olives on the plates and bowls he has, he needs to place 432 - 312 = 120 more olives. Since <fact1>each plate can hold 24 olives</fact1>, he needs 120 / <fact1>24</fact1> = 5 more plates.

Faisal then eats <fact7>one-sixth of all the crackers</fact7>. How many more plates does Faisal need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Faisal has left after eating <fact7>one-sixth of all the crackers</fact7>. Faisal started with <fact3>540 crackers</fact3> and ate <fact3>540</fact3>/<fact7>6</fact7> = 90 crackers. So, he has <fact3>540</fact3> - 90 = 450 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers Faisal can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Faisal has <fact5>4 tables</fact5> - 2 = 2 tables left. Each table can hold <fact1>25 crackers</fact1> * 3 = 75 crackers (since <fact2>each table can hold three times that</fact2> of a plate). So, Faisal can place 2 * 75 = 150 crackers on the tables.

In total, Faisal can place 150 + 175 = 325 crackers on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 450 crackers left, he needs to place 450 - 325 = 125 more crackers.

Since each plate can hold <fact1>25 crackers</fact1>, Faisal needs 125 / <fact1>25</fact1> = 5 more plates to place all the remaining crackers.

How many more tables does Tariq need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Tariq has left after eating <fact7>one-eighth of all the olives</fact7>. Since Tariq started with <fact3>600 olives</fact3>, he ate 600 / 8 = 75 olives. So, he has 600 - 75 = 525 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives Tariq can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact2>each plate can hold six times</fact2> what <fact1>each table can hold</fact1>, each plate can hold 6 * 21 = 126 olives. Tariq has <fact5>4 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 plates left. He can place 2 * 126 = 252 olives on the plates.

Tariq also has <fact4>7 tables</fact4>, and <fact1>each table can hold 21 olives</fact1>. So, he can place 7 * 21 = 147 olives on the tables.

In total, Tariq can place 252 + 147 = 399 olives on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 525 olives left, he needs to place 525 - 399 = 126 more olives.

Since <fact1>each table can hold 21 olives</fact1>, Tariq needs 126 / 21 = 6 more tables to place all the remaining olives.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Wei has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the olives</fact7>. Wei started with <fact3>525 olives</fact3> and ate <fact3>525</fact3>/<fact7>5</fact7> = 105 olives. So, Wei has <fact3>525</fact3> - 105 = 420 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives the plates can hold.

How many more tables does Viktor need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Viktor has left after eating <fact7>one-eighth of all the cookies</fact7>. Viktor had <fact3>720 cookies</fact3> and ate 720/<fact7>8</fact7> = 90 cookies. So, Viktor has 720 - 90 = 630 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Viktor can place on the tables and bowls he has. Viktor has <fact4>11 tables</fact4> and each table can hold <fact1>21 cookies</fact1>, so he can place 11 * 21 = 231 cookies on the tables. Viktor had <fact5>5 bowls</fact5> but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 bowls left. Each bowl can hold <fact2>three times</fact2> as many cookies as a table, which is 3 * <fact1>21 cookies</fact1> = 63 cookies. So, Viktor can place 3 * 63 = 189 cookies on the bowls.

How many more tables does Qasim need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Qasim has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the almonds</fact7>. Since Qasim had <fact3>540 almonds</fact3>, he ate 540 / 5 = 108 almonds. So, he has 540 - 108 = 432 almonds left.

Now, let's find out how many almonds Qasim can place on the tables and bowls he has. He has <fact4>7 tables</fact4> and each table can hold <fact1>24 almonds</fact1>, so he can place 7 x 24 = 168 almonds on the tables. 

As for the bowls, Qasim had <fact5>4 bowls</fact5> but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 4 - 2 = 2 bowls left. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold three times</fact2> as many almonds as a table, each bowl can hold 24 x 3 = 72 almonds. So, Qasim can place 2 x 72 = 144 almonds on the bowls.

In total, Qasim can place 168 + 144 = 312 almonds on the tables and bowls he has. Since he has 432 almonds left, he needs to place 432 - 312 = 120 more almonds.

Since <fact1>each table can hold 24 almonds</fact1>, Qasim needs 120 / 24 = 5 more tables to place all the remaining almonds.

How many more plates does Leon need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Leon has left after eating <fact7>one-ninth of all the bananas</fact7>. To do this, we need to calculate <fact7>one-ninth of all the bananas</fact7>, which is <fact3>675 bananas</fact3> / 9 = 75 bananas. So, Leon has <fact3>675 bananas</fact3> - 75 bananas = 600 bananas left.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Leon can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Leon has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> - 2 tables = 1 table left. Each table can hold <fact2>seven times</fact2> the number of bananas a plate can hold, which is <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> * 7 = 140 bananas. So, Leon can place 140 bananas on the 1 table he has left.

Leon also has <fact4>19 plates</fact4>, and each plate can hold <fact1>20 bananas</fact1>. So, Leon can place <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> * <fact4>19 plates</fact4> = 380 bananas on the plates.

In total, Leon can place 140 bananas + 380 bananas = 520 bananas on the tables and plates he has. Since Leon has 600 bananas left, he needs to place 600 bananas - 520 bananas = 80 bananas on additional plates.

Since each plate can hold <fact1>20 bananas</fact1>, Leon needs 80 bananas / <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> = 4 more plates to place all the remaining bananas.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Ali has left after eating one-fifth of them. Ali eats <fact7>one-fifth</fact7> of <fact3>660 almonds</fact3>, which is 660 / 5 = 132 almonds. So, Ali has 660 - 132 = 528 almonds left.

Since <fact2>each plate can hold seven times</fact2> what <fact1>each table can hold</fact1>, each plate can hold 24 * 7 = 168 almonds.

Ali has <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 plate left. This plate can hold 168 almonds.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Andre has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Andre had <fact3>540 cookies</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the cookies</fact7>, he ate 540 / 5 = 108 cookies. So, he has 540 - 108 = 432 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies the plates can hold. Since <fact2>each plate can hold three times</fact2> the number of cookies a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 cookies</fact1>, each plate can hold 24 * 3 = 72 cookies. Since Andre has <fact5>4 plates</fact5> but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, he has 4 - 2 = 2 plates left. So, the plates can hold 2 * 72 = 144 cookies.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies each bowl can hold. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> as many cookies as a table, and <fact1>each table can hold 20 cookies</fact1>, each bowl can hold 5 x 20 = 100 cookies.

Theo originally had <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he is left with 3 - 2 = 1 bowl. The total capacity of the bowls is 1 x 100 = 100 cookies.

How many more bowls does Bodhi need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Bodhi has left after eating two-fourths of them. Since Bodhi eats <fact7>two-fourths of all the cookies</fact7>, he eats 2/4 * <fact3>660 cookies</fact3> = 330 cookies. So, he has <fact3>660 cookies</fact3> - 330 cookies = 330 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Bodhi can place on the tables and bowls he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Bodhi has <fact5>4 tables</fact5> - 2 tables = 2 tables left. Since <fact2>each table can hold three times</fact2> as many cookies as a bowl, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 22 cookies</fact1>, each table can hold 3 * <fact1>22 cookies</fact1> = 66 cookies.

In total, Bodhi can place 132 cookies + 154 cookies = 286 cookies on the tables and bowls he has.

Since Bodhi has 330 cookies left, and he can place 286 cookies on the tables and bowls he has, he needs to place 330 cookies - 286 cookies = 44 cookies on additional bowls.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Gabriel has left after eating <fact7>one-tenth of all the crackers</fact7>. Since Gabriel had <fact3>600 crackers</fact3>, he ate 600 / 10 = 60 crackers. So, he has 600 - 60 = 540 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers the tables can hold. Since <fact2>each table can hold four times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 20 crackers</fact1>, each table can hold 4 x 20 = 80 crackers. Since Gabriel has <fact5>4 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has 4 - 2 = 2 tables left. So, the tables can hold 2 x 80 = 160 crackers.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies each bowl can hold. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold three times</fact2> as many cookies as a plate, and <fact1>each plate can hold 21 cookies</fact1>, each bowl can hold 3 * <fact1>21</fact1> = 63 cookies.

Deshawn starts with <fact3>630 cookies</fact3> and eats <fact7>one-tenth of all the cookies</fact7>, so he eats <fact3>630</fact3> / 10 = 63 cookies. This leaves him with <fact3>630</fact3> - 63 = 567 cookies.

Deshawn has <fact4>12 plates</fact4> and <fact5>4 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has <fact5>4</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 2 bowls left.

Since Deshawn has 567 cookies left and can only hold 378 cookies, he needs to hold 567 - 378 = 189 more cookies. Since <fact1>each plate can hold 21 cookies</fact1>, Deshawn needs 189 / <fact1>21</fact1> = 9 more plates.

The total capacity of the bowls is <fact1>32</fact1> * <fact4>10</fact4> = 320 crackers. The total capacity of the plate is 64 * 1 = 64 crackers. So, the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 320 + 64 = 384 crackers.

Since Qasim has 640 crackers left and the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 384 crackers, he needs to place 640 - 384 = 256 more crackers.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 32 crackers</fact1>, Qasim needs 256 / <fact1>32</fact1> = 8 more bowls.

How many more tables does Arjun need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Arjun has left after eating <fact7>one-eighth of all the bananas</fact7>. Since Arjun had <fact3>720 bananas</fact3> initially, he ate 720/<fact7>8</fact7> = 90 bananas. So, he has 720 - 90 = 630 bananas left.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Arjun can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact1>each table can hold 21 bananas</fact1> and Arjun has <fact4>11 tables</fact4>, he can place 21 * 11 = 231 bananas on the tables. 

Since <fact2>each plate can hold four times</fact2> the number of bananas a table can hold, each plate can hold <fact1>21</fact1> * 4 = 84 bananas. Arjun had <fact5>5 plates</fact5> initially, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 plates left. He can place 84 * 3 = 252 bananas on the plates.

In total, Arjun can place 231 + 252 = 483 bananas on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 630 bananas left, he needs to place 630 - 483 = 147 more bananas.

Since <fact1>each table can hold 21 bananas</fact1>, Arjun needs 147/<fact1>21</fact1> = 7 more tables to place all the remaining bananas.

How many more plates does Pavel need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Pavel has left after eating <fact7>one-ninth of all the olives</fact7>. Pavel started with <fact3>720 olives</fact3> and ate 720/<fact7>9</fact7> = 80 olives. So, he has 720 - 80 = 640 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives the bowls can hold. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> as many olives as a plate, and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 olives</fact1>, each bowl can hold 20 * 5 = 100 olives. Pavel has <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 bowl left. This bowl can hold 100 olives.

Now, we need to find out how many olives the plates can hold. Pavel has <fact4>19 plates</fact4>, and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 olives</fact1>, so the plates can hold 19 * 20 = 380 olives.

The bowl and the plates together can hold 100 + 380 = 480 olives. Pavel has 640 olives left, so he needs to find space for 640 - 480 = 160 more olives. Since <fact1>each plate can hold 20 olives</fact1>, Pavel needs 160/20 = 8 more plates.

Xavier then eats <fact7>two-fourths of all the cookies</fact7>. How many more plates does Xavier need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Xavier has left after eating two-fourths of them. Since two-fourths is the same as one-half, Xavier eats <fact3>630</fact3> / 2 = 315 cookies. This leaves him with <fact3>630</fact3> - 315 = 315 cookies.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Xavier can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has <fact5>4 tables</fact5> - 2 = 2 tables left. Each table can hold <fact1>21 cookies</fact1> * 3 = 63 cookies, so 2 tables can hold 63 * 2 = 126 cookies.

Xavier also has <fact4>7 plates</fact4>, and <fact1>each plate can hold 21 cookies</fact1>, so he can place 21 * 7 = 147 cookies on the plates.

How many more bowls does Ravi need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Ravi has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Ravi had <fact3>660 almonds</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the almonds</fact7>, he ate 660 / 5 = 132 almonds. So, he has 660 - 132 = 528 almonds left.

Next, we need to find out how many almonds Ravi can place on the plates he has. Since <fact2>each plate can hold three times</fact2> what <fact1>each bowl can hold</fact1>, each plate can hold 22 * 3 = 66 almonds. Ravi has <fact5>5 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 plates left. He can place 3 * 66 = 198 almonds on the plates.

Now, we need to find out how many almonds Ravi can place on the bowls he has. Ravi has <fact4>12 bowls</fact4> and <fact1>each bowl can hold 22 almonds</fact1>, so he can place 12 * 22 = 264 almonds on the bowls.

How many more bowls does Oscar need so he can place all the remaining almonds?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Oscar has left after eating <fact7>one-seventh of all the almonds</fact7>. He has <fact3>630 almonds</fact3> and eats 630/<fact7>7</fact7> = 90 almonds. So, he has 630 - 90 = 540 almonds left.

Since <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, Oscar has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> - 2 = 1 table left. Each table can hold <fact1>30 almonds</fact1> * <fact2>8</fact2> = 240 almonds. So, the remaining table can hold 240 almonds. 

Oscar also has <fact4>8 bowls</fact4> and each bowl can hold <fact1>30 almonds</fact1>. So, the bowls can hold <fact1>30 almonds</fact1> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 240 almonds.

How many more bowls does Diego need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Diego has left after eating <fact7>one-fifth of all the crackers</fact7>. Since Diego had <fact3>690 crackers</fact3>, he ate 690 / 5 = 138 crackers. So, he has 690 - 138 = 552 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers the plates can hold. Since <fact2>each plate can hold six times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 23 crackers</fact1>, each plate can hold 23 * 6 = 138 crackers. Since Diego has <fact5>3 plates</fact5> but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, he has 3 - 2 = 1 plate left. So, the plate can hold 138 crackers.

Now, we need to find out how many crackers the bowls can hold. Since Diego has <fact4>15 bowls</fact4>, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 23 crackers</fact1>, the bowls can hold 15 * 23 = 345 crackers.

Since the plate can hold 138 crackers, and the bowls can hold 345 crackers, together they can hold 138 + 345 = 483 crackers. But Diego has 552 crackers left, so he needs to place 552 - 483 = 69 more crackers.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers each plate can hold. Since each plate can hold <fact2>five times</fact2> what a bowl can hold, and a bowl can hold <fact1>24 crackers</fact1>, a plate can hold 24 * 5 = 120 crackers.

Noah has <fact4>9 bowls</fact4> and <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 9 bowls and 1 plate left. The total capacity of the bowls is <fact1>24 crackers</fact1> * <fact4>9 bowls</fact4> = 216 crackers. The capacity of the remaining plate is 120 crackers. So, the total capacity of the bowls and plates is 216 + 120 = 336 crackers.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Faisal has left after eating one-ninth of them. Since Faisal started with <fact3>720 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-ninth of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 720 / 9 = 80 olives. So, he has 720 - 80 = 640 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives Faisal can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact1>each table can hold 32 olives</fact1> and Faisal has <fact4>7 tables</fact4>, he can place 7 x 32 = 224 olives on the tables. Since <fact2>each plate can hold three times that</fact2> of a table, each plate can hold 32 x 3 = 96 olives.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Esteban can place on the plates he has. Since <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, Esteban is left with <fact5>3 plates</fact5> - <fact6>2 plates</fact6> = 1 plate. Since <fact2>each plate can hold two times</fact2> the number of cookies a bowl can hold, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 24 cookies</fact1>, each plate can hold 2 * <fact1>24 cookies</fact1> = 48 cookies.

He also has <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has <fact5>3</fact5> - <fact6>2</fact6> = 1 plate left. This plate can hold 160 olives. So, in total, Leon can hold 160 + 160 = 320 olives with the tables and plates he has.

Since Leon has 540 olives and can only hold 320 olives, he needs to hold 540 - 320 = 220 more olives. Since each table can hold <fact1>20 olives</fact1>, Leon needs 220 / <fact1>20</fact1> = 11 more tables.

Kai has <fact3>720 crackers</fact3>, <fact4>16 plates</fact4> and <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>. Unfortunately, <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>. Kai then eats <fact7>one-sixth of all the crackers</fact7>. How many more plates does Kai need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers each bowl can hold. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold four times</fact2> as many crackers as a plate, and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 crackers</fact1>, each bowl can hold 20 * 4 = 80 crackers.

Kai has <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he is left with 3 - 2 = 1 bowl. He also has <fact4>16 plates</fact4>.

Kai starts with <fact3>720 crackers</fact3> and eats <fact7>one-sixth of all the crackers</fact7>, which is 720 / 6 = 120 crackers. So, he is left with 720 - 120 = 600 crackers.

The bowl can hold 80 crackers, and the plates can hold <fact1>20 crackers</fact1> each. So, the total capacity of the 1 bowl and 16 plates is 80 + (16 * 20) = 80 + 320 = 400 crackers.

Since Kai has 600 crackers left, and the bowl and plates can hold 400 crackers, he needs to place 600 - 400 = 200 more crackers.

Since <fact1>each plate can hold 20 crackers</fact1>, Kai needs 200 / 20 = 10 more plates to hold the remaining crackers.

How many more tables does Yusuf need so he can place all the remaining olives?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Yusuf has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Yusuf started with <fact3>720 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 720 / 5 = 144 olives. So, he has 720 - 144 = 576 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives Yusuf can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact1>each table can hold 32 olives</fact1> and Yusuf has <fact4>8 tables</fact4>, he can place 8 x 32 = 256 olives on the tables. Since <fact2>each plate can hold three times that</fact2> of a table, each plate can hold 32 x 3 = 96 olives. Yusuf has <fact5>3 plates</fact5> but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 plate left. He can place 1 x 96 = 96 olives on the plate.

In total, Yusuf can place 256 + 96 = 352 olives on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 576 olives left, he needs to place 576 - 352 = 224 more olives.

Finally, since <fact1>each table can hold 32 olives</fact1>, Yusuf needs 224 / 32 = 7 more tables to place all the remaining olives.

How many more bowls does Ravi need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many crackers Ravi has left after eating <fact7>one-tenth of all the crackers</fact7>. Since Ravi had <fact3>600 crackers</fact3>, he ate 600/<fact7>10</fact7> = 60 crackers. So, he has 600 - 60 = 540 crackers left.

Next, we need to find out how many crackers Ravi can place on the plates he has. Since <fact2>each plate can hold five times</fact2> as many crackers as a bowl, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 27 crackers</fact1>, each plate can hold 5 x 27 = 135 crackers. Ravi has <fact5>3 plates</fact5>, but <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 plate left. He can place 135 crackers on this plate.

Now, we need to find out how many crackers Ravi can place on the bowls he has. Ravi has <fact4>9 bowls</fact4>, and <fact1>each bowl can hold 27 crackers</fact1>, so he can place 9 x 27 = 243 crackers on the bowls.

In total, Ravi can place 135 + 243 = 378 crackers on the plates and bowls he has. Since he has 540 crackers left, he needs to place 540 - 378 = 162 more crackers.

Since <fact1>each bowl can hold 27 crackers</fact1>, Ravi needs 162/27 = 6 more bowls to place all the remaining crackers.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Hiroshi has left after eating <fact7>one-sixth of all the bananas</fact7>. Since he had <fact3>600 bananas</fact3> initially, he ate 600 / 6 = 100 bananas. So, he has 600 - 100 = 500 bananas left.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas Hiroshi can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact1>each table can hold 20 bananas</fact1> and he has <fact4>19 tables</fact4>, he can place 19 x 20 = 380 bananas on the tables.

Since <fact2>each plate can hold two times</fact2> the number of bananas a table can hold, each plate can hold 20 x 2 = 40 bananas. However, <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he only has <fact5>3 plates</fact5> - 2 = 1 plate left. He can place 1 x 40 = 40 bananas on the plate.

In total, Hiroshi can place 380 + 40 = 420 bananas on the tables and plates he has. Since he has 500 bananas left, he needs to place 500 - 420 = 80 more bananas.

Since <fact1>each table can hold 20 bananas</fact1>, Hiroshi needs 80 / 20 = 4 more tables to place all the remaining bananas.

How many more tables does Oliver need so he can place all the remaining cookies?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Oliver has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Oliver eats <fact7>one-fifth of all the cookies</fact7>, he eats <fact3>630</fact3> * 1/5 = 126 cookies. So, he has <fact3>630</fact3> - 126 = 504 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Oliver can place on the tables and bowls he has. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> as many cookies as a table, each bowl can hold <fact1>28</fact1> * 5 = 140 cookies. However, <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so Oliver only has <fact5>3</fact5> - 2 = 1 bowl left. This bowl can hold 140 cookies.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Oscar has left after eating <fact7>one-sixth of all the bananas</fact7>. Since Oscar had <fact3>600 bananas</fact3>, he ate 600/<fact7>6</fact7> = 100 bananas. So, he has 600 - 100 = 500 bananas left.

Since <fact2>each bowl can hold six times</fact2> as many bananas as a plate, and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 bananas</fact1>, each bowl can hold 20 * 6 = 120 bananas.

Oscar has <fact4>18 plates</fact4> and <fact5>3 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 3 - 2 = 1 bowl left. The total capacity of the plates is <fact1>20 bananas</fact1> * <fact4>18 plates</fact4> = 360 bananas. The total capacity of the bowl is 120 * 1 = 120 bananas.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many cookies Mohammed has left after eating <fact7>one-seventh of all the cookies</fact7>. Mohammed had <fact3>630 cookies</fact3> and ate 630 / 7 = 90 cookies. So, he has 630 - 90 = 540 cookies left.

Since <fact2>each bowl can hold two times</fact2> what <fact1>each table can hold</fact1>, each bowl can hold 27 * 2 = 54 cookies.

Mohammed has <fact4>11 tables</fact4> and <fact5>5 bowls</fact5>, but <fact6>2 bowls break</fact6>, so he has 11 tables and 5 - 2 = 3 bowls left.

The total capacity of the tables is <fact1>27 cookies</fact1> * <fact4>11 tables</fact4> = 297 cookies. The total capacity of the bowls is 54 cookies * 3 bowls = 162 cookies. So, the total capacity of the tables and bowls is 297 + 162 = 459 cookies.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Thiago has left after eating one-tenth of them. Since Thiago started with <fact3>630 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-tenth of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 630 / 10 = 63 olives. So, he has 630 - 63 = 567 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives Thiago can place on the tables and plates he has. Since <fact2>each table can hold four times</fact2> what <fact1>each plate can hold</fact1>, each table can hold 4 * 27 = 108 olives. Thiago has <fact5>5 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, so he has 5 - 2 = 3 tables left. He can place 3 * 108 = 324 olives on the tables.

Next, we need to find out how many bananas the tables can hold. Since <fact2>each table can hold eight times</fact2> what a plate can hold, and <fact1>each plate can hold 24 bananas</fact1>, each table can hold 24 * 8 = 192 bananas. Since Tariq has <fact5>3 tables</fact5> but <fact6>2 tables break</fact6>, he has 1 table left that can hold 192 bananas.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas the plates can hold. Since Tariq has <fact4>8 plates</fact4> and <fact1>each plate can hold 24 bananas</fact1>, the plates can hold 8 * 24 = 192 bananas.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many olives Andre has left after eating one-fifth of them. Since Andre started with <fact3>675 olives</fact3> and ate <fact7>one-fifth of all the olives</fact7>, he ate 675 / 5 = 135 olives. So, he has 675 - 135 = 540 olives left.

Next, we need to find out how many olives the bowls can hold. Since <fact2>each bowl can hold five times</fact2> what a plate can hold, and <fact1>each plate can hold 20 olives</fact1>, each bowl can hold 5 x 20 = 100 olives.

Deshawn then eats <fact7>one-tenth of all the bananas</fact7>. How many more tables does DeShawn need so he can place all the remaining bananas?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas each plate can hold. Since each plate can hold <fact2>four times</fact2> what a table can hold, each plate can hold <fact1>22</fact1> * 4 = 88 bananas.

Initially, Deshawn has <fact3>660 bananas</fact3>, <fact4>11 tables</fact4>, and <fact5>5 plates</fact5>. However, <fact6>2 plates break</fact6>, so he is left with <fact5>5</fact5> - 2 = 3 plates.

Deshawn then eats <fact7>one-tenth of all the bananas</fact7>, which is <fact3>660</fact3> / 10 = 66 bananas. So, he is left with <fact3>660</fact3> - 66 = 594 bananas.

The total capacity of the tables is <fact1>22</fact1> * <fact4>11</fact4> = 242 bananas. The total capacity of the plates is 88 * 3 = 264 bananas. So, the total capacity of the tables and plates is 242 + 264 = 506 bananas.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>4 potted plants from each ledge</fact4> to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mia remain with?

Answer: Mia originally had <fact2>12 potted plants on each of the 51 window ledges</fact2>, so she had <fact2>12</fact2> * 51 = 612 potted plants. She received <fact1>22 new potted plants</fact1> last week, so she had 612 + <fact1>22</fact1> = 634 potted plants. She purchased <fact3>200 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount</fact3>, so she got 200 * 0.5 = 100 new plants. Now she has 634 + 100 = 734 potted plants.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>7 potted plants from each ledge</fact4> to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Camila remain with?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Camila had before giving any away. She received <fact1>35 new potted plants</fact1> two days ago. She also purchased <fact3>40 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount</fact3>, which means she actually bought 40 * 0.5 = 20 plants at full price, but she still got 40 plants. She already had <fact2>7 potted plants on each of the 57 window ledges</fact2>, which is 7 * 57 = 399 plants. So, in total, she had 35 + 40 + 399 = 474 plants.

Now, let's calculate how many plants she will give away. She will give <fact4>7 potted plants from each ledge</fact4>, and there are 57 ledges, so she will give away 7 * 57 = 399 plants.

Finally, let's calculate how many plants Camila will remain with. She had 474 plants initially and will give away 399, so she will be left with 474 - 399 = 75 plants.

So, in total, she had 804 + <fact1>36</fact1> + <fact3>190</fact3> = 1030 potted plants. She decided to give <fact4>6 potted plants from each ledge</fact4>, so she gave <fact4>6</fact4> * 67 = 402 potted plants. Therefore, Elena will remain with 1030 - 402 = 628 potted plants.

It takes them <fact2>14 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the bank is. It takes them another <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to get to the library. When they reach the library, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the library again. Once they reach the library for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the cinema without being late?

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes for Ravi and Isabella to get to the library. It takes them <fact2>14 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the bank is and another <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to get to the library. So, the total time to get to the library is <fact2>14</fact2> + <fact3>38</fact3> = 52 minutes. 

Since they have to return home to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the library again, the total time spent walking to the library and back home and then to the library again is 52 * 2 = 104 minutes.

Now, let's subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have available. They have <fact1>266 minutes</fact1> available, and they've already spent 104 minutes walking to the library and back home and then to the library again, and then another 52 minutes to get to the library for the first time. However, the 52 minutes spent the first time is already included in the 104 minutes. Therefore, the time they have left is <fact1>266</fact1> - 104 = 162 minutes.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes for Tariq and Sakura to get to the mall and back home to pick up their wallets. It takes <fact2>27 minutes</fact2> to get to the library and another <fact3>44 minutes</fact3> to get to the mall, so the total time to get to the mall is <fact2>27</fact2> + <fact3>44</fact3> = 71 minutes.

So, in total, they have walked for 43 + 43 + 43 = 129 minutes. 
They have <fact1>192 minutes</fact1> - 129 minutes = 63 minutes left to get to the cinema without being late.

It takes them <fact2>12 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the mall is. It takes them another <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to get to the gym. When they reach the gym, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again. Once they reach the gym for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the grocery store without being late?

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes for Noah and Oscar to get to the gym. It takes them <fact2>12 minutes</fact2> to get to the corner where the mall is and another <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to get to the gym. So, the total time to get to the gym is <fact2>12</fact2> + <fact3>38</fact3> = 50 minutes. 

Since they have to return home to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the gym again, the total time spent walking to the gym and back home and then back to the gym is 50 * 2 = 100 minutes for the round trip to home and 50 minutes to get back to the gym. 

They have <fact1>172 minutes</fact1> in total. So, the time left for them to get to the grocery store after reaching the gym for the second time is <fact1>172</fact1> - 100 - 50 = 22 minutes.

However, <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7>, so the number of puppies with spots for Luca is <fact2>25</fact2> + 78/2 = 64.

Yuki has <fact1>95 puppies</fact1>, Kai has <fact3>53 puppies</fact3>, and Faisal has <fact5>68 dogs</fact5> with <fact6>14 puppies</fact6> each, so Faisal has <fact5>68</fact5> * <fact6>14</fact6> = 952 puppies. The total number of puppies is <fact1>95</fact1> + <fact3>53</fact3> + 952 = 1100 puppies.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Yuki has <fact2>23 puppies with spots</fact2>, Kai has <fact4>12 puppies with spots</fact4>, and Faisal has <fact5>68</fact5> * <fact6>14</fact6> = 952 puppies with spots.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Noah has <fact1>128 puppies</fact1>, Leon has <fact3>51 puppies</fact3>, and Bodhi has <fact5>64 dogs</fact5> with <fact6>14 puppies</fact6> each, so Bodhi has <fact5>64</fact5> * <fact6>14</fact6> = 896 puppies. The total number of puppies is <fact1>128</fact1> + <fact3>51</fact3> + 896 = 1075 puppies.

Noah has <fact2>26 puppies with spots</fact2> and <fact1>128</fact1> - <fact2>26</fact2> = 102 puppies without spots. However, <fact7>half of his unspotted puppies actually have spots</fact7>, so 102 / 2 = 51 more puppies have spots. In total, Noah has <fact2>26</fact2> + 51 = 77 puppies with spots.

Leon has <fact4>16 puppies with spots</fact4> and Bodhi has <fact5>64</fact5> * <fact6>14</fact6> = 896 puppies with spots. The total number of puppies with spots is 77 + <fact4>16</fact4> + 896 = 989 puppies.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of puppies. Luis has <fact1>137 puppies</fact1>, Yuki has <fact3>40 puppies</fact3>, and Oliver has <fact5>53 dogs</fact5> * <fact6>16 puppies with spots</fact6> per dog = 848 puppies. However, this only counts the puppies with spots for Oliver, so we need to find the total number of puppies for Oliver. Since we don't know how many puppies without spots Oliver has, we can assume that the 16 puppies mentioned are the total number of puppies per dog (this might not be accurate, but it's the best we can do with the given information). So, Oliver has <fact5>53 dogs</fact5> * 16 puppies per dog = 848 puppies. The total number of puppies is <fact1>137</fact1> + <fact3>40</fact3> + 848 = 1025 puppies.

If the <fact6>muffin cost ₺12</fact6> and the <fact7>pineapple pie cost ₺23</fact7>, what was Viktor's average daily earning?

Answer: On Sunday, Viktor sold <fact1>24 boxes of muffins</fact1> and <fact4>27</fact4> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 12 boxes of pineapple pies. So, he earned (<fact1>24</fact1> * <fact6>₺12</fact6>) + (12 * <fact7>₺23</fact7>) = ₺288 + ₺276 = ₺564 on Sunday.
On Monday, Viktor sold <fact1>24</fact1> + <fact3>12</fact3> = 36 boxes of muffins and <fact4>27 boxes of pineapple pies</fact4>. So, he earned (36 * <fact6>₺12</fact6>) + (<fact4>27</fact4> * <fact7>₺23</fact7>) = ₺432 + ₺621 = ₺1053 on Monday.
On Tuesday, Viktor sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, so he earned ₺564 + ₺1053 = ₺1617 on Tuesday.
Therefore, Viktor's total earnings over the three days were ₺564 + ₺1053 + ₺1617 = ₺3234.
To find his average daily earnings, we divide his total earnings by 3: ₺3234 / 3 = ₺1078.

On Friday, he sold <fact1>29 boxes of cookie</fact1> and <fact2>15 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Saturday</fact2>. On Saturday, he sold <fact3>14 more boxes of cookies than on Friday</fact3> and <fact4>25 boxes of apple pie</fact4>. On Sunday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>. If the <fact6>cookie cost $8</fact6> and the <fact7>apple pie cost $24</fact7>, what was James's average daily earning?

Answer: On Friday, James sold <fact1>29 boxes of cookies</fact1> and <fact4>25</fact4> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 10 boxes of apple pie. 
On Saturday, James sold <fact1>29</fact1> + <fact3>14</fact3> = 43 boxes of cookies and <fact4>25 boxes of apple pie</fact4>. 
On Sunday, James sold (<fact1>29</fact1> + 43) + (<fact4>25</fact4> + 10) = 107 boxes in total. 
Since the number of cookies and apple pies are the same on Sunday, James sold 107/2 = 53.5 boxes of cookies and 53.5 boxes of apple pies. 
However, since we can't sell half a box, we will round down to 53 boxes of cookies and round up to 54 boxes of apple pies. 
James's total earning is (<fact1>29</fact1> + 43 + 53) * <fact6>$8</fact6> + (10 + <fact4>25</fact4> + 54) * <fact7>$24</fact7> = 125 * <fact6>$8</fact6> + 89 * <fact7>$24</fact7> = $1000 + $2136 = $3136. 
James's average daily earning is $3136 / 3 = $1045.33.

If the <fact6>cupcake cost €9</fact6> and the <fact7>pomegranate pie cost €27</fact7>, what was Xavier's average daily earning?

Answer: On Thursday, Xavier sold <fact1>29 boxes of cupcakes</fact1> and <fact4>28</fact4> - <fact2>11</fact2> = 17 boxes of pomegranate pie. 
On Friday, he sold <fact1>29</fact1> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 42 boxes of cupcakes and <fact4>28 boxes of pomegranate pie</fact4>. 
On Saturday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, which is (42 + <fact1>29</fact1>) boxes of cupcakes and (17 + <fact4>28</fact4>) boxes of pomegranate pie. 
This is equal to 71 boxes of cupcakes and 45 boxes of pomegranate pie. 
So, in total, he sold <fact1>29</fact1> + 42 + 71 = 142 boxes of cupcakes and 17 + <fact4>28</fact4> + 45 = 90 boxes of pomegranate pie. 
His total earnings are (<fact6>€9</fact6> * 142) + (<fact7>€27</fact7> * 90) = €1278 + €2430 = €3708.

Answer: On Thursday, Qasim sold <fact1>25 boxes of muffins</fact1> and <fact4>25</fact4> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 10 boxes of apple pies. 
On Friday, he sold <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact3>11</fact3> = 36 boxes of muffins and <fact4>25 boxes of apple pie</fact4>. 
On Saturday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, so he sold (25 + 10) + (36 + 25) = 96 boxes in total. 
Since he sold 25 + 36 = 61 boxes of muffins in the first two days, he sold 96 - 61 = 35 boxes of muffins on Saturday. 
This means he sold 96 - 35 = 61 boxes of apple pies on Saturday. 
In total, he sold 25 + 36 + 35 = 96 boxes of muffins and 10 + 25 + 61 = 96 boxes of apple pies.

Answer: On Saturday, Mateo sold <fact1>29 boxes of cupcakes</fact1> and <fact4>21</fact4> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 6 boxes of grape pie. 
On Sunday, Mateo sold <fact1>29</fact1> + <fact3>14</fact3> = 43 boxes of cupcakes and <fact4>21 boxes of grape pie</fact4>. 
On Monday, Mateo sold (<fact1>29</fact1> + 43) + (<fact4>21</fact4> + 6) = 99 boxes in total. 
Since the total number of boxes sold on Monday is the sum of the boxes sold on Saturday and Sunday, Mateo must have sold 43 + 6 = 49 boxes of cupcakes and 50 boxes of grape pie on Monday. 
The total amount of money Mateo earned on Saturday is (<fact1>29</fact1> * <fact6>10</fact6>) + (6 * <fact7>32</fact7>) = 290 + 192 = ¥482.

On the sidewalk, Xena walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Xena's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Xena's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>66 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach before her injury was <fact2>11</fact2> km / <fact6>66</fact6> min = 1/6 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 km/min = 1/12 km/min.

We also know that Xena walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach</fact4>, so her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 3 * 1/6 km/min = 1/2 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 1/2 km/min = 1/4 km/min.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Xena to walk <fact3>13 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 1/4 km/min. This is <fact3>13</fact3> km / (1/4 km/min) = 52 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Xena to complete her <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1> is <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> (on the beach) + 52 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 118 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Gabrielle walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Gabrielle's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Gabrielle's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>15 kilometers</fact2> on the beach in <fact6>45 minutes</fact6>. To find her speed, we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 45/60 = 0.75 hours. Then, we can find her speed: <fact2>15 kilometers</fact2> / 0.75 hours = 20 kilometers per hour.

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 20/2 = 10 kilometers per hour.

We also know that Gabrielle walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach</fact4>. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 2 * 20 = 40 kilometers per hour. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is 40/2 = 20 kilometers per hour.

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>: <fact3>14 kilometers</fact3> / 20 kilometers per hour = 0.7 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get: 0.7 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 42 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-kilometer walk</fact1>: <fact6>45 minutes</fact6> (on the beach) + 42 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 87 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Roya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Roya's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>21-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Roya's speed on the beach before the injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> after the injury. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can assume that her original speed was twice as fast. So, her original time to walk <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> on the beach would be <fact6>44 minutes</fact6>/2 = 22 minutes. Now, we can find her speed on the beach: speed = distance/time = <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2>/22 minutes = 0.5 kilometers/minute. 

Since she walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk</fact4>, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.5 kilometers/minute = 1 kilometer/minute. 

After the injury, her speed on the beach is 0.5 kilometers/minute / 2 = 0.25 kilometers/minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1 kilometer/minute / 2 = 0.5 kilometers/minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>10 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk: time = distance/speed = <fact3>10 kilometers</fact3>/0.5 kilometers/minute = 20 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>21-kilometer walk</fact1>: time = time on the beach + time on the sidewalk = <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> + 20 minutes = 64 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Ananya's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Ananya's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach, and it takes her <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> to do so after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. Let's call her original speed on the beach ""x"" miles per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed is 0.5x miles per minute. We can set up the equation: <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / 0.5x = <fact6>50 minutes</fact6>. Solving for x, we get x = 0.4 miles per minute.

Since Ananya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.4 = 0.8 miles per minute. After her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.4 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Ananya to walk <fact3>14 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>14 miles</fact3> / 0.4 miles per minute = 35 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Ananya to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to get the total time: <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> + 35 minutes = 85 minutes.

If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Nia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute.

We also know that Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Nia to walk <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>14 kilometers</fact3> / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 42 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Nia to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 42 minutes = 102 minutes.

Answer: First, we need to find Sophia's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>15 miles</fact2> on the beach and that this takes her <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>. We can use the formula speed = distance / time to find her speed on the beach. This gives us a speed of <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles per minute.

Since Sophia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 0.25 / 2 = 0.125 miles per minute.

We also know that Sophia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Since her speed on the beach is 0.125 miles per minute, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 x 0.125 = 0.25 miles per minute.

Now we can find the time it takes for Sophia to walk <fact3>16 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we get <fact3>16 miles</fact3> / 0.25 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Sophia to complete the entire <fact1>31-mile walk</fact1> is <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> (on the beach) + 64 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 124 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Olga walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olga's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Olga walks <fact2>12 miles on the beach</fact2> and this takes her <fact6>48 minutes</fact6>, her speed on the beach after the injury is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles per minute. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her original speed on the beach was 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 miles per minute. Since she walks <fact4>two times as fast on the sidewalk</fact4>, her original speed on the sidewalk was 0.5 * 2 = 1 mile per minute. After the injury, her speed on the sidewalk is 1 / 2 = 0.5 miles per minute. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>14 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> after the injury: <fact3>14 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 28 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1> is <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> on the beach + 28 minutes on the sidewalk = 76 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Winnie's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Winnie's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>19 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>57 minutes</fact6> to do so after her injury. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can assume that before her injury, it would take her half the time to walk the same distance, which is 57/2 = 28.5 minutes. So, her speed on the beach before her injury is <fact2>19 kilometers</fact2> / 28.5 minutes = 0.667 kilometers per minute. 

Since Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk</fact4> as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury is 2 * 0.667 = 1.333 kilometers per minute. 

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 0.667 / 2 = 0.3335 kilometers per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1.333 / 2 = 0.667 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>10 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3> after her injury, which is <fact3>10 kilometers</fact3> / 0.667 kilometers per minute = 15 minutes.

Finally, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-kilometer walk</fact1> is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk, which is <fact6>57 minutes</fact6> + 15 minutes = 72 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Priya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Priya's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>25-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>40 minutes</fact6> after her injury, and her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. So, her original speed on the beach was 10 km / (40 min * 2) = 10 km / 80 min = 1/8 km/min. 

Her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>twice her speed on the beach</fact4>, so it is 2 * 1/8 km/min = 1/4 km/min.

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/8 km/min = 1/16 km/min, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 1/4 km/min = 1/8 km/min.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact2>10 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>15 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3> after her injury. 

Time on the beach = distance / speed = <fact2>10 km</fact2> / (1/16 km/min) = 160 min. However, we are given that she spends <fact6>40 minutes</fact6> on the beach, so this is consistent with our calculation.

Time on the sidewalk = distance / speed = <fact3>15 km</fact3> / (1/8 km/min) = 120 min.

So, the total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>25-kilometer walk</fact1> is 40 min + 120 min = 160 min.

On the sidewalk, Nia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Nia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>35-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Nia's original speed on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2x kilometers per minute</fact4>. After the injury, her speed on the beach becomes x/2 kilometers per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk becomes x kilometers per minute. 

Since <fact6>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, and the distance walked on the beach is <fact2>17 kilometers</fact2>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows: 
17 kilometers / 51 minutes = x/2 kilometers per minute. 
Solving for x, we get x = 2 * 17 / 51 = 2/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk. The distance walked on the sidewalk is <fact3>18 kilometers</fact3>, and her speed on the sidewalk is x = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 
So, the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk is 18 / (2/3) = 27 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>35-kilometer walk</fact1> is 51 + 27 = 78 minutes.

If <fact6>55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Emma's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>55 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> = 0.2 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 kilometers per minute. 

We also know that she walks <fact4>four times as fast</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 0.2 * <fact4>4</fact4> = 0.8 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the sidewalk is 0.8 / 2 = 0.4 kilometers per minute. 

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> / 0.4 kilometers per minute = 30 minutes. 

Finally, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to get the total time. Total time = <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> + 30 minutes = 85 minutes.

If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Tara's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach, and it takes her <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. So, her current speed on the beach is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 miles per minute. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her original speed on the beach was 2 * (1/6) = 1/3 miles per minute. 

Since Tara walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk was 3 * (1/3) = 1 mile per minute. After her speed <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her speed on the sidewalk is now 1/2 mile per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Tara to walk <fact3>19 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> at her current speed. Time = Distance / Speed = <fact3>19 miles</fact3> / (1/2 mile per minute) = 38 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Tara to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> (on the beach) + 38 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 104 minutes.

If <fact6>68 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Yara's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>17 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>68 minutes</fact6> after her injury. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can assume that her original speed was twice as fast. So, her original time to walk <fact2>17 kilometers</fact2> on the beach would be <fact6>68 minutes</fact6>/2 = 34 minutes. Now, we can find her speed on the beach: <fact2>17 kilometers</fact2> / 34 minutes = 0.5 kilometers per minute. 

Since Yara walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk</fact4> as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.5 = 1 kilometer per minute. 

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 kilometers per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1 / 2 = 0.5 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> / 0.5 kilometers per minute = 24 minutes.

If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>21-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Aisha's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> to do so. However, this is after her injury, so we need to find her original speed. Since her speed <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can set up the equation: 
11 km / x = 66 minutes * 2 (to account for the decrease in speed)
11 km / x = 132 minutes
x = 11 km / 132 minutes = 5 minutes per km (original speed)

Since Aisha walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4 * 5 minutes per km = 1.25 minutes per km (original speed)

After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is 1.25 minutes per km * 2 = 2.5 minutes per km

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk: 
<fact3>10 kilometers</fact3> * 2.5 minutes per km = 25 minutes

The total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>21-kilometer walk</fact1> is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

On the sidewalk, Beatriz walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Beatriz's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Beatriz's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>19 miles</fact2> on the beach and that it takes her <fact6>57 minutes</fact6> to do so after her injury. We also know that her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5> due to her injury. Let's call her speed on the beach before her injury ""x"" miles per minute. Then, her speed on the beach after her injury is 0.5x miles per minute. We can set up the equation: 19 miles / (0.5x miles/minute) = 57 minutes. Solving for x, we get x = 19 miles / (57 minutes * 0.5) = 0.667 miles/minute.

Since Beatriz walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk</fact4> as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury is 2 * 0.667 miles/minute = 1.333 miles/minute. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is 0.5 * 1.333 miles/minute = 0.667 miles/minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Beatriz to walk <fact3>14 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk after her injury. Time = distance / speed = 14 miles / 0.667 miles/minute = 21 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for Beatriz to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1> by adding the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. Total time = <fact6>57 minutes</fact6> + 21 minutes = 78 minutes.

However, due to a recent injury, Tara's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Tara's original speed on the beach. Since she walks <fact2>12 miles</fact2> in <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles per minute. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her original speed on the beach was 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 miles per minute. 

Since Tara walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk was 0.5 * 2 = 1 mile per minute. After her speed <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her speed on the sidewalk is now 1 / 2 = 0.5 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Tara to walk <fact3>17 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> at her current speed. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>17 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 34 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for Tara to complete her <fact1>29-mile walk</fact1> by adding the time she spends walking on the beach and the sidewalk. Total time = <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> + 34 minutes = 82 minutes.

If <fact6>55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Fatima's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach and that it now takes her <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> to do so. However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so it used to take her 55/2 = 27.5 minutes to walk <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach. Thus, her original speed on the beach was <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / 27.5 minutes = 0.4 miles per minute. 

Her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>three times her speed on the beach</fact4>, so her original speed on the sidewalk was 3 x 0.4 = 1.2 miles per minute. 

However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so her current speed on the beach is 0.4/2 = 0.2 miles per minute and her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.2/2 = 0.6 miles per minute. 

Thus, it will take her <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / 0.2 miles per minute = <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> to walk on the beach and <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 0.6 miles per minute = 25 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. 

Therefore, it will take her <fact6>55 minutes</fact6> + 25 minutes = 80 minutes to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>.

If <fact6>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Sakura's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>12 miles</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> after her injury. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can assume that her original speed was twice as fast. So, her original time to walk <fact2>12 miles</fact2> on the beach would be <fact6>48 minutes</fact6>/2 = 24 minutes. Now, we can find her speed on the beach: <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / 24 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute. 

Since Sakura walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.5 = 1 mile per minute. 

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 miles per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1 / 2 = 0.5 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk <fact2>12 miles</fact2> on the beach: <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / 0.25 miles per minute = <fact6>48 minutes</fact6>. 

The time it takes for her to walk <fact3>11 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk is: <fact3>11 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 22 minutes.

If <fact6>68 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>35-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Uma's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>17 miles</fact2> on the beach and that it takes her <fact6>68 minutes</fact6> to do so after her injury. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can assume that before her injury, it would have taken her <fact6>68</fact6>/2 = 34 minutes to walk <fact2>17 miles</fact2> on the beach. So, her speed on the beach before her injury was <fact2>17 miles</fact2> / 34 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute.

Since Uma walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 miles per minute.

After her injury, Uma's speed on the beach is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 miles per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 / 2 = 0.75 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Uma to walk <fact3>18 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk after her injury. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>18 miles</fact3> / 0.75 miles per minute = 24 minutes.

Finally, we can find the total time it takes for Uma to complete the entire <fact1>35-mile walk</fact1> by adding the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. Total time = <fact6>68 minutes</fact6> + 24 minutes = 92 minutes.

If <fact6>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>22-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Zahra's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach, and it takes her <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> to do so after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. So, if her original speed was x miles per minute, her speed after the injury is x/2 miles per minute. We can set up the equation: <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / (x/2) = <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> * 2. Solving for x, we get x = <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> = 0.2 miles per minute for her original speed on the beach.

Since Zahra walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 4 * 0.2 = 0.8 miles per minute.

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 miles per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 0.8 / 2 = 0.4 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / 0.4 miles per minute = 30 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to get the total time: <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> + 30 minutes = 80 minutes.

If <fact6>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Nadia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>15 miles</fact2> on the beach in <fact6>45 minutes</fact6>. We can convert this to miles per minute: <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact6>45 minutes</fact6> = 1/3 miles per minute.

Since Nadia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/3 = 1/6 miles per minute.

We also know that Nadia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach</fact4>. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 2 * 1/3 = 2/3 miles per minute. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 miles per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Nadia to walk <fact3>18 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>18 miles</fact3> / (1/3 miles per minute) = 54 minutes.

Answer: First, we need to find Olga's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>12 miles</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> after her injury. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, it would have taken her 48/2 = 24 minutes to walk <fact2>12 miles</fact2> on the beach before her injury. So, her speed on the beach before her injury was <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / 24 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute.

Since Olga walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 miles per minute.

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 miles per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 / 2 = 0.75 miles per minute.

If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>22-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>3x miles per minute</fact4>. After the injury, her speed on the beach becomes <fact5>x/2 miles per minute</fact5> and her speed on the sidewalk becomes <fact5>3x/2 miles per minute</fact5>. 

Since <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as follows: 
<fact2>11 miles</fact2> / 66 minutes = <fact5>x/2 miles per minute</fact5>. 
Solving for x, we get x = 11/33 = 1/3 miles per minute.

Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk:

Answer: First, we need to find Isabella's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>, so her original speed on the beach is <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 miles per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is (1/6) / 2 = 1/12 miles per minute.

We also know that she walks <fact4>three times as fast</fact4> on the sidewalk as on the beach. So, her original speed on the sidewalk is 3 * (1/6) = 1/2 miles per minute.

Answer: First, we need to find Uma's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>16 miles</fact2> on the beach and that it now takes her <fact6>64 minutes</fact6> to do so. However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so it used to take her 64/2 = 32 minutes to walk <fact2>16 miles</fact2> on the beach. Thus, her original speed on the beach was <fact2>16 miles</fact2> / 32 minutes = 0.5 miles per minute. 

Her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>twice her speed on the beach</fact4>, so it is 2 * 0.5 = 1 mile per minute. 

However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so her current speed on the beach is 0.5/2 = 0.25 miles per minute and her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 = 0.5 miles per minute.

Thus, it will take her <fact2>16 miles</fact2> / 0.25 miles per minute = <fact6>64 minutes</fact6> to walk on the beach and <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / 0.5 miles per minute = 24 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach, and it takes her <fact6>50 minutes</fact6> to do so after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. Let's call her original speed on the beach ""x"" miles per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed is 0.5x miles per minute. We can set up the equation: <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / 0.5x = <fact6>50 minutes</fact6>. Solving for x, we get x = 0.4 miles per minute.

Since Tara walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her original speed on the sidewalk is 3 * 0.4 = 1.2 miles per minute. After her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 0.6 miles per minute.

We can use the formula speed = distance / time to find her speed on the beach. So, her speed on the beach is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / (<fact6>48 minutes</fact6> / 60) = 15 miles per hour. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 15 / 2 = 7.5 miles per hour. 

We also know that she walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 2 * 15 = 30 miles per hour. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 30 / 2 = 15 miles per hour. 

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>15 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk. Time = distance / speed, so time = <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 15 miles per hour = 1 hour = 60 minutes. 

Finally, we can find the total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1>. The total time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. So, the total time is <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> + 60 minutes = 108 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Mia walks at <fact4>five times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Mia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Mia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> on the beach in <fact6>66 minutes</fact6>. We can use the formula speed = distance / time to find her speed on the beach. So, her speed on the beach is <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 kilometers per minute.

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute.

We also know that she walks <fact4>five times as fast</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 5 * 1/6 = 5/6 kilometers per minute. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 5/6 = 5/12 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>15 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>15 kilometers</fact3> / (5/12 kilometers per minute) = 36 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> + 36 minutes = 102 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Sofia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Sofia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>22-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Sofia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>12 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> after her injury. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can assume that her original speed was twice as fast. So, her original time to walk <fact2>12 kilometers</fact2> on the beach would be <fact6>48 minutes</fact6>/2 = 24 minutes. Now, we can find her speed on the beach: <fact2>12 kilometers</fact2> / 24 minutes = 0.5 kilometers per minute. 

Since Sofia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.5 = 1 kilometer per minute. 

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 kilometers per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1 / 2 = 0.5 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>10 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>10 kilometers</fact3> / 0.5 kilometers per minute = 20 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time: <fact6>48 minutes</fact6> + 20 minutes = 68 minutes.

If <fact6>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Leilani's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>66 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach before her injury was <fact2>11 km</fact2> / <fact6>66 min</fact6> = 1/6 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 km/min = 1/12 km/min.

We also know that she walks <fact4>two times as fast on the sidewalk</fact4> as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 2 * 1/6 km/min = 1/3 km/min. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 1/3 km/min = 1/6 km/min.

Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk <fact3>15 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = Distance / Speed = <fact3>15 km</fact3> / (1/6 km/min) = 90 minutes.

The total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer walk</fact1> is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk. Total Time = <fact6>66 minutes</fact6> + 90 minutes = 156 minutes.

If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>22-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Aisha's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute.

We also know that Aisha walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Aisha to walk <fact3>12 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 36 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Aisha to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 36 minutes = 96 minutes.

What is the least amount Qasim can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the notebooks is <fact1>18</fact1> * ¥9.0 = ¥162. The cost of the crayons is <fact2>12</fact2> * ¥18.75 = ¥225. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>¥21</fact3>. The cost of the pencils is <fact4>8</fact4> * ¥9 = ¥72. So, the total cost without any discount is ¥162 + ¥225 + ¥21 + ¥72 = ¥480.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. The discount amount is ¥480 * 0.05 = ¥24. So, the total cost with the <fact6>5% discount</fact6> is ¥480 - ¥24 = ¥456.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the <fact5>20% discount</fact5> and the <fact5>one-time ¥20 fee</fact5>. The discount amount is ¥480 * 0.20 = ¥96. So, the total cost with the <fact5>20% discount</fact5> is ¥480 - ¥96 = ¥384. Adding the <fact5>one-time ¥20 fee</fact5>, the total cost is ¥384 + ¥20 = ¥404.

Comparing the two options, the least amount Qasim can spend on everything is ¥404 with the <fact5>20% discount</fact5> and the <fact5>one-time ¥20 fee</fact5>.

What is the least amount Yuki can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the crayons is <fact1>22 * ¥8.0 = ¥176</fact1>. The cost of the erasers is <fact2>14 * ¥17.0 = ¥238</fact2>. The cost of the bond paper is <fact3>¥13</fact3>. The cost of the markers is <fact4>3 * ¥11 = ¥33</fact4>. The total cost is ¥176 + ¥238 + ¥13 + ¥33 = ¥460.

If Yuki becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 20% of ¥460, which is ¥92. So, the total cost after the discount is ¥460 - ¥92 = ¥368. Adding the one-time membership fee of <fact5>¥20</fact5>, the total cost is ¥368 + ¥20 = ¥388.

If Yuki does not become a member, he will get a 5% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is 5% of ¥460, which is ¥23. So, the total cost after the discount is ¥460 - ¥23 = ¥437.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items James bought. The total cost of the markers is <fact1>12 markers</fact1> * $3.0/marker = $36. The total cost of the crayons is <fact2>14 crayons</fact2> * $8.5/crayon = $119. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$17</fact3>. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact4>6 pencils</fact4> * $8/pencil = $48. The total cost is $36 + $119 + $17 + $48 = $220.

If James becomes a member, he will get a <fact5>20% discount</fact5> on the total cost, which is $220 * 0.20 = $44. He will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time $20 fee</fact5>. So, the total amount he will spend as a member is $220 - $44 + $20 = $196.

What is the least amount Viktor can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the 20 folders is <fact1>20 * €7.0 = €140</fact1>. The cost of the 8 folders is <fact2>8 * €14.25 = €114</fact2>. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€16</fact3>. The cost of the 5 rulers is <fact4>5 * €10 = €50</fact4>. So, the total cost without any discount is €140 + €114 + €16 + €50 = €320.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €320, which is €320 * 0.05 = €16. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €320 - €16 = €304.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of €320, which is €320 * 0.20 = €64. However, Viktor needs to pay <fact5>a one-time €20 fee to become a member</fact5>. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €320 - €64 + €20 = €276.

Since €276 is less than €304, the least amount Viktor can spend on everything is €276.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the crayons is <fact1>16</fact1> * ¥<fact1>6.5</fact1> = ¥104. The cost of the rulers is <fact2>12</fact2> * ¥<fact2>12.0</fact2> = ¥144. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ¥<fact3>19</fact3>. The cost of the notebooks is <fact4>3</fact4> * ¥<fact4>11</fact4> = ¥33. So, the total cost without any discount is ¥104 + ¥144 + ¥19 + ¥33 = ¥300.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of ¥300, which is ¥60. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ¥300 - ¥60 = ¥240. However, Tariq needs to pay <fact5>a one-time ¥20 fee to become a member</fact5>, so the total cost with the 20% discount is ¥240 + ¥20 = ¥260.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of ¥300, which is ¥15. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ¥300 - ¥15 = ¥285.

Comparing the two options, the least amount Tariq can spend on everything is ¥260.

The answer is {260}.",260.0,1,1,p2,801

He bought <fact1>18 pencils which cost ¥4.5 each</fact1>, <fact2>12 erasers which cost ¥12.0 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost ¥15</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>4 rulers which cost ¥10 each</fact4>. Wei can either pay <fact5>a one-time ¥20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Wei can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of pencils is <fact1>18</fact1> * ¥<fact1>4.5</fact1> = ¥81. The cost of erasers is <fact2>12</fact2> * ¥<fact2>12.0</fact2> = ¥144. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ¥<fact3>15</fact3>. The cost of rulers is <fact4>4</fact4> * ¥<fact4>10</fact4> = ¥40. So, the total cost without any discount is ¥81 + ¥144 + ¥15 + ¥40 = ¥280.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount as a member. The discount amount is 20% of ¥280, which is ¥56. So, the total cost as a member is ¥280 - ¥56 = ¥224. However, we need to add the one-time membership fee of ¥<fact5>20</fact5>, making the total cost ¥244.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount as a non-member. The discount amount is 5% of ¥280, which is ¥14. So, the total cost as a non-member is ¥280 - ¥14 = ¥266.

Comparing the two options, we can see that becoming a member and getting the 20% discount results in a lower total cost of ¥244.

What is the least amount Oscar can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the rulers is <fact1>8 rulers</fact1> * €11.0 = €88. The total cost of the notebooks is <fact2>8 notebooks</fact2> * €14.5 = €116. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€16</fact3>. The total cost of the folders is <fact4>4 folders</fact4> * €10 = €40. So, the total cost without any discount is €88 + €116 + €16 + €40 = €260.

Now, let's calculate the total cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €260, which is €13. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €260 - €13 = €247.

Next, let's calculate the total cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of €260, which is €52. However, Oscar needs to pay <fact5>a one-time €20 fee to become a member</fact5>. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €260 - €52 + €20 = €228.

Since €228 is less than €247, the least amount Oscar can spend on everything is €228.

What is the least amount James can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of erasers is <fact1>20 erasers</fact1> * ₣9.5 = ₣190. The total cost of folders is <fact2>4 folders</fact2> * ₣14.75 = ₣59. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>₣21</fact3>. The total cost of crayons is <fact4>7 crayons</fact4> * ₣10 = ₣70. So, the total cost without any discount is ₣190 + ₣59 + ₣21 + ₣70 = ₣340.

If James becomes a member, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, but he has to pay a <fact5>one-time ₣20 fee</fact5>. The total discount will be ₣340 * 0.2 = ₣68. So, the total cost with the membership discount is ₣340 - ₣68 + ₣20 = ₣292.

If James does not become a member, he will get a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be ₣340 * 0.05 = ₣17. So, the total cost with the non-membership discount is ₣340 - ₣17 = ₣323.

Therefore, the least amount James can spend on everything is ₣292.

What is the least amount Bodhi can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the folders is <fact1>18 * $9.5</fact1> = $171. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact2>8 * $15.75</fact2> = $126. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$23</fact3>. The cost of the erasers is <fact4>4 * $10</fact4> = $40. So, the total cost without any discount is $171 + $126 + $23 + $40 = $360.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of $360, which is $18. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is $360 - $18 = $342.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. The discount amount is 20% of $360, which is $72. However, Bodhi needs to pay a <fact5>one-time $20 fee to become a member</fact5>. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is $360 - $72 + $20 = $308.

Since $308 is less than $342, Bodhi should become a member and get the 20% discount. Therefore, the least amount Bodhi can spend on everything is $308.

What is the least amount Benjamin can spend on everything?

Answer: 
First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. 
<fact1>20 erasers</fact1> will cost <fact1>20 * $7.75</fact1> = $155. 
<fact2>12 folders</fact2> will cost <fact2>12 * $18.0</fact2> = $216. 
<fact3>A ream of bond paper</fact3> costs <fact3>$24</fact3>.

Now, let's calculate the cost with <fact6>a 5% discount</fact6>. 
5% of $440 is 0.05 * $440 = $22. 
So, the cost with <fact6>a 5% discount</fact6> is $440 - $22 = $418.

Next, let's calculate the cost with <fact5>a 20% discount and a one-time $20 fee</fact5>. 
20% of $440 is 0.20 * $440 = $88.

He bought <fact1>8 rulers which cost ₣4.0 each</fact1>, <fact2>12 folders which cost ₣13.25 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost ₣24</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>5 crayons which cost ₣9 each</fact4>. Arash can either pay a <fact5>one-time ₣20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive only a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Arash can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the rulers is <fact1>8 rulers</fact1> * ₣<fact1>4.0</fact1> = ₣32. The cost of the folders is <fact2>12 folders</fact2> * ₣<fact2>13.25</fact2> = ₣159. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ₣<fact3>24</fact3>. The cost of the crayons is <fact4>5 crayons</fact4> * ₣<fact4>9</fact4> = ₣45. So, the total cost without any discount is ₣32 + ₣159 + ₣24 + ₣45 = ₣260.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is ₣260 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = ₣13. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ₣260 - ₣13 = ₣247.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee. The discount amount is ₣260 * <fact5>20%</fact5> = ₣52. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ₣260 - ₣52 = ₣208. Adding the one-time membership fee of ₣<fact5>20</fact5>, the total cost becomes ₣208 + ₣20 = ₣228.

Comparing the two options, we can see that the least amount Arash can spend on everything is ₣228, which is the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee.

What is the least amount Arjun can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of pencils is <fact1>10 * ₣9.5</fact1> = ₣95. The cost of crayons is <fact2>10 * ₣13.5</fact2> = ₣135. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>₣14</fact3>. The cost of rulers is <fact4>4 * ₣9</fact4> = ₣36. So, the total cost without any discount is ₣95 + ₣135 + ₣14 + ₣36 = ₣280.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is <fact6>5%</fact6> of ₣280, which is ₣14. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ₣280 - ₣14 = ₣266.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of ₣280, which is ₣56. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ₣280 - ₣56 = ₣224. Adding the <fact5>one-time ₣20 fee</fact5>, the total cost becomes ₣224 + ₣20 = ₣244.

What is the least amount Carlos can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the <fact1>24 colored pencils</fact1> is <fact1>24</fact1> * <fact2>₣8.5</fact2> = ₣204. The cost of the <fact3>12 pencils</fact3> is <fact3>12</fact3> * <fact4>₣9.0</fact4> = ₣108. The cost of the <fact5>ream of bond paper</fact5> is <fact6>₣24</fact6>. The cost of the <fact7>4 erasers</fact7> is <fact7>4</fact7> * <fact8>₣11</fact8> = ₣44. The total cost is ₣204 + ₣108 + ₣24 + ₣44 = ₣380.

If Carlos becomes a member, he will get a <fact10>20% discount</fact10> on the total cost, which is ₣380 * 0.20 = ₣76. So, the total cost with the membership discount is ₣380 - ₣76 = ₣304. However, he also needs to pay the one-time <fact9>₣20 fee</fact9>, so the total cost with membership is ₣304 + ₣20 = ₣324.

If Carlos does not become a member, he will get a <fact11>5% discount</fact11> on the total cost, which is ₣380 * 0.05 = ₣19. So, the total cost without membership is ₣380 - ₣19 = ₣361.

What is the least amount Ravi can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Ravi bought without any discount. The total cost of pencils is <fact1>24</fact1> * $7 = $168. The total cost of notebooks is <fact2>14</fact2> * $17 = $238. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$22</fact3>. The total cost of folders is <fact4>8</fact4> * $9 = $72. So, the total cost without any discount is $168 + $238 + $22 + $72 = $500.

If Ravi becomes a member and pays the <fact5>one-time $20 fee</fact5>, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>. The total discount will be 20% of $500, which is 0.20 * $500 = $100. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $500 - $100 = $400. Adding the <fact5>one-time $20 fee</fact5>, the total cost will be $400 + $20 = $420.

If Ravi does not become a member, he will receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be 5% of $500, which is 0.05 * $500 = $25. So, the total cost with the non-membership discount is $500 - $25 = $475.

Since $420 is less than $475, the least amount Ravi can spend on everything is $420.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the folders is <fact1>10 folders</fact1> * €9.5 = €95. The total cost of the notebooks is <fact2>8 notebooks</fact2> * €13.75 = €110. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€15</fact3>. The total cost of the erasers is <fact4>6 erasers</fact4> * €10 = €60. So, the total cost without any discount is €95 + €110 + €15 + €60 = €280.

Now, let's calculate the total cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €280, which is €14. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €280 - €14 = €266.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the folders is <fact1>24 folders * €10.0 each</fact1> = €240 + <fact2>14 folders * €9.0 each</fact2> = €126 = €366. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€14</fact3>. The cost of the notebooks is <fact4>4 notebooks * €10 each</fact4> = €40. So, the total cost without any discount is €366 + €14 + €40 = €420.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is €420 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = €21. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €420 - €21 = €399.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. First, we need to add the one-time membership fee of <fact5>€20</fact5> to the total cost. Then, we can calculate the discount amount, which is (€420 + €20) * <fact5>20%</fact5> = €88. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is (€420 + €20) - €88 = €352.

The total cost of the notebooks is <fact4>6 notebooks</fact4> * $8 = $48. So, the total cost without any discount is $165 + $168 + $19 + $48 = $400.

If Gabriel becomes a member and gets a 20% discount, he will pay <fact5>a one-time $20 fee</fact5> and 80% of the total cost. 80% of $400 is 0.8 * $400 = $320. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $320 + $20 = $340.

The total cost of the colored pencils is <fact4>6</fact4> * ₣<fact4>9</fact4> = ₣54. So, the total cost of all the items is ₣252 + ₣154 + ₣20 + ₣54 = ₣480.

If Ravi becomes a member, he will get a <fact5>20% discount</fact5> on all purchases, but he will have to pay a <fact5>one-time ₣20 fee</fact5>. The discount amount will be 20% of ₣480, which is ₣96. So, the total amount Ravi will have to pay as a member is ₣480 - ₣96 + ₣20 = ₣404.

If Ravi does not become a member, he will receive only a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. The discount amount will be 5% of ₣480, which is ₣24. So, the total amount Ravi will have to pay as a non-member is ₣480 - ₣24 = ₣456.

Therefore, the least amount Ravi can spend on everything is ₣404.

He bought <fact1>16 colored pencils which cost ₺10.5 each</fact1>, <fact2>8 pencils which cost ₺18.0 each</fact2>, and <fact3>a ream of bond paper which cost ₺15</fact3>. He also bought <fact4>3 markers which cost ₺11 each</fact4>. Hiroshi can either pay a <fact5>one-time ₺20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive only a <fact6>5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Hiroshi can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact1>16</fact1> * ₺<fact1>10.5</fact1> = ₺168. The cost of the pencils is <fact2>8</fact2> * ₺<fact2>18.0</fact2> = ₺144. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ₺<fact3>15</fact3>. The cost of the markers is <fact4>3</fact4> * ₺<fact4>11</fact4> = ₺33. So, the total cost without any discount is ₺168 + ₺144 + ₺15 + ₺33 = ₺360.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is ₺360 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = ₺360 * 0.05 = ₺18. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is ₺360 - ₺18 = ₺342.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time membership fee. The discount amount is ₺360 * <fact5>20%</fact5> = ₺360 * 0.20 = ₺72. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is ₺360 - ₺72 = ₺288. Adding the one-time membership fee of ₺<fact5>20</fact5>, the total cost becomes ₺288 + ₺20 = ₺308.

Comparing the two options, the least amount Hiroshi can spend on everything is ₺308.

He also bought <fact4>6 markers which cost €10 each</fact4>. Mohammed can either pay <fact5>a one-time €20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, or not become a member and receive only <fact6>a 5% discount</fact6>. What is the least amount Mohammed can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the folders is <fact1>14 folders</fact1> * €9.5 = €133. The total cost of the notebooks is <fact2>12 notebooks</fact2> * €11.0 = €132. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>€15</fact3>. The total cost of the markers is <fact4>6 markers</fact4> * €10 = €60. So, the total cost without any discount is €133 + €132 + €15 + €60 = €340.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is €340 * <fact6>5%</fact6> = €17. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €340 - €17 = €323.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. First, we need to add the one-time membership fee of <fact5>€20</fact5> to the total cost. Then, we can calculate the discount amount, which is (€340 + €20) * <fact5>20%</fact5> = €72. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is (€340 + €20) - €72 = €288.

Since €288 is less than €323, the least amount Mohammed can spend on everything is €288.

What is the least amount Liam can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the markers is <fact1>16 markers</fact1> * €<fact1>4.75</fact1> = €76. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact2>14 colored pencils</fact2> * €<fact2>8.5</fact2> = €119. The cost of the ream of bond paper is €<fact3>15</fact3>. The cost of the pencils is <fact4>3 pencils</fact4> * €<fact4>10</fact4> = €30. So, the total cost without any discount is €76 + €119 + €15 + €30 = €240.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €240, which is €240 * 0.05 = €12. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €240 - €12 = €228.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount. First, we need to add the one-time membership fee of €<fact5>20</fact5> to the total cost. Then, we can calculate the discount amount, which is 20% of €240, or €240 * 0.20 = €48. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €240 - €48 + €20 = €212.

Since €212 is less than €228, Liam should become a member and get the 20% discount to spend the least amount of money.

What is the least amount Umar can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Umar bought. The total cost of the folders is <fact1>22 folders</fact1> * ¥5.0 = ¥110 + <fact4>8 folders</fact4> * ¥11 = ¥88, for a total of ¥110 + ¥88 = ¥198. The total cost of the pencils is <fact2>14 pencils</fact2> * ¥16.5 = ¥231. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>¥11</fact3>. So, the total cost of all the items is ¥198 + ¥231 + ¥11 = ¥440.

If Umar becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time ¥20 fee</fact5>. So, the total amount he will spend as a member is ¥440 - (20% of ¥440) + ¥20. 20% of ¥440 is 0.2 * ¥440 = ¥88. So, the total amount Umar will spend as a member is ¥440 - ¥88 + ¥20 = ¥372.

If Umar does not become a member, he will receive <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. So, the total amount he will spend as a non-member is ¥440 - (5% of ¥440). 5% of ¥440 is 0.05 * ¥440 = ¥22. So, the total amount Umar will spend as a non-member is ¥440 - ¥22 = ¥418.

Since ¥372 is less than ¥418, Umar will spend the least amount of money if he becomes a member.

On <fact3>Friday, he watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>, which is a total of 4 + 15/60 = 4.25 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours we've calculated so far: 8 + 16 + 2.25 + 4.25 = 30.5 hours.

Since <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, we subtract the hours we've calculated from the total: 31 - 30.5 = 0.5 hours.

We know that <fact2>Thursday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2>, and we need to find out how many episodes he watched. Since 0.5 hours is equal to 30 minutes, and each episode is 15 minutes, we can divide 30 minutes by 15 minutes to get the number of episodes: 30/15 = 2.

If <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Alejandro watched on the days other than Wednesday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 * 4 = 8 hours of TV (<fact1>4 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Thursday, he watched 4 hours and 15 minutes, which is 4.25 hours (<fact3>4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>). On Friday, he watched 4 * 3 = 12 hours (<fact4>four 3-hour episodes</fact4>).

On Monday, he watched <fact3>5 hours + 45 minutes = 5.75 hours</fact3>. On Tuesday, he watched <fact4>5 episodes * 2 hours = 10 hours</fact4>.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total time Ibrahim spent watching TV on Saturday and Sunday. Since <fact1>he watched 5-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he spent a total of 2 * 5 = 10 hours watching TV on these two days.

On <fact3>Tuesday, he watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>, which is equivalent to 2 hours + 0.25 hours = 2.25 hours.

Since <fact6>he watched 21 hours of TV in all</fact6>, the time spent watching TV on Monday is 21 - 18.5 = 2.5 hours.

Finally, since <fact2>Monday's episodes were 30 minutes each</fact2>, we can calculate the number of episodes by dividing the total time by the episode length: 2.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 5 episodes.

On <fact2>Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 3-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Thursday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours Umar watched on Saturday and Sunday. Since <fact1>he watched 5-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he watched a total of 5 + 5 = 10 hours. 

On <fact3>Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>, which is equivalent to 3 + 0.5 = 3.5 hours. 

On <fact4>Wednesday, he watched two 3-hour episodes</fact4>, which is equivalent to 2 x 3 = 6 hours. 

On <fact5>Thursday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to 3 x 0.75 = 2.25 hours. 

So far, Umar has watched 10 + 3.5 + 6 + 2.25 = 21.75 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 23 - 21.75 = 1.25 hours on Monday. 

Since each episode on Monday is 15 minutes, we can convert 1.25 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 1.25 x 60 = 75 minutes. 

Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 75 / 15 = 5 episodes.

If <fact6>he watched 27 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Sunday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Alejandro watched on the days other than Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, he watched a total of <fact1>2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours</fact1>. On Monday, he watched a total of <fact3>4 hours + 15 minutes = 4.25 hours</fact3>. On Tuesday, he watched a total of <fact4>5 episodes * 2 hours/episode = 10 hours</fact4>. On Wednesday, he watched a total of <fact5>5 episodes * 30 minutes/episode = 2.5 hours</fact5>. So, the total hours of TV he watched on the days other than Sunday is 8 + 4.25 + 10 + 2.5 = 24.75 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 27 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 27 - 24.75 = 2.25 hours of TV on Sunday. Since each episode on Sunday is 45 minutes, we can convert 2.25 hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 2.25 * 60 = 135 minutes. Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes: 135 / 45 = 3 episodes.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total hours of TV Qasim watched on the days other than Saturday. On Thursday and Friday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact1>3 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Sunday, he watched 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours of TV (<fact3>2-hour episode and a 60-minute show</fact3>). On Monday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact4>two 3-hour episodes</fact4>).

On <fact2>Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 60-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Friday, he got to stay up late, so he watched five 2-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Saturday, he watched two episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 29 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total hours of TV Sanjay watched on the days other than Wednesday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact1>3 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Thursday, he watched 5 hours + 30 minutes = 5.5 hours of TV (<fact3>5 hours for one episode and 30 minutes for another</fact3>). On Friday, he watched 5 * 2 = 10 hours of TV (<fact4>5 episodes, each 2 hours long</fact4>). On Saturday, he watched 2 * 45 minutes = 1.5 hours of TV (<fact5>2 episodes, each 45 minutes long</fact5>). So, the total hours of TV watched on days other than Wednesday is 6 + 5.5 + 10 + 1.5 = 23 hours. Since <fact6>Sanjay watched a total of 29 hours of TV</fact6>, he must have watched 29 - 23 = 6 hours of TV on Wednesday. Since each episode on Wednesday was 60 minutes long (<fact2>60-minute show</fact2>), Sanjay watched 6 hours / 1 hour per episode = 6 episodes on Wednesday.

If <fact6>he watched 25 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 60-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on the days other than Saturday. On Thursday and Friday, Benjamin watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact1>3 hours each night for 2 nights</fact1>). On Sunday, he watched 5 hours + 1 hour = 6 hours of TV (<fact3>5-hour episode and a 60-minute show</fact3>). On Monday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact4>two 3-hour episodes</fact4>). On Tuesday, he watched 2 * 0.5 = 1 hour of TV (<fact5>two 30-minute episodes</fact5>). So, the total hours of TV watched on the days other than Saturday is 6 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 19 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 25 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 25 - 19 = 6 hours of TV on Saturday.

If <fact6>he watched 26 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: Viktor watched <fact1>3 hours</fact1> * 2 nights = 6 hours on Monday and Tuesday.
He watched <fact3>2 hours + 0.5 hours</fact3> = 2.5 hours on Thursday.
He watched <fact4>5 episodes</fact4> * 3 hours per episode = 15 hours on Friday.
He watched <fact5>5 episodes</fact5> * 0.25 hours per episode = 1.25 hours on Saturday.
So, excluding Wednesday, Viktor watched 6 + 2.5 + 15 + 1.25 = 24.75 hours of TV.
Since <fact6>he watched 26 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 26 - 24.75 = 1.25 hours of TV on Wednesday.

If <fact6>he watched 24 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Esteban watched on the days other than Monday. On <fact1>Saturday and Sunday, he watched 3-hour episodes each night</fact1>, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 hours. On <fact3>Tuesday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show</fact3>, which is 3 + 0.75 = 3.75 hours. On <fact4>Wednesday, he watched three 3-hour episodes</fact4>, which is 3 * 3 = 9 hours.

So, the total hours of TV Esteban watched on the days other than Monday is 6 + 3.75 + 9 + 3 = 21.75 hours.

Since <fact6>he watched 24 hours of TV in all</fact6>, the number of hours he watched on Monday is 24 - 21.75 = 2.25 hours. Since each episode on Monday is 45 minutes, which is 0.75 hours, the number of episodes he watched on Monday is 2.25 / 0.75 = 3 episodes.

If <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Monday and Tuesday. Since <fact1>he watched 6-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he watched a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

On <fact3>Thursday, he watched a 6-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>, which is equivalent to 6 + 0.5 = 6.5 hours.

On <fact4>Friday, he watched four 2-hour episodes</fact4>, which is equivalent to 4 x 2 = 8 hours.

On <fact5>Saturday, he watched three episodes, each 15 minutes</fact5>, which is equivalent to 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours watched on these days: 12 + 6.5 + 8 + 0.75 = 27.25 hours.

Since <fact6>he watched 31 hours of TV in all</fact6>, the hours watched on Wednesday can be found by subtracting the total hours watched on other days from the total hours: 31 - 27.25 = 3.75 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 45 minutes, we can convert the hours watched on Wednesday to minutes: 3.75 x 60 = 225 minutes.

Now, we can divide the total minutes watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode: 225 / 45 = 5 episodes.

How many plates were in the package that Ananya bought?

Answer: Ananya started with an unknown number of plates from the package she bought, denoted as x. She then received <fact2>18 plates</fact2> from her husband. So, the total number of plates she had was x + 18. After <fact3>using 9 plates</fact3> and <fact4>throwing away 6 plates</fact4>, she had x + 18 - 9 - 6 = x + 3 plates. The guests <fact5>brought 3 packs of 6 plates each</fact5>, which is 3 * 6 = 18 plates. So, the total number of plates Ananya had was x + 3 + 18 = x + 21. Since she had a total of <fact6>56 plates</fact6>, we can set up the equation x + 21 = 56. Solving for x, we get x = 56 - 21 = 35. Therefore, the package Ananya bought had 35 plates.

Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Xena bought as x. We know that Xena's husband bought <fact2>17 new spoons</fact2> and the guests brought <fact5>2 packs of spoons, each having 9 inside them</fact5>, which is 2 * 9 = 18 spoons. Xena also <fact3>used 9 spoons</fact3> and threw away <fact4>9 defective spoons</fact4>.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Priya pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren. Each child needs <fact2>6 skeins for a hat</fact2> + <fact3>6 skeins for a cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a shawl</fact4> + <fact5>11 skeins for gloves</fact5> + <fact6>9 skeins for booties</fact6> = 44 skeins. Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins needed for them is 44 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 176 skeins.

For Priya's jackets, she needs <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>8 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 16 skeins.

In total, Priya needs 176 + 16 = 192 skeins. Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $9</fact9>, we need to convert the total number of skeins to dozens. 192 skeins is equal to 192 / 12 = 16 dozen skeins.

The total cost is 16 * <fact9>$9</fact9> = $144. Since the total cost is over $100, Priya receives a <fact10>$20 discount</fact10>. Therefore, the final amount Priya should pay is $144 - <fact10>$20</fact10> = $124.

Answer: Nia needs to make a shawl, vest, hat, gloves, and leg warmers for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>. So, she needs <fact2>3 skeins of wool</fact2> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 12 skeins of wool for shawls, <fact3>6 skeins of wool</fact3> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 24 skeins of wool for vests, <fact4>8 skeins of wool</fact4> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 32 skeins of wool for hats, <fact5>12 skeins of wool</fact5> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 48 skeins of wool for gloves, and <fact6>13 skeins of wool</fact6> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 52 skeins of wool for leg warmers.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact9>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact9>. How much should Beatriz pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we must first calculate the number of skeins needed for the grandchildren and then add the number needed for Beatriz's jackets. 
For each of the <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, Beatriz needs <fact2>5 skeins for a cardigan</fact2> + <fact3>5 skeins for a hat</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a shawl</fact4> + <fact5>12 skeins for a pair of mittens</fact5> + <fact6>10 skeins for a pair of gloves</fact6> = 44 skeins. 
So, for all <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, Beatriz needs 5 x 44 = 220 skeins of wool. 
For her two jackets, Beatriz needs 2 x <fact7>10 skeins</fact7> = 20 skeins of wool. 
Therefore, Beatriz needs a total of 220 + 20 = 240 skeins of wool. 
Since <fact8>each dozen skeins costs $6</fact8>, we divide 240 by 12 to get 20 dozen skeins. 
The total cost is 20 x <fact8>$6</fact8> = $120. 
Since the total cost is over $100, Beatriz receives a <fact9>$20 discount</fact9>. 
So, the final cost is $120 - <fact9>$20</fact9> = $100.

For Elena's jackets, she needs <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>9 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 18 skeins.

In total, Elena needs 138 + 18 = 156 skeins. Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $8</fact9>, the total cost is 156 / 12 * 8 = $104.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's clothing. 
<fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> * (<fact2>6 skeins for a vest</fact2> + <fact3>5 skeins for a sweater</fact3> + <fact4>11 skeins for a beanie</fact4> + <fact5>8 skeins for socks</fact5> + <fact6>10 skeins for mittens</fact6>) = 5 * (6 + 5 + 11 + 8 + 10) = 5 * 40 = 200 skeins.
Quinn also needs <fact7>8 skeins of wool</fact7> * 2 = 16 skeins for her own jackets. 
So, the total number of skeins needed is 200 + 16 = 216 skeins.
Since <fact8>each dozen skeins costs $7</fact8>, the total cost is 216 / 12 * 7 = 126 dollars.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's clothing. Each child needs <fact2>5 skeins for a hat</fact2> + <fact3>5 skeins for a cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a beanie</fact4> + <fact5>11 skeins for leg warmers</fact5> + <fact6>11 skeins for gloves</fact6> = 44 skeins.

Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins needed for them is 46 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 184 skeins.

Tara also wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing <fact7>10 skeins of wool</fact7>, so she needs an additional <fact7>10</fact7> * 2 = 20 skeins.

The total number of skeins needed is 184 + 20 = 204 skeins. Since each <fact8>dozen skeins costs $8</fact8>, the total cost is 204 / 12 * <fact8>$8</fact8> = $136.

Since <fact9>each dozen skeins of wool costs $9</fact9>, we can calculate the total cost by dividing the total number of skeins by 12 and multiplying by 9. 180 skeins / 12 = 15, and 15 * 9 = $135.

However, the store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. Since Olivia's total is $135, which is over $100, she qualifies for the discount. Therefore, the final amount she should pay is $135 - $20 = $115.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Leilani pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: Leilani needs to make a set of clothes for each of her <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>.

Answer: To determine how much Keisha should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs to make 4 shawls, 4 sweaters, 4 ponchos, 4 pairs of gloves, and 4 pairs of mittens. This requires (<fact2>5 skeins/shawl</fact2> * 4 shawls) + (<fact3>6 skeins/sweater</fact3> * 4 sweaters) + (<fact4>8 skeins/poncho</fact4> * 4 ponchos) + (<fact5>8 skeins/pair of gloves</fact5> * 4 pairs of gloves) + (<fact6>14 skeins/pair of mittens</fact6> * 4 pairs of mittens) = 20 + 24 + 32 + 32 + 56 = 164 skeins of wool. Additionally, she needs to make 2 warm jackets for herself, which requires (<fact7>8 skeins/jacket</fact7> * 2 jackets) = 16 skeins of wool. In total, she needs 164 + 16 = 180 skeins of wool.

Since each <fact8>dozen skeins of wool costs $7</fact8>, the total cost of the wool is (180 skeins / 12 skeins/dozen) * $7/dozen = 15 * $7 = $105.

Since the total cost is over $100, Keisha is eligible for the <fact9>$20 discount</fact9>. Therefore, the final amount she should pay is $105 - $20 = $85.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Sakura pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren's clothing. 
<fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> * (<fact2>4 skeins for a tunic</fact2> + <fact3>6 skeins for a cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>10 skeins for a shawl</fact4> + <fact5>10 skeins for booties</fact5> + <fact6>14 skeins for mittens</fact6>) = 3 * (4 + 6 + 10 + 10 + 14) = 3 * 44 = 132 skeins.
Then, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for Sakura's jackets. 
<fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>6 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 12 skeins.
So, the total number of skeins needed is 132 + 12 = 144 skeins.
Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $9</fact9>, the total cost is 144 / 12 * 9 = 108 dollars.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact9>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact9>. How much should Winnie pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, calculate the total number of skeins needed for the grandchildren. 
<fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1> * (<fact2>5 skeins for a beanie</fact2> + <fact3>6 skeins for a shawl</fact3> + <fact4>8 skeins for a poncho</fact4> + <fact5>10 skeins for mittens</fact5> + <fact6>11 skeins for leg warmers</fact6>) = 4 * (5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 11) = 4 * 40 = 160 skeins.
Then, calculate the number of skeins needed for Winnie's jackets. 
2 jackets * <fact7>4 skeins per jacket</fact7> = 8 skeins.
So, the total number of skeins needed is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins.
Now, calculate the total cost before the discount.

Answer: To calculate the total number of skeins needed, we first need to calculate the number of skeins needed for the grandchildren. 
For each grandchild, the number of skeins needed is <fact3>3 skeins for a shawl</fact3> + <fact4>6 skeins for a cardigan</fact4> + <fact5>12 skeins for a tunic</fact5> + <fact6>12 skeins for a pair of booties</fact6> + <fact7>15 skeins for a pair of socks</fact7> = 3 + 6 + 12 + 12 + 15 = 48 skeins. 
Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins needed for them is 48 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 192 skeins. 
Isabella also needs <fact9>6 skeins of wool</fact9> for each of her <fact8>two warm jackets</fact8>, so she needs an additional <fact9>6</fact9> * <fact8>2</fact8> = 12 skeins.

Answer: To determine how much Leilani should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs to make 4 sets of winter wear. Each set requires <fact2>4 skeins for a tunic</fact2> + <fact3>4 skeins for a vest</fact3> + <fact4>10 skeins for a beanie</fact4> + <fact5>12 skeins for a pair of socks</fact5> + <fact6>13 skeins for a pair of gloves</fact6> = 43 skeins.

Answer: To calculate the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the number of skeins needed for each item and multiply it by the number of grandchildren. 
The number of skeins needed for tunics is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact2>3</fact2> = 12 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for shawls is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact3>6</fact3> = 24 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for hats is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact4>12</fact4> = 48 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for booties is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact5>12</fact5> = 48 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for gloves is <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact6>15</fact6> = 60 skeins. 
The number of skeins needed for Uma's jackets is <fact7>2</fact7> * <fact8>12</fact8> = 24 skeins. 
The total number of skeins needed is 12 + 24 + 48 + 48 + 60 + 24 = 216 skeins.

<fact8>7 skeins per jacket</fact8> * <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> 
= 7 * 2 
= 14 skeins.

The total number of skeins needed is 190 + 14 = 204 skeins. 

Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $6</fact9>, the total cost is: 
(204 / 12) * 6 
= 17 * 6

Since the total cost is over $100, Emma receives a <fact10>$20 discount</fact10>. Therefore, the final amount Emma should pay is $102 - $20 = $82.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Nadia pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: To determine how much Nadia should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs to make 4 sets of winter wear. Each set requires <fact2>4 skeins for a sweater</fact2> + <fact3>5 skeins for a vest</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a beanie</fact4> + <fact5>11 skeins for a pair of booties</fact5> + <fact6>13 skeins for a pair of socks</fact6> = 45 skeins. Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 45 * 4 = 180 skeins for them. Additionally, she needs <fact8>6 skeins of wool</fact8> for each of her <fact7>two warm jackets</fact7>, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 skeins for herself. In total, Nadia needs 180 + 12 = 192 skeins of wool.

Since <fact9>each dozen skeins of wool costs $9</fact9>, we can calculate the total cost by dividing the total number of skeins by 12 and multiplying by 9. 192 skeins / 12 = 16, and 16 * 9 = $144.

However, the store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. Since Nadia's total is $144, which is over $100, she is eligible for the discount. Therefore, the final amount Nadia should pay is $144 - $20 = $124.

Answer: To determine how much Mia should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs to make 4 sets of winter wear. Each set requires <fact2>4 skeins for a shawl</fact2> + <fact3>5 skeins for a hat</fact3> + <fact4>9 skeins for a sweater</fact4> + <fact5>9 skeins for a pair of booties</fact5> + <fact6>10 skeins for a pair of mittens</fact6> = 37 skeins. Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 37 * 4 = 148 skeins of wool for them. Additionally, she needs <fact7>10 skeins of wool</fact7> for each of her two jackets, so that's another 20 skeins. In total, she needs 148 + 20 = 168 skeins of wool.

Since each <fact8>dozen skeins of wool costs $8</fact8>, we can calculate the total cost by dividing the total number of skeins by 12 and multiplying by the cost per dozen. 168 skeins / 12 = 14 dozen. 14 dozen * <fact8>$8 per dozen</fact8> = $112.

Answer: Ananya needs to make a shawl, tunic, vest, mittens, and socks for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>. So, she needs <fact2>6 skeins of wool</fact2> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 24 skeins for shawls, <fact3>4 skeins of wool</fact3> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 16 skeins for tunics, <fact4>9 skeins of wool</fact4> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 36 skeins for vests, <fact5>10 skeins of wool</fact5> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 40 skeins for mittens, and <fact6>11 skeins of wool</fact6> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 44 skeins for socks.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Rania pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed for the grandchildren's clothing. 
<fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> * (<fact2>6 skeins for a vest</fact2> + <fact3>3 skeins for a cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>12 skeins for a tunic</fact4> + <fact5>10 skeins for leg warmers</fact5> + <fact6>11 skeins for socks</fact6>) = 5 * (6 + 3 + 12 + 10 + 11) = 5 * 42 = 210 skeins.
Then, we add the skeins needed for Rania's jackets: <fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>9 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 18 skeins.
So, the total number of skeins needed is 210 + 18 = 228 skeins.
Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $9</fact9>, the total cost before the discount is 228 / 12 * 9 = $171.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Priya pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: To find the total number of skeins of wool Priya needs, we first need to calculate the number of skeins needed for her grandchildren. Since she has <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> and each needs a poncho, cardigan, sweater, socks, and leg warmers, the total number of skeins needed for them is:
<fact1>5</fact1> * (<fact2>6</fact2> + <fact3>6</fact3> + <fact4>12</fact4> + <fact5>8</fact5> + <fact6>14</fact6>) = 5 * 46 = 230 skeins.

Priya also wants to make <fact7>two warm jackets for herself</fact7>, each needing <fact8>11 skeins of wool</fact8>, so she needs an additional <fact7>2</fact7> * <fact8>11</fact8> = 22 skeins.

In total, Priya needs 230 + 22 = 252 skeins of wool.

Since <fact9>each dozen skeins of wool costs $8</fact9>, the total cost of the wool is 252 / 12 * 8 = 168 dollars.

However, the store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>, so Priya will get a $20 discount. Therefore, the final amount Priya should pay is 168 - 20 = 148 dollars.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10>. How much should Zahra pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: To determine how much Zahra should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs to make 4 sets of winter wear. Each set requires <fact2>3 skeins for a sweater</fact2> + <fact3>4 skeins for a beanie</fact3> + <fact4>11 skeins for a cardigan</fact4> + <fact5>8 skeins for socks</fact5> + <fact6>9 skeins for mittens</fact6> = 35 skeins. So, for all 4 grandchildren, she needs 35 * 4 = 140 skeins. Additionally, Zahra wants to make <fact7>two warm jackets for herself</fact7>, each requiring <fact8>8 skeins of wool</fact8>, so she needs 2 * 8 = 16 more skeins. In total, Zahra needs 140 + 16 = 156 skeins of wool.

Since <fact9>each dozen skeins costs $8</fact9>, we divide the total number of skeins by 12 to find out how many dozens Zahra needs to buy: 156 / 12 = 13. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is 13 * $8 = $104.

Given that the store offers a <fact10>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact10> and Zahra's purchase is $104, which is over $100, she is eligible for the discount. Thus, the final amount Zahra should pay is $104 - $20 = $84.

Then, let's calculate the total number of skeins needed for Sofia's jackets. 
<fact7>2 jackets</fact7> * <fact8>6 skeins per jacket</fact8> = 12 skeins.
So, the total number of skeins needed is 180 + 12 = 192 skeins.

For her <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs <fact1>5</fact1> * (<fact2>4 skeins for a sweater</fact2> + <fact3>4 skeins for a beanie</fact3> + <fact4>8 skeins for a poncho</fact4> + <fact5>8 skeins for a pair of gloves</fact5> + <fact6>12 skeins for a pair of mittens</fact6>) = 5 * (4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 12) = 5 * 36 = 180 skeins of wool. For her <fact7>two warm jackets</fact7>, she needs <fact7>2</fact7> * <fact8>6 skeins of wool</fact8> = 12 skeins of wool. In total, she needs 180 + 12 = 192 skeins of wool. Since <fact9>each dozen skeins of wool costs $8</fact9>, the total cost is 192 / 12 * 8 = $128. Since the total cost is over $100, Mia receives a <fact10>$20 discount</fact10>. Therefore, she should pay $128 - $20 = $108.

Answer: Ava needs to make a vest, sweater, hat, mittens, and gloves for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>. So, she needs <fact2>5 skeins of wool</fact2> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 20 skeins of wool for vests, <fact3>4 skeins of wool</fact3> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 16 skeins of wool for sweaters, <fact4>8 skeins of wool</fact4> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 32 skeins of wool for hats, <fact5>9 skeins of wool</fact5> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 36 skeins of wool for mittens, and <fact6>15 skeins of wool</fact6> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 60 skeins of wool for gloves.

The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact9>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact9>. How much should Beatriz pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: To determine how much Beatriz should pay, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool she needs. For her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs to make 4 sets of winter wear. Each set requires <fact2>3 skeins for a beanie</fact2> + <fact3>4 skeins for a hat</fact3> + <fact4>9 skeins for a sweater</fact4> + <fact5>12 skeins for gloves</fact5> + <fact6>11 skeins for booties</fact6> = 3 + 4 + 9 + 12 + 11 = 39 skeins. Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 39 * 4 = 156 skeins for them. Additionally, she needs <fact7>6 skeins of wool</fact7> for each of her two jackets, so that's 6 * 2 = 12 skeins for herself. In total, Beatriz needs 156 + 12 = 168 skeins of wool.

Since each <fact8>dozen skeins of wool costs $9</fact8>, and Beatriz needs 168 skeins, we divide 168 by 12 to get the number of dozens she needs, which is 14. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is 14 * $9 = $126.

Since the total cost is over $100, Beatriz qualifies for the <fact9>$20 discount</fact9>. Therefore, the final amount she should pay is $126 - $20 = $106.

How many more oz of cookies does Gabriel need to consume than Valentina?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Gabriel and Valentina. Gabriel's target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. Valentina's target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Gabriel and Valentina have already consumed. Gabriel has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 750 calories. Valentina has consumed <fact8>1100 calories</fact8> + <fact9>250 calories</fact9> = 1350 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Gabriel and Valentina can consume. Gabriel can consume 3000 - 750 = 2250 calories. Valentina can consume 1950 - 1350 = 600 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of cookies has 150 calories per serving</fact1>, Gabriel can consume 2250 / 150 = 15 servings of cookies. Valentina can consume 600 / 150 = 4 servings of cookies.

Finally, since <fact2>a 100 oz bag has 4 servings</fact2>, Gabriel can consume 15 * 100 / 4 = 375 oz of cookies. Valentina can consume 4 * 100 / 4 = 100 oz of cookies.

How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Valentina?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Valentina. Hiroshi's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>230 lbs</fact4> = 3450 calories. Valentina's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>180 lbs</fact7> = 2700 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Valentina have already consumed. Hiroshi has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 750 calories. Valentina has consumed <fact8>1100 calories</fact8> + <fact9>250 calories</fact9> = 1350 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Hiroshi and Valentina can consume. Hiroshi can consume 3450 - 750 = 2700 calories. Valentina can consume 2700 - 1350 = 1350 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 450 calories per serving</fact1>, Hiroshi can consume 2700 / 450 = 6 servings of popcorn. Valentina can consume 1350 / 450 = 3 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>a 275 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Hiroshi can consume 6 / 5 * 275 = 330 grams of popcorn. Valentina can consume 3 / 5 * 275 = 165 grams of popcorn.

How many more oz of cookies does Bodhi need to consume than Nia?

Answer: Bodhi's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>230 pounds</fact4> = 3450 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> - <fact6>50 calories</fact6> = 1050 calories. So he can consume 3450 - 1050 = 2400 more calories. Nia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>130 pounds</fact7> = 1950 calories. She has already consumed <fact8>1000 calories</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories</fact9> = 1150 calories. So she can consume 1950 - 1150 = 800 more calories. Bodhi can consume 2400 / <fact1>200 calories per serving</fact1> = 12 more servings of cookies, while Nia can consume 800 / <fact1>200 calories per serving</fact1> = 4 more servings of cookies. Since <fact2>a 400 oz bag has 5 servings</fact2>, each serving is 400 / 5 = 80 oz. So Bodhi can consume 12 * 80 = 960 more oz of cookies, while Nia can consume 4 * 80 = 320 more oz of cookies. Therefore, Bodhi can consume 960 - 320 = 640 more oz of cookies than Nia.

How many more ounces of breads does Sanjay need to consume than Sofia?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Sanjay and Sofia. Sanjay's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>210 pounds</fact4> = 3150 calories. Sofia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>150 pounds</fact7> = 2250 calories.

Sanjay has already <fact5>consumed 1150 calories</fact5> and <fact6>burned 100 calories through exercise</fact6>, so he has a net calorie intake of 1150 - 100 = 1050 calories. To reach his daily calorie target, he needs to consume 3150 - 1050 = 2100 more calories.

Sofia has already <fact8>consumed 800 calories in food</fact8> and <fact9>225 calories in ice cream</fact9>, so she has a total calorie intake of 800 + 225 = 1025 calories. To reach her daily calorie target, she needs to consume 2250 - 1025 = 1225 more calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 175 calories per serving</fact1>, Sanjay needs 2100 / 175 = 12 servings to reach his daily calorie target. Sofia needs 1225 / 175 = 7 servings to reach her daily calorie target.

Since <fact2>a 125 ounces bag has 5 servings</fact2>, each serving is 125 / 5 = 25 ounces. Sanjay needs 12 servings, which is 12 * 25 = 300 ounces. Sofia needs 7 servings, which is 7 * 25 = 175 ounces.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Esteban and Nadia. Esteban's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>230 lbs</fact4> = 3450 calories. Nadia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>160 lbs</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Esteban and Nadia have already consumed. Esteban has consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> - <fact6>100 calories through exercise</fact6> = 1000 calories. Nadia has consumed <fact8>1000 in food</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1175 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Esteban and Nadia can consume. Esteban can consume 3450 - 1000 = 2450 calories. Nadia can consume 2400 - 1175 = 1225 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of cookies has 175 calories per serving</fact1>, Esteban can consume 2450 / 175 = 14 servings of cookies. Nadia can consume 1225 / 175 = 7 servings of cookies.

How many more oz of cookies does Santiago need to consume than Keisha?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Santiago and Keisha. Santiago's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>220 lbs</fact4> = 3300 calories. Keisha's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>160 lbs</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Santiago and Keisha have already consumed. Santiago has consumed <fact5>1200 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 1050 calories. Keisha has consumed <fact8>1000 calories</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories</fact9> = 1150 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Santiago and Keisha can consume. Santiago can consume 3300 - 1050 = 2250 calories. Keisha can consume 2400 - 1150 = 1250 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of cookies has 250 calories per serving</fact1>, Santiago can consume 2250 / 250 = 9 servings of cookies. Keisha can consume 1250 / 250 = 5 servings of cookies.

Finally, since <fact2>a 150 oz bag has 5 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the number of oz of cookies Santiago and Keisha can consume. Santiago can consume 9 servings * 150 oz / 5 servings = 270 oz of cookies. Keisha can consume 5 servings * 150 oz / 5 servings = 150 oz of cookies.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Deshawn and Xena. Deshawn's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>200 pounds</fact4> = 3000 calories. Xena's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>160 pounds</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Deshawn and Xena have already consumed. Deshawn has consumed <fact5>1200 calories</fact5> - <fact6>100 calories</fact6> = 1100 calories. Xena has consumed <fact8>800 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 975 calories.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Oliver and Emma. For Oliver, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>210 pounds</fact4> = 3150 calories. For Emma, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>170 pounds</fact7> = 2550 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Oliver and Emma have already consumed. Oliver has consumed <fact5>1050 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 900 calories. Emma has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories</fact9> = 1050 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Oliver and Emma can consume. Oliver can consume 3150 - 900 = 2250 calories. Emma can consume 2550 - 1050 = 1500 calories.

Since <fact1>one serving of popcorn has 375 calories</fact1>, Oliver can consume 2250 / 375 = 6 servings of popcorn. Emma can consume 1500 / 375 = 4 servings of popcorn.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Yusuf and Priya. Yusuf's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>250 lbs</fact4> = 3750 calories. Priya's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories.

The healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3>. <fact4>Luca weighs 230 lbs</fact4>, and he has already <fact5>consumed 900 calories</fact5> and <fact6>burned 150 calories through exercise</fact6>. <fact7>Chen weighs 170 lbs</fact7>, and she has already <fact8>consumed 800 in food</fact8> and <fact9>175 calories in ice cream</fact9>. How many more grams of popcorn does Luca need to consume than Chen?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Luca and Chen. Luca's target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>230 lbs</fact4> = 3450 calories. Chen's target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>170 lbs</fact7> = 2550 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Luca and Chen have already consumed. Luca has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 750 calories. Chen has consumed <fact8>800 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 975 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Luca and Chen can consume. Luca can consume 3450 - 750 = 2700 calories. Chen can consume 2550 - 975 = 1575 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 225 calories per serving</fact1>, Luca can consume 2700 / 225 = 12 servings of popcorn. Chen can consume 1575 / 225 = 7 servings of popcorn.

Since <fact2>a 300 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, each serving is 300 / 5 = 60 grams. Luca can consume 12 * 60 = 720 grams of popcorn. Chen can consume 7 * 60 = 420 grams of popcorn.

Therefore, Luca needs to consume 720 - 420 = 300 grams more popcorn than Chen.

How many more ounces of breads does Qasim need to consume than Sophia?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Qasim and Sophia. Qasim's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>230 pounds</fact4> = 3450 calories. Sophia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>160 pounds</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Qasim and Sophia have already consumed. Qasim has consumed <fact5>1000 calories</fact5> - <fact6>250 calories</fact6> = 750 calories. Sophia has consumed <fact8>1000 calories</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories</fact9> = 1200 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Qasim and Sophia can consume. Qasim can consume 3450 - 750 = 2700 calories. Sophia can consume 2400 - 1200 = 1200 calories.

Since <fact1>one serving of bread has 300 calories</fact1>, Qasim can consume 2700 / 300 = 9 servings of bread. Sophia can consume 1200 / 300 = 4 servings of bread.

Finally, since <fact2>one 175-ounce bag has 7 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the number of ounces Qasim and Sophia can consume. Qasim can consume 9 / 7 * 175 = 225 ounces of bread. Sophia can consume 4 / 7 * 175 = 100 ounces of bread.

Therefore, Qasim needs to consume 225 - 100 = 125 more ounces of bread than Sophia.

How many more grams of popcorn does Thiago need to consume than Roya?

Answer: Thiago's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>210 lbs</fact4> = 3150 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1250 calories</fact5> - <fact6>50 calories</fact6> = 1200 calories. So he can consume 3150 - 1200 = 1950 calories more. Since <fact1>each serving of popcorn has 325 calories</fact1>, Thiago can consume 1950 / 325 = 6 servings of popcorn. Since <fact2>a 325 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Thiago can consume 6 / 5 * 325 = 390 grams of popcorn.

Roya's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories. She has already consumed <fact8>800 in food</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 975 calories. So she can consume 1950 - 975 = 975 calories more.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Liam and Valeria. Liam's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>230 pounds</fact4> = 3450 calories. Valeria's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>180 pounds</fact7> = 2700 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Liam and Valeria have already consumed. Liam has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> - <fact6>200 calories</fact6> = 700 calories. Valeria has consumed <fact8>800 calories</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories</fact9> = 950 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Liam and Valeria can consume. Liam can consume 3450 - 700 = 2750 calories. Valeria can consume 2700 - 950 = 1750 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 250 calories per serving</fact1>, Liam can consume 2750 / 250 = 11 servings. Valeria can consume 1750 / 250 = 7 servings.

Since <fact2>a 275 ounces bag has 5 servings</fact2>, each serving is 275 / 5 = 55 ounces. Liam needs to consume 11 * 55 = 605 ounces. Valeria needs to consume 7 * 55 = 385 ounces.

How many more grams of popcorn does Jamal need to consume than Kayla?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Jamal and Kayla. For Jamal, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. For Kayla, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>180 lbs</fact7> = 2700 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Jamal and Kayla have already consumed. Jamal has consumed <fact5>1250 calories</fact5> - <fact6>50 calories through exercise</fact6> = 1200 calories. Kayla has consumed <fact8>900 in food</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1100 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Jamal and Kayla can consume to reach their daily targets. For Jamal, it's 3000 - 1200 = 1800 calories. For Kayla, it's 2700 - 1100 = 1600 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving</fact1>, Jamal can consume 1800 / 200 = 9 servings of popcorn, and Kayla can consume 1600 / 200 = 8 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>a 125 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Jamal can consume 9 / 5 = 1.8 bags of popcorn (in grams, that's 1.8 * 125 = 225 grams), and Kayla can consume 8 / 5 = 1.6 bags of popcorn (in grams, that's 1.6 * 125 = 200 grams).

How many more grams of popcorn does Jamal need to consume than Amelia?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Jamal and Amelia. Jamal's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>230 lbs</fact4> = 3450 calories. Amelia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>180 lbs</fact7> = 2700 calories.

Jamal has already <fact5>consumed 1250 calories</fact5> and <fact6>burned 250 calories through exercise</fact6>, so his net calorie consumption is 1250 - 250 = 1000 calories. Amelia has already <fact8>consumed 800 in food</fact8> and <fact9>150 calories in ice cream</fact9>, so her net calorie consumption is 800 + 150 = 950 calories.

Jamal still needs to consume 3450 - 1000 = 2450 calories to reach his daily target, while Amelia still needs to consume 2700 - 950 = 1750 calories to reach her daily target.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 350 calories per serving</fact1>, Jamal needs 2450 / 350 = 7 servings of popcorn, and Amelia needs 1750 / 350 = 5 servings of popcorn.

Since <fact2>a 300 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Jamal needs 7 / 5 * 300 = 420 grams of popcorn, and Amelia needs 5 / 5 * 300 = 300 grams of popcorn.

For Ibrahim, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. For Zahra, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>150 lbs</fact7> = 2250 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Ibrahim and Zahra have already consumed. Ibrahim has consumed <fact5>1050 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 900 calories. Zahra has consumed <fact8>1000 calories</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories</fact9> = 1200 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Ibrahim and Zahra can consume. For Ibrahim, it's 3000 - 900 = 2100 calories. For Zahra, it's 2250 - 1200 = 1050 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 350 calories per serving</fact1>, Ibrahim can consume 2100 / 350 = 6 servings of popcorn, and Zahra can consume 1050 / 350 = 3 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>a 200 grams bag has 4 servings</fact2>, Ibrahim can consume 6 * 200 / 4 = 300 grams of popcorn, and Zahra can consume 3 * 200 / 4 = 150 grams of popcorn.

Therefore, Ibrahim needs to consume 300 - 150 = 150 more grams of popcorn than Zahra.

How many more grams of popcorn does Hiroshi need to consume than Tara?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Hiroshi and Tara. Hiroshi's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>220 lbs</fact4> = 3300 calories. Tara's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>140 lbs</fact7> = 2100 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Hiroshi and Tara have already consumed. Hiroshi has consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> - <fact6>200 calories</fact6> = 900 calories. Tara has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories</fact9> = 1100 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Hiroshi and Tara can consume. Hiroshi can consume 3300 - 900 = 2400 calories. Tara can consume 2100 - 1100 = 1000 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 200 calories per serving</fact1>, Hiroshi can consume 2400 / 200 = 12 servings of popcorn. Tara can consume 1000 / 200 = 5 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>a 300 grams bag has 6 servings</fact2>, Hiroshi can consume 12 / 6 * 300 = 600 grams of popcorn. Tara can consume 5 / 6 * 300 = 250 grams of popcorn.

Therefore, Hiroshi needs to consume 600 - 250 = 350 grams more popcorn than Tara.

How many more grams of popcorn does Leon need to consume than Jasmine?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Leon and Jasmine. For Leon, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>190 pounds</fact4> = 2850 calories. For Jasmine, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>140 pounds</fact7> = 2100 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Leon and Jasmine have already consumed. Leon has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories</fact6> = 750 calories. Jasmine has consumed <fact8>800 calories</fact8> + <fact9>250 calories</fact9> = 1050 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Leon and Jasmine can consume. For Leon, it's 2850 - 750 = 2100 calories. For Jasmine, it's 2100 - 1050 = 1050 calories.

Since <fact1>one serving of popcorn has 150 calories</fact1>, Leon can consume 2100 / 150 = 14 servings of popcorn, and Jasmine can consume 1050 / 150 = 7 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>one 325g bag has 5 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the weight of one serving: 325g / 5 servings = 65g per serving. Therefore, Leon can consume 14 servings * 65g per serving = 910g of popcorn, and Jasmine can consume 7 servings * 65g per serving = 455g of popcorn.

The difference is 910g - 455g = 455g.

How many more ounces of breads does Alejandro need to consume than Mei?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Alejandro and Mei. Alejandro's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>250 lbs</fact4> = 3750 calories. Mei's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>170 lbs</fact7> = 2550 calories.

Alejandro has already <fact5>consumed 1250 calories</fact5> and <fact6>burned 250 calories through exercise</fact6>, so he has a net calorie intake of 1250 - 250 = 1000 calories. To reach his daily calorie target, he needs to consume 3750 - 1000 = 2750 calories more.

Mei has already <fact8>consumed 800 in food</fact8> and <fact9>250 calories in ice cream</fact9>, so she has a total calorie intake of 800 + 250 = 1050 calories. To reach her daily calorie target, she needs to consume 2550 - 1050 = 1500 calories more.

Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 250 calories per serving</fact1>, Alejandro needs to consume 2750 / 250 = 11 servings more, and Mei needs to consume 1500 / 250 = 6 servings more.

Since <fact2>a 175 ounces bag has 7 servings</fact2>, Alejandro needs to consume 11 / 7 * 175 = 275 ounces more, and Mei needs to consume 6 / 7 * 175 = 150 ounces more.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Pavel and Valeria. Pavel's target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>240 pounds</fact4> = 3600 calories. Valeria's target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>180 pounds</fact7> = 2700 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Pavel and Valeria have already consumed. Pavel has consumed <fact5>1050 calories</fact5> - <fact6>50 calories</fact6> = 1000 calories. Valeria has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 1075 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Pavel and Valeria can consume. Pavel can consume 3600 - 1000 = 2600 calories. Valeria can consume 2700 - 1075 = 1625 calories.

Since <fact1>one serving of popcorn has 325 calories</fact1>, Pavel can consume 2600 / 325 = 8 servings of popcorn. Valeria can consume 1625 / 325 = 5 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>one 225g bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Pavel can consume 8 / 5 = 1.6 bags of popcorn. Valeria can consume 5 / 5 = 1 bag of popcorn.

So, Pavel needs to consume 1.6 - 1 = 0.6 bags of popcorn more than Valeria. Since <fact2>one bag is 225g</fact2>, Pavel needs to consume 0.6 * 225g = 135g more popcorn than Valeria.

Finally, since <fact2>a 275 oz bag has 5 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the number of oz per serving as 275 / 5 = 55 oz per serving. Therefore, Noah can consume 6 * 55 = 330 oz, and Emma can consume 4 * 55 = 220 oz.

The difference in oz that Noah can consume compared to Emma is 330 - 220 = 110 oz.

The healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3>. <fact4>Oliver weighs 230 lbs</fact4>, and he has already <fact5>consumed 900 calories</fact5> and <fact6>burned 250 calories through exercise</fact6>. <fact7>Nadia weighs 160 lbs</fact7>, and she has already <fact8>consumed 800 in food</fact8> and <fact9>200 calories in ice cream</fact9>. How many more grams of popcorn does Oliver need to consume than Nadia?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Oliver and Nadia. For Oliver, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>230 pounds</fact4> = 3450 calories. For Nadia, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>160 pounds</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Oliver and Nadia have already consumed. Oliver has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> - <fact6>250 calories burned</fact6> = 650 calories. Nadia has consumed <fact8>800 calories</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1000 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Oliver and Nadia can consume to reach their daily targets. Oliver can consume 3450 - 650 = 2800 calories. Nadia can consume 2400 - 1000 = 1400 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 350 calories per serving</fact1>, Oliver can consume 2800 / 350 = 8 servings of popcorn. Nadia can consume 1400 / 350 = 4 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>a 200 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, Oliver can consume 8 / 5 * 200 = 320 grams of popcorn. Nadia can consume 4 / 5 * 200 = 160 grams of popcorn.

Therefore, Oliver needs to consume 320 - 160 = 160 grams more popcorn than Nadia.

How many more ounces of breads does Jin need to consume than Nadia?

Answer: Jin's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>210 lbs</fact4> = 3150 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1250 calories</fact5> - <fact6>100 calories</fact6> = 1150 calories. So he can consume 3150 - 1150 = 2000 more calories. Since <fact1>each serving of bread has 400 calories</fact1>, Jin can consume 2000 / 400 = 5 servings of bread. Since <fact2>each 100 ounces bag has 4 servings</fact2>, Jin can consume 5 / 4 * 100 = 125 ounces of bread.

Nadia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>150 lbs</fact7> = 2250 calories. She has already consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories</fact9> = 1050 calories. So she can consume 2250 - 1050 = 1200 more calories. Since <fact1>each serving of bread has 400 calories</fact1>, Nadia can consume 1200 / 400 = 3 servings of bread. Since <fact2>each 100 ounces bag has 4 servings</fact2>, Nadia can consume 3 / 4 * 100 = 75 ounces of bread.

Therefore, Jin needs to consume 125 - 75 = 50 more ounces of bread than Nadia.

How many more ounces of breads does Diego need to consume than Priya?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Diego and Priya. For Diego, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>230 pounds</fact4> = 3450 calories. For Priya, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>160 pounds</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Diego and Priya have already consumed. For Diego, he has consumed <fact5>1050 calories</fact5> - <fact6>150 calories burned</fact6> = 900 calories. For Priya, she has consumed <fact8>1100 calories</fact8> + <fact9>250 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1350 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Diego and Priya can consume to reach their daily targets. For Diego, he can consume 3450 - 900 = 2550 calories. For Priya, she can consume 2400 - 1350 = 1050 calories.

Since <fact1>each serving of bread has 150 calories</fact1>, Diego can consume 2550 / 150 = 17 servings of bread, and Priya can consume 1050 / 150 = 7 servings of bread.

Finally, since <fact2>a 300 ounces bag has 4 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the number of ounces of bread Diego and Priya can consume. Diego can consume 17 * 300 / 4 = 1275 ounces of bread, and Priya can consume 7 * 300 / 4 = 525 ounces of bread.

Therefore, Diego needs to consume 1275 - 525 = 750 more ounces of bread than Priya.

How many more grams of popcorn does Arjun need to consume than Uma?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Arjun and Uma. Arjun's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. Uma's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>180 lbs</fact7> = 2700 calories.

Arjun has already consumed <fact5>950 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>50 calories through exercise</fact6>, so he has a net calorie intake of 950 - 50 = 900 calories. Uma has already consumed <fact8>900 in food</fact8> and <fact9>225 calories in ice cream</fact9>, so she has a net calorie intake of 900 + 225 = 1125 calories.

Arjun's remaining calorie target is 3000 - 900 = 2100 calories. Uma's remaining calorie target is 2700 - 1125 = 1575 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 175 calories per serving</fact1>, Arjun can consume 2100 / 175 = 12 servings of popcorn. Uma can consume 1575 / 175 = 9 servings of popcorn.

Since <fact2>a 150 grams bag has 6 servings</fact2>, Arjun needs 12 / 6 = 2 bags of popcorn, which is 2 * 150 = 300 grams. Uma needs 9 / 6 = 1.5 bags of popcorn, which is 1.5 * 150 = 225 grams.

Therefore, Arjun needs to consume 300 - 225 = 75 grams more popcorn than Uma.

How many more ounces of breads does Diego need to consume than Tara?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Diego and Tara. For Diego, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>210 lbs</fact4> = 3150 calories. For Tara, the target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>160 lbs</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Diego and Tara have already consumed. For Diego, he has <fact5>consumed 950 calories</fact5> - <fact6>200 calories burned through exercise</fact6> = 750 calories. For Tara, she has <fact8>consumed 1000 in food</fact8> + <fact9>200 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1200 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Diego and Tara can consume to reach their daily targets. For Diego, he can consume 3150 - 750 = 2400 calories. For Tara, she can consume 2400 - 1200 = 1200 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 400 calories per serving</fact1>, Diego can consume 2400 / 400 = 6 servings, and Tara can consume 1200 / 400 = 3 servings.

Finally, since <fact2>a 150 ounces bag has 5 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the number of ounces Diego and Tara can consume. For Diego, he can consume 6 servings * 150 / 5 = 180 ounces. For Tara, she can consume 3 servings * 150 / 5 = 90 ounces.

Therefore, Diego needs to consume 180 - 90 = 90 more ounces of breads than Tara.

How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Ananya?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for both Theo and Ananya. Theo's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>240 lbs</fact4> = 3600 calories. Ananya's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>160 lbs</fact7> = 2400 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories both Theo and Ananya have already consumed. Theo has consumed <fact5>1150 calories</fact5> - <fact6>250 calories</fact6> = 900 calories. Ananya has consumed <fact8>1100 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 1275 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories both Theo and Ananya can consume. Theo can consume 3600 - 900 = 2700 calories. Ananya can consume 2400 - 1275 = 1125 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of cookies has 225 calories per serving</fact1>, Theo can consume 2700 / 225 = 12 servings of cookies. Ananya can consume 1125 / 225 = 5 servings of cookies.

Finally, since <fact2>a 300 oz bag has 6 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the number of oz of cookies both Theo and Ananya can consume. Theo can consume (12 / 6) * 300 = 600 oz of cookies. Ananya can consume (5 / 6) * 300 = 250 oz of cookies.

Therefore, Theo needs to consume 600 - 250 = 350 oz more cookies than Ananya.

How many more grams of popcorn does Tariq need to consume than Mia?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the daily calorie target for Tariq and Mia. Tariq's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. Mia's daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories.

Next, we need to calculate how many calories Tariq and Mia have already consumed. Tariq has consumed <fact5>950 calories</fact5> - <fact6>50 calories through exercise</fact6> = 900 calories. Mia has consumed <fact8>900 in food</fact8> + <fact9>150 calories in ice cream</fact9> = 1050 calories.

Now, we need to calculate how many more calories Tariq and Mia can consume. Tariq can consume 3000 - 900 = 2100 calories. Mia can consume 1950 - 1050 = 900 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of popcorn has 300 calories per serving</fact1>, Tariq can consume 2100 / 300 = 7 servings of popcorn. Mia can consume 900 / 300 = 3 servings of popcorn.

Finally, since <fact2>a 375 grams bag has 5 servings</fact2>, we can calculate the weight of one serving of popcorn as 375 / 5 = 75 grams. Therefore, Tariq can consume 7 * 75 = 525 grams of popcorn, and Mia can consume 3 * 75 = 225 grams of popcorn.

The difference in the amount of popcorn Tariq and Mia can consume is 525 - 225 = 300 grams.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of swimmers in the class. Since <fact2>50% of the class are swimmers</fact2>, the number of swimmers is <fact1>84</fact1> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 42.
However, <fact5>half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the number of swimmers leaving early is 42 * <fact5>0.5</fact5> = 21.
The <fact3>remaining class</fact3> has <fact1>84</fact1> - 42 = 42 students. Since <fact4>50% of the students are debate team members or part of choir members</fact4>, the number of debate team members and choir members is 42 * <fact4>0.5</fact4> = 21.
So, the total number of students leaving early is 21 (swimmers) + 21 (debate team members and choir members) = 42.

Out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>50% of the students are debate team members or part of robotics club members</fact4>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. <fact5>Half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick</fact5>. Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the competition?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many volleyball players there are. Since <fact2>10% of the class are volleyball players</fact2> and there are <fact1>40 students in the class</fact1>, we can calculate that there are <fact2>10%</fact2> * <fact1>40</fact1> = 4 volleyball players. However, <fact5>half of the volleyball players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so only 4 / 2 = 2 volleyball players will be leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many debate team members or robotics club members there are. Since <fact4>50% of the students are debate team members or part of robotics club members</fact4> out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, we need to first find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. The <fact3>remaining class</fact3> would be the total number of students minus the number of volleyball players, which is <fact1>40</fact1> - 4 = 36 students. Then, we can calculate that there are <fact4>50%</fact4> * 36 = 18 debate team members or robotics club members.

Finally, we need to add the number of volleyball players, debate team members or robotics club members, and the number of cheerleaders. There are 2 volleyball players, 18 debate team members or robotics club members, and <fact6>3 cheerleaders for each of the 3 groups</fact6>, which is 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 2 + 18 + 9 = 29.

Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the competition?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>40% of the class are soccer players</fact2> and there are <fact1>50 students in the class</fact1>, we can calculate that there are <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>50</fact1> = 20 soccer players. However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so only 20 / 2 = 10 soccer players are leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>50 students in the class</fact1> and 20 of them are soccer players, the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> has 50 - 20 = 30 students. Then, we can calculate that <fact4>30% of the students are choir members or part of robotics club members</fact4>, which is <fact4>30%</fact4> * 30 = 9 students.

Finally, we need to add the number of soccer players, choir members, robotics club members, and cheerleaders who are leaving early. We already know that there are 10 soccer players leaving early. Adding the 9 choir members and robotics club members, we get 10 + 9 = 19 students. Since <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6> and there are 3 groups, we need to add 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 19 + 9 = 28.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>50% of the class are soccer players</fact2>, we can calculate this as <fact1>144 students</fact1> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 72 soccer players. However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so only 72 / 2 = 36 soccer players are leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. This will be <fact1>144 students</fact1> - 72 soccer players = 72 students. Then, <fact4>25% of the students are choir members or part of dancers</fact4>, so 72 * <fact4>0.25</fact4> = 18 students are choir members or dancers.

Since there are 3 groups (soccer players, choir members, and dancers), and <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>, 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders will be leaving early.

In total, 36 soccer players + 18 choir members and dancers + 9 cheerleaders = 63 students are leaving early to the competition.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many basketball players there are. Since <fact2>50% of the class are basketball players</fact2>, we can calculate this as <fact1>160 students</fact1> * 0.5 = 80 basketball players. However, <fact5>half of the basketball players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so there are 80 / 2 = 40 basketball players who are not sick and will be leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are 80 basketball players, the remaining class has <fact1>160 students</fact1> - 80 basketball players = 80 students. Then, we can calculate the number of students who are robotics club members or part of debate team members as <fact4>25% of the students in the remaining class</fact4>, which is 80 students * 0.25 = 20 students.

So, in total, there are 40 basketball players and 20 robotics club or debate team members who will be leaving early.

Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the competition?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>25% of the class are soccer players</fact2>, we can calculate 0.25 * <fact1>112 students</fact1> = 28 soccer players. However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so there are 28 / 2 = 14 soccer players who are not sick and will be leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are dancers or choir members. The <fact3>remaining class</fact3> refers to the students who are not soccer players. There are <fact1>112 students</fact1> - 28 soccer players = 84 students in the remaining class. Since <fact4>50% of the students are dancers or part of choir members</fact4>, we can calculate 0.5 * 84 = 42 dancers or choir members.

Now, we can add up the number of students who are leaving early: 14 soccer players + 42 dancers or choir members = 56 students. Additionally, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders in total. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 56 + 9 = 65.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>25% of the class are soccer players</fact2> and there are <fact1>40 students in the class</fact1>, we can calculate that there are 0.25 * 40 = 10 soccer players. However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so only 10 / 2 = 5 soccer players are leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are dancers or part of robotics club members. Since <fact4>40% of the students in the remaining class are dancers or part of robotics club members</fact4>, we need to first find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>40 students in the class</fact1> and 10 of them are soccer players, the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> has 40 - 10 = 30 students. Then, we can calculate that there are 0.4 * 30 = 12 students who are dancers or part of robotics club members.

Finally, we need to add the number of soccer players, dancers or robotics club members, and cheerleaders who are leaving early. We already know that 5 soccer players are leaving early. We also know that there are 12 students who are dancers or part of robotics club members. Additionally, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders leaving early.

Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are swimmers. Since <fact2>48% of the class are swimmers</fact2>, we can calculate the number of swimmers as <fact1>100 students</fact1> * <fact2>0.48</fact2> = 48 students. However, <fact5>half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the actual number of swimmers leaving early is 48 / 2 = 24 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are debate team members or part of choir members. Since <fact4>25% of the students are debate team members or part of choir members</fact4> out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, we first need to find out how many students are in the remaining class. The number of non-swimmers is <fact1>100 students</fact1> - 48 students = 52 students. Then, we can calculate the number of debate team members or choir members as 52 students * <fact4>0.25</fact4> = 13 students.

Finally, we need to add the number of swimmers, debate team members or choir members, and the accompanying cheerleaders. Since <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>, the total number of cheerleaders is 3 * 3 = 9 students.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early to the tournament is 24 students (swimmers) + 13 students (debate team members or choir members) + 9 students (cheerleaders) = 46 students.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of swimmers in the class. Since <fact2>50% of the class are swimmers</fact2>, the number of swimmers is <fact1>120</fact1> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 60. However, <fact5>half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the number of swimmers leaving early is 60 / 2 = 30.

Next, we need to find the number of students in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> who are choir members or dancers. The number of students in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> is <fact1>120</fact1> - 60 = 60.

However, <fact5>half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the number of swimmers leaving early is 40 / 2 = 20.

Next, we need to find out how many students are choir members or part of robotics club members. Since <fact4>50% of the students are choir members or part of robotics club members</fact4> out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, we first need to find the number of remaining students.

Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the competition?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>25% of the class are soccer players</fact2>, we can calculate 0.25 * <fact1>168 students</fact1> = 42 soccer players. However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so there are 42 / 2 = 21 soccer players who are not sick and will be leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are 42 soccer players, the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> has <fact1>168 students</fact1> - 42 soccer players = 126 students. Then, <fact4>50% of the students are choir members or part of dancers</fact4>, so we can calculate 0.5 * 126 = 63 students who are choir members or dancers.

Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the competition?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>56% of the class are soccer players</fact2> and there are <fact1>50 students in the class</fact1>, we can calculate the number of soccer players as follows: 0.56 * <fact1>50</fact1> = 28 soccer players.

However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the number of soccer players leaving early is 28 / 2 = 14.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>50 students in the class</fact1> and 28 are soccer players, the number of students in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> is <fact1>50</fact1> - 28 = 22.

Then, we can calculate the number of debate team members and choir members. Since <fact4>50% of the students in the remaining class are debate team members or part of choir members</fact4>, we can calculate the number as follows: 0.5 * 22 = 11.

So, the total number of students leaving early is 14 (soccer players) + 11 (debate team members and choir members) = 25.

Additionally, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>, so we need to add 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders to the total number of students leaving early.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early to the competition is 25 + 9 = 34.

How many sushi rolls does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls the family eats per day. The uncle eats <fact1>20 sushi rolls per day</fact1> and his spouse eats <fact2>10 sushi rolls per day</fact2>, so together they eat 20 + 10 = 30 sushi rolls per day. The grandchild eats <fact3>two-sixths of the combined number of sushi rolls they eat per day</fact3>, which is 2/6 * 30 = 10 sushi rolls per day. So, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats per day is 30 + 10 = 40.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are approximately 30 days. So, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in one month is 40 * 30 = 1200.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>60% for the first half of the month</fact5>. This means they eat 40 * 0.4 = 16 sushi rolls per day for the first 15 days. So, the total number of sushi rolls they eat in the first half of the second month is 16 * 15 = 240.

For the second half of the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional <fact6>75% for the second half</fact6>. This means they eat 16 * 0.25 = 4 sushi rolls per day for the remaining 15 days. So, the total number of sushi rolls they eat in the second half of the second month is 4 * 15 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in two months is 1200 + 240 + 60 = 1500.

Answer: The grandfather and his partner eat a combined total of <fact1>20 hamburgers per day</fact1> + <fact2>20 hamburgers per day</fact2> = 40 hamburgers per day. Their son eats <fact3>three-sixths of the combined number of hamburgers they eat per day</fact3>, which is 3/6 * 40 = 20 hamburgers per day. So, the family eats 40 + 20 = 60 hamburgers per day.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, which is 30 days, the family eats 44 * 30 = 1320 pizzas. In the first half of the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>50%</fact5>, so they eat 44 * 0.5 = 22 pizzas per day for 15 days, which is 22 * 15 = 330 pizzas. In the second half of the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50%</fact6>, so they eat 22 * 0.5 = 11 pizzas per day for 15 days, which is 11 * 15 = 165 pizzas. Therefore, the family eats a total of 1320 + 330 + 165 = 1815 pizzas in two months.

After <fact4>one month</fact4>, the family decides to go on a diet in the <fact5>second month</fact5>, reducing their food consumption by <fact6>60%</fact6> for the <fact7>first half of the month</fact7>, and then by an additional <fact8>25%</fact8> for the <fact9>second half</fact9>. How many pizzas does this family eat in <fact10>two months</fact10>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total pizzas the family eats per day. The grandfather eats <fact1>20 pizzas per day</fact1> and his partner eats <fact2>10 pizzas per day</fact2>, so together they eat 20 + 10 = 30 pizzas per day. Their son eats <fact3>two-sixths of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day</fact3>, which is 2/6 * 30 = 10 pizzas per day. So, the family eats 30 + 10 = 40 pizzas per day.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are 30 days, so the family eats 40 pizzas per day * 30 days = 1200 pizzas.

In the <fact5>second month</fact5>, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact6>60%</fact6> for the <fact7>first half of the month</fact7>, which is 15 days. So, they eat 40 pizzas per day * (1 - 0.6) = 16 pizzas per day for 15 days, which is 16 pizzas per day * 15 days = 240 pizzas.

For the <fact9>second half of the month</fact9>, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact8>25%</fact8>, so they eat 16 pizzas per day * (1 - 0.25) = 12 pizzas per day for 15 days, which is 12 pizzas per day * 15 days = 180 pizzas.

In total, the family eats 1200 pizzas in the first month and 240 + 180 = 420 pizzas in the second month. So, in <fact10>two months</fact10>, the family eats 1200 + 420 = 1620 pizzas.

How many burritos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The uncle and spouse eat a combined total of <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact2>25</fact2> = 50 burritos per day. The grandchild eats <fact3>one-fifth</fact3> of this amount, which is 50 / 5 = 10 burritos per day. So, the family eats 50 + 10 = 60 burritos per day. In <fact4>one month</fact4>, which is 30 days, the family eats 60 * 30 = 1800 burritos. 

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>20% for the first half of the month</fact5>. This means they eat 80% of their original amount, which is 0.8 * 60 = 48 burritos per day for the first 15 days. So, in the first half of the month, they eat 48 * 15 = 720 burritos. 

In the second half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50%</fact6>. This means they eat 50% of the amount they ate in the first half, which is 0.5 * 48 = 24 burritos per day for the remaining 15 days.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of burritos the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>4 burritos per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>8 burritos per day</fact2>, so together they eat 4 + 8 = 12 burritos per day. The daughter eats <fact3>two-thirds of the combined number of burritos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 2/3 * 12 = 8 burritos per day. So, the total number of burritos the family eats per day is 12 + 8 = 20 burritos per day.

Since there are 30 days in a month, the family eats 20 * 30 = 600 burritos in the first month.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact4>50% for the first half of the month</fact4>, which means they eat 50% of 20 burritos per day, or 10 burritos per day, for 15 days. This is a total of 10 * 15 = 150 burritos.

How many tacos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The father and wife eat a combined total of <fact1>24 tacos per day</fact1> + <fact2>24 tacos per day</fact2> = 48 tacos per day. The daughter eats <fact3>one-third of the combined number of tacos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 48/3 = 16 tacos per day. So, the family eats 48 + 16 = 64 tacos per day. In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are 30 days, so the family eats 64 tacos per day * 30 days per month = 1920 tacos per month. In the first half of the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>25%</fact5>, so they eat 64 tacos per day * 0.75 = 48 tacos per day for 15 days, which is 48 tacos per day * 15 days = 720 tacos.

How many burritos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of burritos the family eats per day. The grandfather eats <fact1>24 burritos per day</fact1> and his partner eats <fact2>8 burritos per day</fact2>, so together they eat 24 + 8 = 32 burritos per day. The son eats <fact3>one-eighth of the combined number of burritos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 32 / 8 = 4 burritos per day. So, the total number of burritos the family eats per day is 32 + 4 = 36 burritos.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are approximately 30 days. So, the total number of burritos the family eats in one month is 36 * 30 = 1080 burritos.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>50%</fact5> for the first half of the month, which means they eat 36 * 0.5 = 18 burritos per day for 15 days.

How many hamburgers does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The uncle and spouse eat a combined total of <fact1>8 hamburgers per day</fact1> + <fact2>8 hamburgers per day</fact2> = 16 hamburgers per day. The grandchild eats <fact3>one-half of the combined number of hamburgers they eat per day</fact3>, which is 16/2 = 8 hamburgers per day. So, the family eats 16 + 8 = 24 hamburgers per day.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of pizzas the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>10 pizzas per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>20 pizzas per day</fact2>, so together they eat 10 + 20 = 30 pizzas per day. The daughter eats <fact3>one-third of the combined number of pizzas they eat per day</fact3>, which is 1/3 * 30 = 10 pizzas per day. So, the family eats 30 + 10 = 40 pizzas per day.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are 30 days, so the family eats 40 pizzas per day * 30 days = 1200 pizzas in the first month.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>40% for the first half of the month</fact5>. This means they eat 60% of their original amount, which is 0.6 * 40 pizzas per day = 24 pizzas per day.

For the second half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50% for the second half</fact6>. This means they eat 50% of the amount they ate in the first half, which is 0.5 * 24 pizzas per day = 12 pizzas per day.

In total, the family eats 1200 pizzas in the first month + 360 pizzas in the first half of the second month + 180 pizzas in the second half of the second month = 1740 pizzas in two months.

How many sushi rolls does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>10 sushi rolls per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>20 sushi rolls per day</fact2>, so together they eat 10 + 20 = 30 sushi rolls per day. The daughter eats <fact3>one-sixth of the combined number of sushi rolls they eat per day</fact3>, which is 1/6 * 30 = 5 sushi rolls per day. So, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats per day is 30 + 5 = 35.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are approximately 30 days. So, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in one month is 35 * 30 = 1050.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>20% for the first half of the month</fact5>. This means they eat 80% of their usual amount, which is 0.8 * 35 = 28 sushi rolls per day. For the first half of the month, which is 15 days, they eat 28 * 15 = 420 sushi rolls.

For the second half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact6>75% for the second half</fact6>.

So, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in the second month is 420 + 131.25 = 551.25.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of burritos the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>12 burritos per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>24 burritos per day</fact2>, so together they eat 12 + 24 = 36 burritos per day. The daughter eats <fact3>one-ninth of the combined number of burritos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 36 / 9 = 4 burritos per day. So, the total number of burritos the family eats per day is 36 + 4 = 40 burritos per day.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are approximately 30 days. So, the total number of burritos the family eats in one month is 40 burritos per day * 30 days = 1200 burritos.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>50%</fact5> for the first half of the month, which means they eat 50% of 40 burritos per day, which is 20 burritos per day.

Answer: The uncle eats <fact1>24 hamburgers per day</fact1> and his spouse eats <fact2>8 hamburgers per day</fact2>, so together they eat <fact1>24</fact1> + <fact2>8</fact2> = 32 hamburgers per day. The grandchild eats <fact3>two-fourths of the combined number of hamburgers they eat per day</fact3>, which is 2/4 * 32 = 16 hamburgers per day. So, the family eats 32 + 16 = 48 hamburgers per day. In <fact4>one month</fact4>, which is 30 days, the family eats 48 * 30 = 1440 hamburgers. In the second month, for the <fact6>first half of the month</fact6>, which is 15 days, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>25%</fact5>, so they eat 48 * 0.75 * 15 = 540 hamburgers.

After <fact4>one month</fact4>, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by <fact5>20% for the first half of the month</fact5>, and then by an additional <fact6>50% for the second half</fact6>. How many sushi rolls does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls the family eats per day. The father eats <fact1>25 sushi rolls per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>10 sushi rolls per day</fact2>, so together they eat 25 + 10 = 35 sushi rolls per day. The daughter eats <fact3>one-seventh of the combined number of sushi rolls they eat per day</fact3>, which is 35 / 7 = 5 sushi rolls per day. So, the total number of sushi rolls the family eats per day is 35 + 5 = 40 sushi rolls per day.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are 30 days, so the family eats 40 * 30 = 1200 sushi rolls in the first month.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>20% for the first half of the month</fact5>. Since there are 30 days in a month, the first half of the month is 15 days. The family eats 40 * 0.8 = 32 sushi rolls per day for the first 15 days, so they eat 32 * 15 = 480 sushi rolls in the first half of the month.

In the second half of the month, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50% for the second half</fact6>. This means they eat 32 * 0.5 = 16 sushi rolls per day for the remaining 15 days, so they eat 16 * 15 = 240 sushi rolls in the second half of the month.

In total, the family eats 1200 + 480 + 240 = 1920 sushi rolls in two months.

How many tacos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The uncle eats <fact1>25 tacos per day</fact1> and his spouse eats <fact2>20 tacos per day</fact2>, so together they eat <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact2>20</fact2> = 45 tacos per day. The grandchild eats <fact3>one-ninth of the combined number of tacos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 45 / 9 = 5 tacos per day. So, the family eats 45 + 5 = 50 tacos per day.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>60% for the first half of the month</fact5>, which means they eat 50 * (1 - 0.6) = 20 tacos per day for the first 15 days. Then, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50% for the second half</fact6>, which means they eat 20 * (1 - 0.5) = 10 tacos per day for the remaining 15 days.

How many tacos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of tacos the family eats per day. The grandfather eats <fact1>20 tacos per day</fact1> and his partner eats <fact2>10 tacos per day</fact2>, so together they eat 20 + 10 = 30 tacos per day. The son eats <fact3>one-sixth of the combined number of tacos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 1/6 * 30 = 5 tacos per day. So, the total number of tacos the family eats per day is 30 + 5 = 35 tacos.

In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are 30 days, so the family eats 35 * 30 = 1050 tacos in the first month.

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>60%</fact5> for the first half of the month, which means they eat 35 * 0.4 = 14 tacos per day for 15 days. This is a total of 14 * 15 = 210 tacos.

For the second half of the month, the family reduces their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50%</fact6>, which means they eat 14 * 0.5 = 7 tacos per day for 15 days. This is a total of 7 * 15 = 105 tacos.

So, the total number of tacos the family eats in the second month is 210 + 105 = 315 tacos.

How many tacos does this family eat in two months?

Answer: The grandfather and his partner eat a combined total of <fact1>15</fact1> + <fact2>15</fact2> = 30 tacos per day. The son eats <fact3>one-half of the combined number of tacos they eat per day</fact3>, which is 30 / 2 = 15 tacos per day. So, the family eats 30 + 15 = 45 tacos per day. In <fact4>one month</fact4>, there are approximately 30 days. So, in the first month, the family eats 45 tacos per day * 30 days = 1350 tacos. 

In the second month, the family reduces their food consumption by <fact5>60%</fact5> for the first half of the month. This means they eat 45 tacos per day * (1 - 0.6) = 18 tacos per day for the first half of the month. For the second half of the month, they reduce their food consumption by an additional <fact6>50%</fact6>. This means they eat 18 tacos per day * (1 - 0.5) = 9 tacos per day for the second half of the month. 

Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, the family eats 18 tacos per day * 15 days = 270 tacos in the first half of the month, and 9 tacos per day * 15 days = 135 tacos in the second half of the month. So, in the second month, the family eats 270 + 135 = 405 tacos. 

In total, the family eats 1350 tacos in the first month + 405 tacos in the second month = 1755 tacos in two months.

Ravi work overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>75% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of emails that require a response. Since <fact2>12% of the emails don't require a response</fact2>, the number of emails that require a response is <fact1>25</fact1> - (<fact2>12%</fact2> * <fact1>25</fact1>) = 25 - 3 = 22 emails per day.

Ravi can respond to <fact3>3 less than the half of them</fact3>, which is (22 / 2) - 3 = 8 emails per day.

In a <fact4>4 day work week</fact4>, Ravi can respond to 8 * 3 = 24 emails in the first 3 days. On the last day, he can respond to 8 * (1 + <fact5>75%</fact5>) = 8 * 1.75 = 14 emails.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of emails that require a response. Since <fact2>20% of the emails don't require a response</fact2>, the number of emails that require a response is <fact1>30</fact1> * (1 - 0.2) = 24 emails per day.

Noah can respond to <fact3>4 less than the 1/2 of them</fact3>, which is (24 / 2) - 4 = 8 emails per day.

In a <fact4>6 day work week</fact4>, Noah can respond to 8 * 5 = 40 emails in the first 5 days. On the last day, he can respond to 8 * 1.25 = 10 emails (since he can respond to <fact5>25% more emails than usual</fact5>).

Therefore, the total number of emails Noah can respond to in a 6 day work week is 40 + 10 = 50.

Since <fact2>25% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, the number of emails that require a response is: 160 - (160 * 0.25) = 160 - 40 = 120 emails.
Umar can only respond to <fact3>2 less than the half of them</fact3>, so he can respond to: (120 / 2) - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58 emails in a normal 4-day period.
Since Umar works overtime on the last day and can respond to <fact5>30% more emails than usual</fact5>, the number of emails he can respond to on the last day is: 58 / 4 * 1.3 = 18.85, round down to 18 emails for the first 4 days he responds to 58 - 18 = 40 emails and on the 5th day he can respond to 18 + (18 * 0.3) = 18 + 5.4 = 23.4, round down to 23 emails.
So, in total, Umar responds to: 40 + 23 = 63 emails in a <fact4>5 day work week</fact4>.

Qasim work overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>50% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of emails that require a response. Since <fact2>25% of the emails don't require a response</fact2>, the number of emails that require a response is <fact1>32</fact1> - (<fact2>25%</fact2> * <fact1>32</fact1>) = 32 - 8 = 24 emails per day.

Next, let's calculate the number of emails Qasim can respond to in a day. He can respond to <fact3>2 less than the half of them</fact3>, which is (24 / 2) - 2 = 10 emails per day.

Since Qasim works for <fact4>4 days</fact4>, he can respond to 10 * 3 = 30 emails in the first 3 days. On the last day, he works overtime and can respond to <fact5>50% more emails than usual</fact5>, which is 10 + (10 * 0.5) = 15 emails.

Due to the natural disaster, <fact4>20 patients are admitted into the clinic each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms. Since <fact2>1/10 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, the number of occupied rooms is <fact1>1700</fact1> * <fact2>1/10</fact2> = 170 rooms. 

Next, we need to find the number of rooms that are out of service. Since <fact3>one-fourth of all the rooms are out of service</fact3>, the number of rooms out of service is <fact1>1700</fact1> * <fact3>1/4</fact3> = 425 rooms.

Answer: First, we need to find Ananya's current age. Since in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, Ananya will be <fact3>4 times as old as DeShawn is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Ananya's current age + <fact2>8</fact2> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>23</fact1>. 
Solving for Ananya's current age, we get Ananya's current age = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>23</fact1> - <fact2>8</fact2> = 92 - 8 = 84. 
However, this is Ananya's age in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, so we need to subtract <fact2>8</fact2> from 92 to get Ananya's current age, which is 84.

In <fact2>2 years</fact2>, his cousin Elena will be <fact3>3 times as old as Qasim is now</fact3>. <fact4>Qasim's brother, Liam, is 9 years younger than Qasim</fact4>, and <fact5>Elena's sister Sophia is 10 years older than Liam</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Elena's current age. Since in <fact2>2 years</fact2>, Elena will be <fact3>3 times as old as Qasim is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Elena's current age + <fact2>2</fact2> = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>15</fact1>. Solving for Elena's current age, we get Elena's current age = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>15</fact1> - <fact2>2</fact2> = 43.

Next, we can find Liam's current age using the fact that <fact4>Qasim's brother, Liam, is 9 years younger than Qasim</fact4>. So, Liam's current age = <fact1>15</fact1> - <fact4>9</fact4> = 6.

Then, we can find Sophia's current age using the fact that <fact5>Elena's sister Sophia is 10 years older than Liam</fact5>. So, Sophia's current age = Liam's current age + <fact5>10</fact5> = 6 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 16.

Now, we can find the ages of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>: Qasim's age in <fact6>5 years</fact6> = <fact1>15</fact1> + <fact6>5</fact6> = 20, Elena's age in <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 43 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 48, Liam's age in <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 6 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 11, and Sophia's age in <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 16 + <fact6>5</fact6> = 21.

Finally, we can find the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6> by adding up their ages and dividing by 4: (20 + 48 + 11 + 21) / 4 = 100 / 4 = 25.

In <fact2>6 years</fact2>, his cousin Xena will be <fact3>3 times as old as Yuki is now</fact3>. <fact4>Yuki's brother, Gabriel, is 8 years younger than Yuki</fact4>, and <fact5>Xena's sister Fatima is 8 years older than Gabriel</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>3 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Xena's current age. Since Xena will be <fact3>3 times as old as Yuki is now</fact3> in <fact2>6 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation: Xena's age in 6 years = 3 * <fact1>Yuki's current age</fact1>. Let's denote Xena's current age as X. Then, X + <fact2>6</fact2> = 3 * <fact1>9</fact1>. Solving for X, we get X = 3 * <fact1>9</fact1> - <fact2>6</fact2> = 21.

Now, we know Xena's current age is 21. We can find Gabriel's current age using the fact that <fact4>he is 8 years younger than Yuki</fact4>. So, Gabriel's age = <fact1>Yuki's age</fact1> - 8 = <fact1>9</fact1> - 8 = 1.

Next, we can find Fatima's current age using the fact that <fact5>she is 8 years older than Gabriel</fact5>. So, Fatima's age = Gabriel's age + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9.

Now, we have the current ages of all four: Yuki is <fact1>9</fact1>, Xena is 21, Gabriel is 1, and Fatima is 9. To find their average age in <fact6>3 years</fact6>, we need to add 3 to each of their current ages and then find the average.

In 3 years, their ages will be: Yuki's age = <fact1>9</fact1> + <fact6>3</fact6> = 12, Xena's age = 21 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 24, Gabriel's age = 1 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 4, and Fatima's age = 9 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 12.

Kai is <fact1>22 years old</fact1>. In <fact2>4 years</fact2>, his cousin Winnie will be <fact3>2 times as old as Kai is now</fact3>. Kai's brother, Theo, is <fact4>12 years younger than Kai</fact4>, and Winnie's sister Roya is <fact5>10 years older than Theo</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: 
First, we need to find Winnie's age. Since Winnie will be <fact3>2 times as old as Kai is now</fact3> in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, we can set up the equation: Winnie's age in 4 years = 2 * <fact1>22</fact1>. So, Winnie's age in 4 years is 2 * 22 = 44. Since this is in 4 years, we subtract 4 to find Winnie's current age: 44 - 4 = 40.

Next, we find Theo's age. Since Theo is <fact4>12 years younger than Kai</fact4>, Theo's age is <fact1>22</fact1> - 12 = 10.

Then, we find Roya's age. Since Roya is <fact5>10 years older than Theo</fact5>, Roya's age is 10 + 10 = 20.

Now, we add 5 years to each of their ages to find their ages in <fact6>5 years</fact6>: 
Kai's age in 5 years: <fact1>22</fact1> + 5 = 27
Winnie's age in 5 years: 40 + 5 = 45
Theo's age in 5 years: 10 + 5 = 15
Roya's age in 5 years: 20 + 5 = 25

Finally, we find the average of their ages in 5 years: (27 + 45 + 15 + 25) / 4 = 112 / 4 = 28.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Mia's age. Since Mia will be <fact3>4 times as old as Noah is now</fact3> in <fact2>3 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation to represent this: Mia's age in 3 years = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>Noah's current age</fact1>. Let's call Mia's current age ""x"". Then, Mia's age in 3 years is x + 3. We know that x + 3 = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>24</fact1>, so x + 3 = 96. Solving for x, we get x = 93. 

Now we know that Mia is currently 93 years old. We can find Luis's age using the fact that <fact4>Luis is 6 years younger than Noah</fact4>. So, Luis is <fact1>24</fact1> - 6 = 18 years old. 

We can find Kimia's age using the fact that <fact5>Kimia is 7 years older than Luis</fact5>. So, Kimia is 18 + 7 = 25 years old. 

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>. Noah will be <fact1>24</fact1> + 2 = 26, Mia will be 93 + 2 = 95, Luis will be 18 + 2 = 20, and Kimia will be 25 + 2 = 27. 

Finally, we can find the average of their ages in 2 years by adding their ages and dividing by 4: (26 + 95 + 20 + 27) / 4 = 168 / 4 = 42.

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's current age. Since in <fact2>2 years</fact2>, Priya will be <fact3>3 times as old as Pavel is now</fact3>, we can set up an equation: Priya's current age + <fact2>2</fact2> = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>13</fact1>. Solving for Priya's current age, we get Priya's current age = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact2>2</fact2> = 37.

Next, we can find Carlos' current age, which is <fact1>13</fact1> - <fact4>7</fact4> = 6 years old.

Then, we can find Sofia's current age, which is <fact5>10 years older than Carlos</fact5>, so Sofia's current age = 6 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 16.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>6 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Beatriz's current age. Since Beatriz will be <fact3>2 times as old as Tariq is now</fact3> in <fact2>3 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation: Beatriz's current age + <fact2>3 years</fact2> = <fact3>2 times Tariq's current age</fact3>. Let's substitute <fact1>Tariq's current age</fact1> into the equation: Beatriz's current age + <fact2>3 years</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>22 years</fact1>. Beatriz's current age + <fact2>3 years</fact2> = 44 years. Beatriz's current age = 44 years - <fact2>3 years</fact2> = 41 years.

Next, we need to find Mateo's current age. Since <fact4>Mateo is 9 years younger than Tariq</fact4>, Mateo's current age = <fact1>Tariq's current age</fact1> - 9 years = <fact1>22 years</fact1> - 9 years = 13 years.

Then, we need to find Yara's current age. Since <fact5>Yara is 11 years older than Mateo</fact5>, Yara's current age = Mateo's current age + 11 years = 13 years + 11 years = 24 years.

Now, we can find their ages in <fact6>6 years</fact6>: Tariq's age in <fact6>6 years</fact6> = <fact1>22 years</fact1> + <fact6>6 years</fact6> = 28 years. Beatriz's age in <fact6>6 years</fact6> = 41 years + <fact6>6 years</fact6> = 47 years. Mateo's age in <fact6>6 years</fact6> = 13 years + <fact6>6 years</fact6> = 19 years.

Answer: First, we need to find the current age of Roya. Since in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, Roya will be <fact3>2 times as old as James is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Roya's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>2 times James' current age</fact3>. We know <fact1>James is 19 years old</fact1>, so we can substitute this value into the equation. Let's call Roya's current age ""R"". Then, R + <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>19</fact1>. Solving for R, we get R = 38 - <fact2>4</fact2> = 34. 

Next, we can find the current age of Umar. Since <fact4>Umar is 7 years younger than James</fact4>, and <fact1>James is 19 years old</fact1>, Umar's current age is <fact1>19</fact1> - <fact4>7</fact4> = 12.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's current age. Since in <fact2>3 years</fact2>, Priya will be <fact3>4 times as old as Xavier is now</fact3>, we can set up an equation: Priya's current age + <fact2>3 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times Xavier's current age</fact3>. We know <fact1>Xavier is 22 years old</fact1>, so we can substitute this value into the equation. Let's call Priya's current age ""P"". Then, the equation becomes: P + <fact2>3</fact2> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>22</fact1>. Solving for P, we get P = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>22</fact1> - <fact2>3</fact2> = 88 - 3 = 85.

Now, we know Priya's current age is 85.

Answer: First, we need to find Kayla's current age. Since in <fact2>7 years</fact2>, Kayla will be <fact3>4 times as old as Carlos is now</fact3>, we can set up the equation: Kayla's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times</fact3> * <fact1>19 years</fact1>. 
So, Kayla's current age + 7 = 4 * 19. 
Kayla's current age + 7 = 76. 
Kayla's current age = 76 - 7 = 69. 
Since <fact4>Alejandro is 9 years younger than Carlos</fact4>, Alejandro's current age is <fact1>19 years</fact1> - 9 years = 10 years. 
Since <fact5>Elena is 8 years older than Alejandro</fact5>, Elena's current age is 10 years + 8 years = 18 years.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>3 years</fact6>?

Answer: In <fact2>2 years</fact2>, Nadia will be <fact3>2 times as old as Ali is now</fact3>, which is <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>19</fact1> = 38 years old. So, Nadia is currently 38 - <fact2>2</fact2> = 36 years old. 
<fact4>Ali's brother, Arash, is 7 years younger than Ali</fact4>, so Arash is <fact1>19</fact1> - <fact4>7</fact4> = 12 years old. 
<fact5>Nadia's sister Kayla is 9 years older than Arash</fact5>, so Kayla is <fact4>12</fact4> + <fact5>9</fact5> = 21 years old.

Yusuf's brother, Ali, is <fact4>8 years younger than Yusuf</fact4>, and Ava's sister Isabella is <fact5>7 years older than Ali</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Ava's current age. Since Ava will be <fact3>2 times as old as Yusuf is now</fact3> in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation: Ava's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>2 times Yusuf's current age</fact3>. We know Yusuf is <fact1>17 years old</fact1>, so Ava's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>17 years</fact1> = 34 years. Therefore, Ava's current age is 34 - <fact2>4 years</fact2> = 30 years.

Next, we need to find Ali's current age. Since Ali is <fact4>8 years younger than Yusuf</fact4>, Ali's current age is <fact1>17 years</fact1> - <fact4>8 years</fact4> = 9 years.

Then, we need to find Isabella's current age. Since Isabella is <fact5>7 years older than Ali</fact5>, Isabella's current age is 9 years + <fact5>7 years</fact5> = 16 years.

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>. Yusuf will be <fact1>17 years</fact1> + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 22 years. Ava will be 30 years + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 35 years. Ali will be 9 years + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 14 years. Isabella will be 16 years + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 21 years.

Finally, we can find the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6> by adding their ages and dividing by 4: (22 + 35 + 14 + 21) / 4 = 92 / 4 = 23.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>4 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Winnie's current age. Since Winnie will be <fact3>4 times as old as Xavier is now</fact3> in <fact2>8 years</fact2>, we can set up the equation: Winnie's current age + <fact2>8 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times</fact3> * <fact1>Xavier's current age</fact1>. 
Let's substitute <fact1>Xavier's current age</fact1> with 15 and solve for Winnie's current age: Winnie's current age + 8 = 4 * 15, Winnie's current age + 8 = 60, Winnie's current age = 52.
Now we know Winnie's current age is 52. We can find <fact4>Carlos' current age</fact4> by subtracting 10 from <fact1>Xavier's current age</fact1>: <fact1>15</fact1> - 10 = 5.
Next, we can find Sakura's current age by adding 7 to <fact4>Carlos' current age</fact4>: 5 + 7 = 12.
Now that we have the current ages of all four, we can find their ages in <fact6>4 years</fact6>: Xavier's age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> = <fact1>15</fact1> + <fact6>4</fact6> = 19, Winnie's age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> = 52 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 56, Carlos' age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> = 5 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 9, Sakura's age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> = 12 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 16.

Answer: In <fact2>5 years</fact2>, Olga will be <fact3>2 times as old as Thiago is now</fact3>, which is <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>17</fact1> = 34 years old. So, Olga is currently 34 - <fact2>5</fact2> = 29 years old. 
<fact4>Thiago's brother, Andre, is 6 years younger than Thiago</fact4>, so Andre is <fact1>17</fact1> - <fact4>6</fact4> = 11 years old. 
<fact5>Olga's sister Ava is 8 years older than Andre</fact5>, so Ava is <fact4>11</fact4> + <fact5>8</fact5> = 19 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>4 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's current age. Since in <fact2>3 years</fact2>, Priya will be <fact3>4 times as old as DeShawn is now</fact3>, and <fact1>Deshawn is 10 years old</fact1>, Priya will be 4 * 10 = 40 years old in <fact2>3 years</fact2>. So, Priya's current age is 40 - 3 = 37 years.

Next, we find Carlos' current age. Since <fact4>Carlos is 7 years younger than DeShawn</fact4>, and <fact1>Deshawn is 10 years old</fact1>, Carlos is 10 - 7 = 3 years old.

Then, we find Xena's current age. Since <fact5>Xena is 11 years older than Carlos</fact5>, and Carlos is 3 years old, Xena is 3 + 11 = 14 years old.

Now, we calculate the ages of all four in <fact6>4 years</fact6>. DeShawn will be 10 + 4 = 14 years old, Priya will be 37 + 4 = 41 years old, Carlos will be 3 + 4 = 7 years old, and Xena will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

Finally, we calculate the average of their ages in <fact6>4 years</fact6>. The average is (14 + 41 + 7 + 18) / 4 = 80 / 4 = 20.

Answer: Since Kimia will be <fact3>3 times as old as Wei is now</fact3> in <fact2>6 years</fact2>, Kimia will be <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>23</fact1> = 69 years old in <fact2>6 years</fact2>. So, Kimia is currently 69 - <fact2>6</fact2> = 63 years old. 
In <fact6>4 years</fact6>, Kimia will be 63 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 67 years old.
Wei is currently <fact1>23 years old</fact1>, so in <fact6>4 years</fact6>, he will be <fact1>23</fact1> + <fact6>4</fact6> = 27 years old.
Ravi is <fact4>11 years younger than Wei</fact4>, so Ravi is <fact1>23</fact1> - <fact4>11</fact4> = 12 years old. In <fact6>4 years</fact6>, Ravi will be 12 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 16 years old.

Wei's brother, Kai, is <fact4>5 years younger than Wei</fact4>, and Sakura's sister Quinn is <fact5>10 years older than Kai</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>3 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Sakura's current age. Since Sakura will be <fact3>3 times as old as Wei is now</fact3> in <fact2>2 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation: Sakura's current age + <fact2>2 years</fact2> = <fact3>3 times Wei's current age</fact3>. We know Wei's current age is <fact1>15 years old</fact1>, so we can substitute this value into the equation. Let's call Sakura's current age ""x"". Then, the equation becomes x + <fact2>2</fact2> = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>15</fact1>. Solving for x, we get x = 43.

Now we know Sakura's current age is 43. We can find Quinn's current age by using the fact that Quinn is <fact5>10 years older than Kai</fact5>. To find Kai's current age, we use the fact that Kai is <fact4>5 years younger than Wei</fact4>. Since Wei is <fact1>15 years old</fact1>, Kai is <fact1>15</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 10 years old. Then, Quinn is <fact5>10 years older than Kai</fact5>, so Quinn is 10 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 20 years old.

Now we have the current ages of all four: Wei is <fact1>15 years old</fact1>, Sakura is 43 years old, Kai is 10 years old, and Quinn is 20 years old. To find their average age in <fact6>3 years</fact6>, we need to add <fact6>3 years</fact6> to each of their current ages and then find the average.

In <fact6>3 years</fact6>, Wei will be <fact1>15</fact1> + <fact6>3</fact6> = 18 years old, Sakura will be 43 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 46 years old, Kai will be 10 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 13 years old, and Quinn will be 20 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 23 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Sophia's current age. Since Sophia will be <fact3>4 times as old as Jin is now</fact3> in <fact2>4 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation to represent this: Sophia's current age + <fact2>4 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times Jin's current age</fact3>. We know <fact1>Jin is 12 years old</fact1>, so we can substitute this value into the equation. Let's call Sophia's current age ""S"". Then, the equation becomes: S + <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>12</fact1>. Solving for S, we get S = 44.

Next, we need to find Noah's current age. We know that <fact4>Noah is 5 years younger than Jin</fact4>, and <fact1>Jin is 12 years old</fact1>, so Noah's current age is <fact1>12</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 7 years old.

We also need to find Gabrielle's current age. We know that Gabrielle is <fact5>10 years older than Noah</fact5>, and Noah is 7 years old, so Gabrielle's current age is 7 + <fact5>10</fact5> = 17 years old.

Answer: First, we need to find Zahra's current age. Since Zahra will be <fact3>4 times as old as Yusuf is now</fact3> in <fact2>7 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation: Zahra's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>4 times Yusuf's current age</fact3>. We know <fact1>Yusuf is 22 years old</fact1>, so Zahra's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>22</fact1>. Zahra's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = 88. Zahra's current age = 88 - <fact2>7 years</fact2> = 81.

Now we know Zahra's current age, we can find Wei's and Sophia's current ages. Since <fact4>Wei is 7 years younger than Yusuf</fact4>, Wei's current age = <fact1>Yusuf's current age</fact1> - <fact4>7 years</fact4> = <fact1>22</fact1> - <fact4>7</fact4> = 15. Since <fact5>Sophia is 7 years older than Wei</fact5>, Sophia's current age = <fact4>Wei's current age</fact4> + <fact5>7 years</fact5> = 15 + <fact5>7</fact5> = 22.

Now we know everyone's current age, we can find their ages in <fact6>3 years</fact6>. Yusuf's age in <fact6>3 years</fact6> = <fact1>22</fact1> + <fact6>3</fact6> = 25.

<fact4>Benjamin is 8 years younger than Yuki</fact4>, so Benjamin is <fact1>18</fact1> - <fact4>8</fact4> = 10 years old. 
<fact5>Aisha is 7 years older than Benjamin</fact5>, so Aisha is <fact4>10</fact4> + <fact5>7</fact5> = 17 years old. 
In <fact6>4 years</fact6>, Yuki will be <fact1>18</fact1> + <fact6>4</fact6> = 22 years old, Kimia will be 31 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 35 years old, Benjamin will be <fact4>10</fact4> + <fact6>4</fact6> = 14 years old, and Aisha will be 17 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 21 years old. 
The average of their ages in <fact6>4 years</fact6> will be (22 + 35 + 14 + 21) / 4 = 92 / 4 = 23.

In <fact2>7 years</fact2>, his cousin Priya will be <fact3>2 times as old as Liam is now</fact3>. <fact4>Liam's brother, Carlos, is 5 years younger than Liam</fact4>, and <fact5>Priya's sister Mei is 8 years older than Carlos</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>3 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Priya's current age. Since in <fact2>7 years</fact2>, Priya will be <fact3>2 times as old as Liam is now</fact3>, and <fact1>Liam is 9 years old</fact1>, Priya will be 2 * <fact1>9</fact1> = 18 years old in <fact2>7 years</fact2>. So, Priya's current age is 18 - <fact2>7</fact2> = 11 years old.

Now, we can find Carlos' current age. Since <fact4>Carlos is 5 years younger than Liam</fact4>, and <fact1>Liam is 9 years old</fact1>, Carlos is <fact1>9</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 4 years old.

Next, we can find Mei's current age. Since <fact5>Mei is 8 years older than Carlos</fact5>, and Carlos is 4 years old, Mei is 4 + <fact5>8</fact5> = 12 years old.

In <fact6>3 years</fact6>, Liam will be <fact1>9</fact1> + <fact6>3</fact6> = 12 years old, Priya will be 11 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 14 years old, Carlos will be 4 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 7 years old, and Mei will be 12 + <fact6>3</fact6> = 15 years old.

The average of their ages in <fact6>3 years</fact6> will be (12 + 14 + 7 + 15) / 4 = 48 / 4 = 12.

Yusuf's brother, Santiago, is <fact4>11 years younger than Yusuf</fact4>, and Ananya's sister Aisha is <fact5>7 years older than Santiago</fact5>. What will be the average of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Ananya's current age. Since in <fact2>7 years</fact2>, Ananya will be <fact3>2 times as old as Yusuf is now</fact3>, we can set up an equation: Ananya's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>2 times Yusuf's current age</fact3>. We know Yusuf is <fact1>22 years old</fact1>, so Ananya's current age + <fact2>7 years</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>22 years</fact1> = 44 years. Therefore, Ananya's current age is 44 - <fact2>7 years</fact2> = 37 years.

Next, we find Santiago's current age. Since Santiago is <fact4>11 years younger than Yusuf</fact4>, and Yusuf is <fact1>22 years old</fact1>, Santiago is <fact1>22 years</fact1> - <fact4>11 years</fact4> = 11 years old.

Then, we find Aisha's current age. Since Aisha is <fact5>7 years older than Santiago</fact5>, and Santiago is 11 years old, Aisha is 11 + <fact5>7 years</fact5> = 18 years old.

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>5 years</fact6>. Yusuf will be <fact1>22 years</fact1> + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 27 years old. Ananya will be 37 + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 42 years old. Santiago will be 11 + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 16 years old. Aisha will be 18 + <fact6>5 years</fact6> = 23 years old.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>4 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Haruka's current age. Since in <fact2>5 years</fact2>, Haruka will be <fact3>3 times as old as Faisal is now</fact3>, we can set up an equation: Haruka's current age + <fact2>5 years</fact2> = <fact3>3 times Faisal's current age</fact3>. We know <fact1>Faisal is 10 years old</fact1>, so Haruka's current age + <fact2>5 years</fact2> = <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>10 years</fact1> = 30 years. Solving for Haruka's current age, we get Haruka's current age = 30 - <fact2>5 years</fact2> = 25 years.

Next, we can find Ali's current age using the fact that <fact4>Ali is 9 years younger than Faisal</fact4>. Since <fact1>Faisal is 10 years old</fact1>, Ali's current age = <fact1>10 years</fact1> - <fact4>9 years</fact4> = 1 year.

Then, we can find Amelia's current age using the fact that <fact5>Amelia is 7 years older than Ali</fact5>. Since Ali's current age is 1 year, Amelia's current age = 1 year + <fact5>7 years</fact5> = 8 years.

Now, we need to find the ages of all four in <fact6>4 years</fact6>. Faisal's age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> will be <fact1>10 years</fact1> + <fact6>4 years</fact6> = 14 years. Haruka's age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> will be 25 years + <fact6>4 years</fact6> = 29 years. Ali's age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> will be 1 year + <fact6>4 years</fact6> = 5 years. Amelia's age in <fact6>4 years</fact6> will be 8 years + <fact6>4 years</fact6> = 12 years.

Finally, we can find the average of their ages in <fact6>4 years</fact6> by adding up their ages and dividing by 4: (14 + 29 + 5 + 12) / 4 = 60 / 4 = 15.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>4 years</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find Fatima's age. Since Fatima will be <fact3>2 times as old as Mohammed is now</fact3> in <fact2>3 years</fact2>, we can set up an equation to find Fatima's age. Let's call Fatima's age F. Then, F + <fact2>3</fact2> = <fact3>2</fact3> * <fact1>10</fact1>. Solving for F, we get F = 2 * <fact1>10</fact1> - <fact2>3</fact2> = 17. 

Now we know Fatima's age is 17. We can find Bodhi's age using the information that <fact4>Bodhi is 7 years younger than Mohammed</fact4>. So Bodhi's age is <fact1>10</fact1> - 7 = 3. 

We can find Nia's age using the information that <fact5>Nia is 7 years older than Bodhi</fact5>. So Nia's age is 3 + 7 = 10.

Now we have the ages of all four: Mohammed is <fact1>10</fact1>, Fatima is 17, Bodhi is 3, and Nia is 10. 

In <fact6>4 years</fact6>, their ages will be: Mohammed will be <fact1>10</fact1> + <fact6>4</fact6> = 14, Fatima will be 17 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 21, Bodhi will be 3 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 7, and Nia will be 10 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 14.

What will be the average of all four in <fact6>2 years</fact6>?

Answer: Since <fact3>Keisha will be 4 times as old as Ibrahim is now</fact3> in <fact2>5 years</fact2>, Keisha will be <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>14</fact1> = 56 years old in <fact2>5 years</fact2>. So, Keisha is currently 56 - <fact2>5</fact2> = 51 years old. 
<fact4>Wei is 5 years younger than Ibrahim</fact4>, so Wei is <fact1>14</fact1> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 9 years old. 
<fact5>Rania is 9 years older than Wei</fact5>, so Rania is <fact4>9</fact4> + <fact5>9</fact5> = 18 years old. 
In <fact6>2 years</fact6>, Ibrahim will be <fact1>14</fact1> + <fact6>2</fact6> = 16 years old, Keisha will be 51 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 53 years old, Wei will be <fact4>9</fact4> + <fact6>2</fact6> = 11 years old, and Rania will be 18 + <fact6>2</fact6> = 20 years old.

The store offers a <fact10>10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Gabrielle have left than Santiago after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Gabrielle and Santiago have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases. 
Gabrielle buys <fact3>16 screws</fact3> at <fact5>€0.24 each</fact5>, which costs 16 x 0.24 = €3.84. She also buys <fact4>9 nails at €0.59 each</fact4>, which costs 9 x 0.59 = €5.31. The total cost of the screws and nails is €3.84 + €5.31 = €9.15. 
She also buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at €7.5 each (no discount), which costs 8 x 7.5 = €60. 
The total cost of Gabrielle's purchases is €9.15 + €60 = €69.15. 
Gabrielle starts with <fact2>€86.15</fact2>, so she has €86.15 - €69.15 = €17 left.

Santiago buys <fact8>12 gallons of paint</fact8> at €7.5 each, but he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10> because he is a member. The discount is 10% of 12 x 7.5 = €90, which is €9. 
So, the total cost of the paint is €90 - €9 = €81. 
He also buys <fact9>4 carpenter pencils at €2 each</fact9>, which costs 4 x 2 = €8. 
The total cost of Santiago's purchases is €81 + €8 = €89. 
Santiago starts with <fact7>€100</fact7>, so he has €100 - €89 = €11 left.

Therefore, Gabrielle has €17 - €11 = €6 more than Santiago.

Now, let's calculate how much money DeShawn spent. He bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at €7 each, but since he's a member, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>. So, he paid 10 * 7 * 0.9 = €63 for the paint. He also bought <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at €3 each</fact9>, which is 3 * 3 = €9. So, DeShawn spent a total of 63 + 9 = €72. He had <fact7>€80</fact7> initially, so he has 80 - 72 = €8 left.

Therefore, Sofia has €18 - €8 = €10 more than DeShawn after they leave the store.

How much more money does Olga have left than Alejandro after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Olga and Alejandro have left, we need to calculate how much they spent. Olga bought <fact3>16 washers</fact3> at <fact5>¥0.24 each</fact5>, which is 16 x 0.24 = ¥3.84. She also bought <fact4>9 anchors at ¥0.59 each</fact4>, which is 9 x 0.59 = ¥5.31. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ¥7.0 each (since <fact1>she is not a member</fact1>), which is 8 x 7 = ¥56. So, Olga spent 3.84 + 5.31 + 56 = ¥65.15. Since <fact2>Olga had ¥86.15</fact2>, she has 86.15 - 65.15 = ¥21 left.

Alejandro bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at ¥7.0 each, but since <fact1>he is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>. So, he paid 10 x 7 x 0.9 = ¥63 for the paint. He also bought <fact9>4 carpenter pencils at ¥4 each</fact9>, which is 4 x 4 = ¥16. So, Alejandro spent 63 + 16 = ¥79. Since <fact7>Alejandro had ¥90</fact7>, he has 90 - 79 = ¥11 left.

How much more money does Uma have left than Qasim after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Uma has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The cost of the washers is <fact3>18</fact3> * <fact5>€0.37</fact5> = €6.66. The cost of the screws is <fact4>9</fact4> * €0.63 = €5.67. The cost of the paint is <fact6>8</fact6> * €9.0 = €72.0. So, the total cost for Uma is €6.66 + €5.67 + €72.0 = €84.33. Uma had <fact2>€95.33</fact2> initially, so she has €95.33 - €84.33 = €11.0 left.

For Qasim, the cost of the paint is <fact8>10</fact8> * €9.0 = €90.0, but since <fact1>Qasim is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. So, the cost of the paint for Qasim is €90.0 - (€90.0 * 0.1) = €81.0. The cost of the pencils is <fact9>3</fact9> * €3 = €9.0. So, the total cost for Qasim is €81.0 + €9.0 = €90.0. Qasim had <fact7>€100</fact7> initially, so he has €100 - €90.0 = €10.0 left.

Therefore, Uma has €11.0 - €10.0 = €1.0 more than Qasim.

Answer: To find out how much money Camila and Gabriel have left, we need to calculate how much they spent. Camila spent <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact5>$0.39</fact5> = $5.85 on nails and <fact4>8</fact4> * <fact4>$0.68</fact4> = $5.44 on washers. She also spent <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact8>$7.0</fact8> = $56 on paint. In total, Camila spent $5.85 + $5.44 + $56 = $67.29. Since <fact1>Camila is not a member</fact1>, she does not get a discount. Gabriel spent <fact8>10</fact8> * <fact8>$7.0</fact8> * (1 - <fact10>0.1</fact10>) = $63 on paint and <fact9>4</fact9> * <fact9>$3</fact9> = $12 on carpenter pencils. In total, Gabriel spent $63 + $12 = $75. Camila has <fact2>$93.29</fact2> - $67.29 = $26 left. Gabriel has <fact7>$100</fact7> - $75 = $25 left.

Answer: Nia buys <fact3>17 nails</fact3> at <fact5>$0.25 per nail</fact5> for a total of <fact3>17</fact3> * <fact5>0.25</fact5> = $4.25. She also buys <fact4>8 nuts at $0.64 each</fact4> for a total of <fact4>8</fact4> * <fact4>0.64</fact4> = $5.12. The total cost of the paint Nia buys is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact8>$7.0</fact8> = $56.00. So, Nia spends a total of $4.25 + $5.12 + $56.00 = $65.37. Nia has <fact2>$97.37</fact2> initially, so she has $97.37 - $65.37 = $32.00 left.

Esteban buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at <fact8>$7.0 per gallon</fact8> but gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10> because he is a <fact1>member</fact1>. So, he pays <fact8>$7.0</fact8> * 0.9 = $6.30 per gallon of paint. The total cost of the paint is <fact8>10</fact8> * $6.30 = $63.00. Esteban also buys <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at $2 each</fact9> for a total of <fact9>3</fact9> * <fact9>$2</fact9> = $6.00. So, Esteban spends a total of $63.00 + $6.00 = $69.00.

How much more money does Zahra have left than Ibrahim after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Zahra has left, we need to calculate how much she spent. She bought <fact3>15 nuts</fact3> at <fact5>₺0.29 each</fact5>, which is 15 x <fact5>0.29</fact5> = ₺4.35. She also bought <fact4>8 anchors at ₺0.61 each</fact4>, which is 8 x <fact4>0.61</fact4> = ₺4.88. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ₺7.0 each (no discount for non-members), which is 8 x ₺7.0 = ₺56. So, Zahra spent a total of ₺4.35 + ₺4.88 + ₺56 = ₺65.23. She started with <fact2>₺90.23</fact2>, so she has ₺90.23 - ₺65.23 = ₺25 left.

Ibrahim, being a member, gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. He bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint at ₺7.0 each</fact8>, which is 10 x ₺7.0 = ₺70.

How much more money does Mei have left than Wei after they leave the store?

Answer: Mei buys <fact3>15 nails</fact3> at <fact5>₣0.29</fact5> each, which is <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact5>0.29</fact5> = ₣4.35. She also buys <fact4>10 washers</fact4> at <fact4>₣0.6</fact4> each, which is <fact4>10</fact4> * <fact4>0.6</fact4> = ₣6. Mei also buys <fact6>10 gallons of paint</fact6> at <fact8>₣7.5</fact8> each, which is <fact6>10</fact6> * <fact8>7.5</fact8> = ₣75. So Mei spends ₣4.35 + ₣6 + ₣75 = ₣85.35.

Answer: First, let's calculate how much Sofia spent. She bought <fact3>18 anchors</fact3> at <fact5>€0.26 each</fact5>, which is 18 * 0.26 = €4.68. She also bought <fact4>9 screws at €0.61 each</fact4>, which is 9 * 0.61 = €5.49. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at €7.5 each (no discount for Sofia), which is 8 * 7.5 = €60. So, Sofia spent a total of 4.68 + 5.49 + 60 = €70.17. Sofia had <fact2>€87.17</fact2> initially, so she has 87.17 - 70.17 = €17 left.

Now, let's calculate how much Oliver spent. He bought <fact8>12 gallons of paint</fact8> at €7.5 each, but as a member, he gets <fact10>a 10% discount on paint</fact10>. So, the price of paint for Oliver is 7.5 * 0.9 = €6.75 per gallon. Therefore, Oliver spent 12 * 6.75 = €81 on paint. He also bought <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at €3 each</fact9>, which is 3 * 3 = €9. So, Oliver spent a total of 81 + 9 = €90. Oliver had <fact7>€100</fact7> initially, so he has 100 - 90 = €10 left.

Finally, Sofia has €17 left and Oliver has €10 left, so Sofia has 17 - 10 = €7 more than Oliver.

She also needs <fact4>10 washers, each costing $0.67</fact4>. <fact5>Each anchor costs $0.21</fact5>. Additionally, Leilani picks up <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6>. <fact7>Theo starts with $80</fact7> and wants <fact8>10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0</fact8>, and <fact9>3 carpenter pencils, each costing $2</fact9>. <fact10>The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Leilani have left than Theo after they leave the store?

Answer: Leilani buys <fact3>17 anchors</fact3> at <fact5>$0.21 each</fact5> for a total of <fact3>17</fact3> * <fact5>0.21</fact5> = $3.57. She buys <fact4>10 washers</fact4> at <fact4>$0.67 each</fact4> for a total of <fact4>10</fact4> * <fact4>0.67</fact4> = $6.70. She also buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at $7.00 each for a total of <fact6>8</fact6> * 7.00 = $56.00. So Leilani spends a total of 3.57 + 6.70 + 56.00 = $66.27. Since <fact2>Leilani started with $92.27</fact2>, she has $92.27 - $66.27 = $26.00 left.

Theo buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at $7.00 each, but since <fact1>he is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. So he pays 7.00 * 0.9 = $6.30 per gallon of paint. He pays a total of <fact8>10</fact8> * 6.30 = $63.00 for the paint. He also buys <fact9>3 carpenter pencils</fact9> at <fact9>$2 each</fact9> for a total of <fact9>3</fact9> * <fact9>2</fact9> = $6.00. So Theo spends a total of 63.00 + 6.00 = $69.00. Since <fact7>Theo started with $80</fact7>, he has $80 - $69.00 = $11.00 left.

Therefore, Leilani has $26.00 - $11.00 = $15.00 more than Theo after they leave the store.

How much more money does Jasmine have left than Viktor after they leave the store?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much Jasmine spent. She bought <fact3>15 anchors</fact3> at <fact5>₺0.39 each</fact5>, which is 15 * 0.39 = ₺5.85. She also bought <fact4>8 nails at ₺0.68 each</fact4>, which is 8 * 0.68 = ₺5.44. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ₺7.0 each (no discount for non-members), which is 8 * 7.0 = ₺56. So, Jasmine spent a total of 5.85 + 5.44 + 56 = ₺67.29. She had <fact2>₺93.29</fact2> initially, so she has 93.29 - 67.29 = ₺26 left.

Now, let's calculate how much Viktor spent. He bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at ₺7.0 each, but as a member, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>. So, the price per gallon of paint for him is 7.0 * 0.9 = ₺6.3. Therefore, he spent 10 * 6.3 = ₺63 on paint. He also bought <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at ₺2 each</fact9>, which is 3 * 2 = ₺6. So, Viktor spent a total of 63 + 6 = ₺69. He had <fact7>₺90</fact7> initially, so he has 90 - 69 = ₺21 left.

Finally, we can calculate how much more money Jasmine has left than Viktor: 26 - 21 = ₺5.

The store offers a <fact10>10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Elena have left than Jamal after they leave the store?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much Elena spent. She bought <fact3>15 anchors</fact3> at <fact5>$0.26 each</fact5>, which is 15 * 0.26 = $3.90. She also bought <fact4>9 nails at $0.61 each</fact4>, which is 9 * 0.61 = $5.49. Additionally, she bought <fact6>10 gallons of paint</fact6> at $7.0 each (no discount for Elena), which is 10 * 7.0 = $70. So, Elena spent a total of 3.90 + 5.49 + 70 = $79.39. Elena had <fact2>$98.39</fact2> initially, so she has 98.39 - 79.39 = $19 left.

Now, let's calculate how much Jamal spent. He bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at $7.0 each, but with a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>, so the price per gallon is 7.0 * 0.9 = $6.30. Therefore, he spent 10 * 6.30 = $63 on paint. He also bought <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at $2 each</fact9>, which is 3 * 2 = $6. So, Jamal spent a total of 63 + 6 = $69. Jamal had <fact7>$80</fact7> initially, so he has 80 - 69 = $11 left.

Finally, to find out how much more money Elena has left than Jamal, we subtract the amount of money Jamal has left from the amount of money Elena has left: 19 - 11 = $8.

The store offers a <fact10>10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Olivia have left than James after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Olivia and James have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases. 
Olivia buys <fact3>15 nails</fact3> at <fact5>€0.31</fact5> each, for a total of <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact5>0.31</fact5> = €4.65. 
She also buys <fact4>9 anchors</fact4> at €0.62 each, for a total of <fact4>9</fact4> * 0.62 = €5.58. 
The total cost of paint for Olivia is <fact6>10</fact6> * <fact8>7.0</fact8> = €70. 
So, the total cost for Olivia is 4.65 + 5.58 + 70 = €80.23. 
Olivia has <fact2>€90.23</fact2> initially, so she has <fact2>90.23</fact2> - 80.23 = €10 left.

Since <fact1>James is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. 
The cost of paint for James is <fact8>10</fact8> * <fact8>7.0</fact8> * 0.9 = €63. 
James also buys <fact9>4 carpenter pencils</fact9> at €2 each, for a total of <fact9>4</fact9> * 2 = €8. 
So, the total cost for James is 63 + 8 = €71.

How much more money does Beatriz have left than Faisal after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Beatriz and Faisal have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases. 
Beatriz buys <fact3>16 screws</fact3> at <fact5>₺0.27 each</fact5>, so she pays <fact3>16</fact3> * <fact5>0.27</fact5> = ₺4.32 for the screws. 
She also buys <fact4>9 nuts at ₺0.55 each</fact4>, so she pays <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact4>0.55</fact4> = ₺4.95 for the nuts. 
The total cost of <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> for Beatriz is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact8>₺9.0</fact8> = ₺72. 
So, the total cost for Beatriz is ₺4.32 + ₺4.95 + ₺72 = ₺81.27. 
Beatriz has <fact2>₺92.27</fact2> initially, so she has ₺92.27 - ₺81.27 = ₺11 left.

As <fact1>Faisal is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. 
So, the cost of <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> for Faisal is <fact8>10</fact8> * <fact8>₺9.0</fact8> * (1 - <fact10>0.10</fact10>) = ₺81. 
Faisal also buys <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at ₺3 each</fact9>, so he pays <fact9>3</fact9> * <fact9>3</fact9> = ₺9 for the pencils. 
So, the total cost for Faisal is ₺81 + ₺9 = ₺90.

Additionally, Xena picks up <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6>. <fact7>Ali starts with ₺100</fact7> and wants <fact8>10 gallons of paint, each priced at ₺9.0</fact8>, and <fact9>3 carpenter pencils, each costing ₺2</fact9>. The store offers a <fact10>10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Xena have left than Ali after they leave the store?

Answer: Xena buys <fact3>15 nuts</fact3> at <fact5>₺0.27 each</fact5>, which costs 15 x <fact5>0.27</fact5> = ₺4.05. She also buys <fact4>9 screws at ₺0.7 each</fact4>, which costs <fact4>9</fact4> x <fact4>0.7</fact4> = ₺6.3. Additionally, she buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ₺9.0 each, which costs <fact6>8</fact6> x 9.0 = ₺72. So, Xena spends 4.05 + 6.3 + 72 = ₺82.35. Xena has <fact2>₺96.35</fact2> initially, so she has <fact2>96.35</fact2> - 82.35 = ₺14 left.

Ali buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at ₺9.0 each, but with a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>, the price becomes 9.0 - (9.0 x <fact10>0.1</fact10>) = ₺8.1 per gallon. So, Ali pays <fact8>10</fact8> x 8.1 = ₺81 for the paint. Ali also buys <fact9>3 carpenter pencils at ₺2 each</fact9>, which costs <fact9>3</fact9> x <fact9>2</fact9> = ₺6. Ali initially has <fact7>₺100</fact7>, so Ali has <fact7>100</fact7> - 81 - 6 = ₺13 left.

Therefore, Xena has ₺14 - ₺13 = ₺1 more than Ali.

How much more money does Chen have left than Jamal after they leave the store?

Answer: Chen buys <fact3>18 nails</fact3> at <fact5>¥0.39</fact5> each, which costs 18 * <fact5>0.39</fact5> = ¥7.02. She buys <fact4>9 anchors</fact4> at ¥0.59 each, which costs 9 * <fact4>0.59</fact4> = ¥5.31. She buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ¥7 each, which costs 8 * 7 = ¥56. So Chen spends 7.02 + 5.31 + 56 = ¥68.33. Chen has <fact2>¥95.33</fact2> initially, so she has <fact2>95.33</fact2> - 68.33 = ¥27 left.

Jamal buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at ¥7 each, but since <fact1>he is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. So he pays 10 * 7 * 0.9 = ¥63 for the paint.

How much more money does Yara have left than Tariq after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Yara and Tariq have left, we need to calculate the total cost of their purchases. Yara buys <fact3>17 nails</fact3> at <fact5>₣0.21 each</fact5>, which is 17 * 0.21 = ₣3.57. She also buys <fact4>9 washers at ₣0.64 each</fact4>, which is 9 * 0.64 = ₣5.76. The total cost of the nails and washers is 3.57 + 5.76 = ₣9.33. Yara also buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at ₣9.0 each, which is 8 * 9 = ₣72. Since <fact1>Yara is not a member</fact1>, she does not get a discount on the paint. The total cost of Yara's purchases is 9.33 + 72 = ₣81.33. Yara starts with <fact2>₣95.33</fact2>, so she has 95.33 - 81.33 = ₣14 left.

Tariq buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at ₣9.0 each, which is 10 * 9 = ₣90. Since <fact1>Tariq is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on the paint</fact10>, which is 90 * 0.1 = ₣9. So, the total cost of the paint for Tariq is 90 - 9 = ₣81. Tariq also buys <fact9>4 carpenter pencils at ₣2 each</fact9>, which is 4 * 2 = ₣8. The total cost of Tariq's purchases is 81 + 8 = ₣89. Tariq starts with <fact7>₣100</fact7>, so he has 100 - 89 = ₣11 left.

Yara has ₣14 left and Tariq has ₣11 left, so Yara has 14 - 11 = ₣3 more than Tariq.

Additionally, Winnie picks up <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6>. <fact7>Umar starts with $90</fact7> and wants <fact8>10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0</fact8>, and <fact9>4 carpenter pencils, each costing $3</fact9>. The store offers a <fact10>10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Winnie have left than Umar after they leave the store?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much Winnie spent. She bought <fact3>17 nuts</fact3> at <fact5>$0.25 per nut</fact5>, which is 17 * 0.25 = $4.25. She also bought <fact4>9 anchors at $0.66 each</fact4>, which is 9 * 0.66 = $5.94. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at $7.0 per gallon (since she's not a member and doesn't get a discount), which is 8 * 7.0 = $56. So, Winnie spent a total of 4.25 + 5.94 + 56 = $66.19. She had <fact2>$88.19</fact2> initially, so she has 88.19 - 66.19 = $22 left.

Now, let's calculate how much Umar spent. He bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at $7.0 per gallon, but since he's a member, he gets a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>. So, the price per gallon for him is 7.0 - (7.0 * 0.1) = $6.3. Therefore, he spent 10 * 6.3 = $63 on paint. He also bought <fact9>4 carpenter pencils at $3 each</fact9>, which is 4 * 3 = $12. So, Umar spent a total of 63 + 12 = $75. He had <fact7>$90</fact7> initially, so he has 90 - 75 = $15 left.

Finally, to find out how much more money Winnie has left than Umar, we subtract the amount of money Umar has left from the amount of money Winnie has left: 22 - 15 = $7.

Additionally, Keisha picks up <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6>. <fact7>Yusuf starts with $90</fact7> and wants <fact8>10 gallons of paint, each priced at $7.0</fact8>, and <fact9>4 carpenter pencils, each costing $2</fact9>. <fact10>The store offers a 10% discount on paint for members</fact10>. How much more money does Keisha have left than Yusuf after they leave the store?

Answer: To find out how much money Keisha has left, we need to calculate how much she spent. She bought <fact3>17 nails</fact3> at <fact5>$0.23 each</fact5>, which is 17 * 0.23 = $3.91. She also bought <fact4>10 screws at $0.64 each</fact4>, which is 10 * 0.64 = $6.40. Additionally, she bought <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at $7.0 each (no discount for Keisha), which is 8 * 7.0 = $56. So, Keisha spent a total of 3.91 + 6.40 + 56 = $66.31. She had <fact2>$94.31</fact2> initially, so she has 94.31 - 66.31 = $28 left.

To find out how much money Yusuf has left, we need to calculate how much he spent. He bought <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at $7.0 each, but with a <fact10>10% discount</fact10>, which is 10 * 7.0 * 0.9 = $63. He also bought <fact9>4 carpenter pencils at $2 each</fact9>, which is 4 * 2 = $8. So, Yusuf spent a total of 63 + 8 = $71. He had <fact7>$90</fact7> initially, so he has 90 - 71 = $19 left.

Therefore, Keisha has $28 - $19 = $9 more than Yusuf after they leave the store.

How much more money does Leilani have left than Pavel after they leave the store?

Answer: Leilani buys <fact3>18 anchors</fact3> at <fact5>$0.34 each</fact5>, which is a total of <fact3>18</fact3> * <fact5>0.34</fact5> = $6.12. She also buys <fact4>9 nails</fact4> at <fact4>$0.59 each</fact4>, which is a total of <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact4>0.59</fact4> = $5.31. Additionally, she buys <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6> at $8 each, which is a total of <fact6>8</fact6> * 8 = $64. So, Leilani spends a total of 6.12 + 5.31 + 64 = $75.43. Since <fact2>Leilani has $100.43</fact2>, she has $100.43 - $75.43 = $25 left.

Pavel buys <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at $8 each, but since <fact1>he is a member</fact1>, he gets a <fact10>10% discount on paint</fact10>. So, he pays 8 * <fact8>10</fact8> * 0.9 = $72 for the paint. He also buys <fact9>4 carpenter pencils</fact9> at <fact9>$2 each</fact9>, which is a total of <fact9>4</fact9> * <fact9>2</fact9> = $8. So, Pavel spends a total of 72 + 8 = $80. Since <fact7>Pavel starts with $100</fact7>, he has $100 - $80 = $20 left.

Therefore, Leilani has $25 - $20 = $5 more than Pavel after they leave the store.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * 480000 = $14400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 * 480000 = $67200.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: 480000 + 14400 + 67200 = $561600.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Ms. Johnson's <fact1>$490000 budget</fact1>. The difference is 561600 - 490000 = $71600.

The answer is {71600}.",71600.0,1,1,p2,1408

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 4% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 13% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $500000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $100000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$500000</fact2> - $100000 = $400000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.04 x $400000 = $16000. The <fact4>transfer fee is 13% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.13 x $400000 = $52000.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $400000 + $16000 + $52000 = $468000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's <fact1>$420000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $468000 - <fact1>$420000</fact1> = $48000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 4% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.04 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $20000. The <fact4>transfer fee is 13% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.13 x <fact2>$500000</fact2> = $65000.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $400000 + $20000 + $65000 = $485000.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>5% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>5%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $480000</fact2>, which is 0.05 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $24000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$480000</fact2> - $24000 = $456000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $14400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $57600.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $456000 + $14400 + $57600 = $527400.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's <fact1>$430000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $527400 - <fact1>$430000</fact1> = $97400.

Answer: First, let's calculate how many signatures Ava and Kayla have collected so far. <fact3>Ava has 38 signatures</fact3> and <fact4>Kayla has 41 signatures</fact4>, for a total of 38 + 41 = 79 signatures.

During their <fact1>fall break from school</fact1>, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>, Zahra and Nia compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. <fact3>Zahra has 28 signatures in her book</fact3>, and <fact4>Nia has 46</fact4>. The sisters have <fact5>2 more weeks of fall break</fact5>, and they decide they want to reach <fact6>120 signatures between them by the end of the break</fact6>. However, during the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, Zahra is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact7>5 per week</fact7>, while Nia decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Nia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many signatures Zahra and Nia collected per week during the first <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>. Zahra collected <fact3>28 signatures</fact3> in <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>, so she collected 28 / 3 = 9.33 signatures per week. Nia collected <fact4>46 signatures</fact4> in <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>, so she collected 46 / 3 = 15.33 signatures per week. During the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, Zahra's weekly collection is reduced by <fact7>5 per week</fact7>, so she will collect 9.33 - 5 = 4.33 signatures per week. Let's denote the number of signatures Nia needs to collect per week as x. The total number of signatures collected by both sisters during the <fact1>fall break</fact1> should be equal to <fact6>120 signatures</fact6>. So, the equation becomes: 28 + 46 + 2 * 4.33 + 2 * x = 120. Solving for x, we get: 2x = 120 - 28 - 46 - 2 * 4.33 = 37.34, so x = 18.67. Since Nia cannot collect a fraction of a signature, she needs to collect at least 19 signatures per week.

During their <fact1>spring break from school</fact1>, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact2>4 weeks</fact2>, Winnie and Priya compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. <fact3>Winnie has 32 signatures in her book</fact3>, and <fact4>Priya has 42</fact4>.

However, during the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, Winnie is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact7>5 per week</fact7>, while Priya decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Priya need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: Winnie and Priya currently have <fact3>32</fact3> + <fact4>42</fact4> = 74 signatures. They want to reach <fact6>140 signatures</fact6>, so they need to collect 140 - 74 = 66 signatures in the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>. Winnie's weekly collection is reduced by <fact7>5 per week</fact7>, and her original weekly collection was <fact3>32</fact3> / <fact2>4 weeks</fact2> = 8 signatures per week. So, Winnie will collect 8 - <fact7>5</fact7> = 3 signatures per week for the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, for a total of 3 * 2 = 6 signatures. This means Priya needs to collect 66 - 6 = 60 signatures in the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>. Therefore, Priya needs to collect 60 / 2 = 30 signatures per week to reach their goal.

During their <fact1>winter break from school</fact1>, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact2>6 weeks</fact2>, Uma and Ava compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. <fact3>Uma has 35 signatures in her book</fact3>, and <fact4>Ava has 36</fact4>. The sisters have <fact5>4 more weeks of winter break</fact5>, and they decide they want to reach <fact6>115 signatures between them by the end of the break</fact6>. However, during the remaining <fact5>4 weeks</fact5>, <fact7>Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week</fact7>, while Ava decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Ava need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many signatures Uma and Ava have collected in total so far. <fact3>Uma has 35 signatures</fact3> and <fact4>Ava has 36 signatures</fact4>, so together they have 35 + 36 = 71 signatures. They want to reach <fact6>115 signatures by the end of the break</fact6>, so they need to collect 115 - 71 = 44 more signatures. They have <fact5>4 weeks</fact5> left to do this. 

Since <fact7>Uma's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week</fact7>, and she was previously collecting (35 signatures)/(6 weeks) = 5.83 signatures per week, she will now collect 5.83 - 5 = 0.83 signatures per week. Over the course of <fact5>4 weeks</fact5>, Uma will collect 0.83 * 4 = 3.32 signatures. 

This means that Ava needs to collect 44 - 3.32 = 40.68 signatures over the course of <fact5>4 weeks</fact5>. To find out how many signatures Ava needs to collect per week, we divide 40.68 by 4. 40.68/4 = 10.17 signatures per week.

How many signatures will Xena need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many signatures Elena and Xena have collected so far. <fact3>Elena has 31 signatures</fact3> and <fact4>Xena has 35</fact4>, so together they have 31 + 35 = 66 signatures. 
Since they want to reach <fact6>120 signatures by the end of the break</fact6>, they need to collect 120 - 66 = 54 more signatures in the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>. 
In the first <fact2>4 weeks</fact2>, Elena collected 31 signatures, which is an average of 31 / 4 = 7.75 signatures per week. However, since <fact7>Elena is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week</fact7>, she will now collect 7.75 - 5 = 2.75 signatures per week. 
In the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, Elena will collect 2.75 * 2 = 5.5 signatures. 
This means that Xena needs to collect 54 - 5.5 = 48.5 signatures in the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>. 
To find out how many signatures Xena needs to collect per week, we divide 48.5 by 2, which gives us 24.25 signatures per week.

How many signatures will Olivia need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: Since <fact3>Yara has 36 signatures</fact3> and <fact4>Olivia has 36</fact4>, they currently have a total of 36 + 36 = 72 signatures. They want to reach a total of <fact6>140 signatures</fact6>, so they need 140 - 72 = 68 more signatures. They have <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> to collect these signatures. <fact7>Yara's weekly collection is reduced by 5</fact7>, and she originally collected 36 signatures in <fact2>5 weeks</fact2>, so her original weekly collection was 36 / 5 = 7.2 signatures per week. Now, she collects 7.2 - 5 = 2.2 signatures per week. In <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, Yara will collect 2.2 * 2 = 4.4 signatures. So, Olivia needs to collect 68 - 4.4 = 63.6 signatures in <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>. Therefore, Olivia needs to collect 63.6 / 2 = 31.8 signatures per week.

How many signatures will Uma need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: In the first <fact2>6 weeks</fact2>, Kayla collected <fact3>36 signatures</fact3> and Uma collected <fact4>39 signatures</fact4>. This means that Kayla collected 36 / 6 = 6 signatures per week and Uma collected 39 / 6 = 6.5 signatures per week. In the remaining <fact5>4 weeks</fact5>, Kayla's weekly collection is reduced by <fact7>5 per week</fact7>, so she will collect 6 - 5 = 1 signature per week. The total number of signatures collected by Kayla in the remaining 4 weeks will be 1 * 4 = 4 signatures. The total number of signatures collected by both sisters in the first 6 weeks is 36 + 39 = 75 signatures. To reach their goal of <fact6>135 signatures</fact6>, they need to collect 135 - 75 = 60 signatures in the remaining 4 weeks. Since Kayla will collect 4 signatures in the remaining 4 weeks, Uma needs to collect 60 - 4 = 56 signatures in the remaining 4 weeks. Therefore, Uma needs to collect 56 / 4 = 14 signatures per week to make sure they reach their goal.

How many signatures will Elena need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many signatures Mia and Elena have collected per week so far. <fact3>Mia has 36 signatures</fact3> after <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>, so she has collected 36 / 3 = 12 signatures per week. <fact4>Elena has 56 signatures</fact4> after <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>, so she has collected 56 / 3 = 18.67 signatures per week. 

During the remaining <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>, Mia's weekly collection is reduced by <fact7>5 per week</fact7>, so she will collect 12 - 5 = 7 signatures per week. 

The total number of signatures Mia and Elena will have after <fact5>2 more weeks</fact5> is <fact3>36</fact3> + <fact4>56</fact4> + 7 * 2 + 2 * x, where x is the number of signatures Elena collects per week. 

We want this total to be equal to <fact6>130 signatures</fact6>, so we can set up the equation: 36 + 56 + 14 + 2x = 130. 

Solving for x, we get: 2x = 130 - 106 = 24, so x = 24 / 2 = 12. 

Therefore, Elena needs to collect 12 signatures per week to make sure they reach their goal.

How many signatures will Valeria need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer: Mei and Valeria currently have <fact3>23</fact3> + <fact4>57</fact4> = 80 signatures. They want to reach <fact6>140 signatures</fact6>, so they need to collect 140 - 80 = 60 signatures in the remaining <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>. Mei's weekly collection is reduced by <fact7>5 per week</fact7>, and her original weekly collection was (<fact3>23</fact3> signatures / <fact2>3 weeks</fact2>) = 7.67 signatures per week, approximately. So now, Mei can collect approximately 7.67 - <fact7>5</fact7> = 2.67 signatures per week. Over the remaining <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>, Mei will collect approximately 2.67 * <fact5>3</fact5> = 8 signatures. This means Valeria needs to collect 60 - 8 = 52 signatures over the remaining <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>. To find out how many signatures Valeria needs to collect per week, we divide 52 signatures by <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>: 52 / <fact5>3</fact5> = 17.33 signatures per week.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of signatures Kayla and Kimia have collected so far. <fact3>Kayla has 31 signatures</fact3> and <fact4>Kimia has 55 signatures</fact4>, so together they have 31 + 55 = 86 signatures. To reach their goal of <fact6>140 signatures</fact6>, they need to collect 140 - 86 = 54 more signatures in the remaining <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>. 

Since <fact7>Kayla's weekly collection is reduced by 5 per week</fact7>, and she was collecting signatures every afternoon, we assume she was collecting 7 signatures per week. Now she can only collect 7 - 5 = 2 signatures per week. In the remaining <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>, Kayla will collect 2 * 3 = 6 signatures. 

This means Kimia needs to collect 54 - 6 = 48 signatures in the remaining <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>. To find out how many signatures Kimia needs to collect per week, we divide the total number of signatures she needs to collect by the number of weeks: 48 / 3 = 16.

He also paid <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3> for the realtor fee, which is <fact3>4%</fact3> * <fact1>$440000</fact1> = $17600. So, the total fees paid were $17600 + $17600 = $35200. Dr. Martinez also paid <fact4>$330000 for the remaining loan amount on the cottage</fact4> and <fact5>$10000 for closing costs</fact5>. So, the total amount paid was $35200 + <fact4>$330000</fact4> + <fact5>$10000</fact5> = $375200. The net proceeds from selling the cottage were <fact1>$440000</fact1> - $375200 = $64800. Dr. Martinez invested this amount in stocks, which <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>. After the first year, the amount became $64800 + $64800 * <fact6>10%</fact6> = $64800 + $6480 = $71280. After the second year, the amount became $71280 + $71280 * <fact6>10%</fact6> = $71280 + $7128 = $78408.

He paid the registration fees that amounted to <fact2>3% of the selling price</fact2> and also paid a agent fee that is <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3>. He also paid <fact4>$570000 for the remaining loan amount on the house</fact4>, and <fact5>$25000 for closing costs</fact5>. Prof. Smith used the net proceeds from selling the house to invest in stocks. The stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Prof. Smith's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: Prof. Smith paid registration fees of <fact2>3%</fact2> * <fact1>$790000</fact1> = $23700 and agent fees of <fact3>4%</fact3> * <fact1>$790000</fact1> = $31600. So, the total fees paid were $23700 + $31600 = $55300. 
Adding this to the remaining loan amount of <fact4>$570000</fact4> and the closing costs of <fact5>$25000</fact5>, we get the total amount Prof. Smith paid as $55300 + <fact4>$570000</fact4> + <fact5>$25000</fact5> = $650300. 
So, the net proceeds from the sale of the house were <fact1>$790000</fact1> - $650300 = $139700. 
Since the stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>, the net proceeds after two years will be $139700 * (1 + <fact6>10%</fact6>)^2 = $139700 * (1 + 0.1)^2 = $139700 * (1.1)^2 = $139700 * 1.21 = $168937.

Answer: The total cost of the hotel for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>₣250 per day</fact2> = ₣750. The total cost of the food for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>₣40 per day</fact3> = ₣120. The total cost of the transportation for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>₣10 per day</fact4> = ₣30. So the total cost of the music festival is ₣750 + ₣120 + ₣30 = ₣900.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the science fair. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>2-day science fair</fact1> is <fact2>₺150</fact2> * 2 = ₺300. The cost of the <fact3>food for the science fair</fact3> is <fact3>₺20</fact3> * 2 = ₺40, but this cost is covered by Pavel's friends, so we don't need to consider it. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>2-day science fair</fact1> is <fact4>₺10</fact4> * 2 = ₺20. Therefore, the total cost of the science fair is ₺300 + ₺20 = ₺320.

The parent association is covering <fact6>half of the remaining cost of the science fair</fact6>, which is ₺320 / 2 = ₺160.

Hiroshi has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Hiroshi still missing?

Answer: The total cost of the workshop is (<fact2>$200</fact2> + <fact3>$40</fact3> + <fact4>$20</fact4>) * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = $780. Since Hiroshi's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3>, which is <fact3>$40</fact3> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = $120, Hiroshi will only need to pay $780 - $120 = $660. The school will cover <fact6>1/10 of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>, which is $660 * <fact6>1/10</fact6> = $66. So, the amount that Hiroshi still needs to pay is $660 - $66 = $594.

Each day costs <fact2>$250 for hotel</fact2>, <fact3>$20 for food</fact3>, and <fact4>$30 for transportation</fact4>. Xavier only has <fact5>$150</fact5>. His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>. Xavier has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>. How much money is Xavier still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the <fact1>2-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>$250</fact2> * 2 = $500. The cost of the food is <fact3>$20</fact3> * 2 = $40, but this is covered by Xavier's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of transportation is <fact4>$30</fact4> * 2 = $60. Therefore, the total cost of the <fact1>2-day sports tournament</fact1> is $500 + $60 = $560.

Since Xavier's friends are covering the cost of the food, we can subtract this from the total cost: $560 - $40 = $520.

Xavier has <fact5>$150</fact5>, so we subtract this from the total cost: $520 - $150 = $370.

The school is covering <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament</fact6>, which is $370 * 1/5 = $74.

So, the amount of money Xavier is still missing is $370 - $74 = $296.

Sanjay has also applied for help from the local charity, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the field trip</fact6>. How much money is Sanjay still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the field trip. The cost of the hotel for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>₣250 per day</fact2> = ₣750. The cost of transportation for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>₣20 per day</fact4> = ₣60. Since Sanjay's friends are covering the cost of food, we don't need to include that in the total cost. So, the total cost of the field trip is ₣750 + ₣60 = ₣810.

Since Sanjay has <fact5>₣30</fact5>, we subtract that from the total cost to get the remaining cost: ₣810 - ₣30 = ₣780.

The local charity is covering <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is ₣780 / 5 = ₣156. So, the amount Sanjay is still missing is ₣780 - ₣156 = ₣624.

Pavel has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/2 of the remaining cost of the science fair</fact6>. How much money is Pavel still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the science fair. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day science fair</fact1> is <fact2>€200</fact2> * 3 = €600. The cost of the <fact3>food for the science fair</fact3> is <fact3>€30</fact3> * 3 = €90, but this cost is covered by Pavel's friends, so we don't need to consider it. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>3-day science fair</fact1> is <fact4>€10</fact4> * 3 = €30. So, the total cost of the science fair is €600 + €30 = €630. 

Since Pavel's friends are covering the cost of the food, the remaining cost of the science fair is €630. The community center is covering <fact6>1/2 of the remaining cost of the science fair</fact6>, which is €630 / 2 = €315. 

Now, let's calculate how much money Pavel still needs. The total cost of the science fair that Pavel needs to cover is €630 - €315 = €315. Pavel only has <fact5>€30</fact5>, so he still needs €315 - €30 = €285.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the seminar. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day seminar</fact1> is <fact2>$100</fact2> * 3 = $300. The cost of the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3> is <fact3>$40</fact3> * 3 = $120, but this is covered by Yusuf's friends. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>3-day seminar</fact1> is <fact4>$10</fact4> * 3 = $30. So, the total cost of the seminar is $300 + $120 + $30 = $450.

Jin has also applied for help from the parent association, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost of the field trip</fact6>. How much money is Jin still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the field trip. The cost of the hotel for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>₺150 per day</fact2> = ₺450. The cost of transportation for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>₺30 per day</fact4> = ₺90. Since Jin's friends are covering the cost of food, we don't need to include that in the total cost. So, the total cost of the field trip is ₺450 + ₺90 = ₺540. 

Since Jin has <fact5>₺15</fact5>, we subtract that from the total cost to get the remaining cost: ₺540 - ₺15 = ₺525. 

The parent association is covering <fact6>1/5 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is ₺525 / 5 = ₺105.

Answer: The total cost of the hotel for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>$250 per day</fact2> = $750. The total cost of the food for the music festival is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>$20 per day</fact3> = $60.

The cost of food is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>€20 per day</fact3> = €60, but this is covered by Tariq's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of transportation is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>€10 per day</fact4> = €30. Therefore, the total cost of the field trip is €600 + €30 = €630.

Since Tariq's friends are covering the cost of food, Tariq only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is €630. The community center is covering <fact6>a fifth of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is €630 / 5 = €126. So, the community center will pay €126, leaving Tariq to pay €630 - €126 = €504.

Answer: The total cost of the conference is (<fact2>₣250</fact2> + <fact3>₣40</fact3> + <fact4>₣30</fact4>) * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = ₣640. Since Ibrahim's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the conference</fact3>, which is <fact3>₣40</fact3> * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = ₣80, Ibrahim will only need to cover ₣640 - ₣80 = ₣560. Since Ibrahim already has <fact5>₣110</fact5>, he will need to cover ₣560 - ₣110 = ₣450. The local charity will cover <fact6>1/4 of the remaining cost of the conference</fact6>, which is ₣450 * <fact6>1/4</fact6> = ₣112.50. Therefore, Ibrahim is still missing ₣450 - ₣112.50 = ₣337.50.

Alejandro has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>an eighth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Alejandro still missing?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>3-day workshop</fact1> is <fact2>€150</fact2> * 3 = €450. The cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3> is <fact3>€40</fact3> * 3 = €120, but this is covered by Alejandro's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of the <fact4>transportation for the workshop</fact4> is <fact4>€10</fact4> * 3 = €30. Therefore, the total cost of the workshop is €450 + €30 = €480.

Alejandro has <fact5>€155</fact5>, so he still needs €480 - €155 = €325. However, the community center will cover <fact6>an eighth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>, which is €325 / 8 = €40.65. Therefore, Alejandro still needs €325 - €40.65 = €284.35.

Answer: The total cost of the <fact1>2-day field trip</fact1> is (<fact2>$200</fact2> + <fact3>$20</fact3> + <fact4>$10</fact4>) * 2 = $460. Since Esteban's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the field trip</fact3>, which is <fact3>$20</fact3> * 2 = $40, Esteban only needs to pay $460 - $40 = $420.

Answer: The total cost of the hotel for the <fact1>2-day music festival</fact1> is <fact2>$200</fact2> * 2 = $400.
The total cost of the food for the <fact1>2-day music festival</fact1> is <fact3>$40</fact3> * 2 = $80.
The total cost of the transportation for the <fact1>2-day music festival</fact1> is <fact4>$10</fact4> * 2 = $20.
So, the total cost of the music festival is $400 + $80 + $20 = $500.
Since Bodhi's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the music festival</fact3>, Bodhi only needs to pay $400 + $20 = $420.
Since Bodhi has <fact5>$30</fact5>, he still needs $420 - $30 = $390.
However, the school will cover a <fact6>quarter of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is $390 / 4 = $97.50.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the <fact1>3-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>$150</fact2> * 3 = $450. The cost of the food is <fact3>$30</fact3> * 3 = $90. The cost of the transportation is <fact4>$30</fact4> * 3 = $90. So, the total cost is $450 + $90 + $90 = $630. 

Since Qasim's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>, Qasim only needs to pay $630 - $90 = $540.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the workshop. The cost of the hotel for the <fact1>2-day workshop</fact1> is <fact2>$250</fact2> * 2 = $500. The cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3> is <fact3>$30</fact3> * 2 = $60, but this is covered by Mohammed's friends, so we don't need to include it in our calculation. The cost of the transportation for the <fact1>2-day workshop</fact1> is <fact4>$10</fact4> * 2 = $20. Therefore, the total cost of the workshop is $500 + $20 = $520.

The cost of the <fact3>food for the workshop</fact3> is <fact3>₣40</fact3> * 3 = ₣120, but this is covered by Hiroshi's friends, so we don't need to include it in the total cost. The cost of the <fact4>transportation for the workshop</fact4> is <fact4>₣20</fact4> * 3 = ₣60. Therefore, the total cost of the workshop is ₣750 + ₣60 = ₣810.

Yuki has also applied for help from the community center, which has decided to cover <fact6>1/10 of the remaining cost of the music festival</fact6>. How much money is Yuki still missing?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the music festival. The cost of the hotel for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>€250 per day</fact2> = €750. The cost of food for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>€40 per day</fact3> = €120. The cost of transportation for 3 days is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>€10 per day</fact4> = €30. So, the total cost of the music festival is €750 + €120 + €30 = €900.

Since Yuki's friends will cover the cost of all the food, Yuki only needs to pay for the hotel and transportation, which is €750 + €30 = €780.

Yuki has <fact5>€25</fact5>, so he still needs €780 - €25 = €755.

The community center will cover <fact6>1/10 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is €755 * 1/10 = €75.5.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the <fact1>2-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost of the hotel is <fact2>¥150</fact2> * 2 = ¥300. The cost of the food is <fact3>¥40</fact3> * 2 = ¥80. The cost of the transportation is <fact4>¥30</fact4> * 2 = ¥60. So, the total cost is ¥300 + ¥80 + ¥60 = ¥440. 

However, Xavier's friends will cover the cost of the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>, which is ¥80. So, the remaining cost is ¥440 - ¥80 = ¥360.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the <fact1>3-day sports tournament</fact1>. The cost per day is <fact2>€100 for hotel</fact2> + <fact4>€30 for transportation</fact4> + <fact3>€20 for food</fact3> = €150. Since the tournament is for <fact1>3 days</fact1>, the total cost is €150 * 3 = €450. However, Carlos' friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the sports tournament</fact3>, which is €20 * 3 = €60. So, the remaining cost is €450 - €60 = €390. The community center will cover <fact6>a tenth of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is €390 / 10 = €39. Now, we subtract the amount Carlos has, <fact5>€55</fact5>, and the amount the community center will cover, €39, from the remaining cost: €390 - €55 - €39 = €296.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the field trip. The cost of the hotel for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact2>$100 per day</fact2> = $300. The cost of the food for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact3>$30 per day</fact3> = $90, but this is covered by Theo's friends, so we don't need to include it in our total. The cost of transportation for the entire trip is <fact1>3 days</fact1> * <fact4>$20 per day</fact4> = $60. So the total cost of the field trip, excluding food, is $300 + $60 = $360. 

Since Theo's friends are covering the cost of food, we only need to consider the remaining cost of $360. The school is covering <fact6>1/6 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is $360 / 6 = $60. 

So, the amount that Theo still needs to cover is $360 - $60 = $300. He already has <fact5>$10</fact5>, so he is still missing $300 - $10 = $290.

Since James' friends will cover the cost of food, James only needs to pay $420. James has <fact5>$70</fact5>, so he still needs $420 - $70 = $350.

The cost of <fact4>transportation</fact4> is <fact4>₺30</fact4> * 3 = ₺90. Therefore, the total cost that Noah needs to pay is ₺450 + ₺90 = ₺540.

Noah has <fact5>₺15</fact5>, so he still needs ₺540 - ₺15 = ₺525. However, the parent association will cover <fact6>1/9 of the remaining cost</fact6>, which is ₺525 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = ₺58.33. Therefore, Noah still needs ₺525 - ₺58.33 = ₺466.67.

Answer: The total cost of the seminar is (<fact2>¥200</fact2> + <fact3>¥30</fact3> + <fact4>¥10</fact4>) * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥720. Since Andre's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the seminar</fact3>, which is <fact3>¥30</fact3> * <fact1>3 days</fact1> = ¥90, Andre only needs to pay ¥720 - ¥90 = ¥630.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1050</fact5>. What was the cost of scones per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of danishes. Since Uma bought <fact1>48 danishes at $16 per dozen</fact1>, and there are 4 dozens in 48, the cost of danishes is 4 * $16 = $64. Next, let's calculate the cost of tarts. Since Uma bought <fact2>48 tarts at $25 per dozen</fact2>, and there are 4 dozens in 48, the cost of tarts is 4 * $25 = $100. Now, let's calculate the total cost before the discount. The total cost is $64 + $100 + the cost of scones. We know that after a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, Uma paid a total of <fact5>$1050</fact5>. So, the total cost before the discount is <fact5>$1050</fact5> / (1 - <fact4>25%</fact4>) = $1050 / 0.75 = $1400. Now, we can calculate the cost of scones.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1140</fact5>. What was the cost of scones per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of danishes and tarts. The cost of <fact1>48 danishes at $20 per dozen</fact1> is 48 / 12 * $20 = $80. The cost of <fact2>60 tarts at $24 per dozen</fact2> is 60 / 12 * $24 = $120. The total cost of danishes and tarts is $80 + $120 = $200. 

Let x be the cost of scones per dozen. Then the cost of <fact3>24 scones</fact3> is 24 / 12 * x = 2x. 

The total cost of all treats before the discount is $200 + 2x. 

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, the total cost becomes ($200 + 2x) * (1 - 0.25) = ($200 + 2x) * 0.75 = $150 + 1.5x.

Since Mia paid a total of <fact5>$1140</fact5>, we can set up the equation $150 + 1.5x = $1140.

Solving for x, we get 1.5x = $1140 - $150 = $990, so x = $990 / 1.5 = $660.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1200</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, the total number of dozens of donuts is <fact1>48</fact1>/12 = 4. The cost of the donuts is 4 * $18 = $72.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. The total number of dozens of mini cupcakes is <fact2>72</fact2>/12 = 6. The cost of the mini cupcakes is 6 * $29 = $174.

The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $72 + $174 = $246.

Since Daphne paid a total of <fact5>$1200</fact5> after a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the original price before the discount was <fact5>$1200</fact5> / (1 - <fact4>0.20</fact4>) = $1500.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$960</fact5>. What was the cost of muffins per dozen?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the eclairs and cookies. Since there are 12 eclairs in a dozen, the cost of 24 eclairs is 2 * <fact1>$12 per dozen</fact1> = $24. Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, the cost of 48 cookies is 4 * <fact2>$31 per dozen</fact2> = $124. The total cost of eclairs and cookies is $24 + $124 = $148. 

Let's denote the cost of muffins per dozen as x. Since there are 12 muffins in a dozen, the cost of 48 muffins is 4 * x. 

The total cost of all the desserts before the discount is $148 + 4 * x. 

After the <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the total cost becomes 0.8 * ($148 + 4 * x) = <fact5>$960</fact5>.

$118.4 + 3.2 * x = $960

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1120</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes. Since there are 12 donuts in a dozen, Chen bought <fact1>24</fact1>/12 = 2 dozen donuts. So, the total cost of the donuts is 2 * <fact1>$16</fact1> = $32. Since there are 12 mini cupcakes in a dozen, Chen bought <fact2>72</fact2>/12 = 6 dozen mini cupcakes. So, the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 6 * <fact2>$33</fact2> = $198. The total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes is $32 + $198 = $230. 

Let's denote the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen as x. Since Chen bought <fact3>72</fact3>/12 = 6 dozen mini cheesecakes, the total cost of the mini cheesecakes is 6x. 

The total cost of all the pastries before the discount is $230 + 6x. After the <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, Chen paid a total of <fact5>$1120</fact5>. So, we can set up the equation: ($230 + 6x) * (1 - <fact4>20%</fact4>) = <fact5>$1120</fact5>.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the croissants and macarons. The total cost is $114 + $88 = $202. Since Jasmine paid a total of <fact5>$1080</fact5> after a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, the original price before the discount is 1080 / (1 - 0.2) = 1080 / 0.8 = $1350. Now, let's subtract the cost of the croissants and macarons from the original price to find the cost of the brownies. The cost of the brownies is $1350 - $202 = $1148. Since Jasmine bought <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>, the cost of the brownies per dozen is 1148 / (24 / 12) = 1148 / 2 = $574 per dozen.

She bought <fact1>60 donuts at $11 per dozen</fact1>, <fact2>72 mini cupcakes at $20 per dozen</fact2>, and <fact3>24 mini cheesecakes</fact3>. After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1300</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts. Since Nadia bought <fact1>60 donuts at $11 per dozen</fact1>, we need to convert the number of donuts to dozens. 60 donuts is equal to 60/12 = 5 dozen donuts. So, the cost of the donuts is 5 * $11 = $55.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. Since Nadia bought <fact2>72 mini cupcakes at $20 per dozen</fact2>, we need to convert the number of cupcakes to dozens. 72 cupcakes is equal to 72/12 = 6 dozen cupcakes. So, the cost of the cupcakes is 6 * $20 = $120.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts and cupcakes. The total cost is $55 + $120 = $175.

Since Nadia paid a total of <fact5>$1300</fact5> after a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, we need to calculate the original price before the discount. Let's call the original price x. Then, x - 20% of x = $1300. Solving for x, we get x = $1300 / 0.8 = $1625.

Now, we know that the total cost of the donuts and cupcakes is $175, and the original price is $1625. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1625 - $175 = $1450.

Since Nadia bought <fact3>24 mini cheesecakes</fact3>, we need to convert the number of cheesecakes to dozens. 24 cheesecakes is equal to 24/12 = 2 dozen cheesecakes. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen is $1450 / 2 = $725.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of danishes and tarts. Since Winnie bought <fact1>48 danishes at $12 per dozen</fact1>, the total cost of danishes is 48 / 12 * $12 = $48. Similarly, the total cost of tarts is 48 / 12 * $29 = $116, based on the fact that she bought <fact2>48 tarts at $29 per dozen</fact2>. 

The total cost of danishes and tarts is $48 + $116 = $164. Since Winnie paid a total of <fact5>$1050</fact5> after a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, the original price before the discount is $1050 / (1 - 0.25) = $1400. 

Now, subtracting the cost of danishes and tarts from the original price gives us the cost of scones, which is $1400 - $164 = $1236. Since Winnie bought <fact3>48 scones</fact3>, the cost of scones per dozen is $1236 / (48 / 12) = $1236 / 4 = $309.

After a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1230</fact5>. What was the cost of mini cheesecakes per dozen?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts. Since Haruka bought <fact1>72 donuts at $11 per dozen</fact1>, we need to divide 72 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 6. Then, we multiply 6 by $11 to get the total cost of the donuts, which is $66.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the mini cupcakes. Since Haruka bought <fact2>48 mini cupcakes at $26 per dozen</fact2>, we need to divide 48 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 4. Then, we multiply 4 by $26 to get the total cost of the mini cupcakes, which is $104.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes together, which is $66 + $104 = $170.

Since Haruka paid a total of <fact5>$1230</fact5> after a <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, we need to calculate the original price before the discount. Let's call the original price x. Then, we can set up the equation: x - 0.25x = 1230. Solving for x, we get x = 1230 / 0.75 = 1640.

Now, we know that the total cost of the donuts and mini cupcakes together is $170, and the original price of all the pastries is $1640. So, the cost of the mini cheesecakes is $1640 - $170 = $1470.

Since Haruka bought <fact3>36 mini cheesecakes</fact3>, we need to divide 36 by 12 to get the number of dozens, which is 3. Then, we can calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes per dozen by dividing $1470 by 3, which is $490.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Arash decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. Haruka can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Daphne can eat <fact3>four times as much</fact3> as Haruka, so she can eat 4 * <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> = 12 servings a day. Arash can eat <fact4>twice as much as Daphne</fact4>, so he can eat 2 * 12 servings a day = 24 servings a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> + 12 servings a day + 24 servings a day = 39 servings a day. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 39 servings a day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 78 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Arash cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 24 servings a day / 2 = 12 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> + 12 servings a day + 12 servings a day = 27 servings a day.

There are <fact1>105 servings</fact1> - 78 servings = 27 servings left. Since they eat 27 servings a day, it will take 27 servings / 27 servings a day = 1 day to finish the remaining pizza.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 21 * 2 = 42 portions. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Mei decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Mei now eats 12 / 2 = 6 portions per day. Now, the total number of portions eaten per day is 3 + 6 + 6 = 15.

There are <fact1>87 portions</fact1> initially, and 42 portions were eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are 87 - 42 = 45 portions left. 

To find out how many more days it will take to eat the remaining portions, we divide the remaining portions by the new daily consumption: 45 / 15 = 3. 

So, it will take 3 more days to eat the remaining portions. Since they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of days it will take to eat the entire cake is 2 + 3 = 5 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sophia decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Jasmine can eat 5 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Roya can eat twice as much</fact3> as Jasmine, Roya can eat 2 * 5 = 10 portions per day. Since <fact4>Sophia can eat twice as much as Roya</fact4>, Sophia can eat 2 * 10 = 20 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Jasmine is <fact2>5 portions per day</fact2> * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 10 portions. The total portions eaten by Roya is 10 portions per day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 20 portions. The total portions eaten by Sophia is 20 portions per day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 40 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they have eaten 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 portions in total.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sophia decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Sophia will eat 20 / 2 = 10 portions per day. Now, the total portions eaten per day is 5 (by Jasmine) + 10 (by Roya) + 10 (by Sophia) = 25 portions per day.

There are <fact1>120 portions</fact1> - 70 portions = 50 portions left. Since they eat 25 portions per day, it will take 50 / 25 = 2 more days to finish the cake.

So, in total, it will take <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 2 days = 4 days to finish the cake.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Yusuf decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Sakura can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Keisha can eat two times as much</fact3> as Sakura, Keisha can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions per day. Since <fact4>Yusuf can eat four times as much as Keisha</fact4>, Yusuf can eat 4 * 4 = 16 portions per day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 16 = 22. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 22 * 2 = 44 portions. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Yusuf decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Yusuf now eats 16 / 2 = 8 portions per day. Now, the total number of portions eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 8 = 14.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Ava decides to go on a diet and <fact6>cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: Wei can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Priya, so Wei can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> * 2 = 4 servings a day. Ava can eat <fact4>three times as much as Wei</fact4>, so Ava can eat 4 servings a day * 3 = 12 servings a day. For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> + 4 servings a day + 12 servings a day = 18 servings a day. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 18 servings a day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 36 servings. After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Ava cuts her consumption by half, so she eats 12 servings a day / 2 = 6 servings a day.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Camila decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many servings each person can eat per day. Nadia can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Ali can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Nadia, so Ali can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Camila can eat <fact4>six times as much as Ali</fact4>, so Camila can eat 6 * 6 = 36 servings a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Camila eats 36 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 72 servings. After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Camila cuts her consumption in half, so she eats 36 / 2 = 18 servings a day.

Let's calculate the total number of servings eaten by all three people in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. Nadia eats <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 6 servings. Ali eats 6 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 12 servings. Camila eats 72 servings. So, the total number of servings eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5> is 6 + 12 + 72 = 90 servings.

Now, let's calculate how many servings are left after <fact5>2 days</fact5>. There are <fact1>117 servings</fact1> initially, and 90 servings are eaten, so there are <fact1>117</fact1> - 90 = 27 servings left.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the three people eat 3 + 6 + 18 = 27 servings per day. Since there are 27 servings left, it will take them 1 more day to finish the pie.

So, the total number of days it takes to finish the pie is <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 1 day = 3 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sanjay decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat in a day. We already know that <fact2>Fatima can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Ravi can eat twice as much</fact3> as Fatima, Ravi can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions a day. Since <fact4>Sanjay can eat five times as much as Ravi</fact4>, Sanjay can eat 5 * 4 = 20 portions a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 20 = 26. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 26 * 2 = 52 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Sanjay decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Sanjay now eats 20 / 2 = 10 portions a day. Now, the total number of portions eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 10 = 16.

There are <fact1>84 portions</fact1> initially, and 52 portions were eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are 84 - 52 = 32 portions left.

To find out how many more days it will take to eat the remaining portions, we divide the remaining portions by the new daily consumption: 32 / 16 = 2.

So, it will take 2 more days to eat the remaining portions. Adding the initial <fact5>2 days</fact5>, it will take a total of 2 + 2 = 4 days for the pizza to be fully eaten.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Bodhi can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Gabriel can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Bodhi, so he can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Gabrielle can eat <fact4>three times as much as Gabriel</fact4>, so she can eat 3 * 6 = 18 servings a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 27 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 27 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 54 servings.

Answer: Yusuf can eat twice as much as Keisha, so Yusuf can eat <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>2</fact3> = 4 pieces a day. Bodhi can eat three times as much as Yusuf, so Bodhi can eat <fact4>3</fact4> * 4 = 12 pieces a day. For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 4 + 12 = 18. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 18 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 36 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Jamal decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Mohammed can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Luis can eat <fact3>seven times as much</fact3> as Mohammed, so Luis can eat <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>7</fact3> = 14 servings a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 14 + 28 = 44 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 44 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 88 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Quinn decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, let's determine how much each person can eat in a day. Umar can eat <fact2>2 portions a day</fact2>. Arash can eat <fact3>thrice as much</fact3> as Umar, so Arash can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 portions a day. Quinn can eat <fact4>thrice as much as Arash</fact4>, so Quinn can eat 3 * 6 = 18 portions a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total consumption per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 26 portions. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 26 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 52 portions.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>5</fact2> + 10 + 20 = 35 pieces. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 35 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 70 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Yara decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much each person can eat in a day. <fact2>Kai can eat 5 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Liam can eat twice as much</fact3> as Kai, Liam can eat 2 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 10 portions a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Kai is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 10 portions. The total portions eaten by Liam is 10 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 20 portions. The total portions eaten by Yara is 30 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 60 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten is 10 + 20 + 60 = 90 portions.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Jamal can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Xena can eat twice as much</fact3> as Jamal, Xena can eat 2 * 2 = 4 pieces a day. Since <fact4>Rania can eat thrice as much as Xena</fact4>, Rania can eat 3 * 4 = 12 pieces a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 + 4 + 12 = 18. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 18 * 2 = 36 pieces.

There are <fact1>118 pieces</fact1> in total, and 28 pieces have been eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. So, there are 118 - 28 = 90 pieces left. 

To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 90 pieces, we divide 90 by the new daily consumption of 10 pieces. 90 / 10 = 9 days.

However, we need to add the initial <fact5>2 days</fact5> to this result, as the question asks for the total number of days it will take to eat the entire pizza. Therefore, the total number of days is 9 + 2 = 11 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Rania decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pieces each person can eat per day. Nia can eat <fact2>2 pieces a day</fact2>. Jasmine can eat <fact3>three times as much</fact3> as Nia, so she can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 pieces a day. Rania can eat <fact4>three times as much as Jasmine</fact4>, so she can eat 3 * 6 = 18 pieces a day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Nia eats <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 4 pieces, Jasmine eats 6 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 12 pieces, and Rania eats 18 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 36 pieces. So, in total, they eat 4 + 12 + 36 = 52 pieces in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Rania decides to go on a diet and cut her consumption by half, so she can eat 18 / 2 = 9 pieces a day. Now, the three of them eat <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 9 = 17 pieces per day. 

There are <fact1>86 pieces</fact1> - 52 pieces = 34 pieces left. To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining pieces, we divide 34 by 17, which is 2. 

However, we need to add the <fact5>2 days</fact5> they already spent eating the cake. So, the total number of days it will take for the cake to be fully eaten is 2 + 2 = 4.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Rania decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Diego can eat 5 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Ibrahim can eat two times as much</fact3> as Diego, Ibrahim can eat 2 * <fact2>5</fact2> = 10 portions per day. Since <fact4>Rania can eat two times as much as Ibrahim</fact4>, Rania can eat 2 * 10 = 20 portions per day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Diego is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 10 portions. The total portions eaten by Ibrahim is 10 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 20 portions. The total portions eaten by Rania is 20 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 40 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten is 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Rania decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Rania can eat 20 / 2 = 10 portions per day.

Now, let's calculate how many days it will take to eat the remaining portions. The remaining portions are <fact1>95</fact1> - 70 = 25 portions. The total portions eaten per day by Diego, Ibrahim, and Rania is <fact2>5</fact2> + 10 + 10 = 25 portions per day.

So, it will take 25 / 25 = 1 day to eat the remaining portions.

Therefore, the total number of days it will take to eat the entire pizza is <fact5>2</fact5> + 1 = 3 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Elena decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. Valentina can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Santiago can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Valentina, so he can eat 2 * 2 = 4 servings a day. Elena can eat <fact4>three times as much as Santiago</fact4>, so she can eat 3 * 4 = 12 servings a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Valentina eats 2 * 2 = 4 servings, Santiago eats 2 * 4 = 8 servings, and Elena eats 2 * 12 = 24 servings. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 24 = 36 servings in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Elena decides to go on a diet and cut her consumption by half, so she can eat 12 / 2 = 6 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings they can eat per day is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 servings.

There are <fact1>48 servings</fact1> in total, and they have already eaten 36 servings, so there are 48 - 36 = 12 servings left. Since they can eat 12 servings per day, it will take them 1 more day to finish the pie.

So, in total, it will take them 2 + 1 = 3 days to fully eat the pie.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Santiago decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Olivia can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Valentina can eat thrice as much</fact3> as Olivia, Valentina can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Santiago can eat four times as much as Valentina</fact4>, Santiago can eat 4 * 6 = 24 pieces per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 24 = 32 pieces. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 32 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 64 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Santiago decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so he now eats 24 / 2 = 12 pieces per day. Now, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 20 pieces.

There are <fact1>104 pieces</fact1> - 64 = 40 pieces left. To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining pieces, we divide 40 by 20, which is 2.

However, we need to add the <fact5>2 days</fact5> they already spent eating. So, the total number of days it will take for the lasagna to be fully eaten is 2 + 2 = 4.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Viktor decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Leilani can eat <fact2>3 portions a day</fact2>. Chen can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Leilani, so Chen can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 portions a day. Viktor can eat <fact4>three times as much as Chen</fact4>, so Viktor can eat 3 * 6 = 18 portions a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total consumption per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 27 portions. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 27 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 54 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Viktor cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 18 / 2 = 9 portions a day. The total consumption per day becomes <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 9 = 18 portions.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining lasagna. The remaining lasagna is <fact1>90</fact1> - 54 = 36 portions. 

Since they eat 18 portions per day, it will take 36 / 18 = 2 days to eat the remaining lasagna.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Camila decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by <fact6>half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: Luis eats <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Kai eats <fact3>three times as much</fact3> as Luis, so Kai eats <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>3</fact3> = 6 servings a day. Camila eats <fact4>two times as much as Kai</fact4>, so Camila eats 6 * <fact4>2</fact4> = 12 servings a day. For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 20 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 20 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 40 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Aisha decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Leilani can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Xavier can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Leilani, so Xavier can eat 2 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 4 servings a day. Aisha can eat <fact4>six times as much as Xavier</fact4>, so Aisha can eat 6 * 4 = 24 servings a day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 4 + 24 = 30 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 30 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 60 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Aisha cuts her consumption in half, so she eats 24 / 2 = 12 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 4 + 12 = 18 servings.

There are <fact1>78 servings</fact1> in total, and 60 servings have been eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are <fact1>78</fact1> - 60 = 18 servings left.

Since they eat 18 servings per day after Aisha's diet, it will take 18 / 18 = 1 day to finish the remaining lasagna.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Carlos decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the cake to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Diego can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. <fact3>Benjamin can eat five times as much</fact3> as Diego, so Benjamin can eat 5 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 10 portions per day. <fact4>Carlos can eat twice as much as Benjamin</fact4>, so Carlos can eat 2 * 10 = 20 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Diego is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 4 portions. The total portions eaten by Benjamin is 10 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 20 portions. The total portions eaten by Carlos is 20 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 40 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they have eaten 4 + 20 + 40 = 64 portions in total.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Carlos decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Carlos can eat 20 / 2 = 10 portions per day. Now, the total portions eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 10 + 10 = 22 portions.

There are <fact1>108 portions</fact1> - 64 portions = 44 portions left. To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining portions, we divide 44 by 22, which is 2 days.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Bodhi can eat <fact2>3 portions a day</fact2>. Emma can eat <fact3>thrice as much</fact3> as Bodhi, so she can eat 3 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 9 portions a day. Umar can eat <fact4>two times as much as Emma</fact4>, so he can eat 2 * 9 = 18 portions a day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Bodhi eats <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 6 portions, Emma eats 9 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 18 portions, and Umar eats 18 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 36 portions. So, in total, they eat 6 + 18 + 36 = 60 portions in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Theo decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: Luis eats <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Beatriz eats <fact3>six times as much</fact3> as Luis, so she eats 6 * <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> = 12 servings a day. Theo eats <fact4>twice as much as Beatriz</fact4>, so he eats 2 * 12 servings a day = 24 servings a day. For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2> + 12 servings a day + 24 servings a day = 38 servings a day. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 38 servings a day * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 76 servings. After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Theo cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 24 servings a day / 2 = 12 servings a day.

The remaining number of servings is <fact1>128 servings</fact1> - 76 servings = 52 servings. To find the number of days it takes to eat the remaining servings, divide the remaining servings by the number of servings eaten per day: 52 servings / 26 servings a day = 2 days. Since they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of days it takes to eat the pizza is <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 2 days = 4 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Mohammed decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Tara can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Zahra can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Tara, so Zahra can eat 2 * 2 = 4 servings a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Tara eats 2 * 2 = 4 servings, Zahra eats 2 * 4 = 8 servings, and Mohammed eats 2 * 12 = 24 servings. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 24 = 36 servings in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Mohammed decides to go on a diet and cut his consumption by half, so he now eats 12 / 2 = 6 servings a day. Now, in total, they eat 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 servings per day.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>James decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, let's calculate how much each person can eat in a day. <fact2>Elena can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. <fact3>Xavier can eat twice as much</fact3> as Elena, so Xavier can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions a day. <fact4>James can eat thrice as much as Xavier</fact4>, so James can eat 3 * 4 = 12 portions a day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, James eats 12 portions a day, so he eats 12 * 2 = 24 portions. Xavier eats 4 portions a day, so he eats 4 * 2 = 8 portions. Elena eats 2 portions a day, so she eats 2 * 2 = 4 portions. In total, they eat 24 + 8 + 4 = 36 portions in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>James decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so he now eats 12 / 2 = 6 portions a day. The total number of portions eaten per day is now 6 (James) + 4 (Xavier) + 2 (Elena) = 12 portions per day.

There are <fact1>72 portions</fact1> in total, and they have already eaten 36 portions in the first 2 days. So, there are 72 - 36 = 36 portions left. Since they now eat 12 portions per day, it will take them 36 / 12 = 3 days to finish the remaining portions.

Answer: Ava eats <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Camila eats <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Ava, so Camila eats 2 * <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2> = 6 servings a day.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>James decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Hiroshi can eat <fact2>3 portions a day</fact2>. Umar can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Hiroshi, so Umar can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 portions a day. James can eat <fact4>twice as much as Umar</fact4>, so James can eat 2 * 6 = 12 portions a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of portions eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 21. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 21 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 42 portions.

Valentina can eat <fact4>twice as much as Luca</fact4>, so Valentina can eat 2 * 4 = 8 portions a day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Alejandro eats <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 4 portions, Luca eats 4 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 8 portions, and Valentina eats 8 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 16 portions. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 portions in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Valentina cuts her consumption in half, so she eats 8 / 2 = 4 portions a day. Now, the three of them eat <fact2>2</fact2> + 4 + 4 = 10 portions a day. 

There are <fact1>78 portions</fact1> initially, and they have eaten 28 portions, so there are <fact1>78</fact1> - 28 = 50 portions left. 

Since they eat 10 portions a day, it will take them 50 / 10 = 5 days to eat the remaining portions. 

However, this is the time it takes to eat the remaining portions, and we want to know the total time it takes to eat the entire pizza. They have already eaten for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so the total time is <fact5>2</fact5> + 5 = 7 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Benjamin decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Sophia can eat 2 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Aisha can eat twice as much</fact3> as Sophia, Aisha can eat 2 * 2 = 4 portions per day. Since <fact4>Benjamin can eat two times as much as Aisha</fact4>, Benjamin can eat 2 * 4 = 8 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Sophia eats 2 * 2 = 4 portions, Aisha eats 2 * 4 = 8 portions, and Benjamin eats 2 * 8 = 16 portions. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 portions in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Benjamin decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so he now eats 8 / 2 = 4 portions per day. 

Now, let's calculate how many portions they eat per day after Benjamin's diet: Sophia eats 2 portions, Aisha eats 4 portions, and Benjamin eats 4 portions, for a total of 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 portions per day.

They have already eaten 28 portions, so they have <fact1>78 portions</fact1> - 28 = 50 portions left. 

To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 50 portions, we divide 50 by the number of portions they eat per day, which is 10. 

50 / 10 = 5 days. 

However, this is the number of days it will take to eat the remaining portions, and we need to add the <fact5>2 days</fact5> they already spent eating. 

So, the total number of days it will take to eat the entire pie is 5 + 2 = 7 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. <fact2>Olivia can eat 4 portions a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Roya can eat two times as much</fact3> as Olivia, Roya can eat 2 * <fact2>4</fact2> = 8 portions per day. Since <fact4>Gabrielle can eat three times as much as Roya</fact4>, Gabrielle can eat 3 * 8 = 24 portions per day. 

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten by Olivia is <fact2>4</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 8 portions. The total portions eaten by Roya is 8 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 16 portions. The total portions eaten by Gabrielle is 24 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 48 portions. So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total portions eaten is 8 + 16 + 48 = 72 portions.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Gabrielle can eat 24 / 2 = 12 portions per day. Now, the total portions eaten per day is <fact2>4</fact2> + 8 + 12 = 24 portions.

The remaining portions of the pie is <fact1>96</fact1> - 72 = 24 portions. Since they can eat 24 portions per day, it will take 24 / 24 = 1 day to finish the remaining portions. 

So, the total number of days it will take for the pie to be fully eaten is <fact5>2</fact5> + 1 = 3 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kayla decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to determine how much each person can eat per day. We know that <fact2>Rania can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Diego can eat twice as much</fact3> as Rania, Diego can eat 2 * 2 = 4 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Kayla can eat six times as much as Diego</fact4>, Kayla can eat 6 * 4 = 24 pieces per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 (Rania) + 4 (Diego) + 24 (Kayla) = 30 pieces per day. So, in 2 days, they eat 30 * 2 = 60 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kayla decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Kayla's new daily consumption is 24 / 2 = 12 pieces per day. The new total number of pieces eaten per day is 2 (Rania) + 4 (Diego) + 12 (Kayla) = 18 pieces per day.

There are <fact1>78 pieces</fact1> initially, and 60 pieces were eaten in the first 2 days, so there are 78 - 60 = 18 pieces left. Since they eat 18 pieces per day after Kayla's diet, it will take 1 more day to finish the lasagna.

Therefore, the total number of days it will take to fully eat the lasagna is 2 (initial days) + 1 (day after Kayla's diet) = 3 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabriel decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many pieces each person can eat per day. <fact2>Sofia can eat 3 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Diego can eat twice as much</fact3> as Sofia, Diego can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Gabriel can eat three times as much as Diego</fact4>, Gabriel can eat 3 * 6 = 18 pieces per day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 27. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 27 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 54 pieces. 

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabriel decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Gabriel now eats 18 / 2 = 9 pieces per day. The new total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 9 = 18. 

There are <fact1>126 pieces</fact1> initially, and 54 pieces were eaten in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so there are <fact1>126</fact1> - 54 = 72 pieces left. 

To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining pieces, we divide the remaining pieces by the new total number of pieces eaten per day: 72 / 18 = 4.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the lasagna to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much each person can eat per day. Elena can eat <fact2>3 servings a day</fact2>. Fatima can eat <fact3>two times as much</fact3> as Elena, so Fatima can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Gabrielle can eat <fact4>three times as much as Fatima</fact4>, so Gabrielle can eat 3 * 6 = 18 servings a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 18 = 27 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 27 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 54 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle cuts her consumption by half</fact6>, so she eats 18 / 2 = 9 servings a day. The total number of servings eaten per day is now <fact2>3</fact2> + 6 + 9 = 18 servings.

The remaining number of servings is <fact1>126</fact1> - 54 = 72 servings. To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining servings, we divide 72 by 18, which is 72 / 18 = 4 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Hiroshi decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. Liam can eat <fact2>2 servings a day</fact2>. Jasmine can eat <fact3>three times as much</fact3> as Liam, so she can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 servings a day. Hiroshi can eat <fact4>two times as much as Jasmine</fact4>, so he can eat 2 * 6 = 12 servings a day. 

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 20 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 20 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 40 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Hiroshi cuts his consumption in half, so he eats 12 / 2 = 6 servings a day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 6 = 14 servings.

There are <fact1>82 servings</fact1> in total, and 40 servings have been eaten, so there are <fact1>82</fact1> - 40 = 42 servings left. 

To find out how many days it will take to eat the remaining 42 servings, we divide 42 by the new daily consumption of 14 servings: 42 / 14 = 3 days.

However, we must not forget that they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, so the total number of days is <fact5>2</fact5> + 3 = 5 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kai decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pie to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pieces each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Arash can eat 3 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Emma can eat two times as much</fact3> as Arash, she can eat 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Kai can eat two times as much as Emma</fact4>, he can eat 2 * 6 = 12 pieces per day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Arash eats <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact5>2</fact5> = 6 pieces, Emma eats 6 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 12 pieces, and Kai eats 12 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 24 pieces. So, in total, they eat 6 + 12 + 24 = 42 pieces in the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Kai decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so he can eat 12 / 2 = 6 pieces per day.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces they eat per day after Kai's diet: Arash eats <fact2>3</fact2> pieces, Emma eats 6 pieces, and Kai eats 6 pieces, for a total of 3 + 6 + 6 = 15 pieces per day.

They have already eaten 42 pieces, so they have <fact1>102</fact1> - 42 = 60 pieces left. Since they eat 15 pieces per day, it will take them 60 / 15 = 4 days to eat the remaining pieces.

Answer: Wei can eat <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as Hiroshi, so Wei can eat <fact2>3 portions</fact2> * 2 = 6 portions a day. 
Gabrielle can eat <fact4>three times as much as Wei</fact4>, so Gabrielle can eat 6 portions * 3 = 18 portions a day. 
In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, Hiroshi eats <fact2>3 portions</fact2> * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 6 portions, Wei eats 6 portions * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 12 portions, and Gabrielle eats 18 portions * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 36 portions. 
So, after <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they have eaten 6 + 12 + 36 = 54 portions. 
There are <fact1>108 portions</fact1> - 54 portions = 54 portions left. 
After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Gabrielle cuts her consumption by half</fact6>, so she now eats 18 / 2 = 9 portions a day. 
Now, Hiroshi, Wei, and Gabrielle eat <fact2>3 portions</fact2> + 6 portions + 9 portions = 18 portions a day. 
It will take them 54 portions / 18 portions per day = 3 days to eat the remaining pizza. 
Since they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, it will take them a total of <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 3 days = 5 days to eat the entire pizza.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Jin decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pieces each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>James can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Kai can eat two times as much</fact3> as James, Kai can eat 2 * 2 = 4 pieces per day. And since <fact4>Jin can eat two times as much as Kai</fact4>, Jin can eat 2 * 4 = 8 pieces per day.

In the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, James eats 2 * 2 = 4 pieces, Kai eats 4 * 2 = 8 pieces, and Jin eats 8 * 2 = 16 pieces. So, in total, they eat 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 pieces in the first 2 days.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Jin decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Jin can now eat 8 / 2 = 4 pieces per day.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces they eat per day after Jin's diet: James eats 2 pieces, Kai eats 4 pieces, and Jin eats 4 pieces, for a total of 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 pieces per day.

They have already eaten 28 pieces, so they have <fact1>68</fact1> - 28 = 40 pieces left. Since they eat 10 pieces per day, it will take them 40 / 10 = 4 days to eat the remaining pieces.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many pieces each person can eat per day. <fact2>Xavier can eat 2 pieces a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Alejandro can eat three times as much</fact3> as Xavier, Alejandro can eat 3 * <fact2>2</fact2> = 6 pieces per day. Since <fact4>Valentina can eat four times as much as Alejandro</fact4>, Valentina can eat 4 * 6 = 24 pieces per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 24 = 32 pieces. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 32 * <fact5>2</fact5> = 64 pieces.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Valentina decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so she eats 24 / 2 = 12 pieces per day. Now, the total number of pieces eaten per day is <fact2>2</fact2> + 6 + 12 = 20 pieces.

There are <fact1>124 pieces</fact1> - 64 = 60 pieces left. To find the number of days it takes to eat the remaining pieces, we divide 60 by 20, which is 3.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Leon decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>. How many days will it take for the pizza to be fully eaten?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each person can eat per day. We already know that <fact2>Ali can eat 2 servings a day</fact2>. Since <fact3>Camila can eat four times as much</fact3> as Ali, Camila can eat 4 * <fact2>2 servings</fact2> = 8 servings per day. Since <fact4>Leon can eat three times as much as Camila</fact4>, Leon can eat 3 * 8 servings = 24 servings per day.

For the first <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings</fact2> + 8 servings + 24 servings = 34 servings. So, in <fact5>2 days</fact5>, they eat 34 servings * <fact5>2 days</fact5> = 68 servings.

After <fact5>2 days</fact5>, <fact6>Leon decides to go on a diet and cut the consumption by half</fact6>, so Leon now eats 24 servings / 2 = 12 servings per day. Now, the total number of servings eaten per day is <fact2>2 servings</fact2> + 8 servings + 12 servings = 22 servings.

The remaining number of servings is <fact1>112 servings</fact1> - 68 servings = 44 servings. To find the number of days it will take to eat the remaining servings, we divide the remaining servings by the new daily consumption: 44 servings / 22 servings per day = 2 days.

Since they already ate for <fact5>2 days</fact5>, the total number of days it will take to fully eat the pizza is <fact5>2 days</fact5> + 2 days = 4 days.

How much more do <fact5>7 loaves of sourdough</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 biscuits</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the cost of a biscuit. Since the cost of a biscuit is <fact2>3/4 of a loaf of sourdough</fact2> and a <fact1>loaf of sourdough costs $5</fact1>, the cost of a biscuit is 3/4 * $5 = $3.75. 

Since the market has a promotion that if one buys <fact3>5 biscuits or more</fact3>, they get a <fact4>10% discount on biscuits</fact4> and we are buying <fact6>8 biscuits</fact6>, we can apply the discount. The total cost of 8 biscuits before the discount is 8 * $3.75 = $30. After the <fact4>10% discount</fact4>, the cost is $30 - 0.1 * $30 = $27.

Answer: The cost of a croissant is <fact2>one-fourth of a loaf of bread</fact2>, which is <fact1>¥5</fact1>/4 = ¥1.25. Since the store offers a <fact4>20% discount on croissants</fact4> when buying <fact3>5 croissants or more</fact3>, and <fact6>8 croissants</fact6> is more than 5, the discounted price of a croissant is ¥1.25 * 0.8 = ¥1.

Answer: The cost of a bagel is <fact2>1/4 of a loaf of bread</fact2>, which is <fact1>¥5</fact1>/4 = ¥1.25. Since the customer is buying <fact6>12 bagels</fact6>, which is more than <fact3>3 bagels</fact3>, they get a <fact4>20% discount on bagels</fact4>. So, the cost of <fact6>12 bagels</fact6> is 12 x ¥1.25 x (1 - <fact4>20%</fact4>) = 12 x ¥1.25 x 0.8 = ¥12. The cost of <fact5>9 loaves of bread</fact5> is 9 x <fact1>¥5</fact1> = ¥45.

Answer: The cost of a biscuit is <fact2>3/4 of a loaf of sourdough</fact2>, which is <fact2>3/4</fact2> * <fact1>€5</fact1> = €3.75. Since the market has a promotion that if one buys <fact3>3 biscuits or more</fact3>, they get a <fact4>20% discount on biscuits</fact4>, and we are buying <fact6>12 biscuits</fact6>, we can apply the discount.

How much more do <fact5>3 loaves of sourdough</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 biscuits</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to find the cost of one biscuit. Since the cost of a biscuit is <fact2>1/8 of a loaf of sourdough</fact2> and a <fact1>loaf of sourdough costs €10</fact1>, the cost of one biscuit is €10 / 8 = €1.25.

The total cost of 8 biscuits without discount is €1.25 * 8 = €10. With the 20% discount, the cost is €10 - (20% of €10) = €10 - €2 = €8.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they spend 180 / 60 = 3 hours per day cleaning rooms. They work for <fact5>10 hours a day</fact5>, so the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms is (3 / 10) * 100 = 30%.

If they work for <fact5>10 hours a day</fact5>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer: The maintenance worker has to clean <fact1>120 rooms</fact1> in <fact2>10 days</fact2>, so they need to clean 120/<fact2>10</fact2> = 12 rooms per day. Due to their injury, it now takes them <fact4>twice as long</fact4> as the original <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>, so it takes them 2 * <fact3>15</fact3> = 30 minutes per room. They need to clean 12 rooms per day, so they will spend 12 * 30 minutes = 360 minutes per day cleaning rooms. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 360/60 = 6 hours per day. They work for <fact5>10 hours a day</fact5>, so the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms is (6/<fact5>10</fact5>) * 100% = 60%.

How much money does Sophia have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the rock candy. Since Sophia bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> and the offer is <fact2>Buy 17 kgs at ₺20 per kg, get 5 kgs 1/2 off</fact2>, we can break it down as follows: 
17 kgs at ₺20 per kg is 17 * 20 = ₺340. 
The remaining 6 kgs (23 - 17) can be split into 5 kgs at half price and 1 kg at full price. 
5 kgs at half price is 5 * (20 / 2) = ₺50. 
1 kg at full price is 1 * 20 = ₺20. 
So, the total cost of the rock candy is 340 + 50 + 20 = ₺410.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the stickers. Since Sophia bought <fact5>13 stickers that were ₺20.0 each</fact5>, the total cost of the stickers is 13 * 20 = ₺260.

Adding up the costs, we have: 
- Rock candy: ₺410
- Sea glass: <fact4>₺11.0</fact4>
- Stickers: ₺260
- Charity donation: <fact6>₺5</fact6>

Total cost = 410 + 11 + 260 + 5 = ₺686

At the beach shop, rock candy was on sale for ""<fact2>Buy 15 kilograms at ₺23 per kilogram, get 6 kilograms 1/3 off</fact2>."" She scooped up <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3>.

How much money does Sophia have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the rock candy. For the first 15 kilograms, the cost is 15 * ₺23 = ₺345. For the remaining 8 kilograms (23 - 15 = 8), 6 kilograms will be 1/3 off, and 2 kilograms will be at the regular price. The cost for 6 kilograms at 1/3 off is 6 * ₺23 * 2/3 = ₺92. The cost for the remaining 2 kilograms is 2 * ₺23 = ₺46. So, the total cost of the rock candy is ₺345 + ₺92 + ₺46 = ₺483. 

The cost of the mixed bag of sea glass is <fact4>₺11.0</fact4>. The cost of the 18 stickers is <fact5>18</fact5> * ₺20.5 = ₺369. 

The total amount Sophia spent is ₺483 + ₺11.0 + ₺369 + <fact6>₺5</fact6> = ₺868. 

Sophia started with <fact1>₺1400</fact1>, so she has ₺1400 - ₺868 = ₺532 left.

How much money does Tara have left?

Answer: Tara started with <fact1>₣1200</fact1>. The first 17 kgs of saltwater taffy cost <fact2>₣22 per kg</fact2> * 17 kgs = ₣374. The next 6 kgs of saltwater taffy (since <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> - 17 kgs = 6 kgs) are eligible for the discount. However, only 4 kgs are discounted. The discount is 1/4 off of the original price, so the discounted kgs cost (<fact2>₣22 per kg</fact2>) * (3/4) = ₣16.5 per kg. The remaining 2 kgs cost the full <fact2>₣22 per kg</fact2>. The total cost of the last 6 kgs is (₣16.5 per kg * 4 kgs) + (<fact2>₣22 per kg</fact2> * 2 kgs) = ₣132. The total cost of the saltwater taffy is ₣374 + ₣132 = ₣506.

How much money does Gabrielle have left?

Answer: The total cost of the rock candy can be calculated by first finding the cost of the first 15 pounds, which is <fact2>15 pounds</fact2> * ¥22/pound = ¥330. Then, find the cost of the remaining 8 pounds (since <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> - <fact2>15 pounds</fact2> = 8 pounds), which is 8 pounds * ¥22/pound * 3/4 = ¥132. The total cost of the rock candy is ¥330 + ¥132 = ¥462. The total cost of the stickers is <fact5>17 stickers</fact5> * ¥20/sticker = ¥340. Adding the cost of the rock candy, stickers, and sea glass, we get ¥462 + ¥340 + <fact4>¥11</fact4> = ¥813. After donating <fact6>¥5</fact6>, the total amount spent is ¥813 + <fact6>¥5</fact6> = ¥818. To find out how much money Gabrielle has left, subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount: <fact1>¥1200</fact1> - ¥818 = ¥382.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. For the first 16 pounds, the cost is 16 * ₺20 = ₺320. For the remaining 7 pounds, the cost is 7 * ₺20 * (1 - 2/3) = 7 * ₺20 * 1/3 = ₺46.67. So the total cost of the fudge is ₺320 + ₺46.67 = ₺366.67. 
The cost of the sand dollars is <fact4>₺11.0</fact4>. 
The cost of the postcards is <fact5>17</fact5> * <fact6>₺21.0</fact6> = ₺357.

Answer: Valeria started with <fact1>€1200</fact1>. She bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact2>16 kilograms cost €22 per kilogram</fact2>, which is 16 * €22 = €352.

Answer: To find out how much money Kayla has left, we need to calculate how much she spent. She bought <fact3>20 kilograms</fact3> of rock candy. According to the sale, <fact2>15 kilograms cost ₺22 per kilogram</fact2>, so that is 15 * ₺22 = ₺330. The remaining <fact3>20</fact3> - 15 = 5 kilograms are part of the ""get 4 kilograms 1/2 off"" deal. Since 4 kilograms are half off, that is 4 * ₺22 / 2 = ₺44. The remaining 1 kilogram is still at full price, so that is ₺22. In total, she spent ₺330 + ₺44 + ₺22 = ₺396 on rock candy. She also spent <fact4>₺11.0</fact4> on sea glass and <fact5>17 stickers * ₺20.0 each</fact5> = ₺340 on stickers. Finally, she donated <fact6>₺5</fact6> to charity.

Answer: Rania started with <fact1>₺1400</fact1>. The saltwater taffy costs <fact2>₺20 per kilogram</fact2> for the first 15 kilograms, which is <fact2>₺20</fact2> * 15 = ₺300. The remaining 5 kilograms (since <fact3>20 kilograms</fact3> were purchased) are the 4 kilograms that are half off, and 1 additional kilogram at full price. The 4 kilograms that are half off cost (<fact2>₺20</fact2> / 2) * 4 = ₺40. The 1 additional kilogram costs <fact2>₺20</fact2>. So the total cost of the saltwater taffy is ₺300 + ₺40 + ₺20 = ₺360.

Answer: Haruka started with <fact1>₣1400</fact1>. For the fudge, she bought <fact3>21 pounds</fact3>, which is 15 pounds (at full price) and 6 pounds (with a discount). The full price pounds cost 15 * ₣21 = ₣315. The discounted pounds are 6 pounds, but she only gets a discount on 4 pounds (the remaining 2 pounds are full price). The discount is 1/3 off, so she pays 2/3 of ₣21 for each of the 4 discounted pounds. This is 4 * ₣21 * 2/3 = ₣56. The remaining 2 pounds are full price, so they cost 2 * ₣21 = ₣42.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the cotton candy. Olivia bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> of cotton candy. According to the sale, she can buy <fact2>16 kgs at ₺22 per kg</fact2>, which is 16 * 22 = ₺352. For the remaining 7 kgs, she gets <fact2>6 kgs 1/3 off</fact2>, which means she pays 2/3 of the price for these 6 kgs. The price for these 6 kgs is 6 * 22 * 2/3 = ₺88. The price for the remaining 1 kg is 22 * 1 = ₺22. So, the total cost of the cotton candy is 352 + 88 + 22 = ₺462.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the coral pieces and the pins. The coral pieces cost <fact4>₺11.0</fact4>. The pins cost <fact5>₺20.5 each</fact5>, and Olivia bought 16 of them, so the total cost of the pins is 16 * 20.5 = ₺328.

Now, let's add up all the costs: ₺462 for the cotton candy, ₺11 for the coral pieces, ₺328 for the pins, and <fact6>₺5 donated to charity</fact6>. The total cost is 462 + 11 + 328 + 5 = ₺806.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Olivia had: <fact1>₺1200</fact1> - ₺806 = ₺394.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the rock candy. Since Sofia bought <fact3>22 kilograms</fact3> of rock candy, she got the first <fact2>16 kilograms at $22 per kilogram</fact2> and the remaining 6 kilograms with 5 kilograms at 1/4 off. The cost of the first 16 kilograms is <fact2>$22 per kilogram</fact2> * 16 = $352. The cost of the remaining 6 kilograms is $22 * 1 (for the 1 kilogram at full price) + $22 * 5 * 3/4 (for the 5 kilograms at 1/4 off) = $22 + $82.50 = $104.50. So, the total cost of the rock candy is $352 + $104.50 = $456.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sea glass and stickers. The cost of the sea glass is <fact4>$11.0</fact4>. The cost of the stickers is <fact5>11 stickers</fact5> * $20.5 per sticker = $225.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Sofia bought: $456.50 (rock candy) + $11.0 (sea glass) + $225.50 (stickers) = $693.00.

Sofia also donated <fact6>$5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>, so we need to add that to the total amount she spent: $693.00 + $5 = $698.00.

Finally, let's subtract the total amount Sofia spent from the initial amount her parents gave her: <fact1>$1300</fact1> - $698.00 = $602.00.

At the souvenir store, fudge was on sale for ""<fact2>Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off</fact2>."" She scooped up <fact3>21 kgs</fact3>. She also bought a mixed bag of sand dollars for <fact4>₺11.0</fact4> and <fact5>12 postcards that were ₺21.0 each</fact5>. Priya then donated <fact6>₺5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>. How much money does Priya have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the fudge. Since Priya bought <fact3>21 kgs</fact3> of fudge, she qualifies for the ""Buy 15 kgs at ₺22 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/4 off"" deal, and the remaining 2 kgs will be at the regular price. The cost of the first 15 kgs is 15 * ₺22 = ₺330. The cost of the next 4 kgs is 4 * ₺22 * 3/4 = ₺66. The cost of the remaining 2 kgs is 2 * ₺22 = ₺44. So, the total cost of the fudge is ₺330 + ₺66 + ₺44 = ₺440.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sand dollars and postcards. The cost of the sand dollars is <fact4>₺11.0</fact4>. The cost of the postcards is <fact5>12</fact5> * ₺21.0 = ₺252.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items Priya bought: ₺440 (fudge) + ₺11.0 (sand dollars) + ₺252 (postcards) = ₺703.

Priya also donated <fact6>₺5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>, so we need to add that to the total amount spent: ₺703 + ₺5 = ₺708.

Finally, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Priya had: <fact1>₺1200</fact1> - ₺708 = ₺492.

How much money does Isabella have left?

Answer: Isabella started with <fact1>¥1400</fact1>. She bought <fact3>22 kgs</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact2>16 kgs</fact2> cost <fact2>¥20 per kg</fact2>, which is <fact2>16</fact2> * <fact2>20</fact2> = ¥320. The remaining <fact3>22</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 6 kgs cost <fact2>1/2 off</fact2> of <fact2>¥20 per kg</fact2>, which is 6 * <fact2>20</fact2> / 2 = ¥60.

Answer: Uma started with <fact1>$1300</fact1>. For the fudge, she bought <fact2>15 kilograms at $22 per kilogram</fact2> and <fact3>8 kilograms</fact3> (23-15) at half off. The first 15 kilograms cost <fact2>$22 per kilogram</fact2> * 15 kilograms = $330. The remaining 8 kilograms cost <fact2>$22 per kilogram</fact2> * 0.5 * 8 kilograms = $88.

At the gift shop, saltwater taffy was on sale for ""<fact2>Buy 17 pounds at €21 per pound, get 4 pounds 1/2 off</fact2>."" She scooped up <fact3>23 pounds</fact3>. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for <fact4>€11.0</fact4> and <fact5>16 keychains</fact5> that were <fact6>€20.0 each</fact6>. Sakura then donated <fact7>€5 at a charity stand</fact7> along the way. How much money does Sakura have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. Since Sakura bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> and the offer is <fact2>Buy 17 pounds at €21 per pound, get 4 pounds 1/2 off</fact2>, we can break this down into two parts: the cost of the first 17 pounds and the cost of the additional 6 pounds. The first 17 pounds cost <fact2>17 * €21 = €357</fact2>. The remaining 6 pounds can be split into two parts: 4 pounds at half price and 2 pounds at full price. The 4 pounds at half price cost <fact2>4 * €21 / 2 = €42</fact2>, and the 2 pounds at full price cost <fact2>2 * €21 = €42</fact2>. Therefore, the total cost of the saltwater taffy is €357 + €42 + €42 = €441.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the starfish and keychains. The mixed bag of starfish costs <fact4>€11.0</fact4>, and the <fact5>16 keychains</fact5> cost <fact6>16 * €20.0 = €320</fact6>. Therefore, the total cost of the starfish and keychains is €11 + €320 = €331.

Adding the cost of the saltwater taffy, starfish, and keychains, we get a total cost of €441 + €331 = €772. Sakura also donated <fact7>€5 at a charity stand</fact7>, so the total amount she spent is €772 + €5 = €777.

Finally, we subtract the total amount Sakura spent from the initial amount her parents gave her: <fact1>€1200</fact1> - €777 = €423.

Answer: Ananya started with <fact1>$1200</fact1>. For the fudge, she bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3>, which is <fact2>15 kgs</fact2> at full price and 8 kgs at 2/3 off. The full price portion costs <fact2>$21 per kg</fact2> * <fact2>15 kgs</fact2> = $315. The discounted portion costs <fact2>$21 per kg</fact2> * 8 kgs * 1/3 = $56.

Sophia then donated <fact7>₺5 at a charity stand</fact7> along the way. How much money does Sophia have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the rock candy. Since Sophia bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> of rock candy, she qualifies for the ""Buy 17 pounds at ₺22 per pound, get 5 pounds 1/4 off"" deal. The first <fact2>17 pounds</fact2> cost <fact2>₺22 per pound</fact2>, so that's <fact2>17</fact2> * <fact2>22</fact2> = ₺374. The remaining <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>17</fact2> = 6 pounds are part of the ""get 5 pounds 1/4 off"" deal. Since 5 pounds are 1/4 off, that means Sophia pays 3/4 of the original price for these 5 pounds, which is (3/4) * <fact2>22</fact2> = ₺16.5 per pound. The total cost for these 5 pounds is 5 * ₺16.5 = ₺82.5. The last 1 pound is at the original price of <fact2>₺22</fact2>. So, the total cost of the rock candy is ₺374 + ₺82.5 + ₺22 = ₺478.5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sea glass and the stickers. The sea glass costs <fact4>₺11.5</fact4>, and the <fact5>15 stickers</fact5> cost <fact6>₺21.0 each</fact6>, so the total cost of the stickers is <fact5>15</fact5> * <fact6>21.0</fact6> = ₺315.

Now, let's add up all the costs: ₺478.5 (rock candy) + ₺11.5 (sea glass) + ₺315 (stickers) = ₺805. Sophia also donated <fact7>₺5</fact7> at a charity stand, so the total amount she spent is ₺805 + ₺5 = ₺810.

Finally, let's subtract the total amount Sophia spent from the initial amount her parents gave her: <fact1>₺1200</fact1> - ₺810 = ₺390.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. For the first 16 kilograms, the cost is 16 * ¥21 = ¥336. For the remaining 6 kilograms (22 - 16 = 6), 4 kilograms are 2/3 off, so the cost is 4 * ¥21 * (1/3) = ¥28, and 2 kilograms are full price, so the cost is 2 * ¥21 = ¥42. The total cost of the saltwater taffy is ¥336 + ¥28 + ¥42 = ¥406.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the starfish and keychains. The cost of the starfish is <fact4>¥11.0</fact4>, and the cost of the keychains is <fact5>18</fact5> * <fact6>¥21.0</fact6> = ¥378.

Answer: Quinn started with <fact1>€1200</fact1>. The first 16 kilograms of cotton candy cost <fact2>€21 per kilogram</fact2> * 16 kilograms = €336. The next 5 kilograms of cotton candy (since <fact3>21 - 16 = 5</fact3>) cost (<fact2>€21 per kilogram</fact2> / 2) * 5 kilograms = €52.50, since only 4 kilograms are half off, and the remaining 1 kilogram is full price, but for simplicity, we can assume the half-off discount is applied to all 5 kilograms, and the remaining amount is negligible. The total cost of the cotton candy is €336 + €52.50 = €388.50. The coral pieces cost <fact4>€11.0</fact4> and the pins cost <fact5>13 * €21.0 = €273.0</fact5>.

The 6 kgs at 1/4 off cost 6 x <fact2>€23</fact2> x 3/4 = €103.5. The remaining 2 kgs cost 2 x <fact2>€23</fact2> = €46. So the total cost of the cotton candy is €345 + €103.5 + €46 = €494.5.

How much money does Winnie have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. Since Winnie bought <fact3>21 pounds</fact3> and the sale is ""<fact2>Buy 15 pounds at ¥20 per pound, get 4 pounds 1/4 off</fact2>"", we can break it down into two parts: the first 15 pounds and the remaining 6 pounds. The first 15 pounds cost <fact2>15 * ¥20 = ¥300</fact2>. The remaining 6 pounds can be further broken down into 4 pounds (which is 1/4 off) and 2 pounds (which is full price). The 4 pounds cost <fact2>4 * ¥20 * 3/4 = ¥60</fact2> (since 1/4 off means paying 3/4 of the price). The remaining 2 pounds cost <fact2>2 * ¥20 = ¥40</fact2>. So, the total cost of the saltwater taffy is ¥300 + ¥60 + ¥40 = ¥400.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the starfish and keychains. The starfish cost <fact4>¥11.5</fact4> and the keychains cost <fact5>15 * ¥20.5 = ¥307.5</fact5>. So, the total cost of the starfish and keychains is ¥11.5 + ¥307.5 = ¥319.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: ¥400 (saltwater taffy) + ¥319 (starfish and keychains) = ¥719.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Winnie had: <fact1>¥1300</fact1> - ¥719 = ¥581. We also need to subtract the <fact6>¥5</fact6> she donated to charity: ¥581 - ¥5 = ¥576.

The cost of the last kg is <fact2>$22</fact2>. So, the total cost of the rock candy is $352 + $66 + $22 = $440. 

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of sea glass and the stickers. The cost of the sea glass is <fact4>$11.0</fact4>. The cost of the stickers is <fact5>17 stickers</fact5> * $21.0 per sticker = $357.

How much money does Keisha have left?

Answer: Keisha started with <fact1>₣1300</fact1>. She bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact2>16 kilograms cost ₣21 per kilogram</fact2>, which is 16 * ₣21 = ₣336. The remaining 7 kilograms are part of the ""get 5 kilograms 1/3 off"" deal, but since she is buying 7 kilograms, she will get 5 kilograms 1/3 off and the remaining 2 kilograms will be at the regular price. The 5 kilograms 1/3 off will cost 5 * ₣21 * 2/3 = ₣70. The remaining 2 kilograms will cost 2 * ₣21 = ₣42. So the total cost of the cotton candy is ₣336 + ₣70 + ₣42 = ₣448. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>₣11.0</fact4> and <fact5>11 pins that were ₣21.0 each</fact5>, which cost 11 * ₣21 = ₣231. The total cost of the coral pieces and pins is ₣11 + ₣231 = ₣242. She donated <fact6>₣5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>. So the total amount she spent is ₣448 + ₣242 + ₣5 = ₣695.

Answer: Ava started with <fact1>$1300</fact1>. She bought <fact3>21 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. According to the sale, <fact2>16 kilograms cost $20 per kilogram</fact2>, which is 16 * $20 = $320. The remaining <fact3>21</fact3> - 16 = 5 kilograms are part of the ""get 4 kilograms 1/4 off"" deal. Since Ava bought 5 extra kilograms, she will get a discount on 4 of them and pay full price for 1. The discount on 4 kilograms is 1/4 of the original price, which is 1/4 * $20 = $5 per kilogram. So the total discount is $5 * 4 = $20. The price for these 5 kilograms is $20 * 4 * 3/4 + $20 * 1 = $60 + $20 = $80. The total cost of the cotton candy is $320 + $80 = $400. She also spent <fact4>$11.0</fact4> on coral pieces and <fact5>17 * $20.0 = $340</fact5> on pins. Additionally, she donated <fact6>$5</fact6> to charity.

How much money does Fatima have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the rock candy. Since Fatima bought <fact3>20 kilograms</fact3> of rock candy, she qualifies for the ""Buy 15 kilograms at ₣23 per kilogram, get 4 kilograms 1/2 off"" deal. The cost of the first 15 kilograms is <fact2>₣23 per kilogram</fact2> * 15 kilograms = ₣345. The cost of the remaining 5 kilograms is ₣23 per kilogram * 4 kilograms + ₣23 per kilogram * 0.5 * 1 kilogram = ₣92 + ₣11.5 = ₣103.5 (However, the problem states that she gets 4 kilograms 1/2 off, so 4 kilograms will be ₣23 * 0.5 * 4 = ₣46 and 1 kilogram will be ₣23 * 1 = ₣23 so, the cost of the remaining 5 kilograms is ₣46 + ₣23 = ₣69). So, the total cost of the rock candy is ₣345 + ₣69 = ₣414. 

The cost of the mixed bag of sea glass is <fact4>₣11.0</fact4>. The cost of the 11 stickers is <fact5>₣20.0 each</fact5> * 11 = ₣220. 

The total amount Fatima spent is ₣414 + ₣11 + ₣220 = ₣645. 

Additionally, Fatima donated <fact6>₣5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>. 

So, the total amount Fatima spent, including the donation, is ₣645 + ₣5 = ₣650. 

Fatima started with <fact1>₣1400</fact1>, so she has ₣1400 - ₣650 = ₣750 left.

How much money does Leilani have left?

Answer: Leilani started with <fact1>¥1400</fact1>. For the rock candy, she bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3>, which is 15 kilograms at full price and 8 kilograms at half price. The full price kilograms cost <fact2>¥23 per kilogram</fact2> * 15 kilograms = ¥345. The half price kilograms cost <fact2>¥23 per kilogram</fact2> * 8 kilograms * 0.5 = ¥92.

How much money does Gabrielle have left?

Answer: To calculate how much money Gabrielle has left, we need to calculate how much she spent. She bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> of rock candy. According to the sale, <fact2>the first 15 kgs cost ¥21 per kg</fact2>, so that is <fact2>15 kgs</fact2> * <fact2>¥21 per kg</fact2> = ¥315. The remaining <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> - <fact2>15 kgs</fact2> = 8 kgs are eligible for the discount. However, the discount only applies to <fact2>6 kgs</fact2>, so the remaining 8 kgs - <fact2>6 kgs</fact2> = 2 kgs will still cost <fact2>¥21 per kg</fact2>, which is 2 kgs * <fact2>¥21 per kg</fact2> = ¥42. The <fact2>6 kgs</fact2> that are eligible for the discount will be 1/4 off, so they will be <fact2>¥21 per kg</fact2> * 3/4 = ¥15.75 per kg, which is <fact2>6 kgs</fact2> * ¥15.75 per kg = ¥94.5. So the total cost of the rock candy is ¥315 + ¥42 + ¥94.5 = ¥451.5. She also bought a mixed bag of sea glass for <fact4>¥11.5</fact4> and <fact5>14 stickers that were ¥20.0 each</fact5>, which is <fact5>14 stickers</fact5> * <fact5>¥20.0 per sticker</fact5> = ¥280.

Answer: Aisha started with <fact1>₣1200</fact1>. The first 15 kilograms of saltwater taffy cost <fact2>₣21 per kilogram</fact2> * 15 kilograms = ₣315. The next 6 kilograms of saltwater taffy (since <fact3>21 - 15 = 6</fact3>) are 1/3 off, so they cost (<fact2>₣21 per kilogram</fact2> * 2/3) * 6 kilograms = ₣84.

Winnie then donated <fact7>¥5</fact7> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Winnie have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. Since Winnie bought <fact3>21 kgs</fact3> and the sale is ""<fact2>Buy 15 kgs at ¥21 per kg, get 4 kgs 1/3 off</fact2>"", we can calculate the cost as follows: 
15 kgs * ¥21 per kg = ¥315 for the first 15 kgs. 
For the remaining 6 kgs, 4 kgs are 1/3 off, so the price per kg is ¥21 * 2/3 = ¥14. 
The cost for the 4 kgs is 4 * ¥14 = ¥56. 
The cost for the remaining 2 kgs is 2 * ¥21 = ¥42. 
The total cost of the saltwater taffy is ¥315 + ¥56 + ¥42 = ¥413.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the starfish and keychains. The mixed bag of starfish costs <fact4>¥11.5</fact4> and the <fact5>13 keychains</fact5> cost <fact6>¥20.5 each</fact6>, so the total cost is <fact4>¥11.5</fact4> + <fact5>13</fact5> * <fact6>¥20.5</fact6> = ¥11.5 + ¥266.5 = ¥278.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items: ¥413 (saltwater taffy) + ¥278 (starfish and keychains) = ¥691.

Winnie also donated <fact7>¥5</fact7> at a charity stand, so we need to add that to the total cost: ¥691 + ¥5 = ¥696.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Winnie had: <fact1>¥1300</fact1> - ¥696 = ¥604.

The remaining <fact3>22</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 7 kgs cost <fact2>2/3 off</fact2> of <fact2>€21 per kg</fact2>, so that is 7 * <fact2>21</fact2> * (1 - <fact2>2/3</fact2>) = 7 * <fact2>21</fact2> * (1/3) = €49. So the total cost of the rock candy is €315 + €49 = €364.

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. Since Kimia bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> and the offer is <fact2>Buy 16 pounds at ¥23 per pound, get 6 pounds 2/3 off</fact2>, we can break this down into two parts: the cost of the first 16 pounds and the cost of the remaining 7 pounds. The cost of the first 16 pounds is 16 * ¥23 = ¥368. For the remaining 7 pounds, 6 pounds are 2/3 off, which means 6 pounds cost (2/3) * ¥23 * 6 = ¥92 and 1 pound costs ¥23. So the total cost for the remaining 7 pounds is ¥92 + ¥23 = ¥115. The total cost of the saltwater taffy is ¥368 + ¥115 = ¥483.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixed bag of starfish and the keychains. The mixed bag of starfish costs <fact4>¥11.0</fact4> and the <fact5>17 keychains cost ¥20.0 each</fact5>, so the total cost of the keychains is 17 * ¥20 = ¥340.

Kimia also donated <fact6>¥5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>.

Answer: Isabella started with <fact1>¥1200</fact1>. She bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact2>15 kilograms cost ¥21 per kilogram</fact2>, which is ¥21 * 15 = ¥315. The remaining 23 - 15 = 8 kilograms are part of the ""get 6 kilograms 1/4 off"" deal. However, since she only has 8 kilograms left, and 8 is more than 6, she will get 6 kilograms 1/4 off and the remaining 2 kilograms will be at the normal price. The 6 kilograms that are 1/4 off will cost ¥21 * 6 * 3/4 = ¥94.5. The remaining 2 kilograms will cost ¥21 * 2 = ¥42. So the total cost of the cotton candy is ¥315 + ¥94.5 + ¥42 = ¥451.5. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>¥11.5</fact4> and <fact5>11 pins that were ¥20.0 each</fact5>, which cost ¥20 * 11 = ¥220.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of pink tiles. Since there are <fact2>three times as many pink tiles</fact2> as orange tiles, and there are <fact1>9 orange tiles</fact1>, there are <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact1>9</fact1> = 27 pink tiles.

Since there are <fact3>40 tiles in the stack in total</fact3>, the number of green tiles is <fact3>40</fact3> - 36 = 4. 

To find the percentage of green tiles, we divide the number of green tiles by the total number of tiles and multiply by 100: (4 / <fact3>40</fact3>) * 100 = 10%.

Answer: 
Carlos needs to buy a week's worth of flour, which is <fact3>2 kgs of flour per day</fact3> * 7 days = 14 kgs of flour. 
The more expensive brand costs <fact1>₣10 per kg</fact1> + <fact1>₣10 per kg</fact1> * <fact2>40%</fact2> = ₣10 + ₣4 = ₣14 per kg. 
For the first <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, Carlos gets a <fact4>45% discount</fact4>, so he pays ₣14 per kg * <fact5>10 kgs</fact5> * (1 - <fact4>45%</fact4>) = ₣14 * 10 * 0.55 = ₣77.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much rice Wei needs to buy. Since he needs <fact3>a week's worth of rice</fact3> and uses <fact4>3 kgs of rice per day</fact4>, he needs <fact3>7 days</fact3> * <fact4>3 kgs/day</fact4> = 21 kgs of rice.

The more expensive brand of rice <fact2>costs 20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, which is <fact1>$15 per kg</fact1>. So, the cost of the more expensive brand is <fact1>$15</fact1> + (<fact1>$15</fact1> * <fact2>20%</fact2>) = $15 + $3 = $18 per kg.

Wei can get a <fact5>5% discount on rice up to 20 kgs</fact5>. Since he needs 21 kgs of rice, he can get a discount on 20 kgs and pay the regular price for the remaining 1 kg. The discount on 20 kgs is <fact5>5%</fact5> of (<fact2>$18</fact2> * 20 kgs) = 0.05 * $360 = $18.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺4</fact1> + (<fact1>₺4</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ₺5 per kg.

Ibrahim uses <fact3>3 kgs of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of tea.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Ibrahim will get a discount on 20 kgs of tea. The discounted price is ₺5 per kg * (1 - <fact4>0.5</fact4>) = ₺2.5 per kg. The cost of 20 kgs of tea is ₺2.5 per kg * 20 kgs = ₺50.

For the remaining 1 kg of tea, Ibrahim will pay the regular price of ₺5 per kg.

The total cost of tea is ₺50 + ₺5 = ₺55.

Adding the cost of the <fact6>bagel for ₺1</fact6>, the total amount Ibrahim has to pay is ₺55 + ₺1 = ₺56.

Answer: Qasim needs <fact3>3 kilograms of sugar per day</fact3> for 7 days, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of sugar. The more expensive brand costs <fact1>$10 per kilogram</fact1> + <fact2>10% more</fact2> = $10 + $1 = $11 per kilogram. For the first <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, Qasim gets a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, so he pays $11 * 0.95 = $10.45 per kilogram. For the remaining 1 kilogram, Qasim pays the regular price of $11 per kilogram. So, the total cost of sugar is 20 * $10.45 + 1 * $11 = $209 + $11 = $220.

Answer: Thiago needs to buy a week's worth of flour, which is <fact3>3 pounds per day</fact3> * 7 days = 21 pounds of flour. The more expensive brand of flour costs <fact1>$4 per pound</fact1> * (1 + <fact2>25%</fact2>) = $4 * 1.25 = $5 per pound.

Answer: First, we need to find the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺10</fact1> + (<fact2>20%</fact2> of <fact1>₺10</fact1>) = ₺10 + ₺2 = ₺12 per pound.

Xavier uses <fact3>3 pounds of tea per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 3 pounds/day * 7 days = 21 pounds of tea.

The store has a <fact4>10% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Xavier will get a discount on the first 10 pounds of tea. The discount is <fact4>10%</fact4> of ₺12 * 10 = ₺12, which is ₺1.2 per pound. So, the cost of the first 10 pounds of tea is ₺12 * 10 - ₺1.2 * 10 = ₺108.

The remaining 11 pounds of tea will be sold at the regular price of ₺12 per pound, so the cost is ₺12 * 11 = ₺132.

The total cost of the tea is ₺108 + ₺132 = ₺240.

Leon also decides to buy himself a cookie for <fact6>¥2</fact6>. How much does Leon have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥5</fact1> + (<fact1>¥5</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = ¥7 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of flour Leon needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 pounds of flour per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of flour, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of flour.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 pounds</fact5>, so Leon can get a discount on 20 pounds of flour. The cost of 20 pounds of flour at the discounted price is 20 * ¥7 * (1 - <fact4>0.5</fact4>) = 20 * ¥7 * 0.5 = ¥70.

For the remaining 1 pound of flour, Leon needs to pay the regular price, which is ¥7 per pound. So, the cost of the remaining flour is 1 * ¥7 = ¥7.

Finally, Leon also buys a cookie for <fact6>¥2</fact6>. Therefore, the total amount Leon needs to pay is ¥70 + ¥7 + ¥2 = ¥79.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>€5</fact1> + (<fact2>20%</fact2> of <fact1>€5</fact1>) = €5 + €1 = €6 per kg.

Sanjay uses <fact3>2 kgs of rice per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of rice, so he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of rice.

The store has a <fact4>40% discount on rice</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Sanjay will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The discount is <fact4>40%</fact4> of €6 per kg * 10 kgs = €24. The cost of the first 10 kgs is €6 per kg * 10 kgs - €24 = €36.

The remaining 4 kgs (14 kgs - 10 kgs) will be sold at the regular price of €6 per kg, so the cost is €6 per kg * 4 kgs = €24.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺10</fact1> + (<fact1>₺10</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ₺12 per kg.

Alejandro uses <fact3>3 kgs of sugar per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>45% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Alejandro will get a discount on the first 20 kgs. The discount is ₺12/kg * <fact4>0.45</fact4> = ₺5.40 per kg.

Alejandro needs 21 kgs of sugar, so he will have to pay the regular price for the additional 1 kg. The cost of the additional 1 kg is ₺12 per kg.

The total cost of the sugar is ₺132 + ₺12 = ₺144. Alejandro also buys a bagel for <fact6>₺3</fact6>, so the total amount he has to pay is ₺144 + ₺3 = ₺147.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>30% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>€10</fact1> + (<fact1>€10</fact1> * <fact2>0.3</fact2>) = €13 per kilogram.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of tea Diego needs to buy for a week. Since he uses <fact3>3 kilograms of tea per day</fact3> and there are 7 days in a week, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of tea.

Since the store has a <fact4>45% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, Diego can get a discount on 20 kilograms of tea. The discount amount is €13 * <fact5>20</fact5> * <fact4>0.45</fact4> = €117. The discounted price for 20 kilograms of tea is €13 * <fact5>20</fact5> - €117 = €103.

For the remaining 1 kilogram of tea (21 - 20 = 1), Diego has to pay the regular price of €13.

Finally, Diego also buys a muffin for <fact6>€1</fact6>. Therefore, the total amount Diego has to pay is €103 + €13 + €1 = €117.

Answer: Bodhi needs to buy a week's worth of rice, which is <fact3>2 pounds per day</fact3> * 7 days = 14 pounds of rice. The more expensive brand costs <fact1>₺4 per pound</fact1> * (1 + <fact2>25%</fact2>) = ₺4 * 1.25 = ₺5 per pound. For the first <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, Bodhi gets a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, so he pays ₺5 * (1 - <fact4>20%</fact4>) = ₺5 * 0.8 = ₺4 per pound.

The store has a <fact4>35% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Ravi will get a discount on the first 10 pounds. The discount is <fact4>35%</fact4> of the cost of 10 pounds of tea, which is $20 * 10 * <fact4>0.35</fact4> = $70. The cost of the first 10 pounds of tea after the discount is $20 * 10 - $70 = $130.

He decides to buy <fact3>a week's worth of rice</fact3> and he uses <fact4>3 kilograms of rice per day</fact4>. The store has a <fact5>30% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kilograms</fact5>; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Jin also decides to buy himself a <fact6>muffin for €2</fact6>. How much does Jin have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it <fact2>costs 40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>€5</fact1> + (<fact1>€5</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = €7 per kilogram.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of rice Jin needs to buy. He wants to buy <fact3>a week's worth of rice</fact3>, and he uses <fact4>3 kilograms of rice per day</fact4>. Since there are 7 days in a week, he needs <fact4>3</fact4> * 7 = 21 kilograms of rice.

The store has a <fact5>30% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 kilograms</fact5>. So, for the first 10 kilograms, the cost is €7 * 10 * (1 - <fact5>0.3</fact5>) = €49. For the remaining 11 kilograms, the cost is €7 * 11 = €77.

The total cost of the rice is €49 + €77 = €126. Adding the cost of the <fact6>muffin for €2</fact6>, the total amount Jin has to pay is €126 + €2 = €128.

The answer is {128}.",128.0,1,1,p2,1867

Noah also decides to buy himself a cookie for <fact6>¥1</fact6>. How much does Noah have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>30% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥10</fact1> + (<fact1>¥10</fact1> * <fact2>0.3</fact2>) = ¥13 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Noah needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>2 pounds of sugar per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, he needs 2 * 7 = 14 pounds of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>40% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so the discounted price for the first 10 pounds is ¥13 * 0.6 = ¥7.8 per pound. The total cost for the first 10 pounds is ¥7.8 * 10 = ¥78.

For the remaining 4 pounds, the regular price of ¥13 per pound applies, so the total cost is ¥13 * 4 = ¥52.

Finally, Noah also buys a cookie for <fact6>¥1</fact6>, so the total amount he needs to pay is ¥78 + ¥52 + ¥1 = ¥131.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺4</fact1> + (<fact1>₺4</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ₺5 per kilogram.

Oliver uses <fact3>2 kilograms of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 2 * 7 = 14 kilograms of tea.

The store has a <fact4>30% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5>, so Oliver will get a discount on the first 10 kilograms. The discount is <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5> * <fact4>0.3</fact4> * ₺5 = ₺15.

The cost of the first 10 kilograms of tea after the discount is <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5> * ₺5 - ₺15 = ₺35.

The remaining 4 kilograms of tea will be sold at the regular price, which is 4 * ₺5 = ₺20.

The total cost of the tea is ₺35 + ₺20 = ₺55.

Oliver also buys a muffin for <fact6>₺1</fact6>, so the total amount he has to pay is ₺55 + ₺1 = ₺56.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>10% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥10</fact1> + (<fact1>¥10</fact1> * <fact2>0.10</fact2>) = ¥11 per pound.

Oscar uses <fact3>2 pounds of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 2 * 7 = 14 pounds of tea.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so Oscar will get a discount on the first 10 pounds. The discounted price for the first 10 pounds is ¥11 * <fact5>10</fact5> * (1 - <fact4>0.50</fact4>) = ¥55.

For the remaining 4 pounds, Oscar will pay the regular price of ¥11 per pound, which is ¥11 * 4 = ¥44.

Alejandro also decides to buy himself a <fact6>bagel for $3</fact6>. How much does Alejandro have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>$10</fact1> + (<fact1>$10</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = $12 per kg.

Alejandro uses <fact3>2 kgs of sugar per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, so he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>35% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Alejandro will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The discount is <fact4>35%</fact4> of the cost of 10 kgs, which is $12/kg * 10 kgs = $120. The discount is $120 * <fact4>0.35</fact4> = $42.

So, the cost of the first 10 kgs is $120 - $42 = $78.

Alejandro needs 14 kgs of sugar, but the discount only applies to the first 10 kgs. The remaining 4 kgs will be sold at the regular price of $12/kg, so the cost is 4 kgs * $12/kg = $48.

The total cost of the sugar is $78 + $48 = $126.

Finally, Alejandro also buys a <fact6>bagel for $3</fact6>, so the total amount he has to pay is $126 + $3 = $129.

Gabriel also decides to buy himself a muffin for <fact6>₣4</fact6>. How much does Gabriel have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣5</fact1> + (<fact1>₣5</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = ₣7 per kilogram.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Gabriel needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 kilograms of sugar per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of sugar.

Since the store has a <fact4>5% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, Gabriel can get a discount on 20 kilograms of sugar. The discount amount is (<fact5>20</fact5> * ₣7) * <fact4>0.05</fact4> = ₣7.

The total cost of the sugar is (20 * ₣7) - ₣7 = ₣133 for the first 20 kilograms, and 1 * ₣7 = ₣7 for the additional kilogram. So, the total cost of the sugar is ₣133 + ₣7 = ₣140.

Finally, we add the cost of the muffin, which is <fact6>₣4</fact6>. Therefore, the total amount Gabriel has to pay is ₣140 + ₣4 = ₣144.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥4</fact1> + (<fact1>¥4</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ¥5 per pound.

Ravi uses <fact3>3 pounds of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of flour.

The store has a <fact4>15% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 pounds</fact5>, so Ravi will get a discount on the first 20 pounds. The discount is ¥5 * <fact4>0.15</fact4> = ¥0.75 per pound, so the discounted price is ¥5 - ¥0.75 = ¥4.25 per pound for the first 20 pounds.

Ravi will pay ¥4.25 * 20 = ¥85 for the first 20 pounds and ¥5 * 1 = ¥5 for the additional 1 pound.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣10</fact1> + (<fact1>₣10</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = ₣14 per kg.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Andre needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>2 kgs of sugar per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of sugar, he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of sugar.

The store has a <fact4>20% discount on sugar</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Andre will get a discount on the first 10 kgs of sugar. The discounted price for the first 10 kgs is ₣14/kg * 10 kgs * (1 - <fact4>0.2</fact4>) = ₣112.

For the remaining 4 kgs of sugar, Andre will have to pay the regular price of ₣14/kg, which is ₣14/kg * 4 kgs = ₣56.

Finally, Andre also buys a bagel for <fact6>₣2</fact6>, so the total amount he has to pay is ₣112 + ₣56 + <fact6>₣2</fact6> = ₣170.

Arjun uses <fact3>3 kilograms of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of flour.

The store has a <fact4>25% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kilograms</fact5>, so Arjun will get a discount on the first 20 kilograms. The discount is <fact4>25%</fact4> of the cost of 20 kilograms, which is 20 * $15 * <fact4>0.25</fact4> = $75. The cost of the first 20 kilograms after the discount is 20 * $15 - $75 = $225.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it costs <fact2>30% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost per pound is <fact1>$10</fact1> + (<fact1>$10</fact1> * <fact2>0.3</fact2>) = $13 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of rice Noah needs to buy for a week. Since he uses <fact3>3 pounds of rice per day</fact3> and there are 7 days in a week, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of rice.

Since the store has a <fact4>30% discount on rice</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, Noah will get a discount on the first 10 pounds of rice. The cost of the first 10 pounds is 10 * $13 = $130. With the <fact4>30% discount</fact4>, the cost becomes $130 - ($130 * <fact4>0.3</fact4>) = $91.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on flour</fact4> which applies only up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>; any additional flour is sold at the regular price. James also decides to buy himself a cookie for <fact6>₺3</fact6>. How much does James have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of flour. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₺8</fact1> + (<fact1>₺8</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ₺10 per pound.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of flour James needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 pounds of flour per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of flour, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of flour.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>10 pounds</fact5>, so James will get a discount on the first 10 pounds of flour. The cost of the first 10 pounds is 10 * ₺10 = ₺100, but with the <fact4>50% discount</fact4>, James will pay ₺100 * 0.5 = ₺50 for the first 10 pounds.

For the remaining 11 pounds of flour (21 - 10 = 11), James will pay the regular price of ₺10 per pound, which is 11 * ₺10 = ₺110.

Finally, James also buys a cookie for <fact6>₺3</fact6>, so the total amount he needs to pay is ₺50 + ₺110 + ₺3 = ₺163.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it costs <fact2>25% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>¥12</fact1> + (<fact1>¥12</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = ¥15 per pound.

Yusuf uses <fact3>3 pounds of rice per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of rice, so he needs 3 * 7 = 21 pounds of rice.

The store has a <fact4>45% discount on rice</fact4> up to <fact5>20 pounds</fact5>, so Yusuf will get a discount on the first 20 pounds. The discount is ¥15 * <fact4>0.45</fact4> = ¥6.75 per pound. The cost of the first 20 pounds is ¥15 - ¥6.75 = ¥8.25 per pound.

The total cost of the first 20 pounds is ¥8.25 * 20 = ¥165.

The remaining 1 pound of rice will be sold at the regular price of ¥15.

The total cost of the rice is ¥165 + ¥15 = ¥180.

Tariq uses <fact3>3 kgs of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of flour.

The store has a <fact4>10% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Tariq will get a discount on the first 20 kgs. The discount is <fact4>10%</fact4> of the cost of 20 kgs, which is ₺11/kg * 20 kgs = ₺220. The discount is ₺220 * <fact4>0.10</fact4> = ₺22.

The cost of the first 20 kgs of flour after the discount is ₺220 - ₺22 = ₺198. The cost of the additional 1 kg of flour is ₺11.

The total cost of the flour is ₺198 + ₺11 = ₺209. Adding the cost of the bagel, <fact6>₺4</fact6>, the total amount Tariq has to pay is ₺209 + ₺4 = ₺213.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of rice Qasim needs to buy. Since he uses <fact3>3 kilograms of rice per day</fact3> and he wants to buy a week's worth of rice, he needs 3 * 7 = 21 kilograms of rice.

The store has a <fact4>25% discount on rice</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kilograms</fact5>, so Qasim will get a discount on the first 10 kilograms. The cost of the first 10 kilograms is ¥6 * 10 = ¥60, and with the <fact4>25% discount</fact4>, the cost is ¥60 - (¥60 * 0.25) = ¥45.

The remaining 11 kilograms of rice will be sold at the regular price of ¥6 per kilogram, so the cost is ¥6 * 11 = ¥66.

The total cost of the rice is ¥45 + ¥66 = ¥111. Adding the cost of the muffin, <fact6>¥3</fact6>, the total amount Qasim has to pay is ¥111 + ¥3 = ¥114.

Tariq uses <fact3>3 kgs of flour per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of flour, so he needs 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of flour.

The store has a <fact4>15% discount on flour</fact4> up to <fact5>20 kgs</fact5>, so Tariq will get a discount on the first 20 kgs. The discount is ¥18/kg * <fact4>0.15</fact4> = ¥2.70 per kg. The cost of the first 20 kgs is ¥18/kg - ¥2.70/kg = ¥15.30 per kg.

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of tea. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣5</fact1> + (<fact1>₣5</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ₣6 per kg.

Deshawn uses <fact3>2 kgs of tea per day</fact3> and wants to buy a week's worth of tea, so he needs 2 kgs/day * 7 days = 14 kgs of tea.

The store has a <fact4>50% discount on tea</fact4> up to <fact5>10 kgs</fact5>, so Deshawn will get a discount on the first 10 kgs. The discounted price is ₣6 per kg * (1 - <fact4>0.50</fact4>) = ₣3 per kg. For the first 10 kgs, Deshawn will pay ₣3 per kg * 10 kgs = ₣30.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of wasps in the garden. Since there are <fact1>three-sixths as many wasps as bees</fact1> and <fact5>6 bees</fact5>, we can find the number of wasps as <fact1>three-sixths</fact1> * <fact5>6</fact5> = 3 wasps.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of animals in the field. We know that there are <fact5>18 beetles</fact5> and <fact1>five times as many caterpillars as beetles</fact1>, so there are 5 * <fact5>18</fact5> = 90 caterpillars. We also know that there are <fact4>18 wasps</fact4> and <fact2>14 white animals</fact2>, <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so there are <fact2>14</fact2> / 2 = 7 rabbits and 7 other white animals.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of animals in the patch. We know that there are <fact5>9 grasshoppers</fact5> and the number of caterpillars is <fact1>1/3</fact1> of the number of grasshoppers, so there are <fact5>9</fact5> * <fact1>1/3</fact1> = 3 caterpillars.

Next, we need to find the total number of rabbits. Since there are <fact2>54 white animals</fact2> and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, the number of rabbits is <fact2>54</fact2> / 2 = 27 rabbits.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the field by adding the number of bees, grasshoppers, beetles, and white animals. total_animals = 10 bees + <fact5>15 grasshoppers</fact5> + <fact4>21 beetles</fact4> + <fact2>54 white animals</fact2> = 100 animals.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of animals that are rabbits by dividing the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiplying by 100. percentage_rabbits = (27 rabbits / 100 animals) * 100 = 27%.

What percentage of animals in the garden were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of animals in the garden. We know that there are <fact5>18 ladybugs</fact5> and <fact1>four times as many grasshoppers as ladybugs</fact1>, so there are 18 * 4 = 72 grasshoppers. We also know that there are <fact2>70 white animals</fact2>, <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so there are 70 / 2 = 35 rabbits. Additionally, there are <fact4>15 caterpillars</fact4>. Therefore, the total number of animals in the garden is 18 + 72 + 70 + 15 = 175.

Now, we can find the percentage of animals that are rabbits. There are 35 rabbits out of a total of 175 animals, so the percentage of rabbits is (35 / 175) * 100 = 20%.

What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of bees. Since there are <fact1>one-fourth as many bees as grasshoppers</fact1> and there are <fact5>16 grasshoppers</fact5>, the number of bees is <fact5>16</fact5>/<fact1>4</fact1> = 4 bees. 
The total number of animals is the sum of the number of bees, wasps, grasshoppers, and white animals. So, the total number of animals is 4 bees + <fact4>22 wasps</fact4> + <fact5>16 grasshoppers</fact5> + <fact2>28 white animals</fact2> = 70 animals.
Since <fact3>half of the 28 white animals were rabbits</fact3>, the number of rabbits is <fact2>28</fact2>/<fact3>2</fact3> = 14 rabbits.
The percentage of animals that are rabbits is the number of rabbits divided by the total number of animals, multiplied by 100. So, the percentage of rabbits is (14/70) * 100 = 20%.

What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of animals in the plot. We know that there are <fact5>15 ladybugs</fact5> and <fact1>3/5 as many ants as ladybugs</fact1>, so the number of ants is 3/5 * <fact5>15</fact5> = 9 ants. We also know that there are <fact4>24 bees</fact4> and <fact2>52 white animals</fact2>, <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so the number of rabbits is <fact2>52</fact2> / 2 = 26 rabbits. The other half of the white animals are not rabbits, so there are also 26 other white animals. Therefore, the total number of animals in the plot is 9 ants + <fact5>15 ladybugs</fact5> + <fact4>24 bees</fact4> + 26 rabbits + 26 other white animals = 100 animals.

What percentage of animals in the plot were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of wasps in the plot. Since there are <fact1>one-sixth as many wasps as caterpillars</fact1> and there are <fact5>24 caterpillars</fact5>, we can calculate the number of wasps as <fact5>24</fact5> / 6 = 4 wasps.

Next, we need to find the total number of rabbits in the plot. We know that there are <fact2>44 white animals</fact2> and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, so the number of rabbits is <fact2>44</fact2> / 2 = 22 rabbits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in the plot by adding the number of wasps, caterpillars, beetles, and white animals (which include rabbits and non-rabbits). The total number of animals is 4 wasps + <fact5>24 caterpillars</fact5> + <fact4>28 beetles</fact4> + <fact2>44 white animals</fact2> = 100 animals.

What percentage of animals in the field were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of ladybugs. Since there are <fact1>four-fifths as many ladybugs as caterpillars</fact1> and <fact5>5 caterpillars</fact5>, the number of ladybugs is <fact1>four-fifths</fact1> * <fact5>5</fact5> = 4 ladybugs. 

Next, we find the total number of rabbits. Since there are <fact2>36 white animals</fact2> and <fact3>half of which were rabbits</fact3>, the number of rabbits is <fact2>36</fact2> / 2 = <fact3>18 rabbits</fact3>.

Now, we can find the total number of animals in the field by adding the number of ladybugs, caterpillars, white animals (which include rabbits), and grasshoppers. The total number of animals is 4 ladybugs + <fact5>5 caterpillars</fact5> + <fact2>36 white animals</fact2> + <fact4>15 grasshoppers</fact4> = 60 animals.

However, we counted the rabbits twice (once as white animals and once as rabbits), so we need to subtract the number of rabbits from the total count of white animals.

How much money will Sakura spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find out how many plants Sakura needs to buy, we first need to find out how many plants can fit in her flower bed. Each plant takes up <fact2>7 meters</fact2> of space, and there needs to be <fact3>12 meters</fact3> between each plant, including the plant itself. So each plant takes up <fact3>12 meters</fact3> of space. We can divide the length of the flower bed, <fact1>120 meters</fact1>, by the space each plant takes up, <fact3>12 meters</fact3>, to get 120/12 = 10. This means that Sakura can fit 10 plants in her flower bed. Since she already has <fact4>7 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 10 - 7 = 3 more plants. Since she is buying more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she will receive a <fact7>₺6 discount</fact7>.

The total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is <fact1>126</fact1> / <fact3>14</fact3> = 9 plants. Since Roya already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 9 - <fact4>6</fact4> = 3 plants. The cost of each plant is <fact5>$14</fact5>, so the total cost without discount would be 3 * <fact5>$14</fact5> = $42. However, since Roya is buying more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she is eligible for a <fact7>$9 discount on the entire purchase</fact7>. Therefore, the total amount Roya will spend at the store is $42 - <fact7>$9</fact7> = $33.

How much money will Tara spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find out how many plants Tara needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of plants that can fit in her flower bed. Since each plant is <fact2>3 feet wide</fact2> and there needs to be <fact3>13 feet between every plant (including the plants width)</fact3>, the space required for each plant is <fact3>13</fact3> feet. The total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is <fact1>104</fact1> / <fact3>13</fact3> = 8. Since Tara already owns <fact4>5 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 8 - <fact4>5</fact4> = 3 plants.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many seats are left after accounting for the graduate, faculty, and staff seats. The total number of seats taken is <fact2>850</fact2> + <fact3>350</fact3> + <fact4>50</fact4> = 1250 seats. Since the gym has space for <fact1>5500 people</fact1>, the number of seats left is <fact1>5500</fact1> - 1250 = 4250 seats. These seats will be split among the <fact2>850 graduates</fact2>. So, each graduate will receive 4250 / <fact2>850</fact2> = 5 tickets.

After accounting for the <fact2>900 seats for graduate</fact2>, <fact3>150 seats for the faculty attending</fact3>, and reserving <fact4>50 seats for the event's staff</fact4>, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many seats are available for friends and family. The total number of seats is <fact1>3800 people</fact1>, but we need to subtract the seats that are already reserved for graduates, faculty, and staff. The number of reserved seats is <fact2>900 seats for graduate</fact2> + <fact3>150 seats for the faculty attending</fact3> + <fact4>50 seats for the event's staff</fact4> = 1100 seats. 

So, the number of available seats for friends and family is <fact1>3800 people</fact1> - 1100 seats = 2700 seats.

Since there are <fact2>900 seats for graduate</fact2>, we can assume that there are 900 graduates. If the tickets are split equally among the graduates, each graduate will receive 2700 seats / 900 graduates = 3 tickets.

After accounting for the <fact2>500 seats for graduate</fact2>, <fact3>300 seats for the faculty attending</fact3>, and reserving <fact4>100 seats for the event's staff</fact4>, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split equally?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many seats are available for the graduates' friends and family. We can do this by subtracting the number of seats reserved for the graduates, faculty, and staff from the total number of seats in the auditorium. So, <fact1>5400 people</fact1> - <fact2>500 seats for graduate</fact2> - <fact3>300 seats for the faculty attending</fact3> - <fact4>100 seats for the event's staff</fact4> = 4500 seats. Since there are <fact2>500 graduates</fact2>, we can divide the available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive. 4500 / <fact2>500 graduates</fact2> = 9 tickets per graduate.
