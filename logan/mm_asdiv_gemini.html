Therefore, 1(x+y) = <B1>70</B1></span>, which simplifies to x + y = 70. Now we have two equations: x - y = 10 and x + y = 70. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 40 and y = 30.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> The cost of one full and one half ticket is <span class="E" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">$327</span>. One full ticket with reservation costs <span class="C" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">$216</span>.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Let the speed of the train be x km/hr and the speed of the bus be y km/hr.

From <span class="C" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">Scenario 1</span>, we know that:
Time taken by train + Time taken by bus = Total time
<span class="E" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">60</span>/x + <span class="F" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">240</span>/y = <span class="G" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">4</span> ...(1)

From <span class="D" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Scenario 2</span>, we know that:
Time taken by train + Time taken by bus = Total time
<span class="H" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">100</span>/x + <span class="I" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">200</span>/y = <span class="J" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">4 + 10/60</span> 
<span class="H" style="background-color: lightpink; font-weight: bold;">100</span>/x + <span class="I" style="background-color: lightsalmon; font-weight: bold;">200</span>/y = <span class="J" style="background-color: lightgray; font-weight: bold;">25/6</span> ...(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2), we get:
x = 60, y = 80

Therefore, the speed of the train is 60 km/hr and the speed of the bus is 80 km/hr.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>Train: 60 km/hr Bus: 80 km/hr</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> ['60', '80']</div></div>
<div class='container'><div class='question'><strong>Question:</strong> A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.</div><p>No diagram available.</p><div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> Let the original speed of the train be <span class="B" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">x</span> km/hr and the original time taken be <span class="C" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">y</span> hours. We know that distance = speed * time, so the distance covered by the train is <span class="D" style="background-color: lightcyan; font-weight: bold;">xy</span> km. 

Scenario 1: If the train was 6 km/hr faster (<span class="B1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">x+6</span>), it would take 8 hours less (<span class="C" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">y-8</span>) to cover the same distance. 

Scenario 2: If the train was 6 km/hr slower (<span class="B2" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">x-6</span>), it would take 12 hours more (<span class="C" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">y+12</span>) to cover the same distance. 

We can set up equations based on these scenarios, but solving for distance directly would be complex. This type of problem requires setting up multiple equations and solving for unknowns (speed and time) to ultimately determine the distance.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> There are <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">400 panes</span> to be washed. Each pane costs <span class="F1" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">$0.60</span> to wash so Chloe will earn <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">400</span>*<span class="F1" style="background-color: lightcoral; font-weight: bold;">0.60</span> = $240. Each pane is <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">2.5</span> * <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">2.5</span> = 6.25 square feet. This means that Todd will be paying <span class="E1" style="background-color: lightgreen; font-weight: bold;">0.10</span> * 6.25 = $0.625 per pane if he chooses to pay by the square foot.  Because Todd would be paying <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">400</span> * 0.625 = $250, he saves 250-240 = $10.

<div class='answer-reasoning'><strong>Answer Reasoning:</strong> To find the smallest number of ducks, we need to find the least common multiple of the flock sizes. The least common multiple of <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">13</span> and <span class="C1" style="background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">17</span> is 221. This means Morris observed 221/13 = 17 flocks of ducks. Therefore, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is 17 * <span class="B1" style="background-color: lightyellow; font-weight: bold;">13</span> = 221.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: green;'>221</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 221</div></div>

The equilateral triangle has 3 sides each measuring <B1a>42 ft</B1a>. The rectangle has a length of <B2b>76 ft</B2b>.  Since the rectangle is attached to the triangle, one of the widths of the rectangle is common with one of the sides of the triangle and hence the width of the rectangle is <B2a>42 ft</B2a>.  The other width of the rectangle also measures <B2a>42 ft</B2a>. Therefore the perimeter of the field = (3 * <B1a>42</B1a>) + <B2b>76</B2b> + <B2a>42</B2a> + <B2a>42</B2a> = 334 ft.</div><div class='final-answer'><strong>Final Answer:</strong> <span style='font-size:1.1em; color: red;'>334</span></div><div class='ground-truth-answer'><strong>Ground Truth Answer:</strong> 90</div></div>
