6,Jamal is rolling a d12 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 6 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Jamal is rolling a <fact1>d12 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 6 than that he rolls <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 6 on a <fact1>d12 die</fact1>, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. There are 6 numbers greater than 6 on a <fact1>d12 die</fact1> (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), so the probability is 6/12 = 1/2.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>, we need to calculate the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll and then raise it to the power of 4, since the rolls are independent. There are 6 odd numbers on a <fact1>d12 die</fact1> (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), so the probability of rolling an odd number is 6/12 = 1/2. The probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2> is therefore (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage. The probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 1/16. The difference is 1/2 - 1/16 = 7/16. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: (7/16) * 100 = 43.75%.

The answer is {43.75}.",43.75
7,Viktor is rolling a 4-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Viktor is rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are <fact1>4 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Three of these outcomes are greater than 1, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 3/4 or 0.75. 

To roll <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>, Viktor must roll either 1 or 3 four times in a row. The probability of rolling an odd number on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1> is 2/4 or 0.5, so the probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2> is (0.5)^4 = 0.0625.

The difference between these two probabilities is 0.75 - 0.0625 = 0.6875. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.6875 * 100% = 68.75%.

The answer is {68.75}.",68.75
8,Wei is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Wei is rolling a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls <fact2>four even numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number is 10/20 = 0.5, so the probability of rolling <fact2>four even numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5^4 = 0.0625. The difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.4375 * 100% = 43.75%.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>4 potted plants from each ledge</fact4> to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Nia remain with?

Answer: Nia already had <fact2>12 potted plants on each of the 64 window ledges</fact2>, so she had <fact2>12</fact2> * 64 = 768 potted plants. She received <fact1>44 new potted plants</fact1> and purchased <fact3>160 new plants</fact3> at a 50% discount, which means she got 160 * 0.5 = 80 more plants, so in total, she got 44 + 80 = 124 new plants. This brings her total to 768 + 124 = 892 potted plants. She will give away <fact4>4 potted plants from each ledge</fact4>, so she will give away <fact4>4</fact4> * 64 = 256 potted plants. Therefore, Nia will remain with 892 - 256 = 636 potted plants.

Answer: Aisha already had <fact2>8 potted plants on each of the 61 window ledges</fact2>, so she had <fact2>8</fact2> * 61 = 488 potted plants. She received <fact1>43 new potted plants</fact1> and purchased <fact3>200 new plants</fact3> at a 50% discount, which means she got 200 * 0.5 = 100 more plants, so in total, she got 100 + <fact1>43</fact1> = 143 new plants. This brings her total to 488 + 143 = 631 plants. She will give away <fact4>7 potted plants from each ledge</fact4>, so she will give away <fact4>7</fact4> * 61 = 427 plants.

If the brownie cost ₺9 and the grape pie cost ₺28, how much was Santiago's average daily earning?","Reformatted Question: Santiago is selling brownies and grape pies for a fundraiser. On Sunday, he sold <fact1>24 boxes of brownie</fact1> and <fact2>16 fewer boxes of grape pie, than on Monday</fact2>. On Monday, he sold <fact3>11 more boxes of brownies than on Sunday</fact3> and <fact4>26 boxes of grape pie</fact4>.

If the <fact6>brownie cost ₺9</fact6> and the <fact7>grape pie cost ₺28</fact7>, how much was Santiago's average daily earning?

Answer: On Sunday, Santiago sold <fact1>24 boxes of brownie</fact1> and <fact4>26</fact4> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 10 boxes of grape pie. So, on Sunday, he earned (<fact1>24</fact1> * <fact6>₺9</fact6>) + (10 * <fact7>₺28</fact7>) = ₺216 + ₺280 = ₺496.
On Monday, he sold <fact1>24</fact1> + <fact3>11</fact3> = 35 boxes of brownie and <fact4>26 boxes of grape pie</fact4>. So, on Monday, he earned (35 * <fact6>₺9</fact6>) + (<fact4>26</fact4> * <fact7>₺28</fact7>) = ₺315 + ₺728 = ₺1043.

If the <fact6>muffin cost ₣10</fact6> and the <fact7>pear pie cost ₣30</fact7>, how much was Jamal's average daily earning?

Answer: On Wednesday, Jamal sold <fact1>21 boxes of muffins</fact1> and <fact4>23</fact4> - <fact2>19</fact2> = 4 boxes of pear pie. On Thursday, he sold <fact1>21</fact1> + <fact3>12</fact3> = 33 boxes of muffins and <fact4>23 boxes of pear pie</fact4>. On Friday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, which is (21 + 4) + (33 + 23) = 81 boxes. This means he sold (21 + 33 + 81)/3 = 45 boxes of muffins and (4 + 23 + 27)/3 = 18 boxes of pear pie per day on average. His average daily earning is 45 * <fact6>₣10</fact6> + 18 * <fact7>₣30</fact7> = ₣450 + ₣540 = ₣990.
However, the question asks for average daily earnings, so we need to divide by 3. ₣990/3 = ₣330.

53,"Isabella walks 20 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 miles of walking on the beach and 10 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Isabella walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Isabella's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Isabella walks <fact1>20 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>10 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>10 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Isabella walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Isabella's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Isabella's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> originally before the injury, but her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so she would walk <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in 2 * <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 120 minutes originally. Thus, her original speed on the beach is <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / 120 minutes = 1/12 miles per minute. 

Her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach, so it is 3 * 1/12 miles per minute = 1/4 miles per minute.

However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>, so her current speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/12 miles per minute = 1/24 miles per minute, and her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 1/4 miles per minute = 1/8 miles per minute.

The time it takes for her to walk <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach is <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / (1/24 miles per minute) = 240 minutes, but we already know that it takes her <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> to walk on the beach.

The time it takes for her to walk <fact3>10 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk is <fact3>10 miles</fact3> / (1/8 miles per minute) = 80 minutes.

Thus, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1> is <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 80 minutes = 140 minutes.

How much money does Leon have left after paying for the items?","Reformatted Question: Leon has <fact1>₺84.12</fact1> and wants to buy <fact2>45 washers</fact2> from a bin at the home improvement store. Leon also needs <fact3>6 nails</fact3>, each costing <fact4>₺0.87</fact4>. Each washer costs <fact5>₺0.42</fact5>. How much money does Leon have left after paying for the items?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost of the washers. Since Leon wants to buy <fact2>45 washers</fact2> and each washer costs <fact5>₺0.42</fact5>, the total cost of the washers is <fact2>45</fact2> * <fact5>₺0.42</fact5> = ₺18.90.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the nails. Since Leon needs <fact3>6 nails</fact3> and each nail costs <fact4>₺0.87</fact4>, the total cost of the nails is <fact3>6</fact3> * <fact4>₺0.87</fact4> = ₺5.22.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the items by adding the cost of the washers and the cost of the nails: ₺18.90 + ₺5.22 = ₺24.12.

Finally, we can calculate how much money Leon has left after paying for the items by subtracting the total cost from the initial amount of money he had: <fact1>₺84.12</fact1> - ₺24.12 = ₺60.00.

If Mrs. Lee can get 20% discount on the selling price, how much more is the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget?","Reformatted Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her <fact1>$440000 budget</fact1>. She saw a property that has a <fact2>selling price of $600000</fact2>. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more is the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $600000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$600000</fact2> = $120000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$600000</fact2> - $120000 = $480000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 x $480000 = $14400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 x $480000 = $57600.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $480000 + $14400 + $57600 = $551400.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's <fact1>$440000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $551400 - <fact1>$440000</fact1> = $111400.

If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>25% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more is the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>25%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $480000</fact2>, which is 0.25 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $120000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$480000</fact2> - $120000 = $360000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 7% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.07 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $33600. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $67200.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $360000 + $33600 + $67200 = $460800.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget. The difference is $460800 - <fact1>$370000</fact1> = $90800.

How much money does Sakura have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. Since Sakura bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> and the sale is ""<fact2>Buy 16 kilograms at ₺22 per kilogram, get 6 kilograms 1/2 off</fact2>"", we can calculate the cost as follows: 
16 kg * ₺22/kg = ₺352 for the first 16 kg, and 
7 kg * ₺11/kg = ₺77 for the remaining 7 kg (since 6 kg is half off, and 1 kg is full price, but since we can't buy half a kilogram we'll assume the last kilogram is the half-off one and the other 6 kilograms were the ones that were on sale).
So the total cost of the saltwater taffy is ₺352 + ₺77 = ₺429.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the starfish and keychains. The starfish cost <fact4>₺11.0</fact4> and the keychains cost <fact5>18 * ₺20.0 = ₺360</fact5>. 
So the total cost of the starfish and keychains is ₺11 + ₺360 = ₺371.
Sakura also donated <fact6>₺5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>. 
The total amount spent is ₺429 + ₺371 + ₺5 = ₺805.
Finally, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Sakura had: <fact1>₺1300</fact1> - ₺805 = ₺495.
The answer is {495}.",484

She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for <fact4>¥11.0</fact4> and <fact5>14 keychains</fact5> that were <fact6>¥20.5 each</fact6>. Chen then donated <fact7>¥5</fact7> at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Chen have left?

Answer: Chen started with <fact1>¥1400</fact1>. The saltwater taffy costs <fact2>¥23 per pound</fact2> for the first 16 pounds, which is <fact2>¥23</fact2> * 16 = ¥368. The next 5 pounds (since <fact3>21 pounds</fact3> - 16 pounds = 5 pounds) are half off, so they cost (<fact2>¥23</fact2> / 2) * 5 = ¥57.50. The total cost of the saltwater taffy is ¥368 + ¥57.50 = ¥425.50. The starfish cost <fact4>¥11.0</fact4> and the keychains cost <fact5>14</fact5> * <fact6>¥20.5</fact6> = ¥287. Chen also donated <fact7>¥5</fact7>. The total amount Chen spent is ¥425.50 + ¥11.0 + ¥287 + ¥5 = ¥728.50. Chen has <fact1>¥1400</fact1> - ¥728.50 = ¥671.50 left.

211,A carpenter works for 2 weeks every month and 2 days every week. He gets paid €20 every day. How much does he earn in a year after paying 20% in taxes?,"Reformatted Question: A carpenter works for <fact1>2 weeks every month</fact1> and <fact2>2 days every week</fact2>. He gets paid <fact3>€20 every day</fact3>. How much does he earn in a year after paying <fact4>20% in taxes</fact4>?

Answer: The carpenter works for <fact1>2 weeks every month</fact1>, which is equivalent to 2 * 4 = 8 weeks in a 4-week month. However, since the month is not exactly 4 weeks, we will calculate the total number of days worked per year. There are 52 weeks in a year, and the carpenter works <fact2>2 days every week</fact2>, so he works 52 * 2 = 104 days per year from the weekly schedule. Additionally, he works <fact1>2 weeks every month</fact1>, which is equivalent to 2 * 12 = 24 weeks per year from the monthly schedule. Since there are 7 days in a week, he works 24 * 7 = 168 days per year from the monthly schedule. However, this includes some days that are already counted in the weekly schedule. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the overlap. Since the carpenter works <fact2>2 days every week</fact2> and there are 24 weeks from the monthly schedule, the overlap is 24 * 2 = 48 days. Therefore, the total number of days worked per year is 168 + 104 - 48 = 224 days. The carpenter earns <fact3>€20 every day</fact3>, so his total annual income is 224 * 20 = €4480. After paying <fact4>20% in taxes</fact4>, his take-home income is 4480 * (1 - 0.20) = €3584.

243,The Treasure hunt team hid 100 toys. The Lee twins each found 13 toys. All the remaining toys except 5 were found by their friends. What percentage of the initially hidden toys did the friends find?,"Reformatted Question: The Treasure hunt team <fact1>hid 100 toys</fact1>. The Lee twins each <fact2>found 13 toys</fact2>. All the remaining toys except <fact3>5</fact3> were <fact4>found by their friends</fact4>. What percentage of the initially hidden toys did the friends find?

Answer: The Lee twins found a total of 2 x <fact2>13 toys</fact2> = 26 toys. This means that there were <fact1>100 toys</fact1> - 26 toys = 74 toys remaining. Since <fact3>5</fact3> of these were not found by the friends, the friends found 74 - <fact3>5</fact3> = 69 toys. To find the percentage, we divide the number of toys found by the friends by the total number of toys and multiply by 100: (69 / <fact1>100</fact1>) * 100 = 69%. Therefore, the friends found 69% of the initially hidden toys.",69

How many bananas and grapes does Ali have in the house combined?","Reformatted Question: At Ali's house, <fact1>there are eight times as many bananas as grapes</fact1>. He has a total of <fact2>37 grapes</fact2> in his house. Ali then bought <fact3>55 more grapes</fact3> at the store and <fact4>14 fewer bananas than the number of grapes</fact4>. He later bought <fact5>11 bananas</fact5> and <fact6>16 fewer than two times as many grapes</fact6>. How many bananas and grapes does Ali have in the house combined?

Answer: Since <fact1>there are eight times as many bananas as grapes</fact1> and Ali has <fact2>37 grapes</fact2>, he initially has 8 * <fact2>37</fact2> = 296 bananas. After buying <fact3>55 more grapes</fact3>, he now has <fact2>37</fact2> + <fact3>55</fact3> = 92 grapes. He also bought <fact4>14 fewer bananas than the number of grapes</fact4>, which is 92 - 14 = 78 bananas. So now he has 296 + 78 = 374 bananas. After buying <fact5>11 bananas</fact5>, he now has 374 + <fact5>11</fact5> = 385 bananas. He also bought <fact6>16 fewer than two times as many grapes</fact6>, which is 2 * 92 - 16 = 168 grapes. So now he has 92 + 168 = 260 grapes. In total, Ali has 385 bananas + 260 grapes = 645 bananas and grapes combined.

He later bought <fact5>14 pineapples</fact5> and <fact6>13 fewer than two times as many grapes</fact6>. How many pineapples and grapes does Bodhi have in the house combined?

Answer: Bodhi initially had <fact2>32 grapes</fact2> and since <fact1>there are six times as many pineapples as grapes</fact1>, he had 6 * <fact2>32</fact2> = 192 pineapples. After buying <fact3>52 more grapes</fact3>, he had <fact2>32</fact2> + <fact3>52</fact3> = 84 grapes. He also bought <fact4>15 fewer pineapples than the number of grapes</fact4>, which is 84 - 15 = 69 pineapples. So now he has 192 + 69 = 261 pineapples. After buying <fact5>14 pineapples</fact5>, he had 261 + <fact5>14</fact5> = 275 pineapples. He also bought <fact6>13 fewer than two times as many grapes</fact6>, which is 2 * 84 - 13 = 155 grapes.

He later bought <fact5>9 kiwis</fact5> and <fact6>12 fewer than two times as many apricots</fact6>. How many kiwis and apricots does Arash have in the house combined?

Answer: Arash initially had <fact2>22 apricots</fact2> and since <fact1>there are five times as many kiwis as apricots</fact1>, he had 5 * <fact2>22</fact2> = 110 kiwis. After buying <fact3>62 more apricots</fact3>, he had <fact2>22</fact2> + <fact3>62</fact3> = 84 apricots. He also bought <fact4>23 fewer kiwis than the number of apricots</fact4>, which is 84 - 23 = 61 kiwis. So now he has 110 + 61 = 171 kiwis.

288,"Olga's uncle said that she had $260 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play one round of laser tag, have $6 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster seven times. A round of laser tag is $3. The roller coaster costs $13 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Olga needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs $60. How many friends can she invite?","Reformatted Question: Olga's uncle said that she had <fact1>$260 budgeted for her birthday party</fact1>. She wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>$6 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster seven times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of laser tag is $3</fact5>. <fact6>The roller coaster costs $13 per ride</fact6>. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Olga needs to <fact7>rent a bus for the day, which costs $60</fact7>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Let's denote the number of friends Olga can invite as x. Since Olga also participates in the activities, the total number of people is x + 1. The total cost of laser tag is (x + 1) * <fact5>$3</fact5> = $3(x + 1). The total cost of pinball tokens is (x + 1) * <fact3>$6</fact3> = $6(x + 1). The total cost of the roller coaster is (x + 1) * <fact6>$13</fact6> * 7 = $91(x + 1). Adding the cost of the bus, <fact7>$60</fact7>, the total cost is $3(x + 1) + $6(x + 1) + $91(x + 1) + $60. This total cost should not exceed <fact1>$260</fact1>. Setting up the equation: $3(x + 1) + $6(x + 1) + $91(x + 1) + $60 = <fact1>$260</fact1>. Solving for x, we get $100(x + 1) + $60 = $260. $100(x + 1) = $200. x + 1 = 2. x = 1.

However, the problem states that Olga wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>$6 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster seven times</fact4>. This means that the cost for Olga's activities is $3 + $6 + $91 = $100. The remaining budget for her friends is <fact1>$260</fact1> - $100 - <fact7>$60</fact7> = $100. The cost for each friend is $3 + $6 + $91 = $100. Therefore, Olga can invite 1 friend, but since the cost for the friend's activities equals the remaining budget, this would leave no money for anything else. In reality, Olga can invite 0 friends.

However, if we consider the fact that the question asks for the number of friends Olga can invite and the calculations provide the result of 1 friend but no money left, the final answer should be considered as 0 friends because you cannot invite a friend and not pay for their activities.

The answer is {0}.",1
