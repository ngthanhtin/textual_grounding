To continue this pattern, the sixth bin should have 5 more cans than the fifth bin <B5> <C>. Therefore, Andrew will put 16 + 5 = 21 cans in the sixth bin.

Answer_Reasoning: Notice that the number of bottles Ava puts in each bag increases. The difference between the number of bottles in <B2>Bag 2</B2> and <B1>Bag 1</B1> is <B2>53</B2> - <B1>45</B1> = 8 bottles. The difference between <B3>Bag 3</B3> and <B2>Bag 2</B2> is <B3>61</B3> - <B2>53</B2> = 8 bottles.  The difference between <B4>Bag 4</B4> and <B3>Bag 3</B3> is <B4>69</B4> - <B3>61</B3> = 8 bottles. So, Ava puts 8 more bottles in each bag than the previous bag. Therefore, Ava will put <B4>69</B4> + 8 = 77 bottles in <B5>Bag 5</B5>.

Answer_Reasoning: Let the speed of the car from point A be x km/h and the speed of the car from point B be y km/h. <C>When the cars travel in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference of their speeds</C>, which is (x-y) km/h. <C1>They meet in 7 hours and cover a distance of 70 km. Using the formula distance = speed × time, we have 7(x-y) = <B1>70</B1></C1>, which simplifies to x - y = 10. <D>When the cars travel towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds</D>, which is (x+y) km/h. <D1>They meet in 1 hour, covering a distance of 70 km. Therefore, 1(x+y) = <B1>70</B1></D1>, which simplifies to x + y = 70. Now we have two equations: x - y = 10 and x + y = 70. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 40 and y = 30. Therefore, the speed of the car that starts from A is 40 km/h and the speed of the car that starts from B is 30 km/h.

Answer_Reasoning: The difference in price between a <G>10 km</G> trip and a <I>15 km</I> trip is <J>$110</J> - <H>$75</H> = $35. This means that the additional <I>5 km</I> cost $35, so each kilometer costs $35 / <I>5</I> = $7.  A <K>25 km</K> trip is <K>15 km</K> longer than a <G>10 km trip</G>, so it will cost an additional <K>15</K> * $7 = $105.  Therefore a <K>25 km</K> trip will cost <H>$75</H> + $105 = $180.

    D --> F[Reservation charge is the same] 

Answer_Reasoning: The cost of one full and one half ticket is <E>$327</E>. One full ticket with reservation costs <C>$216</C>.  Therefore, the cost of a half ticket with reservation is <E>$327</E> - <C>$216</C> = $111. Because a half ticket costs half the price of a full ticket, we know that the difference in price of $111 represents the price of half a ticket. So a full fare ticket costs 2 * $111 = $222. The reservation fee is <C>$216</C> - $222 = -$6. The answer is -$6.

Answer_Reasoning: 
Let the speed of the train be x km/hr and the speed of the bus be y km/hr.

From <C>Scenario 1</C>, we know that:
Time taken by train + Time taken by bus = Total time
<E>60</E>/x + <F>240</F>/y = <G>4</G> ...(1)

From <D>Scenario 2</D>, we know that:

<H>100</H>/x + <I>200</I>/y = <J>4 + 10/60</J> 
<H>100</H>/x + <I>200</I>/y = <J>25/6</J> ...(2)

Solving equations (1) and (2), we get:
x = 60, y = 80

Therefore, the speed of the train is 60 km/hr and the speed of the bus is 80 km/hr.

1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","```mermaid

    A --> D{Distance}
    B --> B1[+6 km/h --> 8 hours less]
    B --> B2[-6 km/h --> 12 hours more]

```
Answer_Reasoning: Let the original speed of the train be <B>x</B> km/hr and the original time taken be <C>y</C> hours. We know that distance = speed * time, so the distance covered by the train is <D>xy</D> km. 

Scenario 1: If the train was 6 km/hr faster (<B1>x+6</B1>), it would take 8 hours less (<C>y-8</C>) to cover the same distance. 

Scenario 2: If the train was 6 km/hr slower (<B2>x-6</B2>), it would take 12 hours more (<C>y+12</C>) to cover the same distance. 

We can set up equations based on these scenarios, but solving for distance directly would be complex. This type of problem requires setting up multiple equations and solving for unknowns (speed and time) to ultimately determine the distance.

We know from <D1>Scenario 1</D1> that the total interest earned is $130. We also know from <E2>Scenario 2</E2> that if the interest rates were swapped, the total interest earned is $134.  This gives us two equations, which we can then use to solve for our two unknowns, 'x' and 'y'.

    B1 --> B1a[Side = 42 ft]
    B2 --> B2a[Width = B1a]

Answer_Reasoning: The field is a combination of an equilateral triangle and a rectangle.  The equilateral triangle has 3 sides each measuring <B1a>42 ft</B1a>. The rectangle has a length of <B2b>76 ft</B2b>.  Since the rectangle is attached to the triangle, one of the widths of the rectangle is common with one of the sides of the triangle and hence the width of the rectangle is <B2a>42 ft</B2a>.  The other width of the rectangle also measures <B2a>42 ft</B2a>. Therefore the perimeter of the field = (3 * <B1a>42</B1a>) + <B2b>76</B2b> + <B2a>42</B2a> + <B2a>42</B2a> = 334 ft.

    A[Structures]
    A --> B[Eiffel Tower]
    A --> C[Burj Khalifa]
    B --> B1[Height: 324 m]
    C --> C1[Height: 830 m]
    C --> C2[Tallest man-made structure]
Answer_Reasoning: The Eiffel Tower is <C1>830</C1> - <B1>324</B1> = 506 m shorter than the Burj Khalifa.

2072,"Henry and Margo both began traveling around a circular track. Henry is riding his bike, and Margo is walking. It takes Henry 7 minutes to make it all the way around, and Margo takes 12 minutes. How much time will pass until they meet at the starting line?","Fact_Diagram:
graph TD
    A[Circular Track Race]
    A --> B[Henry]
    A --> C[Margo]
    B --> B1[7 minutes per lap]
    C --> C1[12 minutes per lap]

Answer_Reasoning: To find when they meet at the starting line, we need to find the least common multiple of their lap times. The least common multiple of <B1>7 minutes</B1> and <C1>12 minutes</C1> is 84.  Therefore, 84 minutes will pass until they meet at the starting line. 
Final_Answer: {84}
