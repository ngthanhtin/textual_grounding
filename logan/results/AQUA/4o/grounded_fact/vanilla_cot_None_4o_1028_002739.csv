216,"<fact1>5 horses are in a race</fact1>. <fact2>Mr.Jain selects two of horses at random</fact2> and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is # Answer option: ['A)1/5', 'B)2/5', 'C)3/5', 'D)4/5', 'E)6/5']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse when he randomly selects two horses out of the five in the race.

1. **Total number of ways to select two horses from five:**
   The number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( r \) is the number of items to choose. So, we have:
   \[
   \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]
   There are 10 possible pairs of horses that Mr. Jain can select.

2. **Number of favorable outcomes:**
   For Mr. Jain to have selected the winning horse, the winning horse must be one of the two horses he selects. There are 5 horses, and only 1 of them is the winning horse. Once the winning horse is selected, Mr. Jain can choose any of the remaining 4 horses to complete his pair. Thus, there are 4 favorable outcomes (one for each of the other horses paired with the winning horse).

3. **Probability calculation:**
   The probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

98,"Silu and Meenu were walking on the road. Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"" Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight. But she said, ""<fact1>I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight</fact1>."" How much does Meenu weigh? # Answer option: ['A)12', 'B)28', 'C)27', 'D)58', 'E)91']","To solve the problem, we need to determine Meenu's weight based on the information she provided. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Meenu said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."" Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( W \).

2. According to Meenu's statement, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   W = 29 + \frac{1}{2}W
   \]

3. To solve for \( W \), we first need to eliminate the fraction. We can do this by multiplying every term in the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
   \[
   2W = 58 + W
   \]

4. Next, we subtract \( W \) from both sides to isolate \( W \) on one side of the equation:
   \[
   2W - W = 58
   \]

5. Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   W = 58
   \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. 

The correct answer is option D.

194,"Three bells ring at intervals of <fact1>36 seconds</fact1>, <fact2>40 seconds</fact2> and <fact3>48 seconds</fact3>, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again? # Answer option: ['A)After 6 minutes', 'B)After 12 minutes', 'C)After 18 minutes', 'D)After 24 minutes', 'E)none']","To determine when the three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals at which they ring. The intervals are 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**

- 36 can be factored into prime numbers as:  
  \(36 = 2^2 \times 3^2\)

- 40 can be factored into prime numbers as:  
  \(40 = 2^3 \times 5\)

- 48 can be factored into prime numbers as:  
  \(48 = 2^4 \times 3\)

**Step 2: Determine the LCM**

To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is \(2^4\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^2\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^1\).

Thus, the LCM is:
\[ LCM = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the LCM**

\[ LCM = 16 \times 9 \times 5 \]

First, calculate \(16 \times 9\):
\[ 16 \times 9 = 144 \]

Then, multiply the result by 5:
\[ 144 \times 5 = 720 \]

So, the LCM of 36, 40, and 48 is 720 seconds.

**Step 4: Convert Seconds to Minutes**

Since 1 minute = 60 seconds, convert 720 seconds to minutes:
\[ 720 \div 60 = 12 \]

Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

227,"A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are <fact1>45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected</fact1>, then what is the value of n? # Answer option: ['A)11', 'B)10', 'C)9', 'D)8', 'E)7']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls from a box of \( n \) balls, excluding the ball marked with the number 3.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to select 2 balls from \( n \) balls. This is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

However, we are given that the ball marked with the number 3 is not selected. This means we are selecting 2 balls from the remaining \( n-1 \) balls (since we exclude the ball marked with 3).

The number of ways to select 2 balls from \( n-1 \) balls is:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

According to the problem, this number is equal to 45:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
\]

To find \( n \), we solve the equation:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90
\]

Expanding the left side, we have:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \). Plugging in these values:

\[
n = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-88)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 352}}{2}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{361}}{2}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}
\]

This gives two possible solutions:

\[
n = \frac{3 + 19}{2} = 11
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 - 19}{2} = -8
\]

Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have \( n = 11 \).

Thus, the value of \( n \) is 11. Therefore, the final answer is:

107,"<fact1>x men working x hours per day</fact1> can do <fact2>x units of a work in x days</fact2>. How much work can be completed by <fact3>y men working y hours per day in y days</fact3>? # Answer option: ['A)x2/y2 units', 'B)y3/x2 units', 'C)x3/y2 units', 'D)y2/x2 units', 'E)None of these']","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, the number of days they work, and the amount of work completed.

Given:
- \( x \) men working \( x \) hours per day can complete \( x \) units of work in \( x \) days.

From this, we can determine the total amount of work done in terms of man-hours:
- Total man-hours required to complete \( x \) units of work = \( x \) men \(\times\) \( x \) hours/day \(\times\) \( x \) days = \( x^3 \) man-hours.

This means \( x^3 \) man-hours are needed to complete \( x \) units of work. Therefore, the work done per man-hour is:
- Work per man-hour = \( \frac{x}{x^3} = \frac{1}{x^2} \) units of work per man-hour.

Now, we need to find out how much work \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day can complete in \( y \) days.

Calculate the total man-hours available with \( y \) men:
- Total man-hours = \( y \) men \(\times\) \( y \) hours/day \(\times\) \( y \) days = \( y^3 \) man-hours.

Since each man-hour can complete \( \frac{1}{x^2} \) units of work, the total work completed by \( y^3 \) man-hours is:
- Total work = \( y^3 \) man-hours \(\times\) \( \frac{1}{x^2} \) units/man-hour = \( \frac{y^3}{x^2} \) units.

Thus, the amount of work that can be completed by \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day in \( y \) days is \( \frac{y^3}{x^2} \) units.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

1. **Calculate the Total Yearly Production Cost:**
   - The company produces 420 units per month.
   - The production cost per component is $110.
   - Therefore, the monthly production cost is \( 420 \times 110 = 46,200 \) dollars.
   - The yearly production cost is \( 46,200 \times 12 = 554,400 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the Required Yearly Revenue:**
   - The yearly profit must be at least $626,400.
   - Profit is calculated as Revenue - Production Costs.
   - Therefore, the required yearly revenue is \( 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,080,800 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the Required Monthly Revenue:**
   - Since the company sells all components produced each month, the monthly revenue must be \( \frac{1,080,800}{12} = 90,066.67 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the Minimum Selling Price per Component:**
   - The company sells 420 components each month.
   - To achieve the required monthly revenue, the selling price per component must be \( \frac{90,066.67}{420} \approx 214.44 \) dollars.

5. **Select the Minimum Selling Price from the Options:**
   - The options provided are: A) 226, B) 230, C) 240, D) 260, E) 280.

66,"<fact1>One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E</fact1> and <fact2>8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A</fact2>. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins? # Answer option: ['A)8.5', 'B)10.5', 'C)12.5', 'D)14.5', 'E)16.5']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{9\%} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{8\%} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5
     \]

3. **Determine the Maximum Requirement:**
   - To satisfy both vitamin requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two calculated values because we need to meet at least 100% of both vitamins.
   - The maximum of 11.11 grams (for vitamin E) and 12.5 grams (for vitamin A) is 12.5 grams.

Therefore, to meet at least the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, one must consume at least 12.5 grams of the health food.

130,"A man <fact1>walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs</fact1> and <fact2>at 4 kmph for 12 hrs</fact2>. His average speed is
# Answer option: ['A)4 1/3 km/h', 'B)7 2/3 km/h', 'C)9 ½ km/h', 'D)8 km/h', 'E)81 km/h']","To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then use the formula for average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled.**

- For the first part of the journey, the man walks at 5 km/h for 6 hours.
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{km/h} \times 6 \, \text{h} = 30 \, \text{km}
  \]

- For the second part of the journey, the man walks at 4 km/h for 12 hours.
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 4 \, \text{km/h} \times 12 \, \text{h} = 48 \, \text{km}
  \]

- Total distance traveled:
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{km} + 48 \, \text{km} = 78 \, \text{km}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time taken.**

- Total time is the sum of the time for both parts of the journey:
  \[
  \text{Total Time} = 6 \, \text{h} + 12 \, \text{h} = 18 \, \text{h}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the average speed.**

- Using the formula for average speed:
  \[
  \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{78 \, \text{km}}{18 \, \text{h}} = 4.3333 \, \text{km/h}
  \]

- In fractional form, 4.3333 km/h is equivalent to \(4 \frac{1}{3}\) km/h.

Therefore, the average speed of the man is \(4 \frac{1}{3}\) km/h.

124,"If a man <fact1>rows at the rate of 4 kmph in still water</fact1> and his <fact2>rate against the current is 2 kmph</fact2>, then the man's rate along the current is:
# Answer option: ['A)15 kmph', 'B)6 kmph', 'C)12 kmph', 'D)14 kmph', 'E)6 kmph']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's rate along the current, given his rate in still water and his rate against the current.

Let's define the variables:
- \( v_m \) = man's rate in still water = 4 kmph (from fact1)
- \( v_c \) = rate of the current
- \( v_{against} \) = man's rate against the current = 2 kmph (from fact2)
- \( v_{along} \) = man's rate along the current

We know the following relationships:
1. When rowing against the current, the effective speed is reduced by the speed of the current: 
   \[
   v_{against} = v_m - v_c
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   2 = 4 - v_c
   \]
   Solving for \( v_c \):
   \[
   v_c = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ kmph}
   \]

2. When rowing along the current, the effective speed is increased by the speed of the current:
   \[
   v_{along} = v_m + v_c
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   v_{along} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ kmph}
   \]

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.

103,"At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that <fact1>costs him Rs. 1200/-</fact1> so that even after <fact2>offering a 20% discount</fact2>, he <fact3>makes 20% profit</fact3>? # Answer option: ['A)1,879', 'B)1,875', 'C)1,876', 'D)1,872', 'E)1,800']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the sewing machine such that after offering a 20% discount, Karan still makes a 20% profit on the cost price.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - The cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
   - Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price.
   - Profit = 20% of Rs. 1200 = 0.20 * 1200 = Rs. 240.
   - Therefore, the selling price (SP) should be Cost Price + Profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.

2. **Determine the Marked Price for a 20% Discount:**
   - Let the marked price be \( M \).
   - Karan offers a 20% discount on the marked price.
   - The selling price after the discount is 80% of the marked price (since 100% - 20% = 80%).
   - Therefore, 0.80 * M = Rs. 1440.

3. **Solve for the Marked Price:**
   - To find the marked price \( M \), we solve the equation:
     \[
     0.80 \times M = 1440
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.80 to solve for \( M \):
     \[
     M = \frac{1440}{0.80} = 1800
     \]

Thus, the marked price should be Rs. 1800.

The rate of interest is? # Answer option: ['A)10%', 'B)12%', 'C)6%', 'D)8%', 'E)4%']","To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of interest given that the difference between the compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72.

Let's denote:
- Principal (P) = Rs. 5000
- Time (T) = 2 years
- Rate of interest (R) = r%

The formula for simple interest (S.I.) is:
\[ \text{S.I.} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

The formula for compound interest (C.I.) is:
\[ \text{C.I.} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \]

Given that the difference between C.I. and S.I. is Rs. 72, we have:
\[ \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 72 \]

Substituting the formulas, we get:
\[ P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P - \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} = 72 \]

Substitute \( P = 5000 \) and \( T = 2 \):
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 72 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5000 to simplify:
\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{100R}{5000} = \frac{72}{5000} \]

\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Let \( x = \frac{R}{100} \), then:
\[ (1 + x)^2 - 1 - 2x = 0.0144 \]

Expanding \( (1 + x)^2 \):
\[ 1 + 2x + x^2 - 1 - 2x = 0.0144 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x^2 = 0.0144 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ x = \sqrt{0.0144} = 0.12 \]

Since \( x = \frac{R}{100} \), we have:
\[ \frac{R}{100} = 0.12 \]

Thus, \( R = 12\% \).

Therefore, the rate of interest is 12%.

1. **Understanding the Facts:**
   - Fact 1: 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
   - Fact 2: 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars.
   - Fact 3: 10 men liked green cars more than red.

2. **Analyzing Fact 3:**
   - If 10 men liked green cars more than red, this means that these 10 men represent the 25% of men who did not prefer red cars (since 75% preferred red).

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Men:**
   - If 25% of the men equals 10, then the total number of men can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total number of men} = \frac{10}{0.25} = 40
     \]

4. **Calculating the Total Number of People:**
   - Since 60% of the people surveyed were women, it follows that 40% were men.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of people surveyed. Then, 40% of \( x \) is equal to the number of men:
     \[
     0.40x = 40

What is the distance between A and B? # Answer option: ['A)180', 'B)90', 'C)270', 'D)360', 'E)None of the above']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance between points A and B based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the Journey:**
   - Kevin drives from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
   - He then returns from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
   - Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was 70 miles away from B.

2. **Analyzing the Information:**
   - When Kevin is 70 miles away from B, he is still approaching B. This means he has not yet reached B.
   - Since he is traveling at 70 mph towards B, it will take him \( \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 1 \text{ hour} \) to reach B from that point.

3. **Time Calculation:**
   - He reaches B 1 hour after being 70 miles away from it.
   - The problem states that this moment (when he is 70 miles away from B) is exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip.
   - Therefore, after reaching B, he has 2 hours left to complete his trip back to A.

4. **Return Journey:**
   - Kevin returns from B to A at 90 mph.
   - Since he has 2 hours to complete the return journey, the distance from B to A is \( 90 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Distance from A to B:**
   - The distance from A to B is the same as the distance from B to A, which is 180 miles.

Thus, the distance between A and B is 180 miles.

91,"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is partly fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month <fact1>540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800</fact1>. In another month <fact2>620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040</fact2>. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more holidays. The bill for that month would be: # Answer option: ['A)Rs.1560', 'B)Rs.1680', 'C)Rs.1840', 'D)Rs.1950', 'E)Rs.1690']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the given information:
1. When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs.1800.
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]
2. When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs.2040.
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We have two equations:
1. \( F + 540V = 1800 \)
2. \( F + 620V = 2040 \)

To find \( V \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), we can substitute back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Using the first equation:
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For a month with 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
\text{Bill} = F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Bill} = 180 + 1500 = 1680
\]

Thus, the bill for the month with 500 calls is Rs.1680.

At what time do the 2 trains cross one another? # Answer option: ['A)1 hr 23 min', 'B)1 hr 15 min', 'C)1 hr 8 min', 'D)56 min', 'E)55 min']","To determine when the two trains cross each other, we need to calculate the time it takes for them to meet after the first train departs.

1. **Train M's Journey:**
   - Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am.
   - Total travel time for Train M = 4 hours.

2. **Train N's Journey:**
   - Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am.
   - Total travel time for Train N = 3.5 hours.

3. **Relative Speed and Meeting Point:**
   - Both trains are traveling towards each other.
   - Train M travels for 2 hours before Train N starts (from 5 am to 7 am).
   - In these 2 hours, Train M covers half of its journey (since it takes 4 hours in total), meaning it has covered half the distance between City A and City B.

4. **Remaining Distance:**
   - At 7 am, Train M has covered half the distance, and Train N starts its journey.
   - The remaining distance is half the total distance between City A and City B.

5. **Time to Meet:**
   - Train M and Train N are now moving towards each other.
   - Train M has 2 hours left to reach City B, and Train N has 3.5 hours to reach City A.
   - The combined speed of both trains will cover the remaining half distance.

6. **Calculating the Meeting Time:**
   - Since Train M covers the entire distance in 4 hours, it covers half the distance in 2 hours.
   - Train N covers the entire distance in 3.5 hours, so it covers half the distance in 1.75 hours.
   - The time taken for both trains to meet is the time taken to cover the remaining half distance when both are moving towards each other.

7. **Relative Speed Calculation:**
   - Let the total distance be D.
   - Train M's speed = D/4 per hour.
   - Train N's speed = D/3.5 per hour.
   - Combined speed = (D/4 + D/3.5) per hour = (7D/28 + 4D/14) = (7D + 8D)/28 = 15D/28 per hour.

8. **Time to Cross:**
   - Time taken to cover half the distance (D/2) = (D/2) / (15D/28) = (D/2) * (28/15D) = 28/30 = 14/15 hours.

9. **Convert to Minutes:**
   - 14/15 hours = 14/15 * 60 minutes = 56 minutes.

Therefore, the two trains cross each other 56 minutes after Train N starts its journey at 7 am, which is at 7:56 am.

Q is the product of two prime numbers. # Answer option: ['A)I only', 'B)III only', 'C)II only', 'D)I and II only', 'E)I and III only']","To determine which statements about \( Q \) must be true, we need to analyze the condition that \( Q \) has exactly 5 factors.

1. **Understanding the number of factors:**
   - If \( Q \) is a positive integer with a prime factorization of \( Q = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \), the number of factors of \( Q \) is given by \( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1) \).
   - We need this product to equal 5.

2. **Analyzing the possibilities:**
   - Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express 5 as a product of integers is \( 5 = 5 \times 1 \).
   - This implies that one of the exponents \( a_i \) must be 4, and all other exponents must be 0. Therefore, \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number.

3. **Evaluating the statements:**
   - **Statement I:** \( Q \) is the square of a prime number.
     - If \( Q = p^2 \), the number of factors would be \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.
   - **Statement II:** \( Q \) is the fourth power of a prime number.
     - If \( Q = p^4 \), the number of factors is \( (4 + 1) = 5 \). This statement is true.
   - **Statement III:** \( Q \) is the product of two prime numbers.
     - If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes, the number of factors would be \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \), not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Only Statement II is true based on the analysis.

1. **Determine Jack's rate of work:**
   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his rate of work is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the yacht per hour.

2. **Calculate the work Jack has completed:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the work he has completed is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the yacht.

3. **Calculate the remaining work:**
   - The remaining work is \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \) of the yacht.

4. **Determine Jill's rate of work:**
   - Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate. Therefore, Jill's rate is \( 0.05 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{240} \) of the yacht per hour.

5. **Calculate the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work:**
   - Jill needs to complete \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the yacht. Since her rate is \( \frac{1}{240} \) of the yacht per hour, the time \( t \) it takes her to complete the remaining work is given by:

1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 16 and 17.

2. **Prime factorization**:
   - 16 is \(2^4\).
   - 17 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \(17^1\).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - For 2, the highest power is \(2^4\).
   - For 17, the highest power is \(17^1\).

4. **Multiply these together**:

# Answer option: ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expressions \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \) and determine the relationship between them for positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step 1: Analyze \( L(x, y) \)

Given:
\[ L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \]

- \([x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).
- \([y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( y \).
- \([x + y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x + y \).

### Step 2: Analyze \( R(x, y) \)

Given:
\[ R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \]

- \([2x]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( 2x \).
- \([2y]\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \( 2y \).

### Step 3: Compare \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \)

To compare \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \), consider the following:

- The expression \([x + y]\) can be either \([x] + [y]\) or \([x] + [y] + 1\), depending on whether the fractional parts of \( x \) and \( y \) sum to 1 or more.
- The expression \([2x]\) is \( 2[x] \) or \( 2[x] + 1\) depending on whether the fractional part of \( x \) is less than 0.5 or not.
- Similarly, \([2y]\) is \( 2[y] \) or \( 2[y] + 1\) depending on whether the fractional part of \( y \) is less than 0.5 or not.

### Step 4: Consider Specific Cases

1. **Case 1: \( x = 0.5, y = 0.5 \)**
   - \([x] = 0\), \([y] = 0\), \([x + y] = 1\)
   - \( L(x, y) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \)
   - \([2x] = 1\), \([2y] = 1\)
   - \( R(x, y) = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - Here, \( L(x, y) \neq R(x, y) \).

2. **Case 2: \( x = 0.25, y = 0.25 \)**
   - \([x] = 0\), \([y] = 0\), \([x + y] = 0\)
   - \( L(x, y) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \)
   - \([2x] = 0\), \([2y] = 0\)
   - \( R(x, y) = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
   - Here, \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \).

### Conclusion

From the cases above, we see that it is possible for \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \) and also for \( L(x, y) \neq R(x, y) \). Therefore, it is not impossible to find two positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \).

Thus, the correct answer is that it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) for which \( L(x, y) \neq R(x, y) \) is not true, as we have found such examples.

How far can Bill travel on a windy day in <fact3>21 minutes</fact3>? Round to the nearest hundredth.","To determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Bill's speed on a windy day:**
   - According to fact 1, Bill usually averages about 15 mph.
   - According to fact 2, on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph.
   - Therefore, on a windy day, Bill's speed is \(15 \text{ mph} - 4 \text{ mph} = 11 \text{ mph}\).

2. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Bill is traveling for 21 minutes.

The protocol states that the pm should speak before the mp, and the mp should speak before the mla.

Let's assume that among the 10 speakers, there is exactly one pm, one mp, and one mla. The remaining 7 speakers can be any other individuals.

1. **Total Arrangements Without Restrictions:**
   - If there were no restrictions, the 10 speakers could be arranged in \(10!\) ways.

2. **Applying the Protocol:**
   - According to the protocol, the pm must speak before the mp, and the mp must speak before the mla. This means that for any arrangement of these three specific speakers, there is only 1 valid order (pm, mp, mla).
   - Without any restrictions, these 3 speakers can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways.

3. **Calculating Valid Arrangements:**
   - Since only 1 of the \(3!\) arrangements of pm, mp, and mla is valid, we need to divide the total number of unrestricted arrangements by the number of invalid arrangements.
   - Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is \(\frac{10!}{3!}\).

4. **Simplifying the Calculation:**
   - Calculate \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).
   - Thus, the number of valid arrangements is \(\frac{10!}{6}\).

64,"Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has <fact1>10 different types of books</fact1>. She then <fact2>codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters</fact2>. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the <fact3>order of letters in a pair does not matter</fact3>.) # Answer option: ['A)3', 'B)4', 'C)5', 'D)10', 'E)20']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The order of letters in a pair does not matter, which means pairs like ""AB"" and ""BA"" are considered the same.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Single Letter Codes**: If we use \( n \) different letters, we can create \( n \) unique single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes**: For pairs of letters, since the order does not matter, the number of unique pairs we can form from \( n \) letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

3. **Total Codes**: The total number of unique codes we can create using \( n \) letters is the sum of single-letter codes and pair-of-letters codes:
   \[
   \text{Total Codes} = n + \binom{n}{2} = n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
   \]

We need this total to be at least 10, as there are 10 different types of books.

Let's calculate this for different values of \( n \):

- **For \( n = 3 \):**
  \[
  \text{Total Codes} = 3 + \binom{3}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6
  \]
  This is not enough.

- **For \( n = 4 \):**
  \[
  \text{Total Codes} = 4 + \binom{4}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10
  \]
  This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.

- **For \( n = 5 \):**
  \[
  \text{Total Codes} = 5 + \binom{5}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15
  \]
  This is more than enough, but we are looking for the smallest \( n \).

Since \( n = 4 \) gives us exactly 10 codes, which is the minimum required, the smallest number of letters needed is 4.

If after one dive, she got <fact3>$3.40</fact3>. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? # Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of copper coins the diver could have brought up, given that she earned a total of $3.40 from a combination of copper and brass coins.

1. **Convert the total earnings to cents**:  
   $3.40 is equivalent to 340 cents.

2. **Define variables**:  
   Let \( x \) be the number of copper coins and \( y \) be the number of brass coins.

3. **Set up the equation based on earnings**:  
   Each copper coin earns 20 cents, and each brass coin earns 25 cents. Therefore, the equation for the total earnings is:
   \[

How many flowers will the bee fly by to <fact2>bypass 8 flowers</fact2>? # Answer option: ['A)2000', 'B)4000', 'C)8000', 'D)16000', 'E)32000']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers the bee flies by in order to bypass 8 flowers, given that it bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters.

1. **Understand the percentage bypassed**: The bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by. This means that for every 100 flowers it encounters, it bypasses 0.05 flowers.

2. **Set up the equation**: We need to find the total number of flowers, \( x \), that the bee flies by to bypass 8 flowers. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   0.05\% \times x = 8
   \]

3. **Convert percentage to a decimal**: 0.05% is equivalent to 0.0005 in decimal form.

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   0.0005 \times x = 8
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{0.0005}

207,"What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation <fact1>x2 - 5x + k = 0</fact1> will have two real and distinct roots? # Answer option: ['A)9', 'B)7', 'C)3', 'D)8', 'E)12']","To determine the largest integral value of \( k \) for which the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \) has two real and distinct roots, we need to use the discriminant condition for real and distinct roots. 

The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
\Delta > 0
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = k \). Plugging these values into the discriminant formula gives:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k
\]

We need:

\[
25 - 4k > 0
\]

Solving this inequality:

\[
25 > 4k
\]

\[
\frac{25}{4} > k
\]

\[
k < 6.25
\]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Therefore, the largest integral value of \( k \) for which the quadratic equation has two real and distinct roots is 6.

However, the answer options provided are ['A)9', 'B)7', 'C)3', 'D)8', 'E)12']. The closest option to 6 is 7, but 7 is not less than 6.25. Therefore, the correct answer based on the options provided is not directly available. 

Re-evaluating the options, the largest possible value of \( k \) that satisfies \( k < 6.25 \) is 6, but since 6 is not an option, we must choose the next logical option that fits the context of the problem, which is 3, as it is the only option less than 6.25.

154,"The <fact1>height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5</fact1>. It <fact2>costs Rs.260 to paper the walls</fact2> of the room with <fact3>paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter</fact3> <fact4>allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows</fact4>. The height of the room is:
# Answer option: ['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']","To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the room given the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter and the cost of papering the walls.

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**
   - The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5. Let's denote the height of the room as \( h \) and the semi-perimeter as \( s \).
   - Therefore, \( \frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5} \) or \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls:**
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.
   - The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters wide, and costs Rs. 2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the cost per square meter of paper is \( \frac{2}{0.5} = 4 \) Rs/m².

3. **Calculating the Area to be Papered:**
   - The total cost is Rs. 260, and the cost per square meter is Rs. 4.
   - Therefore, the total area to be papered is \( \frac{260}{4} = 65 \) m².
   - However, we need to allow an area of 15 m² for doors and windows, so the actual area of the walls is \( 65 + 15 = 80 \) m².

4. **Relating the Area to the Room Dimensions:**
   - The area of the walls of the room is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Height} \).
   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \). Then, \( \text{Area} = P \times h = 80 \) m².
   - The semi-perimeter \( s = \frac{P}{2} \).

5. **Substituting the Ratio:**
   - From the ratio, \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).
   - Therefore, \( P = 2s \) and substituting \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \) into the area equation:
   \[
   P \times h = 80 \implies 2s \times \frac{2}{5} \times s = 80
   \]
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} s^2 = 80
   \]
   \[
   s^2 = 80 \times \frac{5}{4} = 100
   \]
   \[
   s = 10
   \]

6. **Finding the Height:**
   - Now, substitute \( s = 10 \) back into the height equation:
   \[
   h = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4
   \]

Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters.

Let's denote the number as \( x \).

1. **Calculate \(\frac{7}{8}\) of the number:**
   \[
   \frac{7}{8} \times x = \frac{7x}{8}
   \]

2. **Calculate \(\frac{7}{18}\) of the number:**
   \[
   \frac{7}{18} \times x = \frac{7x}{18}
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the difference:**
   \[
   \frac{7x}{8} - \frac{7x}{18} = 770
   \]

4. **Find a common denominator to combine the fractions:**
   The least common multiple of 8 and 18 is 72.

   Convert each fraction:
   \[
   \frac{7x}{8} = \frac{7x \times 9}{72} = \frac{63x}{72}
   \]
   \[

   \]

5. **Subtract the fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{63x}{72} - \frac{28x}{72} = \frac{35x}{72}
   \]

6. **Set the equation equal to 770:**
   \[
   \frac{35x}{72} = 770
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 72 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   35x = 770 \times 72
   \]

   Calculate \( 770 \times 72 \):
   \[
   770 \times 72 = 55440

   Divide both sides by 35:
   \[
   x = \frac{55440}{35}

   Calculate \( \frac{55440}{35} \):
   \[
   x = 1584

If that projection were to come true, the <fact2>population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago</fact2>. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year? # Answer option: ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given facts and determine the percent population increase over the last year.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to fact 1, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population at the end of the first year will be:
\[ P \times 1.10 \]

At the end of the second year, the population will be:
\[ P \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = P \times 1.21 \]

According to fact 2, the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have:
\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times P_{\text{one year ago}} \]

Let \( P_{\text{one year ago}} \) be the population one year ago. We can express this as:
\[ P_{\text{one year ago}} = P \times (1 + x) \]
where \( x \) is the percent increase over the last year expressed as a decimal.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[ P \times 1.21 = 2 \times P \times (1 + x) \]

Simplifying, we have:
\[ 1.21 = 2 \times (1 + x) \]

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 0.605 = 1 + x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.605 - 1 = -0.395 \]

This result seems incorrect because it suggests a decrease, which contradicts the problem's context. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

Reconsider the equation:

For what price did the retailer sell the appliance? # Answer option: ['A)$27.30', 'B)$51.00', 'C)$63.00', 'D)$70.00', 'E)$91.00']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance based on the given facts.

1. **Understanding the Facts:**
   - Fact 1: The appliance was sold for 40 percent above cost.
   - Fact 2: The gross profit from the sale was $20.00.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost price of the appliance.
   - The selling price is 40% above the cost price, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price} = C + 0.4C = 1.4C
     \]
   - The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
     \[
     \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - C = 1.4C - C = 0.4C
     \]
   - We know from Fact 2 that the gross profit is $20.00:
     \[
     0.4C = 20
     \]

3. **Solving for the Cost Price:**
   - Solve the equation for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{20}{0.4} = 50
     \]
   - So, the cost price of the appliance is $50.00.

4. **Calculating the Selling Price:**
   - Substitute \( C = 50 \) into the equation for the selling price:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price} = 1.4 \times 50 = 70
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The retailer sold the appliance for $70.00.

If <fact1>train is traveling at 120 mile an hour</fact1>, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel? # Answer option: ['A)43 seconds', 'B)39 seconds', 'C)20 seconds', 'D)33 seconds', 'E)55 seconds']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass completely through the tunnel.

1. **Determine the length of the train:**
   - The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel. During this time, the entire length of the train enters the tunnel.
   - The speed of the train is 120 miles per hour. We need to convert this speed into miles per second to find out how far the train travels in 3 seconds.
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so the speed of the train in miles per second is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ miles/hour}}{3600 \text{ seconds/hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second}
     \]
   - In 3 seconds, the train travels:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{30} = \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.

2. **Determine the total distance to be covered:**
   - The train needs to pass completely through the tunnel, which means it needs to cover the length of the tunnel plus its own length.
   - The tunnel is 1 mile long, and the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles long.
   - Total distance to be covered is:
     \[
     1 + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{10}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{11}{10} \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time to pass through the tunnel:**
   - We already know the speed of the train is \(\frac{1}{30}\) miles per second.
   - Time taken to cover \(\frac{11}{10}\) miles is:
     \[
     \frac{\frac{11}{10} \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second}} = \frac{11}{10} \times 30 = 33 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Therefore, the train will take 33 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel.

Let's break down the information given and the steps needed to find the solution:

1. **Understand the given facts:**
   - Fact 1: The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is equal to x. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
     \]

   - Fact 2: The average score for the entire class is y. If there are z students, the total sum of all scores (S) is:
     \[
     \frac{S}{z} = y \implies S = zy
     \]

   - Fact 3: There are z students in the class, where z > 5.

2. **Find the sum of scores excluding the highest and lowest scores:**
   - The total sum of all scores is S = zy.
   - The sum of the highest and lowest scores is H + L = 2x.
   - Therefore, the sum of the scores excluding the highest and lowest scores is:
     \[
     S - (H + L) = zy - 2x
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers:**
   - There are z students in total.
   - Excluding the highest and lowest scorers, there are z - 2 students.

4. **Find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers:**
   - The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is the sum of the scores excluding the highest and lowest scores divided by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}

How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?","To determine the interest accrued on Jerry's bond at maturity, we need to calculate the compound interest using the given information. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Principal Amount (P):**  
   The principal amount of the bond is $5,000.

2. **Determine the Annual Interest Rate (r):**  
   The annual interest rate is 12%.

3. **Identify the Compounding Frequency:**  
   The interest is compounded every six months, which means it is compounded semi-annually. Therefore, the number of compounding periods per year (n) is 2.

4. **Calculate the Interest Rate per Compounding Period:**  
   Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, we divide the annual interest rate by the number of compounding periods per year:
   \[
   \text{Interest rate per period} = \frac{12\%}{2} = 6\% = 0.06
   \]

5. **Determine the Total Number of Compounding Periods (t):**  
   The bond is for 1 year, and since it compounds semi-annually, there are 2 compounding periods in total.

6. **Use the Compound Interest Formula:**  
   The formula for compound interest is:
   \[
   A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
   \]
   where:
   - \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
   - \( P \) is the principal amount ($5,000).
   - \( r \) is the annual interest rate (0.12).
   - \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (2).
   - \( t \) is the time the money is invested for in years (1).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + \frac{0.12}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \left(1 + 0.06\right)^{2}
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \times (1.06)^2
   \]
   \[
   A = 5000 \times 1.1236
   \]
   \[
   A = 5618
   \]

7. **Calculate the Interest Accrued:**  
   The interest accrued is the total amount minus the principal:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618
   \]

Therefore, the interest accrued at maturity is \(\text{Final answer:}\{618\}\)."

1. **Original Length of the Ribbon**: According to fact1, the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm.

2. **Ratio of Reduction**: According to fact2, the length of the ribbon is reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that for every 5 units of the original length, it is now reduced to 3 units.

3. **Calculating the New Length**:
   - The original length is divided into 5 parts (as per the ratio 5:3).
   - Each part is \( \frac{30 \text{ cm}}{5} = 6 \text{ cm} \).
   - According to the ratio, the new length will be 3 parts of this size.
   - Therefore, the new length is \( 3 \times 6 \text{ cm} = 18 \text{ cm} \).

4. **Conclusion**: The length of the ribbon after reduction is 18 cm.

What is the probability that event B occurs? # Answer option: ['A)0.5', 'B)0.6', 'C)0.7', 'D)0.8', 'E)0.9']","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events and the formula for the probability of the union of two events.

Given:
- Events A and B are independent.
- Probability of event A, \( P(A) = 0.6 \).
- Probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring, \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \).

We need to find the probability of event B, \( P(B) \).

For independent events, the probability of the union of two events is given by:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Since A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B occurring is:
\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

Substituting this into the formula for the union, we get:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \times P(B) \]

We know:
\[ P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.6 \]

Substitute these values into the equation:
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \times P(B)) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) \]
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) \]
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) \]

Subtract 0.6 from both sides:
\[ 0.36 = 0.4P(B) \]

Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \]

Thus, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Let's denote:
- \( p \) as the percentage of students who passed.
- \( f \) as the percentage of students who failed.

Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, we have:
\[ p + f = 100 \]

We are given:
- The average score of passing students is 83.
- The average score of failing students is 55.
- The overall class average is 76.

The overall class average can be expressed as a weighted average of the passing and failing students' averages:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 55f}{100} \]

Substituting \( f = 100 - p \) into the equation:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 55(100 - p)}{100} \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 76 = \frac{83p + 5500 - 55p}{100} \]
\[ 76 = \frac{(83p - 55p) + 5500}{100} \]
\[ 76 = \frac{28p + 5500}{100} \]

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 7600 = 28p + 5500 \]

Subtract 5500 from both sides:
\[ 2100 = 28p \]

Divide both sides by 28 to solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{2100}{28} \]
\[ p = 75 \]

Thus, 75% of the class passed the test.

1. **Total Arrangements Without Condition:**
   - First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange the three children without any conditions. Since there are 3 children, the total number of permutations is given by \(3! = 6\).

2. **Applying the Condition (Susan is on the left of Tim):**
   - For each arrangement of the three children, there are two possible orders for Susan and Tim: either Susan is on the left of Tim, or Tim is on the left of Susan.
   - Therefore, exactly half of the total arrangements will have Susan on the left of Tim.

3. **Calculate the Number of Valid Arrangements:**
   - Since there are 6 total arrangements and half of them will have Susan on the left of Tim, the number of valid arrangements is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3\).

How many tempos can lift 29400 toys in one round? # Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)5', 'C)7', 'D)6', 'E)8']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tempos are required to lift 29,400 toys in one round.

1. **Calculate the number of toys in one box:**
   - According to fact1, five dozen toys are packed in a box.
   - One dozen equals 12, so five dozen equals \(5 \times 12 = 60\) toys.
   - Therefore, one box contains 60 toys.

2. **Calculate the total number of toys in one tempo:**
   - According to fact2, 98 boxes are kept in a tempo.
   - Since each box contains 60 toys, the total number of toys in one tempo is \(98 \times 60\).

The height of building, which casts a <fact3>shadow of length 28.75 metre</fact3> under similar conditions will be: # Answer option: ['A)12 metre', 'B)12.5 metre', 'C)13.5 metre', 'D)14 metre', 'E)15 metre']","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. When two objects cast shadows under similar conditions, the ratio of their heights is equal to the ratio of the lengths of their shadows.

Given:
- Height of the flagstaff = 17.5 meters
- Length of the flagstaff's shadow = 40.25 meters
- Length of the building's shadow = 28.75 meters

Let the height of the building be \( h \).

According to the concept of similar triangles, the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the building to the length of its shadow:

\[
\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \frac{h}{28.75}
\]

To find \( h \), we solve the equation:

\[
h = \frac{17.5 \times 28.75}{40.25}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
17.5 \times 28.75 = 503.125
\]

Now, divide by the denominator:

\[
h = \frac{503.125}{40.25} \approx 12.5
\]

Thus, the height of the building is approximately 12.5 meters.

239,"Two numbers are said to be <fact1>relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1</fact1>. <fact2>Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive</fact2>. What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000? # Answer option: ['A)5/7', 'B)3/5', 'C)4/7', 'D)2/5', 'E)2/7']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a number chosen from the set \( S \) is relatively prime to 1,000. 

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

- We are given that two numbers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1.
- The set \( S \) contains integers from 1 to 1,000, inclusive.
- We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen number from this set is relatively prime to 1,000.

**Step 2: Prime factorization of 1,000**

First, we find the prime factorization of 1,000:

\[ 1,000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3 \]

**Step 3: Use Euler's Totient Function**

Euler's Totient Function, \( \phi(n) \), gives the count of numbers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). The formula for Euler's Totient Function is:

\[ \phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\cdots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right) \]

where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m \) are the distinct prime factors of \( n \).

For \( n = 1,000 \), the distinct prime factors are 2 and 5. Thus, we have:

\[ \phi(1,000) = 1,000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right) \]

Calculating this:

\[ \phi(1,000) = 1,000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5} \]

\[ \phi(1,000) = 1,000 \times \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ \phi(1,000) = 400 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the probability**

The probability that a randomly chosen number from the set \( S \) is relatively prime to 1,000 is the ratio of the count of numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000 to the total number of numbers in the set \( S \).

The total number of numbers in \( S \) is 1,000.

Thus, the probability is:

\[ \frac{\phi(1,000)}{1,000} = \frac{400}{1,000} = \frac{2}{5} \]

**Step 5: Choose the correct answer**

The correct answer is option D) \( \frac{2}{5} \).

1. **Identify the radius of the circle**: The point is 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, so the radius \( r \) of the circle is 10 cm.

2. **Calculate the circumference of the circle**: The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   C = 2\pi r
   \]
   Substituting the radius:
   \[
   C = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of revolutions per second**: The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute. To find the number of revolutions per second, divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
   \[
   \text{Revolutions per second} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ revolutions per second}

4. **Calculate the total number of revolutions in 30 seconds**: Multiply the number of revolutions per second by the total time in seconds:
   \[
   \text{Total revolutions in 30 seconds} = 5 \times 30 = 150 \text{ revolutions}

1. **Calculate the fare for one child:**
   - According to the given information, the bus fare for a child is half the fare of one adult.
   - The fare for one adult is Rs. 140.
   - Therefore, the fare for one child is \( \frac{140}{2} = Rs. 70 \).

2. **Calculate the total fare for 4 adults:**
   - The fare for one adult is Rs. 140.

1. **Initial Inventory**: The store started with 600 golf balls in total.

2. **Golf Balls Sold**: By the end of the day, the store sold 80% of its inventory. 
   - 80% of 600 is calculated as follows: 
     \[
     0.8 \times 600 = 480
     \]
   So, the store sold 480 golf balls.

3. **Equal Number of Yellow and White Balls Sold**: The store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls sold is equal to the number of white golf balls sold. Let's denote the number of each type sold as \( x \). Thus:
   \[
   x + x = 480 \implies 2x = 480 \implies x = 240
   \]
   So, the store sold 240 yellow golf balls and 240 white golf balls.

4. **All White Golf Balls Sold**: The problem states that the store sold all of its white golf balls. Therefore, the store initially had 240 white golf balls.

5. **Initial Yellow Golf Balls**: Since the total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day was 600, and 240 of them were white, the number of yellow golf balls initially is:

What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur? # Answer option: ['A)0.22', 'B)0.26', 'C)0.37', 'D)0.46', 'E)0.63']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month. 

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that Stock A will increase in value, which is 0.56.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that Stock B will increase in value, which is 0.74.

We are interested in finding the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value. This is equivalent to finding the probability that both events do not occur, i.e., the probability that Stock A does not increase and Stock B does not increase.

The probability that Stock A does not increase is \( 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44 \).

The probability that Stock B does not increase is \( 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26 \).

To find the greatest probability that neither event occurs, we assume that the events are independent. Under this assumption, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases is the product of the probabilities that each does not increase:

\[ P(\text{Neither A nor B}) = P(\text{Not A}) \times P(\text{Not B}) = 0.44 \times 0.26. \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144. \]

However, the problem asks for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. The greatest value occurs when the events are mutually exclusive, meaning they cannot both happen at the same time. In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:

\[ 1 - \max(P(A), P(B)) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. \]

Thus, the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is 0.26.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the number of times the coin lands on heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin lands on tails.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of flips is 20, so \( H + T = 20 \).
2. The amount of money exchanged is such that neither wins or loses any money, which means the total money given by Christopher to Jonathan equals the total money given by Jonathan to Christopher.

The money exchanged can be expressed as:
- Christopher gives Jonathan $2 for each head, so he gives \( 2H \) dollars in total.
- Jonathan gives Christopher $3 for each tail, so he gives \( 3T \) dollars in total.

Since neither wins or loses any money, the total money exchanged must be equal:
\[ 2H = 3T \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the second equation, express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
\[ T = \frac{2H}{3} \]

Substitute this expression for \( T \) into the first equation:
\[ H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

Multiply through by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 3H + 2H = 60 \]

How many children are there in the row? # Answer option: ['A)23', 'B)27', 'C)26', 'D)28', 'E)29']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of children in the row based on the given facts.

1. **Initial Positions:**
   - Neha is 12th from the left end.
   - Radha is 6th from the right end.

2. **Shifts:**
   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left. So, her new position is 6 + 2 = 8th from the right end.
   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right. So, her new position is 12 + 2 = 14th from the left end.

3. **Position Relationship:**
   - After the shifts, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha.

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Children:**
   - Neha's new position is 14th from the left.
   - Radha's new position is 8th from the right.
   - The number of children between Neha and Radha is 6.

   Let's denote the total number of children as \( N \).

   Since Radha is 8th from the right, her position from the left is \( N - 8 + 1 \).

   According to the problem, the number of children between Neha and Radha is 6. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   (N - 8 + 1) - 14 = 6
   \]

   Simplifying the equation:

   \[
   N - 7 - 14 = 6
   \]

   \[
   N - 21 = 6
   \]

   \[
   N = 27
   \]

Thus, the total number of children in the row is 27.

0,"A <fact3>car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed</fact3>, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes <fact2>10 minutes</fact2> for the <fact1>angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°</fact1>. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower? # Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative speed. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A car is moving towards a tower.
   - The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Trigonometric Setup:**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - Let the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 45° be \( d_1 \).
   - Let the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 60° be \( d_2 \).

3. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d_1} \implies d_1 = h
     \]
   - When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d_2} \implies d_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

4. **Distance Travelled:**
   - The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - The distance travelled in 10 minutes is:
     \[
     d_1 - d_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]

5. **Speed of the Car:**
   - The speed of the car is the distance travelled divided by time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
     \]

6. **Time to Reach the Base:**
   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( d_2 \).
   - The time to cover this distance at the same speed is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{d_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
     \]
   - Simplifying this expression:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

7. **Rationalizing the Denominator:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
     \[
     \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - The time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \).

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.

The number of permutations of \( n \) distinct items is given by \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

For 4 books, the number of permutations is:
\[ 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \]

This means there are 24 different ways to arrange the 4 books.

According to <fact2>, Anna moves just one book every minute. Therefore, it would take her 1 minute to complete each arrangement.

**Step 1: Determine the composition of alloy X.**

Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. This can be simplified to 2:3. 

- Total parts in alloy X = 2 (zinc) + 3 (copper) = 5 parts.
- Zinc in alloy X = \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total weight.
- Copper in alloy X = \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total weight.

Given that we have 40 grams of alloy X:
- Zinc in 40 grams of alloy X = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 40 = 16\) grams.
- Copper in 40 grams of alloy X = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 40 = 24\) grams.

**Step 2: Determine the composition of alloy Y.**

Alloy Y is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11.

- Total parts in alloy Y = 7 (zinc) + 11 (copper) = 18 parts.
- Zinc in alloy Y = \(\frac{7}{18}\) of the total weight.
- Copper in alloy Y = \(\frac{11}{18}\) of the total weight.

Given that we have 60 grams of alloy Y:
- Zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y = \(\frac{7}{18} \times 60 = 23.33\) grams.
- Copper in 60 grams of alloy Y = \(\frac{11}{18} \times 60 = 36.67\) grams.

**Step 3: Combine the amounts to form alloy Z.**

Now, we combine the zinc and copper from both alloys to form alloy Z.

- Total zinc in alloy Z = 16 grams (from X) + 23.33 grams (from Y) = 39.33 grams.
- Total copper in alloy Z = 24 grams (from X) + 36.67 grams (from Y) = 60.67 grams.

**Step 4: Calculate the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.**

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{39.33}{60.67}
\]

To simplify this, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 to avoid decimals:
- Zinc: \(39.33 \times 3 = 118\)
- Copper: \(60.67 \times 3 = 182\)

Thus, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is approximately 118:182, which simplifies to 59:91.

Then how many values of M are more than 300. # Answer option: ['A)20', 'B)30', 'C)40', 'D)200', 'E)None']","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given facts and equations.

1. **Understanding the numbers M and N:**
   - \( M = 100a + 10b + c \) (since M is a three-digit number with digits a, b, and c)
   - \( N = 100c + 10b + a \) (since N is the number formed by reversing the digits of M)

2. **Given conditions:**
   - \( M > N \)
   - \( M - N + 396c = 990 \)

3. **Expressing M - N:**
   \[
   M - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
   \]

4. **Substituting into the equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990
   \]

5. **Simplifying the equation:**
   \[
   99(a - c) + 396c = 990 \implies 99a - 99c + 396c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a + 297c = 990
   \]
   \[
   99a = 990 - 297c
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{990 - 297c}{99}
   \]

6. **Simplifying further:**
   \[
   a = \frac{990}{99} - \frac{297c}{99}
   \]
   \[
   a = 10 - 3c
   \]

7. **Finding valid values for a and c:**
   - Since a is a digit (1 to 9 for a three-digit number), and c is a digit (0 to 9), we need to find integer solutions for \( a = 10 - 3c \).

8. **Checking possible values of c:**
   - If \( c = 0 \), then \( a = 10 \) (not valid since a must be a single digit)
   - If \( c = 1 \), then \( a = 7 \)
   - If \( c = 2 \), then \( a = 4 \)
   - If \( c = 3 \), then \( a = 1 \)
   - If \( c \geq 4 \), then \( a \) becomes negative or zero, which is not valid.

9. **Valid pairs (a, c):**
   - (7, 1), (4, 2), (1, 3)

10. **Calculating M for each valid pair:**
    - For (7, 1): \( M = 100 \times 7 + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b \)
    - For (4, 2): \( M = 100 \times 4 + 10b + 2 = 402 + 10b \)
    - For (1, 3): \( M = 100 \times 1 + 10b + 3 = 103 + 10b \)

11. **Finding values of M greater than 300:**
    - For (7, 1): \( M = 701 + 10b \) (all values are greater than 300)
    - For (4, 2): \( M = 402 + 10b \) (all values are greater than 300)
    - For (1, 3): \( M = 103 + 10b \) (none are greater than 300)

12. **Counting the number of valid M values:**
    - For (7, 1): \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
    - For (4, 2): \( b \) can be 0 to 9, giving 10 values.
    - Total = 10 + 10 = 20 values.

Therefore, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is 20.

1. **Initial Charge:**
   - The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. 
   - Subtract this from the total amount you have: $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 remaining.

2. **Cost for Additional Distance:**
   - Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents.
   - With $5.00 remaining, calculate how many additional quarter-miles you can afford: $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles.

3. **Total Distance Calculation:**
   - The first quarter-mile is already covered by the initial charge.
   - You can travel 50 additional quarter-miles with the remaining money.
   - Total quarter-miles = 1 (initial) + 50 (additional) = 51 quarter-miles.

4. **Convert Quarter-Miles to Miles:**
   - There are 4 quarter-miles in a mile.

If the <fact2>area of each of triangle is 70 square feet</fact2>, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth? # Answer option: ['A)56', 'B)58', 'C)60', 'D)62', 'E)64']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of the original square piece of cloth and then calculate its perimeter.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge of the square is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) (original side) and \( s - 4 \) (trimmed side).
   - The area of the rectangle is \( s \times (s - 4) \).

3. **Area of the Triangles:**
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally to form two right-angled triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is half the area of the rectangle.
   - Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \( 2 \times 70 = 140 \) square feet.

4. **Formulating the Equation:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given by:
     \[
     s \times (s - 4) = 140
     \]
   - Expanding and rearranging gives:
     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
   - Rearranging further:
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]

5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We solve the quadratic equation \( s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140) = 16 + 560 = 576
     \]
   - The square root of 576 is 24.
   - Therefore, the solutions for \( s \) are:
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - This gives \( s = 14 \) or \( s = -10 \). Since a side length cannot be negative, \( s = 14 \).

1. **Manufacturer's Discount:**
   - The manufacturer offers a 20% discount on the original price of the tubeless tyres.

2. **Retailer's Additional Discount:**
   - The retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the price after the manufacturer's discount has been applied.

Let's calculate the effective total discount step by step:

- **Step 1:** Calculate the price after the manufacturer's discount.
  - Let the original price of the tyres be \( P \).
  - After a 20% manufacturer's discount, the price becomes \( P - 0.20P = 0.80P \).

- **Step 2:** Calculate the price after the retailer's additional discount.
  - The retailer offers a 20% discount on the price after the manufacturer's discount, which is \( 0.80P \).
  - The additional discount is \( 0.20 \times 0.80P = 0.16P \).
  - Therefore, the price after the retailer's discount is \( 0.80P - 0.16P = 0.64P \).

- **Step 3:** Calculate the total discount.
  - The total discount is the reduction from the original price \( P \) to the final price \( 0.64P \).
  - The total discount amount is \( P - 0.64P = 0.36P \).
  - Therefore, the total discount percentage is \( \frac{0.36P}{P} \times 100\% = 36\% \).

Thus, the total discount available at the retailer is 36%.

Let's analyze the given facts:

1. **Fact 1**: If you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. **Fact 2**: If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes.

Let's denote:
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( S \) as the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.

### Analyzing Fact 1:
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.

The equation for Fact 1 is:
\[ S - 20 = 10v \]

### Analyzing Fact 2:
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken to reach the bottom is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.

The equation for Fact 2 is:
\[ S - 10 = 20v \]

### Solving the Equations:
We have two equations:
1. \( S - 20 = 10v \)
2. \( S - 10 = 20v \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (S - 10) - (S - 20) = 20v - 10v \]
\[ 10 = 10v \]
\[ v = 1 \]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack? # Answer option: ['A)2', 'B)3', 'C)4', 'D)5', 'E)6']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of ties you must take out to ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color. This is a classic problem that can be approached using the Pigeonhole Principle.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the different colors and their quantities:**
   - Red: 8 ties
   - Violet: 13 ties
   - Blue: 10 ties
   - Pink: 5 ties
   - Green: 4 ties

2. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:**
   - The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.
   - In this context, the ""containers"" are the colors, and the ""items"" are the ties.

3. **Determine the worst-case scenario:**
   - To avoid having two ties of the same color, you would need to pick one tie of each color first. This means picking 5 ties (one of each color: red, violet, blue, pink, and green).

4. **Ensure at least two ties of the same color:**
   - After picking one tie of each color (5 ties), the next tie you pick (the 6th tie) will definitely be a duplicate of one of the colors you have already picked.

1. **Understanding the Structure:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm, because the thickness is subtracted from both sides.

2. **Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The entire cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - The outer cube (5 cm) consists of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) smaller cubes.
   - The inner hollow part (3 cm) consists of \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) smaller cubes.

3. **Cubes in the Shell:**
   - The number of smaller cubes that form the shell (the part that is not hollow) is the difference between the total number of cubes in the outer cube and the inner hollow part: \(125 - 27 = 98\).

4. **Painting the Outer Surface:**
   - When the outer surface is painted, only the cubes on the outermost layer are affected.
   - The outermost layer consists of the cubes on the surface of the 5 cm cube.

5. **Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - When the outer surface is painted, only the outer faces of the outermost layer are painted.
   - The cubes that are not on the outermost layer will have all their faces unpainted.
   - The inner hollow part (3 cm cube) is not painted at all, so all its faces remain unpainted.

6. **Calculating Unpainted Faces:**
   - The inner hollow part consists of 27 smaller cubes, each with 6 unpainted faces.
   - Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is \(27 \times 6 = 162\).

7. **Considering the Shell:**
   - The shell consists of 98 smaller cubes.
   - The cubes on the outermost layer of the shell will have some faces painted, but the inner faces (facing the hollow part) will remain unpainted.
   - The cubes on the inner surface of the shell (facing the hollow part) will have 5 faces unpainted (since only the face exposed to the outer surface is painted).

8. **Calculating Unpainted Faces in the Shell:**
   - The inner surface of the shell (the part facing the hollow cube) consists of a 3 cm cube, which is \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\) cubes.
   - Each of these 27 cubes has 5 unpainted faces.
   - Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces in the shell is \(27 \times 5 = 135\).

9. **Total Unpainted Faces:**
   - The total number of unpainted faces is the sum of unpainted faces from the hollow part and the shell: \(162 + 135 = 297\).

However, it seems there is a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:

- The inner hollow part (3 cm cube) has 27 cubes, each with 6 unpainted faces: \(27 \times 6 = 162\).
- The shell has 98 cubes, but only the inner surface of the shell (facing the hollow part) will have unpainted faces.
- The inner surface of the shell (3 cm cube) has 54 cubes (since it includes the outer layer of the 3 cm cube), each with 5 unpainted faces: \(54 \times 5 = 270\).

Re-evaluating the total unpainted faces:

- Total unpainted faces = \(162 + 270 = 432\).

This still doesn't match any of the given options. Let's consider the possibility of a mistake in the options or the problem statement. However, based on the given options, the closest logical answer considering potential misinterpretation or error in the problem statement is:

Final answer: {A}"
