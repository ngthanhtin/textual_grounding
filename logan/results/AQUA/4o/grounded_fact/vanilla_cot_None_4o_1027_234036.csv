216,"5 horses are in a race. Mr.Jain selects two of horses at random and bets on them. The probability that he selected the winning horse is
# Answer option: ['A)1/5', 'B)2/5', 'C)3/5', 'D)4/5', 'E)6/5']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse when he randomly selects two horses out of the five.

1. **Total number of ways to select two horses from five:**
   The number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( r \) is the number of items to choose. So, we have:
   \[
   \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]

2. **Number of favorable outcomes:**
   For Mr. Jain to have selected the winning horse, the winning horse must be one of the two horses he selects. There is only 1 winning horse in the race. Once the winning horse is selected, Mr. Jain can choose any of the remaining 4 horses to complete his selection of two horses. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 1 horse from the remaining 4 horses:
   \[
   \binom{4}{1} = 4
   \]

3. **Probability calculation:**
   The probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

Thus, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

98,"Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?""
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. ""How much does Meenu weigh?
# Answer option: ['A)12', 'B)28', 'C)27', 'D)58', 'E)91']","To solve the problem, we need to determine Meenu's weight based on the information she provided.

Meenu said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight."" Let's denote Meenu's weight as \( x \).

According to her statement, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 29 + \frac{x}{2} \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying the entire equation by 2:
\[ 2x = 58 + x \]

Next, we subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 2x - x = 58 \]
\[ x = 58 \]

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

Now, let's verify the answer with the given options:
- A) 12
- B) 28
- C) 27
- D) 58
- E) 91

The correct answer is option D) 58.

194,"Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds, 40 seconds and 48 seconds, respectively. They start ringing together at a particular time. When they will ring together again?
# Answer option: ['A)After 6 minutes', 'B)After 12 minutes', 'C)After 18 minutes', 'D)After 24 minutes', 'E)none']","To determine when the three bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their ringing intervals: 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 48 seconds.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**
- 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
- 40 = 2^3 * 5
- 48 = 2^4 * 3

**Step 2: Determine the LCM**
The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:

- The highest power of 2 is 2^4 (from 48).
- The highest power of 3 is 3^2 (from 36).
- The highest power of 5 is 5 (from 40).

Thus, the LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5.

**Step 3: Calculate the LCM**
- 2^4 = 16
- 3^2 = 9
- 5 = 5

Now, multiply these together:
- 16 * 9 = 144
- 144 * 5 = 720

The LCM of 36, 40, and 48 is 720 seconds.

**Step 4: Convert Seconds to Minutes**
720 seconds is equal to 720 / 60 = 12 minutes.

Therefore, the three bells will ring together again after 12 minutes.

227,"A box contains a certain number of balls, marked successively from 1 to n. If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected, then what is the value of n?
# Answer option: ['A)11', 'B)10', 'C)9', 'D)8', 'E)7']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of balls, \( n \), in the box such that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without selecting the ball marked with the number 3.

First, let's consider the total number of balls, \( n \). If we exclude the ball marked with the number 3, we have \( n - 1 \) balls remaining.

The number of ways to choose 2 balls from \( n - 1 \) balls is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\]

We are given that this number of combinations is 45:

\[
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = 45
\]

To solve for \( n \), we first multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
(n-1)(n-2) = 90
\]

Next, we expand the left side:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90
\]

Subtract 90 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

\[
n^2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0
\]

\[
n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0
\]

Now, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -88 \):

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

\[
n = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-88)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 352}}{2}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{361}}{2}
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 \pm 19}{2}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{3 + 19}{2} = 11
\]

\[
n = \frac{3 - 19}{2} = -8
\]

Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we discard \( n = -8 \) and accept \( n = 11 \).

Thus, the value of \( n \) is 11.

107,"x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days. How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?
# Answer option: ['A)x2/y2 units', 'B)y3/x2 units', 'C)x3/y2 units', 'D)y2/x2 units', 'E)None of these']","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of men, the number of hours they work per day, the number of days they work, and the amount of work they can complete.

Given:
- \( x \) men working \( x \) hours per day can complete \( x \) units of work in \( x \) days.

From this, we can deduce the total amount of work done in terms of man-hours:
- Total man-hours required to complete \( x \) units of work = \( x \) men \(\times\) \( x \) hours/day \(\times\) \( x \) days = \( x^3 \) man-hours.

Now, we need to find out how much work \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day can complete in \( y \) days.

The total man-hours available with \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day for \( y \) days is:
- Total man-hours available = \( y \) men \(\times\) \( y \) hours/day \(\times\) \( y \) days = \( y^3 \) man-hours.

Since \( x^3 \) man-hours are required to complete \( x \) units of work, the amount of work that can be completed with \( y^3 \) man-hours is proportional to the ratio of \( y^3 \) to \( x^3 \).

The work completed by \( y \) men in \( y \) days working \( y \) hours per day is:
- Work completed = \( x \) units \(\times\) \(\frac{y^3}{x^3}\).

Now, let's simplify this expression:
- Work completed = \(\frac{y^3}{x^3} \times x = \frac{y^3 \times x}{x^3} = \frac{y^3}{x^2}\).

Thus, the amount of work that can be completed by \( y \) men working \( y \) hours per day in \( y \) days is \(\frac{y^3}{x^2}\) units.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

10,"A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
# Answer option: ['A)226', 'B)230', 'C)240', 'D)260', 'E)280']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum selling price per component that will ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

1. **Calculate the Total Yearly Production Cost:**
   - The company produces 420 units per month.
   - The production cost per component is $110.
   - Total production cost per month = 420 units * $110/unit = $46,200.
   - Total production cost per year = $46,200/month * 12 months = $554,400.

2. **Determine the Required Yearly Revenue:**
   - The desired yearly profit is $626,400.
   - Yearly profit = Yearly revenue - Yearly production cost.
   - Therefore, Yearly revenue = Yearly profit + Yearly production cost.
   - Yearly revenue = $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,080,800.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Selling Price per Component:**
   - The company sells 420 units per month, so in a year, it sells 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units.
   - To find the minimum selling price per component, divide the required yearly revenue by the total number of units sold in a year.
   - Minimum selling price per component = $1,080,800 / 5,040 units = $214.68.

4. **Choose the Minimum Selling Price from the Options:**
   - The minimum selling price must be at least $214.68 to achieve the desired profit.
   - From the given options, the smallest price that is greater than or equal to $214.68 is $226.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit is at least $626,400 is $226.

66,"One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?
# Answer option: ['A)8.5', 'B)10.5', 'C)12.5', 'D)14.5', 'E)16.5']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of the health food are required to meet at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamin E and vitamin A.

1. **Vitamin E Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     9\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{9\%} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11
     \]

2. **Vitamin A Requirement:**
   - Each gram of the health food provides 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A.
   - To find out how many grams are needed to meet 100% of the requirement, we set up the equation:
     \[
     8\% \times \text{grams} = 100\%
     \]
   - Solving for grams:
     \[
     \text{grams} = \frac{100\%}{8\%} = \frac{100}{8} = 12.5
     \]

3. **Determine the Maximum Requirement:**
   - To satisfy both vitamin requirements, we need to take the maximum of the two calculated values because we need to meet at least 100% of both vitamins.
   - The maximum of 11.11 grams (for vitamin E) and 12.5 grams (for vitamin A) is 12.5 grams.

Therefore, to meet at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, one must consume at least 12.5 grams of the health food daily.

# Answer option: ['A)4 1/3 km/h', 'B)7 2/3 km/h', 'C)9 ½ km/h', 'D)8 km/h', 'E)81 km/h']","To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then divide the total distance by the total time.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - Distance traveled at 5 km/h for 6 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{km/h} \times 6 \, \text{h} = 30 \, \text{km}
     \]
   - Distance traveled at 4 km/h for 12 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 4 \, \text{km/h} \times 12 \, \text{h} = 48 \, \text{km}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{km} + 48 \, \text{km} = 78 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 6 \, \text{h} + 12 \, \text{h} = 18 \, \text{h}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{78 \, \text{km}}{18 \, \text{h}} = 4.3333 \, \text{km/h}
   \]

5. **Convert the average speed to a fraction:**
   \[
   4.3333 \, \text{km/h} = 4 \frac{1}{3} \, \text{km/h}

# Answer option: ['A)15 kmph', 'B)6 kmph', 'C)12 kmph', 'D)14 kmph', 'E)6 kmph']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the man's rate along the current. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The man's rowing rate in still water is 4 kmph.
2. The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.

Let's denote:
- \( v_b \) as the man's rowing speed in still water (4 kmph).
- \( v_c \) as the speed of the current.
- \( v_{against} \) as the man's speed against the current (2 kmph).
- \( v_{along} \) as the man's speed along the current.

The man's speed against the current can be expressed as:
\[ v_{against} = v_b - v_c \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 2 = 4 - v_c \]

Solving for \( v_c \):
\[ v_c = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ kmph} \]

Now, we need to find the man's speed along the current, which can be expressed as:

# Answer option: ['A)1,879', 'B)1,875', 'C)1,876', 'D)1,872', 'E)1,800']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the marked price of the sewing machine such that after offering a 20% discount, Karan still makes a 20% profit on the cost price.

1. **Determine the Selling Price for 20% Profit:**
   - The cost price (CP) of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
   - Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price.
   - Profit = 20% of CP = 0.20 * 1200 = Rs. 240.
   - Therefore, the selling price (SP) should be CP + Profit = 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440.

2. **Determine the Marked Price for a 20% Discount:**
   - Let the marked price be \( M \).
   - Karan offers a 20% discount on the marked price.
   - The selling price after the discount is 80% of the marked price (since 100% - 20% = 80%).
   - Therefore, 0.80 * M = 1440.

3. **Solve for the Marked Price:**
   - \( M = \frac{1440}{0.80} \).
   - \( M = 1800 \).

Thus, the marked price should be Rs. 1800 to achieve a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.

1. **Determine the cost of one bottle in cents:**
   - If 27 bottles cost A cents, then the cost of one bottle is \( \frac{A}{27} \) cents.

2. **Determine the cost of B bottles in cents:**
   - If one bottle costs \( \frac{A}{27} \) cents, then B bottles will cost \( B \times \frac{A}{27} = \frac{AB}{27} \) cents.

3. **Convert the cost from cents to dollars:**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, to convert the cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100.
   - Therefore, the cost of B bottles in dollars is \( \frac{AB}{27} \div 100 = \frac{AB}{2700} \).

200,"The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is?
# Answer option: ['A)10%', 'B)12%', 'C)6%', 'D)8%', 'E)4%']","To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of interest at which the difference between the compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for Rs. 5000 over 2 years is Rs. 72.

Let's denote:
- Principal (P) = Rs. 5000
- Time (T) = 2 years
- Rate of interest (R) = unknown

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{S.I.} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

The formula for compound interest is:
\[ \text{C.I.} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P \]

The difference between compound interest and simple interest is given as Rs. 72:
\[ \text{C.I.} - \text{S.I.} = 72 \]

Substituting the formulas, we have:
\[ P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - P - \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} = 72 \]

Substitute \( P = 5000 \) and \( T = 2 \):
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - \frac{5000 \times R \times 2}{100} = 72 \]

Simplify:
\[ 5000 \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 5000 - 100R = 72 \]

Divide the entire equation by 5000 to simplify:
\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{100R}{5000} = \frac{72}{5000} \]

\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 - 1 - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Expand the square:
\[ \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000} \]

Substitute back:
\[ 1 + \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000} - 1 - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Simplify:
\[ \frac{2R}{100} + \frac{R^2}{10000} - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

Combine terms:
\[ \frac{R^2}{10000} + \frac{R}{50} - \frac{R}{50} = 0.0144 \]

\[ \frac{R^2}{10000} = 0.0144 \]

Multiply through by 10000 to clear the fraction:
\[ R^2 = 144 \]

Take the square root of both sides:
\[ R = 12 \]

Thus, the rate of interest is 12%.

# Answer option: ['A)100', 'B)120', 'C)50', 'D)200', 'E)80']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people who took the survey.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - 60% of the survey participants were women.
   - 40% of the survey participants were men (since 100% - 60% = 40%).
   - 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars.
   - 10 men preferred green cars over red cars.

2. **Calculate the number of men who preferred green cars:**
   - If 75% of the men preferred red cars, then 25% of the men preferred green cars (since 100% - 75% = 25%).
   - We know that 25% of the men equals 10 men (since 10 men preferred green cars).

3. **Calculate the total number of men:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of men.
   - 25% of \( x \) is equal to 10 men.
   - Therefore, \( 0.25x = 10 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{10}{0.25} = 40 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of people who took the survey:**
   - Since 40% of the survey participants were men, and there are 40 men, we can set up the equation:
   - Let \( y \) be the total number of people who took the survey.
   - 40% of \( y \) is equal to 40 men.
   - Therefore, \( 0.40y = 40 \).

What is the probability of the man catching the first train?
# Answer option: ['A)0.9', 'B)0.8', 'C)0.6', 'D)0.65', 'E)1.5']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of the man catching the first train that arrives at the station. Let's break down the situation:

1. **Train Schedules:**
   - The main line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:00 A.M. So, the main line train arrives at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, 5:30, etc.
   - The harbor line train arrives every 10 minutes starting at 5:02 A.M. So, the harbor line train arrives at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, 5:32, etc.

2. **Time Intervals:**
   - From 5:00 to 5:02, the main line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:02 to 5:10, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:10 to 5:12, the main line train is the first to arrive.
   - From 5:12 to 5:20, the harbor line train is the first to arrive.
   - This pattern repeats every 10 minutes.

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   - In each 10-minute cycle, the main line train is the first to arrive for 2 minutes (from 5:00 to 5:02 and from 5:10 to 5:12).
   - The harbor line train is the first to arrive for 8 minutes (from 5:02 to 5:10 and from 5:12 to 5:20).

4. **Probability of Catching the First Train:**
   - The probability that the man catches the main line train (first train) is the ratio of the time intervals when the main line train is the first to arrive to the total time interval.
   - Probability = (Time interval for main line train being first) / (Total time interval)
   - Probability = 2 minutes / 10 minutes = 0.2

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train (main line train) is 0.2.

   - He is traveling at 70 mph towards B, so in 1 hour, he would cover 70 miles, reaching B.

3. **Time Calculation:**
   - Since he is 70 miles away from B and traveling at 70 mph, it takes him 1 hour to reach B.
   - After reaching B, he immediately turns around and heads back to A.
   - The total time from the point he is 70 miles away from B to the end of his trip is 3 hours.
   - Therefore, after reaching B, he has 2 hours left to complete his trip back to A.

4. **Distance Calculation:**
   - In the 2 hours after reaching B, Kevin travels back to A at 90 mph.
   - Distance covered in 2 hours at 90 mph = 90 mph * 2 hours = 180 miles.

5. **Distance Between A and B:**
   - Since the distance from B to A is 180 miles, the distance from A to B is also 180 miles (as the distance is the same in both directions).

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 180 miles.

91,"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800. In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs.2040. In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays. The bill for that month would be :
# Answer option: ['A)Rs.1560', 'B)Rs.1680', 'C)Rs.1840', 'D)Rs.1950', 'E)Rs.1690']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the fixed and variable components of the telephone bill.

Let's denote:
- \( F \) as the fixed part of the bill.
- \( V \) as the variable cost per call.

From the problem, we have two scenarios:

1. For 540 calls, the bill is Rs.1800:
   \[
   F + 540V = 1800
   \]

2. For 620 calls, the bill is Rs.2040:
   \[
   F + 620V = 2040
   \]

We have two equations:
1. \( F + 540V = 1800 \)
2. \( F + 620V = 2040 \)

To find \( V \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(F + 620V) - (F + 540V) = 2040 - 1800
\]
\[
620V - 540V = 240
\]
\[
80V = 240
\]
\[
V = \frac{240}{80} = 3
\]

Now that we have \( V = 3 \), we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( F \). Using the first equation:
\[
F + 540 \times 3 = 1800
\]
\[
F + 1620 = 1800
\]
\[
F = 1800 - 1620 = 180
\]

Now we have:
- Fixed cost \( F = 180 \)
- Variable cost per call \( V = 3 \)

For a month with 500 calls, the bill would be:
\[
F + 500V = 180 + 500 \times 3
\]
\[
= 180 + 1500
\]
\[
= 1680
\]

Therefore, the bill for the month with 500 calls is Rs.1680.

149,"A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
# Answer option: ['A)1 hr 23 min', 'B)1 hr 15 min', 'C)1 hr 8 min', 'D)56 min', 'E)55 min']","To solve this problem, we need to determine when the two trains cross each other. Let's break down the information given:

1. Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am. Therefore, the travel time for Train M is 4 hours.

2. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am. Therefore, the travel time for Train N is 3.5 hours.

Next, we need to calculate the speeds of the trains. Since the distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains, we can use the formula: 

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is \( D \).

- Speed of Train M = \( \frac{D}{4} \)
- Speed of Train N = \( \frac{D}{3.5} = \frac{2D}{7} \)

Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains meet. Train M starts at 5 am, and Train N starts at 7 am. Therefore, by the time Train N starts, Train M has already been traveling for 2 hours.

In 2 hours, Train M covers a distance of:

\[ \text{Distance covered by Train M in 2 hours} = 2 \times \frac{D}{4} = \frac{D}{2} \]

This means that when Train N starts at 7 am, Train M has already covered half the distance between City A and City B.

Now, the remaining distance for both trains to meet is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The relative speed of the two trains when they are moving towards each other is the sum of their speeds:

\[ \text{Relative speed} = \frac{D}{4} + \frac{2D}{7} = \frac{7D}{28} + \frac{8D}{28} = \frac{15D}{28} \]

The time taken for the trains to meet is given by:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{\frac{D}{2}}{\frac{15D}{28}} = \frac{D}{2} \times \frac{28}{15D} = \frac{28}{30} = \frac{14}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Convert \(\frac{14}{15}\) hours into minutes:

\[ \frac{14}{15} \times 60 = 56 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the two trains will meet 56 minutes after 7 am, which is at 7:56 am.

228,"If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, which of the following must be true about Q?
I. Q is the square of a prime number.
II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.
III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.
# Answer option: ['A)I only', 'B)III only', 'C)II only', 'D)I and II only', 'E)I and III only']","To determine which statements must be true about a positive integer \( Q \) that has exactly 5 factors, we need to analyze the possible forms of \( Q \).

The number of factors of a positive integer \( n \) with the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \) is given by the formula:

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For \( Q \) to have exactly 5 factors, the product of the increments of the exponents must equal 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to achieve this is if one of the increments is 5 and all others are 1. This implies that \( Q \) must be of the form \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number.

Now, let's evaluate each statement:

I. **Q is the square of a prime number.**

If \( Q = p^2 \), then the number of factors would be \( (2 + 1) = 3 \), which is not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.

II. **Q is the fourth power of a prime number.**

If \( Q = p^4 \), then the number of factors would be \( (4 + 1) = 5 \). This matches the condition given in the problem. Therefore, this statement is true.

III. **Q is the product of two prime numbers.**

If \( Q = p_1 \times p_2 \), where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes, then the number of factors would be \( (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \), which is not 5. Therefore, this statement is false.

Based on the analysis, only statement II is true. Therefore, the correct answer is:

# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)8', 'C)22', 'D)50', 'E)20']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work on the yacht.

1. **Determine Jack's rate of work:**
   - Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours. Therefore, his rate of work is \( \frac{1}{12} \) of the yacht per hour.

2. **Calculate the work Jack has already done:**
   - Jack finishes two-thirds of the work. Therefore, the work he has completed is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the yacht.

3. **Determine the remaining work:**
   - The remaining work is \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \) of the yacht.

4. **Determine Jill's rate of work:**
   - Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate. Therefore, Jill's rate is \( 0.05 \times \frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{240} \) of the yacht per hour.

5. **Calculate the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work:**
   - Jill needs to complete \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the yacht. The time \( t \) it takes her to do this is given by the equation:
     \[
     \text{Work} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}

# Answer option: ['A)272 minutes', 'B)304 minutes', 'C)190 minutes', 'D)70 minutes', 'E)35 minutes']","To determine when both trains will leave the station simultaneously again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two departure intervals: 16 minutes for Train A and 17 minutes for Train B.

1. **Identify the numbers**: We have 16 and 17.

2. **Prime factorization**:
   - 16 is \(2^4\).
   - 17 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is \(17^1\).

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   - The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.
   - For 2, the highest power is \(2^4\).
   - For 17, the highest power is \(17^1\).

4. **Multiply these together**:

# Answer option: ['A)3km', 'B)2km', 'C)4km', 'D)5km', 'E)6km']","To determine how far A is from the starting point, we can break down the movements step by step and calculate the net displacement.

1. **Initial Position:** Let's assume A starts at the origin point (0, 0).

2. **Travel South 3 km:** 
   - Moving south decreases the y-coordinate.
   - New position: (0, -3).

3. **Travel East 5 km:** 
   - Moving east increases the x-coordinate.
   - New position: (5, -3).

4. **Travel North 3 km:**

5. **Travel West 2 km:** 
   - Moving west decreases the x-coordinate.
   - New position: (3, 0).

Now, we need to calculate the distance from the final position (3, 0) back to the starting point (0, 0).

The distance can be calculated using the distance formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}

# Answer option: ['A)L(x,y) = R(x,y)', 'B)L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)', 'C)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'D)L(x,y) < R(x,y)', 'E)None']","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the expressions \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \) and \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \) and determine if there are any conditions under which these expressions are equal or not equal for positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Floor Function:**
   - The floor function \([x]\) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \).
   - For any real number \( x \), we can express it as \( x = n + f \) where \( n = [x] \) is an integer and \( 0 \leq f < 1 \) is the fractional part.

2. **Expression for \( L(x, y) \):**
   - \( L(x, y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] \).
   - Let \( x = a + u \) and \( y = b + v \) where \( a = [x] \), \( b = [y] \), \( 0 \leq u < 1 \), and \( 0 \leq v < 1 \).
   - Then, \( x + y = (a + b) + (u + v) \).
   - The floor of \( x + y \) is \([x + y] = a + b + [u + v]\).
   - If \( u + v < 1 \), then \([u + v] = 0\).
   - If \( u + v \geq 1 \), then \([u + v] = 1\).

3. **Expression for \( R(x, y) \):**
   - \( R(x, y) = [2x] + [2y] \).
   - \( 2x = 2a + 2u \) and \( 2y = 2b + 2v \).
   - \([2x] = 2a + [2u]\) and \([2y] = 2b + [2v]\).
   - \([2u]\) is 0 if \( 0 \leq u < 0.5 \) and 1 if \( 0.5 \leq u < 1 \).
   - \([2v]\) is 0 if \( 0 \leq v < 0.5 \) and 1 if \( 0.5 \leq v < 1 \).

4. **Comparing \( L(x, y) \) and \( R(x, y) \):**
   - \( L(x, y) = a + b + (a + b + [u + v]) = 2a + 2b + [u + v] \).
   - \( R(x, y) = 2a + 2b + [2u] + [2v] \).

5. **Conditions for Equality:**
   - For \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \), we need \([u + v] = [2u] + [2v]\).
   - If \( u + v < 1 \), then \([u + v] = 0\).
     - If both \( u < 0.5 \) and \( v < 0.5 \), then \([2u] = 0\) and \([2v] = 0\), so \( [2u] + [2v] = 0 \).
     - If one of \( u \) or \( v \) is \(\geq 0.5\), then \([2u] + [2v] = 1\), which is not equal to \([u + v] = 0\).
   - If \( u + v \geq 1 \), then \([u + v] = 1\).
     - This requires that at least one of \( u \) or \( v \) is \(\geq 0.5\), making \([2u] + [2v] = 1\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - It is possible to find \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \) by choosing \( u \) and \( v \) such that both are less than 0.5 or both are greater than or equal to 0.5.
   - Therefore, it is not impossible to find such \( x \) and \( y \).

The correct answer is that it is not impossible to find \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( L(x, y) = R(x, y) \). Therefore, the answer is not option A. The correct answer is that it is possible to find such \( x \) and \( y \), so the answer is not option B either.

# Answer option: ['A)3', 'B)4', 'C)5', 'D)10', 'E)20']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of letters required to create unique codes for 10 different types of books, using either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

Let's break down the possibilities:

1. **Single Letter Codes:**
   - If we use \( n \) different letters, we can create \( n \) unique single-letter codes.

2. **Pair of Letters Codes:**
   - If we use \( n \) different letters, the number of unique pairs of two different letters is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

The total number of unique codes we can create using \( n \) letters is the sum of single-letter codes and pair-of-letters codes:
\[
n + \binom{n}{2} = n + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

We need this total to be at least 10, as there are 10 types of books.

Let's calculate this for different values of \( n \):

- **For \( n = 3 \):**
  \[
  3 + \binom{3}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6
  \]
  This is not enough, as we need at least 10.

- **For \( n = 4 \):**
  \[
  4 + \binom{4}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10
  \]
  This is exactly 10, which is sufficient.

- **For \( n = 5 \):**
  \[
  5 + \binom{5}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15
  \]
  This exceeds 10, but we are looking for the smallest \( n \).

Since \( n = 4 \) is the smallest number of letters that allows us to create at least 10 unique codes, the answer is 4.

136,"For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)0']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of copper coins the diver could have brought up to earn exactly $3.40, given that she earns 20 cents per copper coin and 25 cents per brass coin.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of copper coins.
- \( y \) as the number of brass coins.

The total earnings equation based on the coins is:
\[ 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40 \]

To eliminate decimals, multiply the entire equation by 100:
\[ 20x + 25y = 340 \]

We need to find the minimum value of \( x \) (copper coins) such that the equation holds true with \( x \) and \( y \) being non-negative integers.

First, let's express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ 25y = 340 - 20x \]
\[ y = \frac{340 - 20x}{25} \]

For \( y \) to be an integer, \( 340 - 20x \) must be divisible by 25. Let's check the values of \( x \) starting from the smallest possible integer:

1. **\( x = 0 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{340 - 20 \times 0}{25} = \frac{340}{25} = 13.6 \]
   \( y \) is not an integer.

2. **\( x = 1 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{340 - 20 \times 1}{25} = \frac{320}{25} = 12.8 \]
   \( y \) is not an integer.

3. **\( x = 2 \):**
   \[ y = \frac{340 - 20 \times 2}{25} = \frac{300}{25} = 12 \]
   \( y \) is an integer.

Since \( y \) is an integer when \( x = 2 \), this is the minimum number of copper coins that satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 2.

# Answer option: ['A)2000', 'B)4000', 'C)8000', 'D)16000', 'E)32000']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flowers the bee flies by in order to bypass 8 flowers, given that it bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters.

1. **Understand the percentage bypassed**: The bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by. This means that for every 100 flowers it encounters, it bypasses 0.05 flowers.

2. **Set up the equation**: We need to find the total number of flowers, \( x \), that the bee flies by to bypass 8 flowers. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   0.05\% \times x = 8

3. **Convert percentage to a decimal**: 0.05% as a decimal is 0.0005.

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   0.0005 \times x = 8

# Answer option: ['A)9', 'B)7', 'C)3', 'D)8', 'E)12']","To determine the largest integral value of \( k \) for which the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \) has two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant \( \Delta \) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero:

\[
\Delta > 0
\]

In the given equation \( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = k \). Substituting these values into the discriminant formula gives:

\[
\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot k = 25 - 4k
\]

We require:

\[
25 - 4k > 0
\]

Solving this inequality for \( k \):

\[
25 > 4k
\]

\[
\frac{25}{4} > k
\]

\[
k < 6.25
\]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Therefore, the largest integral value of \( k \) for which the quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots is 6.

Thus, the final answer is:

154,"The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
# Answer option: ['A)2.6m', 'B)3.9m', 'C)4m', 'D)4.2m', 'E)4.4m']","To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the room given the cost of papering the walls and the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Ratio:**
   - The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5.
   - Let the height of the room be \( h \).
   - Let the semi-perimeter of the room be \( s \).
   - According to the ratio, \( \frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5} \) or \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).

2. **Cost of Papering the Walls:**
   - The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260.
   - The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters.
   - The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total length of paper used is \( \frac{260}{2} = 130 \) meters.

3. **Calculating the Area Covered by the Paper:**
   - The area covered by the paper is the length of the paper multiplied by its width.
   - Area covered = \( 130 \times 0.5 = 65 \) square meters.

4. **Adjusting for Doors and Windows:**
   - An area of 15 square meters is allowed for doors and windows.
   - Therefore, the actual area of the walls to be papered is \( 65 + 15 = 80 \) square meters.

5. **Relating Area to Room Dimensions:**
   - The area of the walls is given by the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height.
   - Let the perimeter of the room be \( P \).
   - The area of the walls is \( P \times h = 80 \).

6. **Using the Semi-Perimeter:**
   - The semi-perimeter \( s = \frac{P}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( P = 2s \).

7. **Substituting the Ratio:**
   - From the ratio, \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \).
   - Substitute \( P = 2s \) into the area equation:
     \[
     2s \times \frac{2}{5} \times s = 80
     \]
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} s^2 = 80
     \]
     \[
     s^2 = 80 \times \frac{5}{4} = 100
     \]
     \[
     s = 10
     \]

8. **Finding the Height:**
   - Using \( h = \frac{2}{5} \times s \):
     \[
     h = \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4
     \]

Therefore, the height of the room is 4 meters.

# Answer option: ['A)1584', 'B)2520', 'C)1728', 'D)1656', 'E)None']","To solve this problem, let's denote the number as \( x \).

1. **Calculate the correct value:**
   - The correct calculation should be \( \frac{7}{8} \times x \).

2. **Calculate the incorrect value:**
   - The student calculated \( \frac{7}{18} \times x \).

3. **Set up the equation for the difference:**
   - The difference between the correct and incorrect values is given as 770.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = 770
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Factor out \( \frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x \):
     \[
     \frac{7}{8}x - \frac{7}{18}x = \left(\frac{7}{8} - \frac{7}{18}\right)x
     \]
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{7}{8} = \frac{63}{72}, \quad \frac{7}{18} = \frac{28}{72}
     \]
   - Subtract the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{63}{72} - \frac{28}{72} = \frac{35}{72}

79,"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?
# Answer option: ['A)20%', 'B)40%', 'C)50%', 'D)65%', 'E)75%']","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the population changes over the years.

Let's denote the population one year ago as \( P \).

According to the problem, the population is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. Therefore, the population at the end of the first year (current population) would be:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.1 \]

The population at the end of the second year would be:

\[ P_{\text{2 years}} = P_{\text{current}} \times 1.1 = P \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = P \times 1.21 \]

We are told that the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, we have:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

To find the population increase over the last year, we need to determine the current population in terms of the population one year ago. We know:

\[ P_{\text{current}} = P \times 1.1 \]

We need to find the percentage increase from the population one year ago to the current population. The percentage increase is given by:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P_{\text{current}} - P}{P} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the expression for \( P_{\text{current}} \):

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P \times 1.1 - P}{P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = \left( \frac{0.1P}{P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = 10\% \]

However, this is the increase for one year. We need to find the increase over the last year, which is the increase from the population one year ago to the current population. Since the population two years from now is double the population one year ago, the current population must have increased by a certain percentage to fit this condition.

Let's re-evaluate the condition:

\[ P \times 1.21 = 2P \]

This implies that the population one year ago was actually \( \frac{P}{1.21} \) if we consider the current population as \( P \).

Therefore, the population one year ago was:

\[ P_{\text{1 year ago}} = \frac{P}{1.21} \]

The current population is \( P \).

The percentage increase from one year ago to the current population is:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - \frac{P}{1.21}}{\frac{P}{1.21}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ = \left( \frac{1.21P - P}{P} \right) \times 100\% \]

25,"A retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00. For what price did the retailer sell the appliance?
# Answer option: ['A)$27.30', 'B)$51.00', 'C)$63.00', 'D)$70.00', 'E)$91.00']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of the appliance based on the information given.

1. **Understand the relationship between cost, selling price, and profit:**
   - Let \( C \) be the cost price of the appliance.
   - The selling price is 40% above the cost price, so the selling price \( S \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C
     \]
   - The gross profit is given as $20.00, which is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
     \[
     S - C = 20
     \]

2. **Set up the equation using the profit information:**
   - From the profit equation, we have:
     \[
     1.4C - C = 20
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     0.4C = 20
     \]

3. **Solve for the cost price \( C \):**
   - Divide both sides by 0.4 to find \( C \):
     \[
     C = \frac{20}{0.4} = 50
     \]

4. **Calculate the selling price \( S \):**
   - Substitute \( C = 50 \) back into the equation for the selling price:
     \[
     S = 1.4 \times 50 = 70
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - The cost price is $50.00.
   - The selling price is $70.00.
   - The profit is \( 70 - 50 = 20 \), which matches the given profit.

Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for \(\$70.00\).

186,"An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
# Answer option: ['A)43 seconds', 'B)39 seconds', 'C)20 seconds', 'D)33 seconds', 'E)55 seconds']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel.

1. **Determine the length of the train:**
   - The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel. During this time, the entire length of the train enters the tunnel.
   - The speed of the train is 120 miles per hour. We need to convert this speed into miles per second to find out how far the train travels in 3 seconds.
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so the speed in miles per second is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ miles/hour}}{3600 \text{ seconds/hour}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second}
     \]
   - In 3 seconds, the train travels:
     \[
     3 \times \frac{1}{30} = \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.

2. **Determine the total distance the train needs to travel to completely pass through the tunnel:**
   - The train needs to travel its own length plus the length of the tunnel to completely pass through.
   - The length of the tunnel is 1 mile, and the length of the train is \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles.
   - Total distance to travel = \(1 + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{11}{10} = 1.1\) miles.

3. **Calculate the time to travel this distance:**
   - The train travels at a speed of 120 miles per hour, which is \(\frac{1}{30}\) miles per second.
   - Time taken to travel 1.1 miles is:
     \[
     \frac{1.1 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{30} \text{ miles/second}} = 1.1 \times 30 = 33 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Therefore, the train will take 33 seconds to completely pass through the tunnel.

If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
# Answer option: ['A)(zy – 2x)/z', 'B)(zy – 2)/z', 'C)(zx – y)/(z – 2)', 'D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)', 'E)(zy – x)/(z + 2)']","To solve this problem, we need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The average of the highest score (H) and the lowest score (L) is \( x \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \frac{H + L}{2} = x \implies H + L = 2x
     \]

2. **Average score for the entire class:**
   - The average score for the entire class is \( y \), and there are \( z \) students. Therefore, the total sum of all scores is:
     \[
     zy
     \]

3. **Sum of scores excluding the highest and lowest:**
   - The sum of all scores is \( zy \).
   - The sum of the highest and lowest scores is \( H + L = 2x \).
   - Therefore, the sum of the scores excluding the highest and lowest is:
     \[
     zy - 2x
     \]

4. **Number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers:**
   - Since there are \( z \) students in total, excluding the highest and lowest scorers, there are \( z - 2 \) students.

5. **Average score excluding the highest and lowest scorers:**
   - The average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is the sum of the scores excluding the highest and lowest divided by the number of students excluding the highest and lowest:
     \[
     \frac{zy - 2x}{z - 2}
     \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

175,"Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity?
# Answer option: ['A)$5102', 'B)$618', 'C)$216', 'D)$202', 'E)$200']","To determine how much interest the bond accrued at maturity, we need to calculate the future value of the bond using the given interest rate and compounding frequency.

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**  
   The principal amount is $5,000.

2. **Determine the annual interest rate (r):**  
   The annual interest rate is 12%.

3. **Determine the compounding frequency:**  
   The interest is compounded every six months, which means it is compounded twice a year.

4. **Calculate the interest rate per compounding period:**  
   Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, the interest rate per period is half of the annual rate:  
   \[
   \text{Interest rate per period} = \frac{12\%}{2} = 6\% = 0.06
   \]

5. **Determine the number of compounding periods (n):**  
   Since the bond is for 1 year and compounds semi-annually, there are 2 compounding periods in total.

6. **Use the future value formula for compound interest:**  
   The future value \( FV \) of the bond can be calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   FV = P \times (1 + r/n)^{nt}
   \]  
   where \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the annual interest rate, \( n \) is the number of compounding periods per year, and \( t \) is the time in years.

   Plugging in the values:  
   \[
   FV = 5000 \times (1 + 0.06)^2
   \]

7. **Calculate the future value:**  
   \[
   FV = 5000 \times (1.06)^2 = 5000 \times 1.1236 = 5618
   \]

8. **Calculate the interest accrued:**  
   The interest accrued is the future value minus the principal:  
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 5618 - 5000 = 618
   \]

# Answer option: ['A)18', 'B)30', 'C)6', 'D)15', 'E)12']","To solve this problem, we need to understand what it means to reduce the length of the ribbon in the ratio 5:3.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The ratio 5:3 means that for every 5 units of the original length, it is now reduced to 3 units. 

2. **Original Length**: The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm.

3. **Setting Up the Proportion**: We can set up a proportion to find the new length. If the original length (5 parts) is 30 cm, we need to find the new length (3 parts).

   \[
   \frac{5}{3} = \frac{30}{x}
   \]

   Here, \( x \) is the new length of the ribbon.

4. **Solving the Proportion**: Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   5x = 3 \times 30
   \]

   \[
   5x = 90
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{90}{5}
   \]

   \[
   x = 18
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: The new length of the ribbon is 18 cm.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A) 18.

1. **Initial Group Composition:**
   - Boys = 64
   - Girls = 40

2. **Let the number of boys and girls who joined be \( x \).**

3. **New Composition:**
   - Boys = 64 + \( x \)
   - Girls = 40 + \( x \)

4. **Given Ratio:**
   - The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.

5. **Set up the equation for the ratio:**
   \[
   \frac{64 + x}{40 + x} = \frac{4}{3}
   \]

6. **Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
   \]

7. **Expand both sides:**
   \[
   192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
   \]

8. **Rearrange to solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   192 - 160 = 4x - 3x
   \]
   \[

143,"The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
# Answer option: ['A)0.5', 'B)0.6', 'C)0.7', 'D)0.8', 'E)0.9']","To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events and the formula for the probability of the union of two events.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(A \cup B) = 0.96 \)

Since events A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B occurring is given by:
\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B) \]

We also know the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
\[ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) \]

Substituting the given values into this formula, we have:
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 \times P(B)) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)(1 - 0.6) \]
\[ 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) \]

Subtract 0.6 from both sides:
\[ 0.36 = 0.4P(B) \]

Divide both sides by 0.4 to solve for \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = \frac{0.36}{0.4} \]
\[ P(B) = 0.9 \]

Thus, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

218,"On a test the passing students had an average of 83, while the failing students had an average
of 55. If the overall class average was 76, what percent of the class passed?
# Answer option: ['A)44%', 'B)66%', 'C)68%', 'D)72%', 'E)75%']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of students who passed the test. We have the following information:

- The average score of passing students is 83.
- The average score of failing students is 55.
- The overall class average is 76.

Let's denote:
- \( p \) as the proportion of students who passed.
- \( f \) as the proportion of students who failed.

Since the total proportion must equal 1, we have:
\[ p + f = 1 \]
\[ f = 1 - p \]

The overall class average can be expressed as a weighted average of the passing and failing students' averages:
\[ 83p + 55f = 76 \]

Substitute \( f = 1 - p \) into the equation:
\[ 83p + 55(1 - p) = 76 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 83p + 55 - 55p = 76 \]
\[ 28p + 55 = 76 \]

Subtract 55 from both sides:
\[ 28p = 21 \]

Divide both sides by 28 to solve for \( p \):
\[ p = \frac{21}{28} \]
\[ p = \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ p = 0.75 \]

Thus, 75% of the class passed the test.

# Answer option: ['A)7', 'B)3', 'C)2', 'D)1', 'E)6']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the three children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) on three identical chairs in a straight line, with the condition that Susan is to the left of Tim.

1. **Calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions:**

   There are 3 children and 3 chairs, so the total number of ways to arrange the children is given by the factorial of the number of children:
   \[
   3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 possible arrangements of the children.

2. **Identify the arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim:**

   For each arrangement of the three children, there is a corresponding arrangement where Susan is to the left of Tim and another where Tim is to the left of Susan. Therefore, half of the total arrangements will have Susan to the left of Tim.

   Since there are 6 total arrangements, the number of arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **List the valid arrangements:**

   To verify, let's list the possible arrangements and check which ones satisfy the condition:
   - Susan, Tim, Zen (STZ)
   - Susan, Zen, Tim (SZT)

# Answer option: ['A)26', 'B)28', 'C)21', 'D)80', 'E)23']","To find the depth of the canal, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezium (trapezoid):

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height} \]

In this problem:
- \(\text{Base}_1 = 10\) m (the top width of the canal)
- \(\text{Base}_2 = 6\) m (the bottom width of the canal)
- \(\text{Area} = 640\) square meters

We need to find the height, which is the depth of the canal.

Plug the known values into the formula:

\[ 640 = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 + 6) \times \text{Height} \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 640 = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \times \text{Height} \]

\[ 640 = 8 \times \text{Height} \]

# Answer option: ['A)62, 35', 'B)62, 34', 'C)34, 62', 'D)42, 62', 'E)62, 42']","To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( A \) be the amount of money Arjun has.
- Let \( S \) be the amount of money Sajal has.

We have two conditions given in the problem:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.

Let's translate these conditions into equations:

### Condition 1:
If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Arjun will have \( A - 30 \) and Sajal will have \( S + 30 \). According to the condition, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:

\[
S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
S + 30 = 2A - 60
\]

\[
S = 2A - 90 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

### Condition 2:
If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have \( A + 10 \) and Sajal will have \( S - 10 \). According to the condition, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal:

\[
A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
A + 10 = 3S - 30
\]

\[
A = 3S - 40 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

### Solving the Equations:
Now, we have two equations:

1. \( S = 2A - 90 \)
2. \( A = 3S - 40 \)

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

\[
A = 3(2A - 90) - 40
\]

\[
A = 6A - 270 - 40
\]

\[
A = 6A - 310
\]

\[
310 = 6A - A
\]

\[
310 = 5A
\]

\[
A = 62
\]

Now, substitute \( A = 62 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( S \):

\[
S = 2(62) - 90
\]

\[
S = 124 - 90
\]

\[
S = 34
\]

Thus, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are 10 songs.
   - Each student selects their 2 favorite songs.
   - Each song is selected 5 times.

2. **Determine Total Selections:**
   - Since each song is selected 5 times, and there are 10 songs, the total number of selections made by all students is:
     \[
     10 \text{ songs} \times 5 \text{ selections per song} = 50 \text{ total selections}

3. **Relate Selections to Students:**
   - Each student selects 2 songs.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of students surveyed.
   - Since each student makes 2 selections, the total number of selections is also:
     \[

# Answer option: ['A)5/7', 'B)3/5', 'C)4/7', 'D)2/5', 'E)2/7']","To determine the probability that a number chosen from the set \( S \) (which contains integers from 1 to 1,000) is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of integers in \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1,000 and divide that by the total number of integers in \( S \).

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 1,000
First, we find the prime factorization of 1,000:
\[ 1,000 = 10^3 = (2 \times 5)^3 = 2^3 \times 5^3 \]

### Step 2: Euler's Totient Function
The Euler's Totient Function, \(\phi(n)\), gives the count of numbers up to \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). For a number \( n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times \ldots \times p_m^{k_m} \), the function is given by:
\[
\phi(n) = n \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right)\ldots\left(1 - \frac{1}{p_m}\right)
\]

Applying this to 1,000:
\[
\phi(1000) = 1000 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right)
\]
\[
= 1000 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{5}

\[
= 1000 \times \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
= 400
\]

So, there are 400 numbers in the set \( S \) that are relatively prime to 1,000.

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
The total number of integers in \( S \) is 1,000. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen number from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1,000 is:
\[
\frac{400}{1000} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Thus, the probability that a number chosen from \( S \) is relatively prime to 1,000 is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

# Answer option: ['A)750pi', 'B)1500pi', 'C)1875pi', 'D)3000pi', 'E)7500pi']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade. The point is 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, and the fan is rotating at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute.

1. **Calculate the circumference of the circle traced by the point:**
   - The radius of the circle is 10 centimeters.
   - The formula for the circumference \( C \) of a circle is \( C = 2\pi r \), where \( r \) is the radius.
   - So, \( C = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \) centimeters.

2. **Determine the number of revolutions in 30 seconds:**
   - The fan rotates at 300 revolutions per minute.
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the fan makes \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) revolutions per second.
   - In 30 seconds, the number of revolutions is \( 5 \times 30 = 150 \) revolutions.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled by the point:**
   - The distance traveled in one revolution is the circumference of the circle, which is \( 20\pi \) centimeters.
   - Therefore, the total distance traveled in 150 revolutions is \( 150 \times 20\pi = 3000\pi \) centimeters.

1. **Choose the middle letter (vowel):**
   - There are 5 vowels available: A, E, I, O, U.
   - So, there are 5 choices for the middle letter.

2. **Choose the first letter (consonant):**

If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
# Answer option: ['A)80', 'B)120', 'C)240', 'D)320', 'E)360']","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Inventory**: The store starts with 600 golf balls.

2. **Golf Balls Sold**: By the end of the day, the store sold 80% of its inventory. 
   - 80% of 600 is calculated as follows: 
     \[
     0.8 \times 600 = 480
     \]
   So, the store sold 480 golf balls.

3. **Equal Number of Yellow and White Balls Sold**: The problem states that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so, sold all of its white golf balls.

4. **All White Balls Sold**: Since all the white golf balls were sold, and they were sold in equal number to the yellow golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is half of the total golf balls sold.
   - Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold is:
     \[
     \frac{480}{2} = 240
     \]

5. **Initial Number of White Golf Balls**: Since all white golf balls were sold, the store initially had 240 white golf balls.

6. **Initial Number of Yellow Golf Balls**: The total initial inventory was 600 golf balls. If 240 of these were white, then the number of yellow golf balls initially is:
   \[
   600 - 240 = 360
   \]

Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

3,"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?
# Answer option: ['A)0.22', 'B)0.26', 'C)0.37', 'D)0.46', 'E)0.63']","To find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to consider the probabilities of the complementary events.

1. **Complementary Probabilities:**
   - The probability that Stock A will not increase is \(1 - 0.56 = 0.44\).
   - The probability that Stock B will not increase is \(1 - 0.74 = 0.26\).

2. **Independence Assumption:**
   - If we assume that the events are independent, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase is the product of their complementary probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Neither A nor B}) = P(\text{Not A}) \times P(\text{Not B}) = 0.44 \times 0.26 = 0.1144
     \]

3. **Greatest Value Consideration:**
   - To find the greatest possible value for the probability that neither event occurs, we consider the scenario where the events are mutually exclusive. This means that if one event occurs, the other cannot, which maximizes the probability that neither occurs.
   - In this case, the probability that neither event occurs is:
     \[
     P(\text{Neither A nor B}) = 1 - P(\text{A or B})
     \]
   - Using the formula for the union of two events:
     \[
     P(\text{A or B}) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)
     \]
   - To maximize \(P(\text{Neither A nor B})\), we minimize \(P(A \text{ and } B)\). The minimum value for \(P(A \text{ and } B)\) is 0 when the events are mutually exclusive.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     P(\text{A or B}) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0 = 1.30
     \]
   - Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, the maximum value for \(P(\text{A or B})\) is 1. Thus:
     \[
     P(\text{Neither A nor B}) = 1 - 1 = 0
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The greatest value for the probability that neither event occurs, considering realistic scenarios, is when the events are independent, which gives us 0.1144. However, this is not an option.
   - The closest option that represents a realistic scenario is when the events are not mutually exclusive, and the probability of neither occurring is calculated as:
     \[
     P(\text{Neither A nor B}) = 1 - (0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 \times 0.74) = 1 - 0.8144 = 0.1856
     \]
   - The closest answer option to this realistic scenario is 0.26.

Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur, given the options, is \(\boxed{B}\).

23,"In a class 1/16 of the students study math, 1/10 of the students study bio, 1/8 of the students study english. The total number of students is a 4 digit number. Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students.
# Answer option: ['A)8880', 'B)8870', 'C)8890', 'D)7890', 'E)6780']","To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students, \( N \), which is a 4-digit number. The fractions of students studying different subjects must result in whole numbers of students. Therefore, \( N \) must be a common multiple of the denominators of the fractions: 16, 10, and 8.

1. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**

   - The prime factorization of 16 is \( 2^4 \).
   - The prime factorization of 10 is \( 2 \times 5 \).
   - The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).

   The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations:

   - For 2, the highest power is \( 2^4 \).
   - For 5, the highest power is \( 5^1 \).

   Therefore, the LCM is \( 2^4 \times 5 = 16 \times 5 = 80 \).

2. **Determine the Range of \( N \):**

   Since \( N \) is a 4-digit number, it must be between 1000 and 9999. We need to find the smallest and largest 4-digit numbers that are multiples of 80.

   - **Minimum \( N \):** 
     - Divide 1000 by 80: \( 1000 \div 80 = 12.5 \).
     - The smallest integer greater than 12.5 is 13.
     - Therefore, the smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is \( 13 \times 80 = 1040 \).

   - **Maximum \( N \):**
     - Divide 9999 by 80: \( 9999 \div 80 = 124.9875 \).
     - The largest integer less than 124.9875 is 124.
     - Therefore, the largest 4-digit multiple of 80 is \( 124 \times 80 = 9920 \).

3. **Calculate the Difference:**

   The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:
   \[
   9920 - 1040 = 8880
   \]

Thus, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 8880.

# Answer option: ['A)D/(M-3)', 'B)MD/3', 'C)M/(D-3)', 'D)3D/(M2-3M)', 'E)None of these']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more each remaining man will have to contribute if 3 men drop out of the original group of M men.

1. **Initial Contribution:**
   - The total cost of the gift is Rs. D.
   - Initially, there are M men sharing the cost equally.
   - Therefore, each man's initial contribution is \( \frac{D}{M} \).

2. **After 3 Men Drop Out:**
   - If 3 men drop out, the number of men left is \( M - 3 \).
   - The total cost of the gift remains Rs. D.
   - Now, each of the remaining \( M - 3 \) men will have to contribute \( \frac{D}{M-3} \).

3. **Additional Contribution Required:**
   - The additional contribution required from each remaining man is the difference between the new contribution and the initial contribution.
   - This is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Additional Contribution} = \frac{D}{M-3} - \frac{D}{M}

# Answer option: ['A)5C3*4C3', 'B)5C4*4C2', 'C)5C2*4C4', 'D)5C6*4C5', 'E)4C3*4C3']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how Fernando can allocate his 3 lunches and 3 dinners during the weekdays, given the constraints.

1. **Lunches:**
   - Fernando has 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) to allocate his 3 lunches.
   - We need to choose 3 days out of these 5 days for lunches.
   - The number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{3} \).

2. **Dinners:**
   - Fernando has 4 weekdays (Monday to Thursday) to allocate his 3 dinners because he always goes home for dinner on Friday nights.
   - We need to choose 3 days out of these 4 days for dinners.
   - The number of ways to choose 3 days out of 4 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{3} \).

Now, we calculate these combinations:

- \( \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \)
- \( \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \)

Finally, the total number of ways Fernando can allocate his meals is the product of the two combinations:

171,"Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?
# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)23', 'C)16', 'D)18', 'E)12']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the coin landed on heads such that neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money after 20 flips.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the number of times the coin landed on heads.
- \( T \) as the number of times the coin landed on tails.

We know that the total number of flips is 20, so:
\[ H + T = 20 \]

For each head, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, so the total amount Christopher gives to Jonathan is \( 2H \).

For each tail, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so the total amount Jonathan gives to Christopher is \( 3T \).

Since neither won or lost any money, the total amount given by Christopher to Jonathan must equal the total amount given by Jonathan to Christopher:
\[ 2H = 3T \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( H + T = 20 \)
2. \( 2H = 3T \)

From the second equation, we can express \( T \) in terms of \( H \):
\[ T = \frac{2H}{3} \]

Substitute this expression for \( T \) into the first equation:
\[ H + \frac{2H}{3} = 20 \]

Multiply the entire equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 3H + 2H = 60 \]
\[ 5H = 60 \]

Solve for \( H \):
\[ H = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

# Answer option: ['A)23', 'B)27', 'C)26', 'D)28', 'E)29']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of children in the row based on the given positions of Neha and Radha.

1. **Initial Positions:**
   - Neha is 12th from the left end.
   - Radha is 6th from the right end.

2. **Shifting Positions:**
   - Radha is shifted 2 places to the left. So, her new position is 6 + 2 = 8th from the right end.
   - Neha is shifted 2 places to the right. So, her new position is 12 + 2 = 14th from the left end.

3. **Children Between Neha and Radha:**
   - After shifting, there are 6 children between Neha and Radha.

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Children:**
   - The new position of Radha is 8th from the right, and the new position of Neha is 14th from the left.
   - The number of children between Neha and Radha is given as 6.
   - Therefore, the position of Neha from the left plus the position of Radha from the right minus 1 (to account for the overlap) should equal the total number of children:
     \[
     \text{Total children} = (\text{Position of Neha from left}) + (\text{Position of Radha from right}) - 1
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Total children} = 14 + 8 - 1 = 21

0,"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?
# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry and the concept of relative speed. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower.
   - The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
   - We need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.

2. **Trigonometric Setup:**
   - Let the height of the tower be \( h \).
   - Let the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 45° be \( d_1 \).
   - Let the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 60° be \( d_2 \).

3. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(45°) = \frac{h}{d_1} \implies d_1 = h
     \]
   - When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have:
     \[
     \tan(60°) = \frac{h}{d_2} \implies d_2 = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}
     \]

4. **Distance Travelled:**
   - The car travels from \( d_1 \) to \( d_2 \) in 10 minutes.
   - The distance travelled in 10 minutes is:
     \[
     d_1 - d_2 = h - \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} = h \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)
     \]

5. **Speed of the Car:**
   - The speed of the car is the distance travelled divided by time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}
     \]

6. **Time to Reach the Base:**
   - The remaining distance to the base of the tower is \( d_2 \).
   - The time \( t \) to cover this distance at the same speed is:
     \[
     t = \frac{d_2}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{10}}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     t = \frac{\frac{h}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 10}{h \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3} - 1}
     \]

7. **Rationalizing the Denominator:**
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:
     \[
     t = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\sqrt{3} - 1)(\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \frac{10(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)
     \]

Thus, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is \( 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) \) minutes.

# Answer option: ['A)22 minutes', 'B)30 minutes', 'C)15 minutes', 'D)24 minutes', 'E)35 minutes']","To determine how long it would take Anna to arrange her 4 books in every possible combination, we need to calculate the total number of permutations of the 4 books. 

The formula for permutations of \( n \) items is \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \).

For 4 books, the number of permutations is:
\[ 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \]

This means there are 24 different ways to arrange the 4 books.

# Answer option: ['A)69:91', 'B)59:91', 'C)59:90', 'D)59:91', 'E)69:101']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y, and then find the ratio of zinc to copper in the new alloy Z.

**Step 1: Determine the composition of alloy X.**

Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. This can be simplified to 2:3. Therefore, in every 5 parts of alloy X, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper.

- Total weight of alloy X = 40 grams.
- Zinc in alloy X = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 40 = 16\) grams.
- Copper in alloy X = \(\frac{3}{5} \times 40 = 24\) grams.

**Step 2: Determine the composition of alloy Y.**

Alloy Y is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11.

- Total weight of alloy Y = 60 grams.
- Zinc in alloy Y = \(\frac{7}{18} \times 60 = 23.33\) grams (approximately).
- Copper in alloy Y = \(\frac{11}{18} \times 60 = 36.67\) grams (approximately).

**Step 3: Combine the amounts of zinc and copper from alloys X and Y to form alloy Z.**

- Total zinc in alloy Z = 16 grams (from X) + 23.33 grams (from Y) = 39.33 grams.
- Total copper in alloy Z = 24 grams (from X) + 36.67 grams (from Y) = 60.67 grams.

**Step 4: Calculate the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.**

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:

\[
\text{Ratio of zinc to copper} = \frac{39.33}{60.67}
\]

To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to avoid decimals:

\[
\frac{39.33 \times 100}{60.67 \times 100} = \frac{3933}{6067}
\]

This ratio simplifies approximately to 59:91 when rounded to the nearest whole numbers.

Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91.

# Answer option: ['A)11.75 miles', 'B)12.75 miles', 'C)17.75 miles', 'D)14.75 miles', 'E)10.75 miles']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how far you can travel with $8.50 in a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile.

1. **Initial Charge Calculation:**
   - The initial charge for the first quarter-mile is $3.50.

2. **Remaining Money Calculation:**
   - After paying the initial charge, the remaining money is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.

3. **Cost per Additional Quarter-Mile:**
   - Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, or $0.10.

4. **Number of Additional Quarter-Miles:**
   - With the remaining $5.00, you can pay for additional quarter-miles. 
   - The number of additional quarter-miles you can afford is $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 additional quarter-miles.

5. **Total Distance Calculation:**
   - The total number of quarter-miles you can travel is the initial quarter-mile plus the additional quarter-miles: 1 (initial) + 50 (additional) = 51 quarter-miles.
   - Convert quarter-miles to miles: 51 quarter-miles * (1 mile / 4 quarter-miles) = 12.75 miles.

Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

83,"A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
# Answer option: ['A)56', 'B)58', 'C)60', 'D)62', 'E)64']","To solve this problem, let's go through the steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We start with a square piece of cloth.
   - One edge is trimmed by 4 feet to form a rectangle.
   - This rectangle is then cut diagonally to form two triangles.
   - The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the side length of the original square be \( s \).
   - After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the dimensions of the rectangle become \( s \) by \( s - 4 \).

3. **Area of the Triangle:**
   - The rectangle is cut diagonally, so each triangle has a base of \( s \) and a height of \( s - 4 \).
   - The area of each triangle is given by the formula for the area of a triangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4)
     \]
   - We know the area of each triangle is 70 square feet:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times s \times (s - 4) = 70
     \]

4. **Solve for \( s \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     s \times (s - 4) = 140
     \]
   - Expand and rearrange the equation:
     \[
     s^2 - 4s = 140
     \]
     \[
     s^2 - 4s - 140 = 0
     \]
   - Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
     where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -140 \).
     \[
     s = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-140)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 560}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{576}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     s = \frac{4 \pm 24}{2}
     \]
   - The possible solutions for \( s \) are:
     \[
     s = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \quad \text{and} \quad s = \frac{-20}{2} = -10
     \]
   - Since \( s \) must be positive, \( s = 14 \).

5. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Original Square:**
   - The perimeter of the original square is \( 4 \times s \).
   - Therefore, the perimeter is \( 4 \times 14 = 56 \) feet.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The perimeter of the original piece of square cloth is 56 feet.

223,"The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts. If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, then what is the total discount available at that retailer?
# Answer option: ['A)10%', 'B)25%', 'C)28%', 'D)30%', 'E)36%']","To determine the total discount available at the retailer, we need to consider the sequential application of the discounts.

1. **Initial Manufacturer Discount:**
   - The manufacturer offers a 20% discount on the original price of the tubeless tyres. 
   - If the original price is \( P \), the price after the manufacturer's discount is:
     \[
     P_{\text{after manufacturer discount}} = P \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P
     \]

2. **Additional Retailer Discount:**
   - The retailer offers an additional 20% discount on the price after the manufacturer's discount.
   - The price after the retailer's discount is:
     \[
     P_{\text{after retailer discount}} = 0.80P \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80P \times 0.80 = 0.64P
     \]

3. **Total Discount Calculation:**
   - The total discount is the reduction from the original price \( P \) to the final price \( 0.64P \).
   - The total discount amount is:
     \[
     \text{Total discount amount} = P - 0.64P = 0.36P
     \]
   - The total discount percentage is:
     \[
     \text{Total discount percentage} = \left(\frac{0.36P}{P}\right) \times 100\% = 36\%
     \]

Therefore, the total discount available at the retailer is 36%.

16,"Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?
# Answer option: ['A)1 step/minute', 'B)2 step/minute', 'C)3 step/minute', 'D)4 step/minute', 'E)None of the above']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the elevator in steps per minute. Let's break down the information given:

1. When you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. When you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

Let's denote:
- \( v \) as the speed of the elevator in steps per minute.
- \( S \) as the total number of steps from the top to the bottom.

**Case 1: Walking 20 steps**
- You walk 20 steps, so the elevator needs to cover \( S - 20 \) steps.
- The time taken is 10 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 20 \) steps in 10 minutes.

**Case 2: Walking 10 steps**
- You walk 10 steps, so the elevator needs to cover \( S - 10 \) steps.
- The time taken is 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the elevator covers \( S - 10 \) steps in 20 minutes.

From these two cases, we can set up the following equations based on the speed of the elevator:

1. \((S - 20) = 10v\)
2. \((S - 10) = 20v\)

Now, let's solve these equations:

From equation 1:
\[ S - 20 = 10v \]
\[ S = 10v + 20 \]

From equation 2:
\[ S - 10 = 20v \]
\[ S = 20v + 10 \]

Now, set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[ 10v + 20 = 20v + 10 \]

Solve for \( v \):
\[ 10v + 20 = 20v + 10 \]
\[ 20 = 10v - 10 \]
\[ 30 = 10v \]
\[ v = 3 \]

Thus, the speed of the elevator is 3 steps per minute.

# Answer option: ['A)1.5%', 'B)4.5%', 'C)10%', 'D)5%', 'E)12%']","To find the interest rate, we need to determine the total interest paid and then calculate the rate based on the principal amount.

1. **Calculate the Total Amount Paid:**
   - The man pays Rs.31.50 per month for 12 months.
   - Total amount paid = 31.50 * 12 = Rs.378

2. **Calculate the Total Interest Paid:**
   - The principal amount borrowed = Rs.360
   - Total interest paid = Total amount paid - Principal amount
   - Total interest paid = 378 - 360 = Rs.18

3. **Calculate the Interest Rate:**
   - The interest rate is calculated on the principal amount for one year.
   - Interest rate = (Total interest / Principal) * 100
   - Interest rate = (18 / 360) * 100 = 5%

# Answer option: ['A)2', 'B)3', 'C)4', 'D)5', 'E)6']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of ties you must take out to ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color.

Let's consider the worst-case scenario, where you pick the maximum number of different colored ties without having two of the same color. You have the following colors and quantities:

- Red: 8 ties
- Violet: 13 ties
- Blue: 10 ties
- Pink: 5 ties
- Green: 4 ties

In the worst-case scenario, you would pick one tie of each color before you start picking a second tie of any color. So, you would pick:

1. One red tie
2. One violet tie
3. One blue tie
4. One pink tie
5. One green tie

At this point, you have picked 5 ties, and each is of a different color. To ensure that you have at least two ties of the same color, you need to pick one more tie. This sixth tie will necessarily be of a color you have already picked, thus giving you at least two ties of the same color.

56,"A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?
# Answer option: ['A)438', 'B)550', 'C)500', 'D)450', 'E)498']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted when the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted.

1. **Understanding the Structure:**
   - The hollow cube has an outer size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm.
   - This means the inner cube (the hollow part) has a size of \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) cm.

2. **Calculating the Number of Smaller Cubes:**
   - The entire cube (5 cm) is made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.
   - The total number of smaller cubes in the 5 cm cube is \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\).

3. **Calculating the Number of Smaller Cubes in the Hollow Part:**
   - The hollow part is a cube of size 3 cm.
   - The number of smaller cubes in the hollow part is \(3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27\).

4. **Calculating the Number of Smaller Cubes in the Shell:**
   - The shell of the hollow cube is the difference between the total number of cubes and the cubes in the hollow part.
   - Number of cubes in the shell = \(125 - 27 = 98\).

5. **Painting the Outer Surface:**
   - When the outer surface is painted, only the cubes on the outermost layer are affected.
   - The outermost layer of the 5 cm cube is a shell of thickness 1 cm.

6. **Calculating Unpainted Faces:**
   - Each smaller cube has 6 faces.
   - The cubes in the shell have some faces painted and some unpainted.
   - The inner cubes (3 cm cube) are completely unpainted and have \(27 \times 6 = 162\) unpainted faces.

7. **Calculating Painted Faces:**
   - The outer surface of the 5 cm cube is painted, which includes the outer faces of the shell.
   - The number of painted faces is equal to the surface area of the 5 cm cube, which is \(6 \times 5 \times 5 = 150\).

8. **Calculating Total Unpainted Faces:**
   - Total faces of all smaller cubes = \(125 \times 6 = 750\).
   - Total painted faces = 150.
   - Total unpainted faces = Total faces - Painted faces = \(750 - 150 = 600\).

9. **Final Calculation:**
   - The unpainted faces of the inner cubes (3 cm cube) are already counted as 162.
   - The remaining unpainted faces are from the shell, which is \(600 - 162 = 438\).

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 438.

61,"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?
# Answer option: ['A)22', 'B)27', 'C)29', 'D)Cannot be determined', 'E)None of the above']","To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Q, R, and T as follows:

- Let Q's age be \( q \).
- Let R's age be \( r \).
- Let T's age be \( t \).

According to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed as:

\[ r - q = q - t \]

This equation implies that the difference between R's age and Q's age is equal to the difference between Q's age and T's age.

Rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ r - q = q - t \]
\[ r + t = 2q \]

We are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( r + t = 2q \)
2. \( r + t = 50 \)

Since both expressions for \( r + t \) are equal, we can set them equal to each other:

\[ 2q = 50 \]

Solving for \( q \), we find:

\[ q = 25 \]

Now, we need to find the difference between R's age and Q's age, which is \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r + t = 50 \), we know:

\[ r + t = 50 \]

And from \( r + t = 2q \), we have:

\[ r + t = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

This confirms that our calculations are consistent. However, we need to find \( r - q \).

From the equation \( r - q = q - t \), we substitute \( q = 25 \):

\[ r - 25 = 25 - t \]

Rearranging gives:

\[ r = 50 - t \]

Substituting back into the equation \( r - q = q - t \):

\[ (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \]

Simplifying:

\[ 25 - t = 25 - t \]

This equation is always true, but it doesn't directly give us the value of \( r - q \) without knowing either \( r \) or \( t \) individually. However, since \( r + t = 50 \), and we have already established that \( q = 25 \), the difference \( r - q \) is:

\[ r - q = (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \]

Since \( r + t = 50 \), we can express \( t \) in terms of \( r \):

\[ t = 50 - r \]

Substituting back, we get:

\[ r - q = 25 - (50 - r) = 2r - 50 \]

This shows that without specific values for \( r \) or \( t \), the difference \( r - q \) cannot be determined as a specific number. Therefore, the answer is:

# Answer option: ['A)Rs. 697.50', 'B)Rs. 712.50', 'C)Rs. 787.50', 'D)Rs. 750', 'E)Rs. 780']","To solve this problem, let's define the variables and understand the situation:

- Let the marked price of the watch be \( M \).
- The shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, so the selling price at 5% discount is \( 0.95M \).
- The shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, so the selling price at 7% discount is \( 0.93M \).

The difference in profit when the discount is increased from 5% to 7% is Rs. 15. This means the difference in the selling prices at these two discount rates is Rs. 15.

So, we can set up the equation:

\[
0.95M - 0.93M = 15
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
0.02M = 15
\]

To find the marked price \( M \), divide both sides by 0.02:

\[
M = \frac{15}{0.02} = 750
\]

Thus, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

# Answer option: ['A)9', 'B)6', 'C)4', 'D)3', 'E)2']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from Winson's home to his school, which we'll call \( d \).

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance from home to school in miles.
   - The time taken to run to school is \( t_1 \).
   - The time taken to walk back home is \( t_2 \).

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - When running to school, Winson's speed is 10 miles/hr. Therefore, the time taken to run to school is:
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{d}{10}
     \]
   - When walking back home, Winson's speed is 5 miles/hr. Therefore, the time taken to walk back is:
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d}{5}
     \]

3. **Total Time for the Journey:**
   - The total time for the journey is given as 1 hour. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     t_1 + t_2 = 1
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \):
     \[
     \frac{d}{10} + \frac{d}{5} = 1
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 10:
     \[
     \frac{d}{10} + \frac{2d}{10} = 1
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{10} = 1
     \]
   - Solve for \( d \) by multiplying both sides by 10:
     \[
     3d = 10

   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     d = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33

The expression for \( x \) is:

\[
x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4}
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4
\]

Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as a perfect square:

\[
n^2 + 2n\sqrt{n} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16 = (n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2
\]

Thus, the expression for \( x \) becomes:

\[
x = \frac{(n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4)^2}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4} = n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4

Now, we need to find the range of \( x \) as \( n \) varies from 36 to 72.

1. **When \( n = 36 \):**

   \[
   x = 36 + 4\sqrt{36} + 4 = 36 + 24 + 4 = 64
   \]

2. **When \( n = 72 \):**

   \[
   x = 72 + 4\sqrt{72} + 4
   \]

   Calculate \( \sqrt{72} \):

   \[
   \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2} \approx 6 \times 1.414 = 8.484
   \]

   Therefore:

   \[
   x = 72 + 4 \times 8.484 + 4 = 72 + 33.936 + 4 = 109.936

1. Orange costs 18 dollars.
2. Pineapple costs 27 dollars.
3. Grape costs 15 dollars.

One possible approach is to consider the number of letters in each fruit's name:

- ""Orange"" has 6 letters.
- ""Pineapple"" has 9 letters.
- ""Grape"" has 5 letters.

Now, let's see if there's a relationship between the number of letters and the cost:

- Orange: 6 letters → 18 dollars
- Pineapple: 9 letters → 27 dollars
- Grape: 5 letters → 15 dollars

We can observe that the cost of each fruit is 3 times the number of letters in its name:

- Orange: 6 letters × 3 = 18 dollars
- Pineapple: 9 letters × 3 = 27 dollars
- Grape: 5 letters × 3 = 15 dollars

Now, let's apply this logic to determine the cost of a mango:

1. **Understand the profit per bag:**
   - The selling price of each bag is $100.
   - The profit is 25% of the selling price.
   - Therefore, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is:

81,"Julie’s yard is rectangular. One side of the yard is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet. What is the length of the other side of the yard?
# Answer option: ['A)30 feet', 'B)20 feet', 'C)10 feet', 'D)50 feet', 'E)60 feet']","To find the length of the other side of Julie's rectangular yard, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We are given:
- The width of the yard is 100 feet.
- The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet.

Let's denote the length of the other side as \( L \).

Using the formula, we have:

\[ 3,000 = L \times 100 \]

To solve for \( L \), divide both sides of the equation by 100:

\[ L = \frac{3,000}{100} \]

\[ L = 30 \]

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Now, let's match this with the answer options provided:

- A) 30 feet
- B) 20 feet
- C) 10 feet
- D) 50 feet

246,"Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
# Answer option: ['A)58', 'B)62', 'C)66', 'D)70', 'E)74']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of Alice's rectangular yard and then calculate the amount of fencing required for three sides.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the yard:**
   - Let the length of the yard be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters.
   - We know that one side of the yard, which is unfenced, is 10 meters. Let's assume this is the width, \( W = 10 \) meters.
   - The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters. Therefore, we can use the area formula for a rectangle:
     \[
     L \times W = 240
     \]
     Substituting \( W = 10 \) into the equation:
     \[
     L \times 10 = 240
     \]
     \[
     L = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of fencing needed:**
   - Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard: two widths and one length.
   - The total length of fencing required is:
     \[
     \text{Fencing} = L + 2W
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Fencing} = 24 + 2 \times 10 = 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - The dimensions of the yard are \( L = 24 \) meters and \( W = 10 \) meters.
   - The area is \( 24 \times 10 = 240 \) square meters, which matches the given area.
   - The fencing calculation is correct: \( 24 + 20 = 44 \) meters.

It seems there was a mistake in the initial calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

1. **Re-evaluate the dimensions:**
   - If the unfenced side is 10 meters, then the other dimension must be calculated correctly.
   - Let \( L = 10 \) meters (unfenced side), then \( W \) is the other dimension.
   - The area is \( L \times W = 240 \):
     \[
     10 \times W = 240
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Re-calculate the fencing:**
   - The fenced sides are two lengths and one width:
   - Fencing needed is:
     \[
     2L + W = 2 \times 10 + 24 = 20 + 24 = 44 \text{ meters}
     \]

Upon re-evaluation, the correct calculation should be:
- The fenced sides are two widths and one length, not two lengths and one width.

Let's correct this:
- Fencing needed is:
  \[
  2W + L = 2 \times 24 + 10 = 48 + 10 = 58 \text{ meters}
  \]

Therefore, the correct amount of fencing needed is 58 meters.

125,"The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.
# Answer option: ['A)368', 'B)377', 'C)288', 'D)997', 'E)112']","To solve this problem, let's denote the three-digit number as \( \overline{abc} \), where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are the digits of the number. The number can be expressed as \( 100a + 10b + c \).

We are given the following conditions:

1. The sum of the digits is 17:
   \[
   a + b + c = 17
   \]

2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
   \]

3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get the number with its digits reversed:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
   \]

   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
   \]
   \[
   99a - 99c = 495
   \]
   \[
   a - c = 5
   \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( a + b + c = 17 \)
2. \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \)
3. \( a - c = 5 \)

From equation 3, we can express \( a \) in terms of \( c \):
\[
a = c + 5
\]

Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) into equation 1:
\[
(c + 5) + b + c = 17
\]
\[
2c + b = 12
\]
\[
b = 12 - 2c
\]

Substitute \( a = c + 5 \) and \( b = 12 - 2c \) into equation 2:
\[
(c + 5)^2 + (12 - 2c)^2 + c^2 = 109
\]

Expanding each term:
\[
(c + 5)^2 = c^2 + 10c + 25
\]
\[
(12 - 2c)^2 = 144 - 48c + 4c^2
\]

Substitute these into the equation:
\[
c^2 + 10c + 25 + 144 - 48c + 4c^2 + c^2 = 109
\]
\[
6c^2 - 38c + 169 = 109
\]
\[
6c^2 - 38c + 60 = 0
\]

Divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
3c^2 - 19c + 30 = 0
\]

Now, solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
c = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -19 \), and \( c = 30 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-19)^2 - 4 \times 3 \times 30 = 361 - 360 = 1
\]

The roots are:
\[
c = \frac{19 \pm 1}{6}
\]

This gives:
\[
c = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \quad \text{(not an integer, discard)}
\]
\[
c = \frac{18}{6} = 3
\]

Thus, \( c = 3 \).

Substitute \( c = 3 \) back to find \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
a = c + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8
\]
\[
b = 12 - 2c = 12 - 6 = 6
\]

The number is \( \overline{abc} = 863 \).

240,"At the of his one-year investment, Charles received $54,080, including interest and principal from a certain investment. If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually, which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested?
# Answer option: ['A)$45,000', 'B)$50,000', 'C)$54,000', 'D)$59,000', 'E)$62,000']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the original amount of money Charles invested, given that he received $54,080 at the end of one year with an 8% annual interest rate compounded semi-annually.

1. **Understand the Compounding**: 
   - The annual interest rate is 8%, but since it is compounded semi-annually, the interest rate per period (every six months) is 8% / 2 = 4%.

2. **Number of Compounding Periods**:
   - Since the investment is for one year and interest is compounded semi-annually, there are 2 compounding periods in one year.

3. **Formula for Compound Interest**:
   - The formula for compound interest is: 
     \[
     A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
     \]
     where:
     - \(A\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
     - \(P\) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).
     - \(r\) is the annual interest rate (decimal).
     - \(n\) is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
     - \(t\) is the time the money is invested for in years.

4. **Plug in the Known Values**:
   - We know \(A = 54,080\), \(r = 0.08\), \(n = 2\), and \(t = 1\).
   - Plug these into the formula:
     \[
     54,080 = P \left(1 + \frac{0.08}{2}\right)^{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     54,080 = P \left(1 + 0.04\right)^{2}

     \[
     54,080 = P \left(1.04\right)^{2}
     \]
     \[
     54,080 = P \times 1.0816
     \]

5. **Solve for \(P\)**:
   - Divide both sides by 1.0816 to solve for \(P\):
     \[
     P = \frac{54,080}{1.0816}

# Answer option: ['A)13x/2', 'B)13x/2 - 6', 'C)13x/24', 'D)(13x+1)/24', 'E)(13x-12)/24']","To determine the length of the fence in feet, we need to consider both the width of the pickets and the spaces between them.

1. **Width of the Pickets:**
   - Each picket is \( \frac{1}{2} \) inch wide.
   - For \( x \) pickets, the total width of the pickets is \( \frac{x}{2} \) inches.

2. **Spaces Between Pickets:**
   - There are \( x \) pickets, which means there are \( x - 1 \) spaces between them.
   - Each space is 6 inches wide.
   - Therefore, the total space between the pickets is \( 6(x - 1) \) inches.

3. **Total Length of the Fence in Inches:**
   - The total length of the fence is the sum of the widths of the pickets and the spaces between them:
   \[
   \text{Total length in inches} = \frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1)
   \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   = \frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{12x}{2} - \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{x + 12x - 12}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{13x - 12}{2}

4. **Convert Inches to Feet:**
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12:
   \[
   \text{Total length in feet} = \frac{13x - 12}{2 \times 12} = \frac{13x - 12}{24}

1. **Calculate the distance of the journey:**
   - The car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr for 20 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/hr × 20 hr = 1200 km.

2. **Determine the required speed to cover the same distance in 10 hours:**

# Answer option: ['A)247.67', 'B)237.67', 'C)227.67', 'D)215.67', 'E)None of these']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount offered by the invoice terms.

1. **Understanding the Invoice Terms:**
   - The invoice amount is $20,000.
   - The terms are 4/30, n/100, which means a 4% discount is available if the invoice is paid within 30 days. Otherwise, the full amount is due in 100 days.

2. **Calculate the Discount:**
   - The discount is 4% of $20,000.
   - Discount = 0.04 * $20,000 = $800.

3. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   - If the merchant takes the discount, he pays $20,000 - $800 = $19,200.

4. **Determine the Savings:**
   - By paying $19,200 instead of $20,000, the merchant saves $800.

5. **Calculate the Time Period:**
   - The merchant needs to pay within 30 days to take advantage of the discount.
   - If he doesn't take the discount, he pays the full amount in 100 days.
   - The time period for which the money is borrowed is 100 - 30 = 70 days.

6. **Calculate the Simple Interest Rate:**
   - The merchant saves $800 by paying early, which is effectively the interest on the $19,200 borrowed for 70 days.
   - Using the simple interest formula: Interest = Principal * Rate * Time
   - Here, Interest = $800, Principal = $19,200, Time = 70/365 years (since interest rates are typically annual).

   \[
   800 = 19200 \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{70}{365}

205,"A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?
# Answer option: ['A)36 grams', 'B)40 grams', 'C)42 grams', 'D)48 grams', 'E)50 grams']","To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Volume of the Original Coin:**
   - The original coin is a cylinder with a thickness (height) of 2 mm and a diameter of 15 mm.
   - The radius \( r \) of the coin is half of the diameter, so \( r = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) mm.
   - The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \).
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     V = \pi (7.5)^2 \times 2 = \pi \times 56.25 \times 2 = 112.5\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]

2. **Determine the Volume of Aluminum and Silver:**
   - The problem states that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy.
   - Therefore, the volume of aluminum \( V_{\text{Al}} = \frac{112.5\pi}{2} = 56.25\pi \) cubic mm.
   - Similarly, the volume of silver \( V_{\text{Ag}} = 56.25\pi \) cubic mm.

3. **Determine the Densities:**
   - Let the density of aluminum be \( \rho_{\text{Al}} \).
   - Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the density of silver \( \rho_{\text{Ag}} = 2\rho_{\text{Al}} \).

4. **Determine the Weight of the Original Coin:**
   - The weight of the coin is the sum of the weights of aluminum and silver.
   - Weight of aluminum = \( V_{\text{Al}} \times \rho_{\text{Al}} = 56.25\pi \times \rho_{\text{Al}} \).
   - Weight of silver = \( V_{\text{Ag}} \times \rho_{\text{Ag}} = 56.25\pi \times 2\rho_{\text{Al}} = 112.5\pi \times \rho_{\text{Al}} \).
   - Total weight = \( 56.25\pi \times \rho_{\text{Al}} + 112.5\pi \times \rho_{\text{Al}} = 168.75\pi \times \rho_{\text{Al}} \).
   - We know the total weight is 30 grams, so:
     \[
     168.75\pi \times \rho_{\text{Al}} = 30
     \]
   - Solving for \( \rho_{\text{Al}} \):
     \[
     \rho_{\text{Al}} = \frac{30}{168.75\pi}
     \]

5. **Determine the Weight of the New Coin:**
   - The new coin is made of pure aluminum, with a thickness of 1 mm and a diameter of 30 mm.
   - The radius of the new coin is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) mm.
   - The volume of the new coin is:
     \[
     V_{\text{new}} = \pi (15)^2 \times 1 = 225\pi \text{ cubic mm}
     \]
   - The weight of the new coin is:
     \[
     \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = V_{\text{new}} \times \rho_{\text{Al}} = 225\pi \times \frac{30}{168.75\pi}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Weight}_{\text{new}} = 225 \times \frac{30}{168.75} = \frac{6750}{168.75} = 40 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 40 grams.

221,"If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained. If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs, then what is Ajay's present age?
# Answer option: ['A)40', 'B)60', 'C)70', 'D)80', 'E)90']","To solve this problem, we need to determine Ajay's present age based on the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the relationship between Rahul and Denis:**
   - Denis's age is given as 5 years.
   - Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis.
   - Therefore, Rahul's age = Denis's age - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 years.

2. **Using the information about Ajay's age:**
   - If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the remainder is divided by 18, we get Rahul's age.
   - Let Ajay's present age be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, \((x - 6) / 18 = \text{Rahul's age}\).
   - We know Rahul's age is 3 years.
   - So, \((x - 6) / 18 = 3\).

3. **Solving the equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by 18 to eliminate the fraction: \( x - 6 = 3 \times 18 \).
   - Calculate \( 3 \times 18 = 54 \).
   - So, \( x - 6 = 54 \).
   - Add 6 to both sides to solve for \( x \): \( x = 54 + 6 \).
   - Therefore, \( x = 60 \).

Ajay's present age is 60 years.

165,"If x<0, y>0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, which of the following must be true?
# Answer option: ['A)x > y', 'B)y^2 > x^2', 'C)-x^3 < y^2', 'D)–x < y', 'E)x < –y']","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine which of the answer options must be true.

Given:
1. \( x < 0 \)
2. \( y > 0 \)
3. \( |x^3| > |y^2| \)

Let's break down each condition:

- Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^3 \) will also be negative because the cube of a negative number is negative. Therefore, \( |x^3| = -x^3 \).

- Since \( y > 0 \), \( y^2 \) will be positive. Therefore, \( |y^2| = y^2 \).

From the condition \( |x^3| > |y^2| \), we have:
\[ -x^3 > y^2 \]

Now, let's evaluate each answer option:

A) \( x > y \)
- Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \( x \) cannot be greater than \( y \). This option is false.

B) \( y^2 > x^2 \)
- Since \( x < 0 \), \( x^2 \) is positive. However, we cannot directly compare \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \) without additional information. This option is not necessarily true.

C) \(-x^3 < y^2\)
- We have \(-x^3 > y^2\) from the given condition, so this option is false.

D) \(-x < y\)
- Since \( x < 0 \), \(-x\) is positive. We need to check if \(-x < y\). Given that \(-x^3 > y^2\), and knowing that \(-x^3\) is positive, it suggests that \(-x\) could be greater than \( y \) when considering the cube and square relationship. However, this does not directly imply \(-x < y\). This option is not necessarily true.

E) \( x < -y \)
- Since \( x < 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), \(-y\) is negative. Therefore, \( x < -y \) is true because \( x \) is negative and less than any negative number that is the negation of a positive \( y \).

Thus, the only option that must be true given the conditions is:

# Answer option: ['A)1 minute', 'B)2 minutes', 'C)3 minutes', 'D)4 minutes', 'E)5 minutes']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile.

1. **Determine the rate at which they collectively bike:**
   - Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour.
   - Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour.
   - Together, their combined rate is \(10 + 20 = 30\) miles per hour.

2. **Convert their combined rate to miles per minute:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so their combined rate in miles per minute is:
     \[
     \frac{30 \text{ miles per hour}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

3. **Determine how long it takes to bike 1 mile collectively:**
   - Since they bike 0.5 miles in 1 minute, to bike 1 mile, it would take:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{0.5 \text{ miles per minute}} = 2 \text{ minutes}

# Answer option: ['A)2400', 'B)2500', 'C)2600', 'D)2700', 'E)None of these']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the shares of Mohan and Sohan such that their future values at the age of 26 are equal when invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum.

1. **Determine the time period for each son:**
   - Mohan is currently 23 years old, so he will reach 26 in 3 years.
   - Sohan is currently 24 years old, so he will reach 26 in 2 years.

2. **Let Mohan's share be Rs. x.**
   - Then, Sohan's share will be Rs. (5100 - x).

3. **Calculate the future value of Mohan's share:**
   - The future value of Mohan's share after 3 years at 4% compound interest is given by:
     \[
     \text{Future Value of Mohan's share} = x \times \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^3 = x \times (1.04)^3
     \]

4. **Calculate the future value of Sohan's share:**
   - The future value of Sohan's share after 2 years at 4% compound interest is given by:
     \[
     \text{Future Value of Sohan's share} = (5100 - x) \times \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)^2 = (5100 - x) \times (1.04)^2

6. **Simplify and solve for x:**
   - First, calculate the powers of 1.04:
     \[
     (1.04)^3 = 1.124864
     \]
     \[
     (1.04)^2 = 1.0816
     \]

   - Substitute these values into the equation:
     \[
     x \times 1.124864 = (5100 - x) \times 1.0816
     \]

   - Expand and simplify:
     \[
     1.124864x = 5100 \times 1.0816 - 1.0816x
     \]

   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     1.124864x + 1.0816x = 5512.16

   - Solve for x:
     \[
     x = \frac{5512.16}{2.206464} \approx 2500

# Answer option: ['A)4', 'B)5', 'C)6', 'D)7', 'E)8']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each friend eats the candies and then combine these rates to find the time it takes for both to finish the jar together.

1. **Determine P's rate of eating:**
   - P can finish the entire jar in 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, P's rate is 1 jar per 10 minutes, or \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the jar per minute.

2. **Determine Q's rate of eating:**
   - Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes.
   - Therefore, Q's rate is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the jar per 5 minutes, which simplifies to \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the jar per minute.

3. **Combine their rates:**
   - Since both are eating simultaneously, we add their rates together.
   - P's rate: \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the jar per minute.
   - Q's rate: \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the jar per minute.
   - Combined rate: \(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}\) of the jar per minute.

4. **Calculate the time to finish the jar together:**
   - If they together eat \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the jar per minute, it will take them 5 minutes to finish the entire jar (since \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the jar per minute means the whole jar in 5 minutes).

Therefore, the time it takes for both P and Q to empty the jar together is 5 minutes.

The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?
# Answer option: ['A)8%', 'B)10%', 'C)12.5%', 'D)16.7%', 'E)25%']","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average cost per year for both purchasing new tires and repairing the current tires, and then determine the percentage by which the cost of new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

1. **Calculate the average cost per year for new tires:**
   - Cost of new tires = $180 per tire
   - Lifespan of new tires = 4 years
   - Average cost per year for new tires = Total cost / Lifespan = $180 / 4 = $45 per year

2. **Calculate the average cost per year for repairing current tires:**
   - Cost of repairing current tires = $40 per tire
   - Lifespan extension from repair = 1 year
   - Average cost per year for repairing = Total cost / Lifespan extension = $40 / 1 = $40 per year

3. **Calculate the percentage increase in cost from repairing to buying new tires:**
   - Difference in cost per year = $45 (new tires) - $40 (repair) = $5
   - Percentage increase = (Difference / Cost of repair) * 100 = ($5 / $40) * 100 = 12.5%

The expression given is:

\[
\frac{a^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2} = (a - b)^2

First, let's simplify the left-hand side:

1. Recognize that \(a^2 - b^2\) is a difference of squares, which can be factored as:

   \[
   a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
   \]

2. Substitute this factorization into the expression:

   \frac{(a - b)(a + b)}{(a + b)(a + b)} = \frac{a - b}{a + b}
   \]

Now, compare this simplified expression with the right-hand side \((a - b)^2\):

The simplified left-hand side is \(\frac{a - b}{a + b}\), which does not match \((a - b)^2\).

Therefore, the expression \(\frac{a^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2}\) does not simplify to \((a - b)^2\) directly. We need to find the correct expression that equates to \((a - b)^2\).

(Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.)
# Answer option: ['A)120', 'B)19', 'C)180', 'D)420', 'E)460']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 4 presenters from a team of 4 men and 4 women, with the condition that the group cannot be composed entirely of men or entirely of women.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from the 8 team members (4 men and 4 women) without any restrictions. This is a combination problem, and the formula for combinations is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose.

In this case, \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 4 \):

\[
\binom{8}{4} = \frac{8!}{4! \times 4!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 70
\]

So, there are 70 total ways to choose 4 presenters from the 8 team members.

Next, we need to subtract the number of groups that consist entirely of men or entirely of women.

1. **All men**: Choose 4 men from 4 men.
   \[
   \binom{4}{4} = 1
   \]

2. **All women**: Choose 4 women from 4 women.
   \[
   \binom{4}{4} = 1
   \]

Adding these two cases gives us the number of groups that are either all men or all women:
\[
1 + 1 = 2
\]

Now, subtract these from the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters:
\[
70 - 2 = 68
\]

Therefore, there are 68 different groups of presenters that can be chosen such that the group is not composed entirely of men or entirely of women.

# Answer option: ['A)84', 'B)66', 'C)28', 'D)19', 'E)11']","Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the unknown number be \( x \).

2. According to the problem, one third of 3/4 of the number is 21. We can write this as an equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times x = 21
   \]

3. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times x = 21 \times 3
   \]

4. Calculate \( 21 \times 3 \):
   \[
   21 \times 3 = 63

We are given that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. We can use the ratio to find out how many red sweets there are.

1. The ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4. This means for every 3 + 4 = 7 parts, 3 parts are red and 4 parts are green.

2. We know there are 120 green sweets, which correspond to the 4 parts in the ratio.

3. To find the value of one part, we divide the number of green sweets by the number of parts for green sweets:

# Answer option: ['A)300', 'B)200', 'C)400', 'D)100', 'E)500']","To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( n \) be the number of employees in the organization.
2. Let \( x \) be the original contribution from each employee.

From the problem statement, we have the following two scenarios:

- The total contribution from all employees is Rs. 6 lakh:
  \[
  n \times x = 600,000
  \]

- If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh:
  \[
  n \times (x + 60) = 624,000

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( n \times x = 600,000 \)
2. \( n \times (x + 60) = 624,000 \)

Let's solve these equations step by step:

From the first equation, express \( x \) in terms of \( n \):
\[
x = \frac{600,000}{n}
\]

Substitute this expression for \( x \) into the second equation:
\[
n \times \left(\frac{600,000}{n} + 60\right) = 624,000

Simplify the equation:
\[
600,000 + 60n = 624,000

Subtract 600,000 from both sides:
\[
60n = 24,000

# Answer option: ['A)21%', 'B)20%', 'C)25%', 'D)33%', 'E)18%']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage increase required to return the discounted price back to the original price.

Let's assume the original price of an item is \( P \).

On the day of the discount, the shopkeeper offers a 20% discount. Therefore, the discounted price is:
\[ P_{\text{discounted}} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P \]

The next day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the item at the original price \( P \). To find the percentage increase needed from the discounted price back to the original price, we use the formula for percentage increase:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Price} - \text{Old Price}}{\text{Old Price}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Here, the ""New Price"" is the original price \( P \), and the ""Old Price"" is the discounted price \( 0.80P \).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{P - 0.80P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{0.20P}{0.80P} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{0.20}{0.80} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 0.25 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = 25\% \]

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 25% to return to the original price.

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
# Answer option: ['A)50', 'B)70', 'C)75', 'D)100', 'E)125']","To solve this problem, let's define some variables:

- Let \( V \) be the number of files infected by a virus.
- Let \( W \) be the number of files infected by a worm.
- Let \( B \) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
- Let \( W_{\text{only}} \) be the number of files infected only by a worm.

We know the following:

1. The total number of files is 250.
2. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, \( V = 0.5 \times 250 = 125 \).
3. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Therefore, \( W_{\text{only}} = 2.5B \).

We also know that:

- The number of files infected by a worm, \( W \), is the sum of those infected only by a worm and those infected by both a virus and a worm. Therefore, \( W = W_{\text{only}} + B = 2.5B + B = 3.5B \).

Since the total number of files is 250, we can write the equation:

\[
V + W - B = 250
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
125 + 3.5B - B = 250
\]

Simplifying:

\[
125 + 2.5B = 250
\]

Subtract 125 from both sides:

\[
2.5B = 125
\]

Divide by 2.5:

\[
B = 50
\]

Now, we can find \( W_{\text{only}} \):

\[
W_{\text{only}} = 2.5B = 2.5 \times 50 = 125
\]

Now, we can find \( W \):

\[
W = 3.5B = 3.5 \times 50 = 175
\]

Finally, we need to find the number of files not infected by a worm. This is the total number of files minus those infected by a worm:

\[
250 - W = 250 - 175 = 75
\]

Therefore, the number of Sam's files that were NOT infected by a worm is 75.

1. **Football Interest**: 8% of the students are interested in Football. Therefore, the number of students interested in Football is \( 0.08x \).

2. **Cricket Interest**: \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the students are interested in Cricket. Therefore, the number of students interested in Cricket is \( \frac{4}{5}x \).

3. **Basketball Interest**: 10% of the students are interested in Basketball. Therefore, the number of students interested in Basketball is \( 0.10x \).

4. **Not Interested in Any Games**: The problem states that 20 students are not interested in any games.

The sum of the percentages of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball, plus those not interested in any games, should equal the total number of students:

\[
0.08x + \frac{4}{5}x + 0.10x + 20 = x

Convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) to a decimal to make calculations easier:

\[
\frac{4}{5} = 0.80

Substitute this into the equation:

\[
0.08x + 0.80x + 0.10x + 20 = x

Combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[
0.98x + 20 = x

1. **Calculate the number of eligible voters:**
   - Total voters = 5,000
   - Percentage of voters not eligible = 20%
   - Number of voters not eligible = 20% of 5,000 = 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000
   - Number of eligible voters = Total voters - Voters not eligible = 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. **Determine the number of votes needed to win:**
   - The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.
   - This means the winning candidate received 15% more votes than the other candidate.

3. **Calculate the number of votes each candidate received:**
   - Let the number of votes the losing candidate received be \( x \).

   - Votes for the winning candidate = 1.15x
   - \( 1.15 \times 1,860.47 \approx 2,139.54 \)

Since the number of votes must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number. However, it seems there might be a miscalculation or misinterpretation in the options provided. Let's re-evaluate:

- If the winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes, then:
  - Winning margin = 15% of 4,000 = 0.15 * 4,000 = 600
  - Let the votes for the losing candidate be \( y \).
  - Then, votes for the winning candidate = \( y + 600 \).

7. **Set up the equation for total votes again:**
   - Total votes = Votes for winning candidate + Votes for losing candidate
   - 4,000 = (y + 600) + y
   - 4,000 = 2y + 600
   - 2y = 4,000 - 600
   - 2y = 3,400
   - \( y = \frac{3,400}{2} = 1,700 \)

188,"There are ten lime soda bottles on a table in a restaurant. They are to be served among two different groups of customers consisting of 5 members each. How many ways are there to create these 2 groups?
# Answer option: ['A)90', 'B)105', 'C)126', 'D)252', 'E)525']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can divide 10 lime soda bottles into two groups of 5 bottles each. This is a classic combinatorics problem where we are choosing 5 bottles out of 10 to form one group, and the remaining bottles automatically form the second group.

The number of ways to choose 5 bottles out of 10 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, and \( k \) is the number of items to choose.

In this case, \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 5 \). So, we calculate:

\[
\binom{10}{5} = \frac{10!}{5! \times 5!}
\]

Calculating the factorials, we have:

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
\]

However, since we are dividing by \( 5! \times 5! \), we only need to calculate the first 5 terms of \( 10! \) and divide by \( 5! \):

\[
10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 = 30240
\]

And \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \).

Now, divide 30240 by 120:

\[
\frac{30240}{120} = 252
\]

Therefore, there are 252 ways to divide the 10 lime soda bottles into two groups of 5 bottles each.

238,"Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?
# Answer option: ['A)50', 'B)100', 'C)150', 'D)200', 'E)70']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls in the class given that exactly 2/5th of the children are girls and there are 100 boys.

1. Let's denote the total number of children in the class as \( T \).

2. According to the problem, 2/5th of the children are girls. Therefore, the number of girls can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} \times T
   \]

3. We also know that there are 100 boys in the class. Since the total number of children is the sum of the number of boys and girls, we can write:
   \[
   T = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls}
   \]
   \[
   T = 100 + \frac{2}{5} \times T
   \]

4. To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   T = 100 + \frac{2}{5} \times T
   \]

5. Rearrange the equation to isolate \( T \):
   \[
   T - \frac{2}{5} \times T = 100
   \]

6. Factor out \( T \) from the left side:
   \[
   T \left(1 - \frac{2}{5}\right) = 100
   \]

7. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   T \left(\frac{5}{5} - \frac{2}{5}\right) = 100
   \]
   \[
   T \left(\frac{3}{5}\right) = 100
   \]

8. Solve for \( T \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{5}\):
   \[
   T = 100 \times \frac{5}{3}
   \]
   \[
   T = \frac{500}{3}
   \]
   \[
   T = 166.67
   \]

9. Since the total number of children must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's assume the total number of children is a multiple of 5, as 2/5th of them are girls.

10. Let \( T = 250 \) (a multiple of 5 that makes calculations easier):
    \[
    \text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} \times 250 = 100
    \]

11. Check if this satisfies the condition of 100 boys:
    \[
    \text{Number of boys} = T - \text{Number of girls} = 250 - 100 = 150
    \]

12. Since we assumed \( T = 250 \) incorrectly, let's correct it:
    \[
    \text{Number of boys} = 100
    \]
    \[
    \text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} \times T
    \]
    \[
    T = 100 + \frac{2}{5} \times T
    \]

13. Solving again:
    \[
    T = 100 + \frac{2}{5} \times T
    \]
    \[
    T - \frac{2}{5} \times T = 100
    \]
    \[
    T \times \frac{3}{5} = 100
    \]
    \[
    T = 100 \times \frac{5}{3} = 166.67
    \]

14. Correcting the approach, assume \( T = 250 \):
    \[
    \text{Number of girls} = \frac{2}{5} \times 250 = 100
    \]

15. Correctly, the number of girls is 100.

248,"What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.
# Answer option: ['A)37', 'B)38', 'C)36', 'D)30', 'E)39']","To solve this problem, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product equals the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   727 + 728 + 729 = 2184
   \]

2. **Set Up the Problem:**
   Let the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). The product of these integers is:
   \[
   (n-1) \times n \times (n+1) = n(n^2 - 1) = n^3 - n
   \]

   We need this product to equal 2184:
   \[
   n^3 - n = 2184
   \]

3. **Estimate \( n \):**
   We need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 - n = 2184 \). Let's estimate \( n \) by considering the cube root of 2184:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{2184} \approx 13
   \]

4. **Test \( n = 13 \):**
   \[
   n^3 - n = 13^3 - 13 = 2197 - 13 = 2184
   \]

   This matches our requirement, so the integers are 12, 13, and 14.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Integers:**

How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)15', 'C)12', 'D)6', 'E)3']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each hose fills the pool and then find out how long it would take hose B to fill the pool alone.

1. **Determine the rate of hose A:**
   - Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, the rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.

2. **Calculate the amount of the pool filled by hose A in the first 2 hours:**
   - In 2 hours, hose A fills \( 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool.

3. **Determine the remaining part of the pool to be filled:**
   - After 2 hours, \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) of the pool is left to be filled.

4. **Calculate the combined rate of hoses A and B:**
   - Hose A and hose B together fill the remaining \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the pool in 3 hours.
   - Therefore, their combined rate is \( \frac{3/4}{3} = \frac{1}{4} \) of the pool per hour.

5. **Determine the rate of hose B:**
   - The rate of hose A is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Let the rate of hose B be \( \frac{1}{b} \) of the pool per hour.
   - Combined, their rate is \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \).

6. **Solve for the rate of hose B:**
   - \( \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} \)
   - Subtract \( \frac{1}{8} \) from both sides: \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \)
   - Find a common denominator: \( \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{8} \)
   - \( \frac{1}{b} = \frac{2}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \)

7. **Calculate the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool alone:**
   - If the rate of hose B is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the pool per hour, then it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the pool alone.

The word ""PROBLEC"" consists of 7 distinct letters: P, R, O, B, L, E, C.

Since we are using all 7 letters to form a 7-letter word and none of the letters repeat, we are essentially looking for the number of permutations of these 7 distinct letters.

The number of permutations of n distinct objects is given by n!, which is the factorial of n.

In this case, n = 7, so we need to calculate 7!.

# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)11', 'C)12', 'D)13', 'E)14']","To solve this problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \( N \) such that when 2272 and 875 are divided by \( N \), they leave the same remainder.

Let's denote the remainder by \( r \). Then we have:
\[ 2272 \equiv r \pmod{N} \]
\[ 875 \equiv r \pmod{N} \]

This implies:
\[ 2272 - r = kN \]
\[ 875 - r = mN \]

for some integers \( k \) and \( m \). Subtracting these two equations gives:
\[ (2272 - r) - (875 - r) = kN - mN \]
\[ 2272 - 875 = (k - m)N \]
\[ 1397 = (k - m)N \]

Thus, \( N \) must be a divisor of 1397. We need to find the 3-digit divisors of 1397.

First, let's factor 1397 to find its divisors. We check divisibility by smaller prime numbers:

- 1397 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
- Sum of digits of 1397 is \( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \), not divisible by 3.
- 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
- For 7, perform the division: \( 1397 \div 7 \approx 199.57 \), not an integer.
- For 11, alternating sum of digits: \( (1 + 9) - (3 + 7) = 10 - 10 = 0 \), divisible by 11. So, 1397 is divisible by 11.

Perform the division:
\[ 1397 \div 11 = 127 \]

So, 1397 can be factored as \( 11 \times 127 \).

Since 127 is a prime number and both 11 and 127 are less than 1000, the only 3-digit divisor of 1397 is 127 itself.

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of \( N = 127 \):
\[ 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \]

Thus, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 10.

# Answer option: ['A)238', 'B)289', 'C)200', 'D)287', 'E)187']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance from the starting point where the ship and the plane meet.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( 10S \) as the speed of the plane (since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship).
- \( t \) as the time taken by the plane to meet the ship after it starts.

First, calculate the time it took for the ship to travel 180 miles:
- The ship travels 180 miles at speed \( S \), so the time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is \( \frac{180}{S} \).

When the plane starts, the ship has already traveled 180 miles. From this point, both the ship and the plane travel for the same amount of time \( t \) until they meet.

During this time \( t \):
- The ship travels an additional distance of \( S \times t \).
- The plane travels a distance of \( 10S \times t \).

Since they meet at the same point, the total distance traveled by the ship from the start is equal to the total distance traveled by the plane from the start.

The total distance traveled by the ship from the start is:
\[ 180 + S \times t \]

The total distance traveled by the plane from the start is:
\[ 10S \times t \]

Setting these two distances equal gives:
\[ 180 + S \times t = 10S \times t \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ 180 = 10S \times t - S \times t \]
\[ 180 = 9S \times t \]
\[ t = \frac{180}{9S} \]
\[ t = \frac{20}{S} \]

Now, substitute \( t = \frac{20}{S} \) back into the equation for the total distance traveled by the ship:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 180 + S \times \frac{20}{S} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 180 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 200 \]

Thus, the distance from the starting point where they meet is 200 miles.

   - **Case 4:** One $2 bar, one $1 bar, and one 50-cent bar.
     - Cost: \(2 + 1 + 0.5 = 3.5\) dollars. (This does not satisfy the condition of being more than $4, so we exclude this case.)

     - Case 2: 18 ways
     - Case 5: 4 ways

   Total = \(24 + 18 + 4 = 46\) ways.

93,"A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction?
# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)15', 'C)18', 'D)20', 'E)30']","To determine the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. **Identify the given quantities:**
   - Total number of books = 45
   - Number of hardcover books = 30
   - Number of fiction books = 20

2. **Determine the maximum overlap:**
   - We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. This is the intersection of the two sets: hardcover books and fiction books.

3. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**
   - The maximum overlap occurs when the total number of books is just enough to cover the sum of the two categories minus their intersection.
   - If all fiction books are hardcover, then the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is simply the number of fiction books, which is 20.

4. **Check the feasibility:**
   - If all 20 fiction books are hardcover, then there are 10 more hardcover books that are not fiction (since there are 30 hardcover books in total).
   - This scenario is feasible because the total number of books is 45, which is more than enough to accommodate 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books.

Thus, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.

This diagonal will be the diameter of the sphere because the sphere is inscribed such that all vertices of the rectangular solid touch the sphere.

The dimensions of the rectangular solid are given as 3, 4, and 15. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular solid with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}
\]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
3^2 = 9
\]
\[
4^2 = 16
\]
\[
15^2 = 225

Adding these values:

\[
9 + 16 + 225 = 250

Now, take the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{250}

Simplifying \(\sqrt{250}\):

\[
\sqrt{250} = \sqrt{25 \times 10} = \sqrt{25} \times \sqrt{10} = 5\sqrt{10}

123,"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third. What is the value of 50% of that number?
# Answer option: ['A)22.5', 'B)84', 'C)21', 'D)24', 'E)25']","Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let the unknown number be \( x \).

2. According to the problem, when 30 is subtracted from this number, it is reduced to its one third. This can be expressed as an equation:
   \[
   x - 30 = \frac{x}{3}
   \]

3. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
   \[
   3(x - 30) = x
   \]

4. Distribute the 3 on the left side:
   \[
   3x - 90 = x
   \]

5. To isolate \( x \), subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x - x - 90 = 0

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x - 90 = 0
   \]

7. Add 90 to both sides to solve for \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 90
   \]

8. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 45

210,"Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways?
# Answer option: ['A)22 hrs', 'B)18 hrs', 'C)16 hrs', 'D)20 hrs', 'E)13 hrs']","To solve this problem, let's define the variables:

- Let \( T \) be the time taken to travel one way by train.
- Let \( C \) be the time taken to travel one way by car.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   T + C = 17
   \]

2. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. This means that traveling both ways by train takes 4 hours more than traveling one way by train and one way by car. Therefore:
   \[
   2T = 17 + 4 = 21
   \]

From equation 2, we can solve for \( T \):
\[
2T = 21 \implies T = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5
\]

Now, substitute \( T = 10.5 \) into equation 1 to find \( C \):
\[
10.5 + C = 17 \implies C = 17 - 10.5 = 6.5
\]

Now, we need to find the time taken if Mr. Sam traveled both ways by car:
\[
2C = 2 \times 6.5 = 13

# Answer option: ['A)126km', 'B)144km', 'C)127km', 'D)228km', 'E)128km']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance traveled by the jeep. Let's denote the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as \( v \) km/hr.

1. **Forward Journey:**
   - Time taken = 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( v \times 6 \) km

2. **Return Journey:**
   - The speed is increased by 12 km/hr, so the speed during the return journey is \( v + 12 \) km/hr.
   - Time taken = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( (v + 12) \times 4 \) km

Since the distance traveled in both the forward and return journeys is the same, we can set up the equation:

\[ 6v = 4(v + 12) \]

Now, let's solve for \( v \):

\[ 6v = 4v + 48 \]

Subtract \( 4v \) from both sides:

\[ 2v = 48 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ v = 24 \]

Now that we have the speed of the jeep during the forward journey, we can calculate the distance:

Distance = \( 6v = 6 \times 24 = 144 \) km

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 144 km.

# Answer option: ['A)40', 'B)62', 'C)82', 'D)92', 'E)102']","To solve this problem, we need to find the number of consecutive integers, \( k \), such that their sum is 51, and the least integer is -50.

Let's denote the consecutive integers as:
\[
-50, -49, -48, \ldots, (-50 + k - 1)
\]

The sum of these \( k \) consecutive integers can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Sum} = (-50) + (-49) + (-48) + \ldots + (-50 + k - 1)
\]

This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = -50 \) and the last term is \( -50 + k - 1 \). The number of terms is \( k \).

The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
51 = \frac{k}{2} \times \left(-50 + (-50 + k - 1)\right)
\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
-50 + (-50 + k - 1) = -50 - 50 + k - 1 = -101 + k
\]

Substitute back into the sum equation:
\[
51 = \frac{k}{2} \times (-101 + k)
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
102 = k \times (-101 + k)

Distribute \( k \):
\[
102 = -101k + k^2
\]

Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
\[
k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -101 \), and \( c = -102 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-101)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609
\]

Calculate the square root of the discriminant:
\[
\sqrt{10609} = 103
\]

Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
\[
k = \frac{101 \pm 103}{2}
\]

Calculate the two possible values for \( k \):
1. \( k = \frac{101 + 103}{2} = \frac{204}{2} = 102 \)
2. \( k = \frac{101 - 103}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \)

Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we choose \( k = 102 \).

Thus, the number of consecutive integers is \(\boxed{102}\).

101,"A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :
# Answer option: ['A)18', 'B)20', 'C)25', 'D)26', 'E)27']","To solve this problem, we need to understand that the ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. We are given that the youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages of all members is 250 years.

Let's denote:
- The number of members in the club as \( n \).
- The age of the youngest member as \( a = 7 \) years.
- The common difference \( d = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} \) years (since 3 months is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a year).

The ages of the members form an arithmetic sequence:
- The first term \( a = 7 \).
- The second term \( a + d = 7 + \frac{1}{4} \).
- The third term \( a + 2d = 7 + 2 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \), and so on.

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1) \cdot d \]

The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2a + (n-1) \cdot d) \]

We know the sum of the ages is 250 years, so:
\[ \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2 \times 7 + (n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{4}) = 250 \]

Simplifying:
\[ \frac{n}{2} \cdot (14 + \frac{n-1}{4}) = 250 \]

Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ n \cdot (14 + \frac{n-1}{4}) = 500 \]

Distribute \( n \):
\[ 14n + \frac{n(n-1)}{4} = 500 \]

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 56n + n(n-1) = 2000 \]

\[ n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 0 \).

We can solve this using the quadratic formula:
\[ n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 56 \), and \( c = -2000 \).

Calculate the discriminant:
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 56^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2000) \]
\[ = 3136 + 8000 \]
\[ = 11136 \]

Now, solve for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{-56 \pm \sqrt{11136}}{2} \]

Calculate \( \sqrt{11136} \):
\[ \sqrt{11136} = 105.5 \] (approximately)

So, the solutions for \( n \) are:
\[ n = \frac{-56 + 105.5}{2} \]
\[ n = \frac{49.5}{2} \]
\[ n = 24.75 \]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 25.

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 25.

# Answer option: ['A)15', 'B)16', 'C)17', 'D)18', 'E)19']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jacob made, given that both Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and together they made 35 toys.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of toys made by Alex.
- \( J \) as the number of toys made by Jacob.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( A + J = 35 \) (total toys made by both).
2. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Alex worked is \( 7A \).
3. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so the total hours Jacob worked is \( 9J \).
4. Both worked for almost the same number of hours, so \( 7A \approx 9J \).

We can set up the equation for the hours worked:
\[ 7A = 9J \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( A + J = 35 \)
2. \( 7A = 9J \)

From the second equation, express \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ A = \frac{9}{7}J \]

Substitute \( A \) in the first equation:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + J = 35 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \frac{9}{7}J + \frac{7}{7}J = 35 \]
\[ \frac{16}{7}J = 35 \]

Solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 35 \times \frac{7}{16} \]
\[ J = \frac{245}{16} \]
\[ J = 15.3125 \]

Since \( J \) must be an integer, and the options provided are integers, we round \( J \) to the nearest whole number. The closest integer to 15.3125 is 15.

Therefore, the number of toys prepared by Jacob is 15.

1. **Calculate the total man-days required to complete the work:**
   - 8 men work for 6 days to complete the work.
   - Total man-days = Number of men × Number of days = 8 men × 6 days = 48 man-days.

2. **Determine how many men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day:**
   - We need to complete the same amount of work (48 man-days) in 1/2 day.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day.
   - The equation for the work done is: \( x \) men × 1/2 day = 48 man-days.

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x \times \frac{1}{2} = 48 \)

1. **Determine the work rate of each painter:**
   - Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{6} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Black can paint 1 house in 8 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{8} \) house per day.
   - Mr. Blue can paint 1 house in 12 days, so his rate is \( \frac{1}{12} \) house per day.

2. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Brown in 8 days:**
   - In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints \( 8 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3} \) houses.

3. **Calculate the work done by Mr. Black in 6 days:**
   - In 6 days, Mr. Black paints \( 6 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) houses.

4. **Total work done by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:**
   - Total work = \( \frac{4}{3} + \frac{3}{4} \).
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator: \( \frac{4}{3} = \frac{16}{12} \) and \( \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{12} \).

# Answer option: ['A)12 am on the next day', 'B)5 am on the next day', 'C)5 pm on the next day', 'D)2 pm on the next day', 'E)None of these']","To determine when the two trains will meet, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and find the point where they meet.

1. **Calculate the head start of Train A:**
   - Train A leaves at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm. Therefore, Train A has a 3-hour head start.
   - In 3 hours, Train A travels: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 40 \text{ kmph} = 120 \text{ km}\).

2. **Relative speed of the trains:**
   - Since both trains are traveling in the same direction, we calculate the relative speed by subtracting the speed of Train A from Train B.
   - Relative speed = \(72 \text{ kmph} - 40 \text{ kmph} = 32 \text{ kmph}\).

# Answer option: ['A)10', 'B)11.5', 'C)12.5', 'D)13.5', 'E)15']","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total journey duration considering the change in speed after covering a quarter of the distance.

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours to reach its destination.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 100 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered before it starts raining:**
   - The train covers a quarter of the total distance before it starts raining.
   - Therefore, the distance covered before it starts raining is:
     \[
     \text{Distance before rain} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \, \text{miles} = 250 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time taken to cover the distance before it starts raining:**
   - The train travels at 100 miles/hour for the first 250 miles.
   - Therefore, the time taken to cover 250 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time before rain} = \frac{250 \, \text{miles}}{100 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 2.5 \, \text{hours}

4. **Calculate the remaining distance after it starts raining:**
   - The remaining distance to be covered after it starts raining is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = 1000 \, \text{miles} - 250 \, \text{miles} = 750 \, \text{miles}

5. **Calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the reduced speed:**
   - The train travels at 75 miles/hour for the remaining 750 miles.
   - Therefore, the time taken to cover 750 miles is:
     \[
     \text{Time after rain} = \frac{750 \, \text{miles}}{75 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 10 \, \text{hours}

6. **Calculate the total journey duration:**
   - The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken before and after it starts raining:
     \[
     \text{Total Journey Duration} = 2.5 \, \text{hours} + 10 \, \text{hours} = 12.5 \, \text{hours}

1. **Determine the rate of production for each machine:**
   - Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{6} \) yo-yos per minute.
   - Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes. Therefore, its rate of production is \( \frac{1}{9} \) yo-yos per minute.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of production:**
   - The combined rate of production for both machines is the sum of their individual rates:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{9}
     \]
   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 9 is 18.
   - Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 18:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{18}, \quad \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{18}
     \]
   - Add the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{3}{18} + \frac{2}{18} = \frac{5}{18}

   - Therefore, the combined rate of production is \( \frac{5}{18} \) yo-yos per minute.

3. **Determine how long it takes to produce 10 yo-yos:**
   - Let \( t \) be the time in minutes it takes to produce 10 yo-yos. Using the combined rate of production:

137,"Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds. Find the total distance between A to B.
# Answer option: ['A)700 meters', 'B)1000 meters', 'C)700 kilometers', 'D)555 meters', 'E)600 meters']","To find the total distance between A and B, we need to determine how far Ram and Krishna have traveled when they meet at point C.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by Ram:**
   - Ram's speed = 20 m/s
   - Time traveled = 10 seconds
   - Distance traveled by Ram = Speed × Time = 20 m/s × 10 s = 200 meters

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by Krishna:**
   - Krishna's speed = 40 m/s
   - Time traveled = 10 seconds
   - Distance traveled by Krishna = Speed × Time = 40 m/s × 10 s = 400 meters

3. **Calculate the total distance between A and B:**
   - The total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna when they meet.
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by Ram + Distance traveled by Krishna = 200 meters + 400 meters = 600 meters

Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 600 meters.

89,"A book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%. If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?
# Answer option: ['A)2% Profit', 'B)3% Profit', 'C)2% Loss', 'D)3% Loss', 'E)4% Loss']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost price of the book first and then calculate the profit or loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.

1. **Determine the Cost Price (CP):**

   The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the selling price (SP) is 110% of the cost price.

   \[
   SP = CP + 10\% \text{ of } CP = 1.10 \times CP
   \]

   Given that SP = Rs. 27.50, we can set up the equation:

   \[
   1.10 \times CP = 27.50
   \]

   Solving for CP:

   \[
   CP = \frac{27.50}{1.10} = 25.00
   \]

   So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.00.

2. **Calculate the Profit or Loss if Sold for Rs. 25.75:**

   If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, we need to compare this selling price with the cost price to determine the profit or loss.

   \[
   \text{Profit or Loss} = SP - CP = 25.75 - 25.00 = 0.75
   \]

   Since the result is positive, it indicates a profit.

3. **Calculate the Profit Percentage:**

   The profit percentage is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{CP}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.75}{25.00} \right) \times 100 = 3\%

# Answer option: ['A)5%', 'B)15%', 'C)25%', 'D)35%', 'E)45%']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

Let's break down the information given:

1. 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
2. 40% of employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.
3. 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

First, let's find the percentage of employees who take at least one type of vacation. Since 20% take neither, 100% - 20% = 80% take at least one type of vacation.

Next, we know that 75% take a winter vacation. This includes those who take both winter and summer vacations. Therefore, the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is:

75% (winter vacation) - 40% (both vacations) = 35% (only winter vacation).

Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation. Since 80% take at least one type of vacation and 20% take neither, we know that:

80% (at least one vacation) - 75% (winter vacation) = 5% (only summer vacation).

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5%.

# Answer option: ['A)40', 'B)200', 'C)380', 'D)400', 'E)3200']","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We start with a bag of only white marbles. The number of marbles in the bag is unknown, so let's denote it as \( Q \).

2. **First Action:**
   - 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back into the bag. Now, the bag contains \( Q \) marbles, of which 20 are black.

3. **Second Action:**
   - Another 20 marbles are pulled out, and 1 of them is black. This means the proportion of black marbles in this sample is \( \frac{1}{20} \).

4. **Proportion of Black Marbles:**
   - We are told that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. Therefore, the proportion of black marbles in the bag is also \( \frac{1}{20} \).

5. **Equation Setup:**
   - The proportion of black marbles in the bag is given by the number of black marbles divided by the total number of marbles, \( \frac{20}{Q} \).
   - According to the problem, this proportion is equal to \( \frac{1}{20} \).

6. **Solve for \( Q \):**
   \[
   \frac{20}{Q} = \frac{1}{20}

# Answer option: ['A)36', 'B)28', 'C)42', 'D)15', 'E)20']","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the height of an object and the length of its shadow. This relationship is typically proportional, meaning that if one object is taller than another, its shadow will be proportionally longer, assuming the light source and angle are the same for both objects.

Given:
- The first ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that is 10 inches long.
- The second ant is 6 inches tall, and we need to find the length of its shadow.

Let's set up a proportion based on the information given for the first ant:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of first ant}}{\text{Shadow of first ant}} = \frac{\text{Height of second ant}}{\text{Shadow of second ant}}
\]

Substitute the known values into the proportion:

\[
\frac{4}{10} = \frac{6}{x}
\]

Where \( x \) is the length of the shadow of the second ant. To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:

\[
4x = 6 \times 10
\]

\[
4x = 60
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{60}{4}

# Answer option: ['A)6', 'B)7', 'C)8', 'D)9', 'E)10']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of line segment RU given the information about the points R, S, T, and U on a line.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - RS = 5
   - RT = 17
   - ST = 22
   - U is the midpoint of ST.

2. **Determine the position of U:**
   Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is equal to the length of UT. Therefore, SU = UT = ST/2 = 22/2 = 11.

3. **Determine the position of R, S, T, and U on the line:**
   - Let's assume point R is at position 0 on the line.
   - Since RS = 5, point S is at position 5.
   - Since ST = 22, point T is at position 5 + 22 = 27.
   - Since U is the midpoint of ST, U is at position (5 + 27)/2 = 16.

4. **Calculate the length of RU:**
   - R is at position 0.
   - U is at position 16.
   - Therefore, the length of RU is 16 - 0 = 16.

However, it seems there is a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:

- We know RT = 17, and T is at position 27. Therefore, R should be at position 27 - 17 = 10.
- Now, recalculate RU:
  - R is at position 10.
  - U is at position 16.
  - Therefore, the length of RU is 16 - 10 = 6.

Thus, the length of line segment RU is 6.

# Answer option: ['A)9 Trousers', 'B)8 Trousers', 'C)10 Trousers', 'D)7 Trousers', 'E)11 Trousers']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trousers and shirts the man can buy with a total of Rs 810, given that trousers cost Rs 70 each and shirts cost Rs 30 each. We also need to maximize the number of trousers purchased.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased:**

   - Each trouser costs Rs 70.
   - If the man spends all Rs 810 on trousers, the maximum number of trousers he can buy is:
     \[
     \text{Maximum trousers} = \left\lfloor \frac{810}{70} \right\rfloor = 11 \text{ trousers}
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the maximum number of trousers:**

   - Cost of 11 trousers = \(11 \times 70 = 770\)
   - Remaining money = \(810 - 770 = 40\)

3. **Determine how many shirts can be bought with the remaining money:**

   - Each shirt costs Rs 30.
   - With Rs 40 remaining, the man can buy:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{40}{30} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ shirt}
     \]

4. **Verify the total expenditure:**

   - Total cost for 11 trousers and 1 shirt = \(770 + 30 = 800\)
   - This is within the budget of Rs 810.

5. **Determine the ratio of trousers to shirts:**

   - Number of trousers = 11
   - Number of shirts = 1
   - Ratio of trousers to shirts = \(11:1\)

Since the problem asks for the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased, the answer is the number of trousers, which is 11.

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|

Substituting the given points \((a,0)\), \((b,0)\), and \((x,y)\) into the formula, we have:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| a(0-y) + b(y-0) + x(0-0) \right|

This means we need to consider the cases where Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger, since Roger cheats.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Probability that Alan answers correctly:**
   - Alan guesses randomly, so the probability that he answers correctly is \( \frac{1}{5} \).

2. **Probability that Roger answers correctly:**
   - Roger cheats, so the probability that he answers correctly is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Probability that Peter answers correctly:**
   - Peter performs calculations, so the probability that he answers correctly is \( \frac{5}{6} \).

4. **Probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating:**
   - This means either Alan or Peter answers correctly, but not Roger.

   - **Case 1:** Alan answers correctly and Roger does not.
     - Probability that Alan answers correctly: \( \frac{1}{5} \).
     - Probability that Roger does not answer correctly: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \).
     - Combined probability for this case: \( \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{15} \).

   - **Case 2:** Peter answers correctly and Roger does not.
     - Probability that Peter answers correctly: \( \frac{5}{6} \).
     - Probability that Roger does not answer correctly: \( \frac{1}{3} \).
     - Combined probability for this case: \( \frac{5}{6} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{18} \).

5. **Total probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating:**
   - Add the probabilities from Case 1 and Case 2:
   \[
   \frac{1}{15} + \frac{5}{18}
   \]

   - To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 15 and 18 is 90.

   - Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 90:
     - \( \frac{1}{15} = \frac{6}{90} \)
     - \( \frac{5}{18} = \frac{25}{90} \)

   - Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{6}{90} + \frac{25}{90} = \frac{31}{90}

# Answer option: ['A)8', 'B)12', 'C)16', 'D)24', 'E)25']","Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( n \) be the original number of friends who planned to go on the picnic.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount each friend was originally supposed to contribute.

2. **Set Up the Original Equation:**
   - The total planned expenditure on eatables is Rs. 96.
   - Therefore, the original contribution per person is given by:
     \[
     n \times x = 96
     \]
   - So, \( x = \frac{96}{n} \).

3. **Account for the Friends Who Did Not Turn Up:**
   - Four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who actually attended is \( n - 4 \).
   - Each of these friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so the new contribution per person is \( x + 4 \).

4. **Set Up the New Equation:**
   - The total expenditure remains Rs. 96, so:
     \[
     (n - 4) \times (x + 4) = 96
     \]

5. **Substitute the Value of \( x \):**
   - Substitute \( x = \frac{96}{n} \) into the new equation:
     \[
     (n - 4) \times \left(\frac{96}{n} + 4\right) = 96
     \]

6. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distribute and simplify:
     \[
     (n - 4) \times \left(\frac{96 + 4n}{n}\right) = 96
     \]
   - Multiply through by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     (n - 4) \times (96 + 4n) = 96n
     \]
   - Expand:
     \[
     96n + 4n^2 - 384 - 16n = 96n
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     4n^2 - 16n - 384 = 0
     \]

7. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Divide the entire equation by 4:
     \[
     n^2 - 4n - 96 = 0
     \]
   - Factor the quadratic:
     \[
     (n - 12)(n + 8) = 0
     \]
   - The solutions are \( n = 12 \) and \( n = -8 \).

8. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since the number of friends cannot be negative, \( n = 12 \).

9. **Determine the Number of Friends Who Attended:**
   - The number of friends who attended is \( n - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \).

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 8.

   - The side of the square is given as 20 cm.
   - The area of the square is side × side = 20 cm × 20 cm = 400 cm².

2. **Calculate the area of the semi-circles:**
   - The diameter of each semi-circle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm.
   - The radius of each semi-circle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.
   - The area of a full circle with radius 10 cm is πr² = π × (10 cm)² = 100π cm².
   - The area of one semi-circle is half of the full circle's area, so it is 100π / 2 = 50π cm².
   - Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is 2 × 50π = 100π cm².

3. **Calculate the area of the remaining paper:**
   - Subtract the area of the semi-circles from the area of the square.
   - Remaining area = Area of square - Area of semi-circles = 400 cm² - 100π cm².

4. **Approximate the value of π:**
   - Use the approximation π ≈ 3.14.
   - Therefore, 100π ≈ 100 × 3.14 = 314 cm².

5. **Calculate the final remaining area:**
   - Remaining area = 400 cm² - 314 cm² = 86 cm².

The area of the remaining paper is 86 cm². However, none of the provided answer options match this calculation. It seems there might be a mistake in the options provided or in the interpretation of the problem. Based on the calculations, the correct area should be 86 cm², but since this is not an option, I will assume there might be a typographical error in the options.

Final answer: {None of the provided options match the calculated area of 86 cm².}"

# Answer option: ['A)9 2 0 0', 'B)9 2 0 9', 'C)9 2 0 1', 'D)9 2 0 7', 'E)9 2 2 2']","To decipher the multiplication table, we need to interpret the letters as digits and solve the multiplication problem. The problem is structured as follows:

```
  M A D
×   B E
-------------
  M A D
R A E
-------------
A M I D
```

This represents a multiplication of a three-digit number \(MAD\) by a two-digit number \(BE\), resulting in a four-digit number \(AMID\).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the structure:**
   - \(MAD\) is multiplied by \(E\) to give \(MAD\) (the first partial product).
   - \(MAD\) is multiplied by \(B\) to give \(RAE\) (the second partial product, shifted one position to the left).
   - The sum of these partial products is \(AMID\).

2. **Analyze the first partial product:**
   - Since \(MAD \times E = MAD\), \(E\) must be 1. This is because multiplying by 1 leaves the number unchanged.

3. **Analyze the second partial product:**
   - \(MAD \times B = RAE\), and since \(E = 1\), \(B\) must be a digit that, when multiplied by \(MAD\), results in a number that fits the pattern \(RAE\).

4. **Consider the final sum:**
   - The sum of \(MAD\) and \(RAE\) must equal \(AMID\).

5. **Trial and error with options:**
   - We are given options that suggest possible values for \(MAD\) and \(AMID\). Let's test these:

   - **Option A: 9200**
     - \(MAD = 920\), \(AMID = 9200\)
     - \(920 \times 1 = 920\)
     - \(920 \times B = RAE\) and \(920 + RAE = 9200\)
     - \(RAE = 9200 - 920 = 8280\)
     - \(920 \times B = 8280\) implies \(B = 9\)
     - This works because \(920 \times 9 = 8280\)

   - **Option B: 9209**
     - \(MAD = 920\), \(AMID = 9209\)
     - \(920 \times 1 = 920\)
     - \(920 \times B = RAE\) and \(920 + RAE = 9209\)
     - \(RAE = 9209 - 920 = 8289\)
     - \(920 \times B = 8289\) does not work as \(B\) is not an integer

   - **Option C: 9201**
     - \(MAD = 920\), \(AMID = 9201\)
     - \(920 \times 1 = 920\)
     - \(920 \times B = RAE\) and \(920 + RAE = 9201\)
     - \(RAE = 9201 - 920 = 8281\)
     - \(920 \times B = 8281\) does not work as \(B\) is not an integer

   - **Option D: 9207**
     - \(MAD = 920\), \(AMID = 9207\)
     - \(920 \times 1 = 920\)
     - \(920 \times B = RAE\) and \(920 + RAE = 9207\)
     - \(RAE = 9207 - 920 = 8287\)
     - \(920 \times B = 8287\) does not work as \(B\) is not an integer

   - **Option E: 9222**
     - \(MAD = 922\), \(AMID = 9222\)
     - \(922 \times 1 = 922\)
     - \(922 \times B = RAE\) and \(922 + RAE = 9222\)
     - \(RAE = 9222 - 922 = 8300\)
     - \(922 \times B = 8300\) does not work as \(B\) is not an integer

The only option that works is Option A, where \(MAD = 920\), \(B = 9\), \(E = 1\), and \(AMID = 9200\).

96,"A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
# Answer option: ['A)9', 'B)11', 'C)22', 'D)25', 'E)31']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of each side of the square formed by rebending the wire.

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Rectangle:**
   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Breadth})
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (27 \, \text{cm} + 17 \, \text{cm}) = 2 \times 44 \, \text{cm} = 88 \, \text{cm}
   \]

2. **Use the Perimeter to Form a Square:**
   When the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm.

3. **Calculate the Side Length of the Square:**
   The perimeter of a square is given by:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{Side length}
   \]
   Setting this equal to 88 cm:
   \[
   4 \times \text{Side length} = 88 \, \text{cm}
   \]
   Solving for the side length:
   \[
   \text{Side length} = \frac{88 \, \text{cm}}{4} = 22 \, \text{cm}
   \]

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm.

How much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?
# Answer option: ['A)45 Min', 'B)75 Min', 'C)90 Min', 'D)120 Min', 'E)60 Min']","To determine how much time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets, let's break it down step by step:

1. Roy takes the first tablet immediately. This is at time 0 minutes.
2. He takes the second tablet 15 minutes after the first one.
3. He takes the third tablet 15 minutes after the second one.
4. He takes the fourth tablet 15 minutes after the third one.
5. He takes the fifth tablet 15 minutes after the fourth one.

Now, let's calculate the total time:

- Time for the first tablet: 0 minutes
- Time for the second tablet: 15 minutes
- Time for the third tablet: 15 + 15 = 30 minutes
- Time for the fourth tablet: 30 + 15 = 45 minutes
- Time for the fifth tablet: 45 + 15 = 60 minutes

Therefore, it will take Roy a total of 60 minutes to consume all 5 tablets.

50,"I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there?
# Answer option: ['A)453', 'B)651', 'C)400', 'D)487', 'E)286']","To solve this problem, let's define the number of each type of coin as \( x \). This means there are \( x \) coins of 25 paise, \( x \) coins of 50 paise, and \( x \) coins of 1 rupee.

First, let's convert the total amount in the pouch to paise for easier calculation. Since 1 rupee = 100 paise, Rs. 700 is equivalent to 70000 paise.

Now, calculate the total value of the coins in terms of paise:

- The value of \( x \) coins of 25 paise is \( 25x \) paise.
- The value of \( x \) coins of 50 paise is \( 50x \) paise.
- The value of \( x \) coins of 1 rupee is \( 100x \) paise.

The total value of all the coins is the sum of these values:

\[
25x + 50x + 100x = 175x
\]

We know that the total value of the coins is 70000 paise, so we can set up the equation:

\[
175x = 70000
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{70000}{175}
\]

Calculate the division:

\[
x = 400

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

2. According to the problem, 10% of the staplers were defective. Therefore, the number of defective staplers is \( 0.1x \).

3. The number of non-defective staplers is then \( x - 0.1x = 0.9x \).

4. Of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers rejected by mistake is \( 0.02 \times 0.9x = 0.018x \).

5. We are given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   0.018x = 72

# Answer option: ['A)70', 'B)30', 'C)3', 'D)7', 'E)5']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of matches played by the tennis team and then calculate how many matches they lost.

1. **Determine the total number of matches played:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of matches played.
   - We know that the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches.
   - Therefore, the number of matches lost is 30% of the total matches, or \( 0.3x \).

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total number of matches is the sum of matches won and matches lost.
   - So, \( 20 + 0.3x = x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation: \( 0.3x = x - 20 \).
   - Simplify: \( 0.3x = 1x - 20 \).
   - Subtract \( 0.3x \) from both sides: \( 0.7x = 20 \).
   - Divide both sides by 0.7: \( x = \frac{20}{0.7} \).

4. **Calculate \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{20}{0.7} = \frac{200}{7} \approx 28.57 \).
   - Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number: \( x = 28 \).

5. **Calculate the number of matches lost:**
   - The number of matches lost is 30% of the total matches: \( 0.3 \times 28 = 8.4 \).
   - Since the number of matches lost must also be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number: 8.

4,"A trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. What is the cost price of the article?
# Answer option: ['A)270', 'B)300', 'C)280', 'D)320', 'E)315']","To find the cost price of the article, we need to understand the relationship between the selling price, cost price, and profit percentage.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Selling Price (SP) = Rs. 360
   - Profit Percentage = 20%

2. **Use the formula for profit percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Profit Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Substitute the known values into the formula:**
   \[
   20 = \left(\frac{360 - \text{Cost Price}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   20 = \left(\frac{360 - \text{Cost Price}}{\text{Cost Price}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   0.2 = \frac{360 - \text{Cost Price}}{\text{Cost Price}}
   \]

5. **Solve for Cost Price:**
   \[
   0.2 \times \text{Cost Price} = 360 - \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   \[
   0.2 \times \text{Cost Price} + \text{Cost Price} = 360
   \]
   \[
   1.2 \times \text{Cost Price} = 360
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost Price} = \frac{360}{1.2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost Price} = 300
   \]

6. **Verify the calculation:**
   - If the Cost Price is Rs. 300, then the profit is 20% of Rs. 300, which is Rs. 60.
   - Therefore, the Selling Price should be Rs. 300 + Rs. 60 = Rs. 360, which matches the given Selling Price.

Thus, the cost price of the article is Rs. 300.

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as \( N \).

1. **Physics Students**: 20% of the students took exactly physics. Therefore, the number of students who took exactly physics is \( 0.2N \).

2. **Math Students**: 28% of the students took exactly math. Therefore, the number of students who took exactly math is \( 0.28N \).

Since these are the students who took exactly one subject, they do not overlap. Therefore, the total number of students who took either physics or math is \( 0.2N + 0.28N = 0.48N \).

Given that there are more than 501 students in the school, we need to find the smallest integer \( N \) such that:

\[ N > 501 \]

and

\[ 0.48N \] is an integer (since the number of students must be a whole number).

Let's check the options provided:

- **A) 550**: \( 0.48 \times 550 = 264 \) (integer)
- **B) 570**: \( 0.48 \times 570 = 273.6 \) (not an integer)
- **C) 600**: \( 0.48 \times 600 = 288 \) (integer)
- **D) 700**: \( 0.48 \times 700 = 336 \) (integer)

The smallest \( N \) that satisfies both conditions (greater than 501 and \( 0.48N \) being an integer) is 550.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 550.

233,"Professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest. What was the rate of interest per annum?
# Answer option: ['A)2%', 'B)8%', 'C)5%', 'D)10%', 'E)None of these']","To find the rate of interest per annum, we can use the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest (SI)} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (Rs. 5000),
- \( R \) is the rate of interest per annum,
- \( T \) is the time period in years (3 years),
- SI is the simple interest (Rs. 300).

We need to find \( R \). Plugging in the known values into the formula, we have:

\[ 300 = \frac{5000 \times R \times 3}{100} \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ 300 = \frac{15000 \times R}{100} \]

\[ 300 = 150R \]

Now, solve for \( R \):

\[ R = \frac{300}{150} \]

\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%.

92,"Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes. If they start rotating now from the same point, when will they be at the same starting point again?
# Answer option: ['A)1 hour and 31 minutes', 'B)2 hour and 31 minutes', 'C)3 hour and 31 minutes', 'D)4 hour and 31 minutes', 'E)5 hour and 31 minutes']","To solve this problem, we need to determine when both balls A and B will be at the same starting point again after they start rotating together.

1. **Determine the time for one full rotation for each ball:**

   - Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. Therefore, the time for one full rotation for Ball A is:
     \[
     \text{Time for one rotation of A} = \frac{26 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 13 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. Therefore, the time for one full rotation for Ball B is:
     \[
     \text{Time for one rotation of B} = \frac{35 \text{ minutes}}{5} = 7 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the rotation times:**

   - We need to find the LCM of 13 minutes and 7 minutes to determine when both balls will be at the starting point simultaneously.

   - Since 13 and 7 are both prime numbers, their LCM is simply their product:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(13, 7) = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the LCM into hours and minutes:**

   - 91 minutes can be converted into hours and minutes:
     \[
     91 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 31 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, both balls A and B will be at the same starting point again after 1 hour and 31 minutes.

# Answer option: ['A)6.5', 'B)7.5', 'C)7', 'D)6', 'E)None of the above']","To solve this problem, we need to understand the ratio of rice, wheat, and corn in the cereal mixture, which is given as 2:3:5. This means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.

We are told that the bag contains 3 pounds of rice. Since the ratio of rice is 2 parts, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of parts in the mixture:

Let the common factor for the parts be \( x \). Then:
- Rice = 2 parts = \( 2x \)
- Wheat = 3 parts = \( 3x \)
- Corn = 5 parts = \( 5x \)

We know that the rice weighs 3 pounds, so:
\[ 2x = 3 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{3}{2} \]

Now, we need to find the weight of the corn, which is 5 parts:
\[ 5x = 5 \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn.

214,"IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?
# Answer option: ['A)0.5', 'B)1', 'C)1.25', 'D)1.5', 'E)2']","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional gallons of orange juice must be added to the existing mixture to make orange juice 60% of the total mixture.

1. **Initial Composition:**
   - The initial mixture is 1 gallon of soft drink.
   - It contains 40% orange juice and 60% water.
   - Therefore, the amount of orange juice in the initial mixture is 0.4 gallons (40% of 1 gallon).

2. **Desired Composition:**
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture.
   - Let \( x \) be the additional gallons of orange juice to be added.

3. **Equation Setup:**
   - After adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes \( 0.4 + x \) gallons.
   - The total volume of the mixture becomes \( 1 + x \) gallons (since we are adding \( x \) gallons of orange juice to the original 1 gallon).

4. **Setting up the Equation:**
   - We want the orange juice to be 60% of the total mixture:
   \[
   \frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Multiply both sides by \( 1 + x \) to clear the fraction:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)
   \]
   - Distribute the 0.6 on the right side:
   \[
   0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x
   \]
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   0.4 + x - 0.6x = 0.6
   \]
   \[
   0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6
   \]
   - Subtract 0.4 from both sides:
   \[
   0.4x = 0.2
   \]
   - Divide by 0.4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - We need to add 0.5 gallons of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the total mixture.

# Answer option: ['A)278', 'B)2890', 'C)270', 'D)2702', 'E)960']","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the marks secured by the candidate and the maximum marks in both scenarios.

1. **Original Scenario:**
   - Marks secured by the candidate = 504
   - Maximum marks = M

2. **Converted Scenario:**
   - Marks secured by the candidate = 420
   - Maximum marks = 800

The candidate's performance in both scenarios should represent the same percentage of the maximum marks. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the percentage of marks secured:

\[
\frac{504}{M} = \frac{420}{800}
\]

Now, solve for \( M \):

1. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:

\[
504 \times 800 = 420 \times M
\]

2. Calculate \( 504 \times 800 \):

\[
504 \times 800 = 403200
\]

3. Now, divide both sides by 420 to solve for \( M \):

\[
M = \frac{403200}{420}

1. **Identify the principal amount (P):**  
   Rahul borrowed Rs. 500. So, \( P = 500 \).

2. **Identify the rate of interest (R):**  
   The rate of interest is 6% per annum. So, \( R = 6\% \).

3. **Identify the time period (T):**  
   The time period is 4 years. So, \( T = 4 \).

4. **Calculate the simple interest (SI):**  
   The formula for simple interest is:

# Answer option: ['A)54', 'B)24', 'C)48', 'D)20', 'E)36']","To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways the man can choose one type of fruit for breakfast and one type of vegetable for dinner.

1. **Choosing a fruit for breakfast:**
   - The man has 6 different types of fruit to choose from.
   - Therefore, there are 6 possible choices for breakfast.

2. **Choosing a vegetable for dinner:**
   - The man has 8 different types of vegetables to choose from.
   - Therefore, there are 8 possible choices for dinner.

3. **Calculating the total number of combinations:**
   - Since the choice of fruit and the choice of vegetable are independent events, we multiply the number of choices for breakfast by the number of choices for dinner.
   - Total combinations = (Number of fruit choices) × (Number of vegetable choices) = 6 × 8 = 48.

Thus, the man can eat breakfast and dinner in 48 different ways.

# Answer option: ['A)26.2%', 'B)32.8%', 'C)43.7%', 'D)59.0%', 'E)65.6%']","To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula. The binomial probability formula is:

\[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of trials (in this case, 5 registered voters),
- \( k \) is the number of successful trials (in this case, exactly 4 voters who voted),
- \( p \) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 0.9 or 90%),
- \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient, calculated as \(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).

Let's calculate the probability step by step:

1. **Calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{4}\):**

   \[
   \binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5 \times 4!}{4! \times 1!} = 5

2. **Calculate \( p^k \):**

   \[
   p^k = 0.9^4 = 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 \times 0.9 = 0.6561
   \]

3. **Calculate \( (1-p)^{n-k} \):**

   \[
   (1-p)^{n-k} = (1-0.9)^{5-4} = 0.1^1 = 0.1

# Answer option: ['A)12/25', 'B)3/2', 'C)3', 'D)2', 'E)25/3']","To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different types of bread in terms of the amount of falafel they contain.

1. **Pita to Roll Relationship:**
   - Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
   - Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as 3 pita breads.

2. **Roll to Baguette Relationship:**
   - Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.
   - Therefore, 1 roll contains the same amount of falafel as \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

3. **Combining the Relationships:**
   - From the first relationship, we know 1 roll = 3 pita breads.
   - From the second relationship, we know 1 roll = \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes.

4. **Equating Pita and Baguette:**
   - Since 1 roll = 3 pita breads and 1 roll = \( \frac{5}{3} \) baguettes, we can equate the two:
     \[
     3 \text{ pita breads} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ baguettes}
     \]

5. **Finding Pita in Terms of Baguette:**
   - To find how many pita breads are equivalent to 1 baguette, we solve for 1 baguette:

   - This can be written as: \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \).

5. **Solving the equations:**
   - From the first equation: \( M + \frac{J}{2} = 75 \).
   - From the second equation: \( J + \frac{M}{3} = 75 \).

6. **Express \( M \) from the first equation:**
   - \( M = 75 - \frac{J}{2} \).

7. **Substitute \( M \) in the second equation:**

   - Total bribery pool = $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.

2. **Calculate the proportion of the pool contributed by Hoopsmot:**
   - Hoopsmot's contribution = $16,000.
   - Proportion = Hoopsmot's contribution / Total bribery pool = $16,000 / $20,000 = 0.8.

3. **Apply this proportion to the total number of senators:**
   - Total senators influenced = 30.
   - Senators considered Hoopsmot's = 0.8 * 30 = 24.

Therefore, the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's is 24.

192,"A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number?
# Answer option: ['A)12', 'B)24', 'C)42', 'D)48', 'E)49']","To solve this problem, let's define the two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the digit in the ten's place and \(b\) is the digit in the unit's place.

We are given two conditions:

1. The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:
   \[
   10a + b = a + b + 18
   \]

2. The digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place:
   \[
   b = 2a
   \]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify the first condition
From the first condition:
\[
10a + b = a + b + 18
\]
Subtract \(a + b\) from both sides:
\[
9a = 18
\]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[
a = 2
\]

### Step 2: Use the second condition
From the second condition:
\[
b = 2a
\]
Substitute \(a = 2\) into this equation:
\[
b = 2 \times 2 = 4
\]

### Step 3: Form the number
Now, substitute \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\) back into the expression for the number:
\[
10a + b = 10 \times 2 + 4 = 20 + 4 = 24
\]

Thus, the two-digit number is 24.

### Step 4: Verify the conditions
- The sum of the digits is \(2 + 4 = 6\).
- The number 24 exceeds the sum of its digits by \(24 - 6 = 18\), which satisfies the first condition.
- The digit at the unit's place (4) is double the digit in the ten's place (2), which satisfies the second condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{24}\).

First, simplify the denominator:

\[ 13 \times 13 = 169 \]

\[ 169 - 156 = 13 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{5 + ? \times 19 - 15 - 7}{13} = 6 \]

Simplify the numerator:

\[ 5 - 15 - 7 = -17 \]

So, the equation is:

\[ \frac{? \times 19 - 17}{13} = 6 \]

Multiply both sides by 13 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ ? \times 19 - 17 = 78 \]

Add 17 to both sides:

\[ ? \times 19 = 95 \]

Divide both sides by 19 to solve for ""?"":

\[ ? = \frac{95}{19} \]

142,"Two cars are travelling from the same starting point in the same direction, having started their commute at the same time. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, while the second travels at a steady rate of 52 mph. How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other?
# Answer option: ['A)3 hours', 'B)5 hours', 'C)6 hours', 'D)4 hours', 'E)7 hours']","To determine how much time will pass before the two cars are 15 miles apart, we need to consider their relative speeds. The first car is traveling at 55 mph, and the second car is traveling at 52 mph. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 55 \text{ mph} - 52 \text{ mph} = 3 \text{ mph} \]

This means that the first car is moving away from the second car at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

We want to find out how long it will take for the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles. Since the relative speed between the two cars is 3 mph, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ mph}} \]

Calculating this gives:

\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the two cars to be 15 miles apart.

# Answer option: ['A)$7.73', 'B)$6.73', 'C)$5.73', 'D)$4.73', 'E)$3.73']","To find the cover price per issue, we need to determine the total cover price for 15 issues and then divide by 15 to find the price per issue.

1. **Understand the savings**: The subscription cost of $42.00 represents a 25% savings off the total cover price. This means that the subscription cost is 75% of the total cover price.

2. **Set up the equation**: Let \( x \) be the total cover price for 15 issues. Since $42.00 is 75% of the total cover price, we can write the equation:
   \[
   0.75x = 42
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**: Divide both sides of the equation by 0.75 to find the total cover price.
   \[
   x = \frac{42}{0.75} = 56

4. **Find the cover price per issue**: Now that we know the total cover price for 15 issues is $56, we divide by 15 to find the cover price per issue.
   \[
   \text{Cover price per issue} = \frac{56}{15} \approx 3.73

82,"The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
# Answer option: ['A)242', 'B)308', 'C)352', 'D)412', 'E)456']","To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF), the least common multiple (LCM), and the two integers. The relationship is given by:

\[
\text{GCF}(a, b) \times \text{LCM}(a, b) = a \times b
\]

We are given:
- GCF = 11
- LCM = 7700
- One of the integers, \( a = 350 \)

We need to find the other integer, \( b \).

First, substitute the known values into the equation:

\[
11 \times 7700 = 350 \times b
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
11 \times 7700 = 84700
\]

Now, solve for \( b \):

\[
84700 = 350 \times b
\]

Divide both sides by 350 to isolate \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{84700}{350}
\]

Calculate the division:

\[
b = 242
\]

Thus, the other integer is 242. Let's verify that this solution satisfies the conditions:

1. Check the GCF of 350 and 242:
   - The prime factorization of 350 is \( 2 \times 5^2 \times 7 \).
   - The prime factorization of 242 is \( 2 \times 11^2 \).

   The only common factor is 11, which matches the given GCF.

2. Check the LCM of 350 and 242:

# Answer option: ['A)9 hours.', 'B)10 hours.', 'C)11 hours.', 'D)12 hours.', 'E)13 hours.']","To determine how long it will take Shweta to cover 100 km, we need to consider both her riding speed and her rest breaks.

1. **Calculate the time taken to ride 15 km:**
   - Shweta rides at 10 km per hour.
   - Time to ride 15 km = Distance / Speed = 15 km / 10 km per hour = 1.5 hours.

2. **Calculate the number of 15 km segments in 100 km:**
   - 100 km / 15 km per segment = 6 full segments with a remainder.
   - 6 segments cover 90 km, leaving 10 km remaining.

3. **Calculate the total riding time for 90 km:**
   - Each 15 km segment takes 1.5 hours.
   - For 6 segments: 6 segments × 1.5 hours per segment = 9 hours.

4. **Calculate the rest time for 90 km:**
   - Shweta rests for 10 minutes (or 1/6 of an hour) at the end of each 15 km segment.
   - She will rest 5 times for the first 90 km (since she doesn't rest after the last segment if she finishes her journey).
   - Total rest time = 5 rests × 1/6 hour per rest = 5/6 hours.

5. **Calculate the time to ride the remaining 10 km:**
   - Time to ride 10 km = Distance / Speed = 10 km / 10 km per hour = 1 hour.

6. **Add up all the times:**
   - Total riding time = 9 hours (for 90 km) + 1 hour (for the remaining 10 km) = 10 hours.
   - Total rest time = 5/6 hours.

7. **Total time taken:**
   - Total time = Total riding time + Total rest time = 10 hours + 5/6 hours = 10 + 0.8333 hours ≈ 10.8333 hours.

Since the options are in whole hours, we round 10.8333 hours to the nearest whole number, which is 11 hours.

32,"When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet.
# Answer option: ['A)1584', 'B)1120', 'C)792', 'D)1320', 'E)1200']","To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the original rectangular sheet and then calculate its area.

Let's denote the length and width of the original rectangular sheet as \( L \) and \( W \), respectively.

1. **Folding along one set of sides:**

   When the sheet is folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. This means that the folded dimension is half of one of the original dimensions. Let's assume the sheet is folded along its length \( L \), so each part has dimensions \( \frac{L}{2} \) and \( W \).

   The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
   \[
   2 \left( \frac{L}{2} + W \right) = 48
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   L + 2W = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **Folding along the other set of sides:**

   When the sheet is folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. This means the sheet is folded along its width \( W \), so each part has dimensions \( L \) and \( \frac{W}{2} \).

   The perimeter of each folded part is given by:
   \[
   2 \left( L + \frac{W}{2} \right) = 66
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2L + W = 66 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

3. **Solving the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   L + 2W = 48
   \]
   \[
   2L + W = 66
   \]

   To solve for \( L \) and \( W \), we can multiply Equation 1 by 2:
   \[
   2L + 4W = 96
   \]

   Now, subtract Equation 2 from this result:
   \[
   (2L + 4W) - (2L + W) = 96 - 66
   \]
   \[
   3W = 30
   \]
   \[
   W = 10
   \]

   Substitute \( W = 10 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   L + 2(10) = 48
   \]
   \[
   L + 20 = 48
   \]
   \[
   L = 28
   \]

4. **Calculating the area:**

   The area of the original rectangular sheet is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280
   \]

It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the equations and calculations:

Re-evaluate the system of equations:
- \( L + 2W = 48 \)
- \( 2L + W = 66 \)

Substitute \( W = 10 \) into the correct equation:
- \( L + 2(10) = 48 \)
- \( L + 20 = 48 \)
- \( L = 28 \)

Re-calculate the area:
- \( \text{Area} = L \times W = 28 \times 10 = 280 \)

It seems there was a mistake in the options provided. The correct area based on the calculations is 280, which is not listed in the options. Please verify the problem statement and options."

Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
# Answer option: ['A)144km', 'B)72 km', 'C)126km', 'D)84 km', 'E)48km']","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movements of Allen and Bob and determine the distance between X and Y.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the distance between X and Y be \( d \) km.
   - Allen's speed is 54 km/h.
   - Bob's speed is 78 km/h.

2. **First Meeting:**
   - Allen and Bob start at the same time and move towards each other.
   - Their relative speed is \( 54 + 78 = 132 \) km/h.
   - They will meet for the first time after covering the entire distance \( d \).
   - Time taken for the first meeting is \( \frac{d}{132} \) hours.

3. **Second Meeting:**
   - After the first meeting, Allen continues to Y and Bob continues to X.
   - Once they reach their respective destinations, they turn around and head back.
   - They meet for the second time after Bob has covered 48 km more than Allen.

4. **Distance Covered by Bob and Allen:**
   - Let the time taken from the start until the second meeting be \( t \) hours.
   - Distance covered by Bob in time \( t \) is \( 78t \) km.
   - Distance covered by Allen in time \( t \) is \( 54t \) km.
   - According to the problem, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the second meeting:
     \[
     78t = 54t + 48
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     78t - 54t = 48 \\
     24t = 48 \\
     t = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate Distance \( d \):**
   - In 2 hours, the total distance covered by both Allen and Bob together is:
     \[
     78t + 54t = 132t = 132 \times 2 = 264 \text{ km}
     \]
   - Since they meet twice, the total distance covered is twice the distance between X and Y:
     \[
     2d = 264 \\
     d = 132 \text{ km}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between X and Y is 132 km.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\text{Final answer: \{C\}}\)"
