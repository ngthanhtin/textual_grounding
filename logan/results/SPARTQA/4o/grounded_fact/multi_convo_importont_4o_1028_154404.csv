To determine which object is above a medium blue square, let's analyze the given FACTs:

1. In Block A, we have two medium blue squares. According to <important1>, medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two and a medium black square. This means that medium blue square number two is at the top, followed by the medium black square, and then medium blue square number one at the bottom.

2. Block B is above Block A and contains three medium yellow squares. According to <important3>, medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block B. This implies that medium yellow square number one is at the bottom of Block B. According to <important2>, medium yellow square number two is below medium yellow square number three, which means medium yellow square number three is at the top, followed by medium yellow square number two, and then medium yellow square number one at the bottom.

3. Block C is to the right of Block B and contains two medium blue squares. Below medium blue square number two, there is medium blue square number one.

Now, let's determine which medium yellow square is above a medium blue square:

- Medium yellow square number two is in Block B, which is above Block A. Since Block A contains medium blue squares, medium yellow square number two is indeed above the medium blue squares in Block A.

- The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of Block B is medium yellow square number one. Since Block B is above Block A, medium yellow square number one is also above the medium blue squares in Block A.

Therefore, both medium yellow square number two and the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium yellow square number one) are above medium blue squares.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium square, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and the squares within them.

1. We know that <important1>Block C is to the left of A</important1> and <important2>block B is to the left of C</important2>. This means the order from left to right is Block B, Block C, and then Block A.

2. In <important4>Block B, there is a medium yellow square and a medium black square</important4>. According to <important5>below the medium black square is the medium yellow square</important5>, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square in Block B.

3. In <important6>Block C, there is a medium blue square and a medium black square</important6>. <important8>The medium blue square is below the medium black square</important8>, and <important7>the medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block</important7>.

4. Since Block B is to the left of Block C, the medium black square in Block B is to the left of the medium black square in Block C.

5. The question asks which object is to the right of a medium square. Since Block B is to the left of Block C, the medium black square in Block C is to the right of the medium black square in Block B.

Therefore, the medium black square in Block C is to the right of a medium square (the medium black square in Block B).

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the black shape, let's analyze the given FACTs:

1. <important1>Block C is above block A and to the left of block B</important1>. This means Block C is positioned such that it is not directly above Block B, but rather to its left.

2. <important2>It has a medium black square</important2>. This indicates that the medium black square is located within Block C.

3. <important3>The medium black square is below a medium yellow square</important3>. This means that within Block C, there is a medium yellow square positioned above the medium black square.

Now, we need to determine what is below the black shape in Block C. Since the black square is in Block C and is below a yellow square in the same block, we need to consider the position of Block C relative to the other blocks.

Given that Block C is above Block A and to the left of Block B, the black square in Block C cannot be directly above any elements in Block B. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block B is not below the black shape in Block C.

Additionally, since Block C is above Block A, the black shape in Block C is not touching the bottom edge of Block A or any other block.

Thus, the answer to what is below the black shape is {3: none of them}.","We have three blocks, A, B and C. Two medium blue squares are in block A. It also contains one medium yellow square.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's analyze the given FACTs step by step:

1. <important1>Block C has two medium yellow squares</important1>. This indicates that there are two yellow squares in Block C.

2. <important2>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important2>. This means that medium yellow square number one is at the very bottom of Block C.

3. <important3>Below a medium black square there is medium yellow square number two</important3>. This tells us that medium yellow square number two is positioned below a medium black square.

4. <important4>Below medium yellow square number two and the medium black square there is medium yellow square number one</important4>. This confirms that medium yellow square number one is below both medium yellow square number two and the medium black square.

From these FACTs, we can deduce the following arrangement in Block C:
- At the bottom of Block C is medium yellow square number one.
- Above medium yellow square number one is medium yellow square number two.
- Above medium yellow square number two is the medium black square.

Now, let's answer the question: Which object is below a medium yellow square?

- Medium yellow square number two is below the medium black square, not below another yellow square.
- The object that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium yellow square number one) is below medium yellow square number two.

Therefore, the object that is below a medium yellow square is the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block, which is medium yellow square number one.

The correct answer is {1}.","There are three blocks, A, B and C. Block C is below blocks A and B. Block A has a medium blue square.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium black square, we need to analyze the positions of the medium black squares in the blocks A, B, and C.

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important1>Two medium black squares are in block A</important1>.
   - <important2>Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important2>.
   - <important3>It is below medium black square number two</important3>.

2. **Block B**: 
   - <important4>To the left of block A there is block B</important4>.
   - <important5>There is also a medium black square in this block</important5>.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important6>To the left of block B there is block C</important6>.
   - <important7>It contains one medium black square</important7>.

Now, let's determine the relative positions:

- **Medium black square number one** in block A is touching the bottom edge of block A, and it is below medium black square number two in block A.
- **Medium black square number two** is above medium black square number one in block A.
- Block B is to the left of block A, and it contains a medium black square.
- Block C is to the left of block B, and it contains a medium black square.

Since block B is to the left of block A, the medium black square in block B is to the right of the medium black squares in block C. However, the question asks about the objects to the right of the medium black squares in block A.

- The medium black square in block B is to the right of the medium black squares in block C, but not to the right of the medium black squares in block A.
- There are no objects to the right of the medium black squares in block A because block A is the rightmost block.

Therefore, neither the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of block A nor medium black square number two in block A has an object to its right.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the big yellow triangle in Block B, we need to analyze the arrangement of objects in Block A and their relative positions.

1. **Understanding Block A's Composition:**
   - <important1>Block A has one big blue triangle, one medium black circle, and one big black circle</important1>.
   - <important2>This block also has one big yellow circle</important2>.

2. **Positioning within Block A:**
   - <important3>The big blue triangle is below the medium black circle, the big yellow circle, and the big black circle</important3>. This indicates that the big blue triangle is at the bottom of Block A, and the other shapes are above it.

3. **Position of Block B:**
   - <important4>Block B is above block A</important4>. This means that the big yellow triangle in Block B is positioned above all the shapes in Block A.

4. **Determining What is Directly Below the Big Yellow Triangle:**
   - Since Block B is above Block A, the big yellow triangle in Block B is directly above the entire Block A.
   - Within Block A, the big yellow circle and the big black circle are both above the big blue triangle, as per <important3>.

Therefore, both the big black circle and the big yellow circle are below the big yellow triangle in Block B.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the left of the blue shape, let's analyze the given FACTs:

1. <important1>One medium black square is in block A</important1>.
2. <important2>Block B contains a medium black square</important2>.
3. <important3>A medium blue square is below the medium black square</important3> in block B.

From these FACTs, we can deduce the following:

- Block A has a medium black square.
- Block B has a medium black square, and directly below it is a medium blue square.
- Block C is to the left of block B and to the right of block A.

Since the medium blue square is in block B, we need to determine what is to the left of this blue square. Block C is to the left of block B, but it contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square, with the yellow square below the black square. Therefore, the medium black square in block C is not directly to the left of the blue square in block B.

Block A, which is to the left of block C, contains a medium black square. However, since block C is between block A and block B, the medium black square in block A is not directly to the left of the blue square in block B.

Thus, the only medium black square directly to the left of the blue square in block B is the medium black square in block B itself.

Therefore, the answer is {0}.","We have three blocks, A, B and C. <important1>One medium black square is in block A</important1>.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the small blue circle, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Block B Configuration**:
   - Block B contains a medium black circle, a small yellow circle, a small blue triangle, a small blue circle, and a medium yellow triangle.
   - The medium yellow triangle is to the left of the small blue triangle.
   - The small blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - The small blue circle is below both the small blue triangle and the medium yellow triangle.

2. **Position of the Small Blue Circle**:
   - Since the small blue circle is below the small blue triangle and the medium yellow triangle, it is positioned lower in Block B.

3. **Block C and Block A Configuration**:
   - Block C is below Block B and contains a medium yellow triangle and a medium yellow square. The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and below the medium yellow square.
   - Block A is below Block C and contains a small yellow circle.

4. **What is Below the Small Blue Circle?**:
   - The small blue circle is in Block B. Below Block B is Block C, and below Block C is Block A.
   - The small blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B, and the small blue circle is below it within Block B.
   - The small yellow circle is in Block A, which is below Block C and Block B.

Given the configuration, the small blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B, and the small blue circle is below it within Block B. Therefore, the small blue triangle is not below the small blue circle. The small yellow circle is in Block A, which is below Block C and Block B, so it is below the small blue circle.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in both blocks A and B.

1. **Block A Analysis:**
   - <important1>Block A has one medium black triangle, a big black square, and a big yellow circle</important1>.
   - <important2>The medium black triangle is to the right of a small yellow square</important2>.
   - The big black square is to the left of and below the small yellow square.
   - The big black square is to the left of the big yellow circle.
   - The medium black triangle is above the big yellow circle.

   From this, we can deduce that the small yellow square is to the left of the medium black triangle, and the big black square is to the left of the big yellow circle.

2. **Block B Analysis:**
   - <important3>Block B contains a medium blue circle and one medium yellow square</important3>.
   - <important4>To the right of and below the medium yellow square there is the medium blue circle</important4>.

   This indicates that the medium yellow square is to the left of the medium blue circle.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of a medium circle:

- In Block A, there is no medium circle, so we focus on Block B.
- In Block B, the medium yellow square is to the left of the medium blue circle.

Therefore, the small yellow square in Block A is not relevant to the medium circle in Block B. The big yellow circle in Block A is also not relevant to the medium circle in Block B.

Thus, the object to the left of a medium circle is the medium yellow square in Block B.

The answer is {1}.","We have two blocks.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the yellow object, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and squares based on the given FACTs.

1. We know that <important1>block C is above both blocks A and B</important1>. This means that any object in block C is positioned above the objects in blocks A and B.

2. <important2>Block C contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square</important2>. 

3. <important3>Below the medium yellow square is the medium black square</important3>. This indicates that within block C, the yellow square is directly above the black square.

Since block C is above both blocks A and B, the objects in block C do not directly interact with the objects in blocks A and B in terms of vertical positioning. Therefore, the medium yellow square in block C is not directly above any medium blue square in block A or block B.

Thus, the answer to the question ""What is below the yellow object?"" is that there is no medium blue square directly below the yellow object in block C. The correct answer is {3}.","There are three blocks, A, B and C. Block A has three medium blue squares. There is also a medium black square touching the bottom edge of this block.

2. <important2>To the right of the small yellow square there is the small blue triangle</important2>.
3. <important3>Block B is below A</important3>.
4. <important4>Block C has a big black circle</important4>.
5. <important5>Above the big black circle is the small yellow triangle</important5>.

Now, let's reason through the information:

- In Block A, the small yellow square is to the left of the small blue triangle. There is no mention of anything being below the small yellow square in Block A.
- Block B is below Block A, but there is no mention of a small yellow shape in Block B.
- In Block C, the small yellow triangle is above the big black circle. This means the big black circle is below the small yellow triangle.

Therefore, the object that is below a small yellow shape is the big black circle in Block C. Since the big black circle is not an option, we conclude that the medium thing is not below a small yellow shape.

To determine which object is above a medium blue square, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and squares based on the given FACTs.

1. We know that <important1>Block B is below C</important1> and <important2>Block A is below B</important2>. This means the order from top to bottom is Block C, Block B, and then Block A.

2. <important3>Block A has two medium blue squares</important3>. According to <important4>below medium blue square number two is medium blue square number one</important4>, the arrangement in Block A from top to bottom is medium blue square number two, then medium blue square number one, and finally the medium black square.

3. Block B contains a medium yellow square, and Block C has two medium black squares, with medium black square number one being below medium black square number two.

Now, let's address the question: Which object is above a medium blue square? The options are:
- The thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block
- Medium black square number two

Since Block A is the lowest block, the thing touching the bottom edge of Block A is the medium black square in Block A. This medium black square is below both medium blue squares in Block A, so it is not above a medium blue square.

Medium black square number two is in Block C, which is the topmost block. Therefore, it is above all the contents of Block B and Block A, including the medium blue squares in Block A.

Thus, the object that is above a medium blue square is medium black square number two.

To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important1>Block A is above B</important1>, and <important2>block B is below C</important2>. This means the order from top to bottom is C, A, B.
3. <important3>Block A contains one medium yellow square</important3>.
4. <important4>Block B contains three medium black squares</important4>.
5. <important5>Block C contains one medium yellow square</important5>.

Now, let's consider the positions of the medium black squares in Block B:

- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three and medium black square number two.
- Below medium black square number three is medium black square number two.

This means the order of the black squares from top to bottom in Block B is:
- Top: Medium black square number three
- Middle: Medium black square number two
- Bottom: Medium black square number one

Since <important1>Block A is above B</important1> and <important3>Block A contains one medium yellow square</important3>, the medium yellow square in Block A is directly above Block B, which contains the medium black squares.

Therefore, the medium black square number three, which is at the top of Block B, is directly below the medium yellow square in Block A.

Thus, the object below a medium yellow square is medium black square number three, which is not an option. However, since medium black square number two is below medium black square number three, it is indirectly below the medium yellow square in Block A.

Therefore, the correct answer is {1: medium black square number two}.","We have three blocks.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in blocks A and B.

1. **Identifying the medium circles:**
   - In block A, there is a <important2>medium blue triangle</important2>, but no medium circle is mentioned.
   - In block B, there is a <important4>medium black circle</important4>.

2. **Identifying the objects in question:**
   - The blue object that is touching the bottom edge of a block is the <important5>big blue square</important5> in block A.
   - The <important3>small yellow circle</important3> is also in block A.

3. **Determining the relative positions:**
   - The <important4>medium black circle</important4> is in block B.
   - The <important5>big blue square</important5> is in block A, which is to the right of block B.
   - The <important3>small yellow circle</important3> is also in block A, which is to the right of block B.

Since both the big blue square and the small yellow circle are in block A, which is to the right of block B (where the medium black circle is located), both objects are to the right of the medium black circle.

To determine which object is below a big yellow square, let's analyze the information provided:

1. <important1>Block B is above A</important1>.
2. <important2>Block C is above B</important2>.
3. <important3>Block A contains a small blue square</important3>.
4. <important4>Block B has a big yellow square</important4> and one medium black square.
5. <important5>Block C has a big yellow square</important5> touching the bottom edge of this block.

From these FACTs, we can deduce the following:

- Since <important2>Block C is above B</important2> and <important1>Block B is above A</important1>, Block A is the lowest block.
- <important3>Block A contains a small blue square</important3>, and since Block A is the lowest, the small blue square is below both Block B and Block C.
- <important4>Block B has a big yellow square</important4>, and since Block B is above Block A, the small blue square in Block A is below the big yellow square in Block B.
- The medium black square is in Block B, which is below Block C but above Block A. Therefore, the medium black square is not below the big yellow square in Block B, but it is below the big yellow square in Block C.

Thus, the small blue square is below the big yellow square in Block B, and the medium black square is below the big yellow square in Block C. Therefore, both the small blue square and the medium object are below a big yellow square.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in each block based on the given FACTs.

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important1>One medium yellow square is in block A</important1>.
   - <important2>A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</important2>.
   - This means the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square in block A.

2. **Block B**:
   - <important3>Block B has one medium yellow square and a medium black square in it</important3>.
   - <important4>Below the medium black square is the medium yellow square</important4>.
   - This means the medium black square is above the medium yellow square in block B.

3. **Block C**:
   - <important5>Block C is to the left of block A</important5>.
   - <important6>Block B is above it</important6>.
   - <important7>It contains a medium yellow square and one medium blue square</important7>.
   - <important8>Below the medium blue square there is the medium yellow square</important8>.
   - This means the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square in block C.

Now, let's determine the relative positions:

- **Block C** is to the left of **Block A** (<important5>), and **Block B** is above **Block C** (<important6>).
- In **Block A**, the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square (<important2>).
- In **Block B**, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square (<important4>).
- In **Block C**, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square (<important8>).

Since **Block C** is to the left of **Block A**, and **Block B** is above **Block C**, the medium blue square in **Block C** is not directly related to the medium yellow squares in **Block A** or **Block B** in terms of being to the right.

Therefore, neither the medium yellow square in **Block A** nor the medium yellow square in **Block B** is to the right of a medium blue square.

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important1>Block B contains a medium yellow square</important1>.
3. <important2>The medium yellow square is below a medium blue square</important2>. This means the blue square is at the top of Block B.
4. <important3>Block C is above Block A and to the right of Block B</important3>.
5. <important4>Block C has two medium black squares</important4>.
6. <important5>Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block C</important5>.
7. <important6>Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two</important6>.

Now, let's visualize the arrangement:

- Block B has the blue square at the top and the yellow square below it.
- Block C, which is to the right of Block B, has two black squares. The first black square is touching the bottom edge of Block C, and the second black square is above the first one.

Since Block C is to the right of Block B, the blue square in Block B is directly to the left of Block C. Therefore, both medium black square number two (which is above) and the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of Block C are to the right of the blue square.

4. <important4>To the right of block A is block B</important4>.
5. Block B contains <important5>two medium blue squares</important5>.
6. <important6>Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important6>.

From these FACTs, we can deduce the following:

- In Block A, the medium black square is at the bottom, and the medium blue square is above it.
- Block B is to the right of Block A.
- In Block B, there are two medium blue squares, with one touching the bottom edge.

Now, we need to determine which medium blue square is to the right of the medium black square in Block A:

- The medium blue square in Block A is directly above the medium black square in Block A, so it is not to the right of the black square.
- Block B, which contains two medium blue squares, is to the right of Block A. Therefore, the medium blue square in Block B that is touching the bottom edge is to the right of the medium black square in Block A.

Thus, the medium blue square which is touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B) is to the right of the black object in Block A.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, let's analyze the given FACTs step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important1>Block A is below B</important1>, which means Block B is above Block A.
3. <important2>Block C is to the left of A</important2>, indicating that Block C is positioned to the left of Block A.

5. <important5>Below medium black square number one, which is below medium black square number two, is the medium blue square</important5>. This means the arrangement in Block A from top to bottom is: medium black square number two, medium black square number one, and then the medium blue square.
6. <important6>Block B contains one medium black square</important6>.
7. <important7>Block C contains one medium blue square</important7>.

Now, let's visualize the arrangement:

- Block C is to the left of Block A and contains a medium blue square.
- Block A, from top to bottom, has: medium black square number two, medium black square number one, and a medium blue square.
- Block B is above Block A and contains one medium black square.

Since Block C is to the left of Block A, the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of all objects in Block A. Therefore, the medium black squares in Block A are to the right of the medium blue square in Block C.

The medium blue square in Block A is below the medium black squares in Block A, so the medium black squares in Block A are above and not directly to the right of the medium blue square in Block A.

The medium black square in Block B is above Block A, so it is not directly to the right of the medium blue square in Block A or Block C.

Therefore, the medium black square number one in Block A is to the right of the medium blue square in Block C, but the medium black square in Block B is not directly to the right of any medium blue square.

Thus, the object to the right of a medium blue square is medium black square number one.

1. **Block B** contains:
   - <important1>One medium blue triangle</important1>
   - <important2>One small yellow square</important2>

   The medium blue triangle is near to and below the small yellow square, indicating that the yellow square is above and possibly to the left of the triangle.

2. **Block C** contains:
   - <important3>One small black square</important3>

   Since Block B is to the left of Block C, the small black square in Block C is to the right of everything in Block B, including the medium blue triangle.

Therefore, the small black square in Block C is to the right of the medium blue triangle in Block B. The yellow shape (small yellow square) is not to the right of the medium blue triangle, as it is in the same block and positioned above it.

Thus, the object to the right of a medium thing is the black object.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a small blue circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in Block B.

1. **Understanding Block B's Layout:**
   - <important1>Block B has two small blue circles</important1>.
   - <important2>Small blue circle number one is near to small blue circle number two</important2>.
   - <important3>Small blue circle number two is touching the right edge of this block</important3>.

Given these FACTs, small blue circle number two is at the right edge of Block B. Since small blue circle number one is near to small blue circle number two, it must be positioned to the left of small blue circle number two.

2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We need to determine which object is to the right of a small blue circle.

Since small blue circle number two is at the right edge of Block B, there cannot be any object to its right within Block B. Therefore, the only possibility for an object to be to the right of a small blue circle is if it is to the right of small blue circle number one.

3. **Considering Block A:**
   - Block A is to the right of Block B, so any object in Block A is to the right of the objects in Block B.
   - The objects in Block A are a big black circle, a small black triangle, and a big black square.

Since Block A is entirely to the right of Block B, the objects in Block A (including the big black square) are to the right of small blue circle number one in Block B.

Therefore, the big black square is to the right of a small blue circle (specifically, small blue circle number one).

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in the blocks.

1. **Block A**: Contains one medium yellow square. There is no information about anything being below this square, so we cannot conclude that there is an object below the medium yellow square in block A.

2. **Block B**: Is to the right of block A and contains one medium yellow square. Again, there is no information about anything being below this square.

3. **Block C**: Is below block B and contains two medium yellow squares. According to the FACTs:
   - <important4>Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two and a medium black square</important4>.
   - <important5>Below the medium black square is medium yellow square number two</important5>.

From these FACTs, we can deduce the following arrangement in block C:
- At the top is medium yellow square number two.
- Below medium yellow square number two is a medium black square.
- Below the medium black square is medium yellow square number one.

Therefore, medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

Since medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, and there is no information about anything being below the medium yellow square in block A, the answer is that medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

Thus, the correct answer is {1}.","There are three blocks. We call them A, B and C. One medium yellow square is in block A. <important1>Block B is to the right of block A</important1>.

2. <important2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</important2>, so the small yellow triangle is located in Block A.

3. <important3>Block B contains one small black square</important3>, which means the small black square is in Block B, not in Block A or C.

4. <important4>Block C has a big yellow triangle</important4> and <important5>a small black circle</important5>. These are the key elements in Block C.

Since Block A is above both Block B and Block C, the contents of Block C are below Block A. Therefore, the small yellow triangle in Block A is above the contents of Block C.

In Block C, the big yellow triangle and the small black circle are both present. The question asks what is below the small yellow triangle in Block A. Since Block C is below Block A, the contents of Block C, which include both the big yellow triangle and the small black circle, are below the small yellow triangle.

Thus, the answer is that both the small black circle and the big yellow triangle are below the small yellow triangle.

The correct answer is {2}.","We have three blocks, A, B and C. <important1>Block A is above blocks B and C</important1>. <important2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</important2>. <important3>Block B contains one small black square</important3>.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a small triangle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks.

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important1>A small black triangle is in block A</important1>.
   - <important2>There is also a medium blue triangle touching the bottom edge of this block</important2>.
   - <important3>To the right of the medium blue triangle is the small black triangle</important3>.

   In Block A, the small black triangle is to the right of the medium blue triangle.

2. **Block B**: 
   - <important7>A medium blue square is to the left of a big yellow square</important7> and the big yellow triangle.
   - The big yellow triangle is to the right of the big yellow square.

   In Block B, the big yellow square is to the left of the big yellow triangle.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important4>Block C is above block A</important4>.
   - <important5>It has a small blue triangle and one medium yellow circle</important5>.
   - <important6>The small blue triangle is near to, below and to the right of the medium yellow circle</important6>.

   In Block C, the small blue triangle is to the right of the medium yellow circle.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of a small triangle:

- In Block A, the small black triangle is to the right of the medium blue triangle, so the medium blue triangle is to the left of the small black triangle.
- In Block C, the small blue triangle is to the right of the medium yellow circle, so the medium yellow circle is to the left of the small blue triangle.

Therefore, the medium yellow circle is to the left of a small triangle (the small blue triangle in Block C).

The big yellow square is not directly related to any small triangle in the given FACTs.

Thus, the object to the left of a small triangle is the medium yellow circle.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the small black circle, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and their contents based on the given FACTs.

1. We know that <important1>Block A is to the left of and B is to the right of C</important1>. This means the order from left to right is Block A, Block C, and then Block B.

2. <important2>Block A has a small black circle</important2>. Since Block A is the leftmost block, the small black circle is in Block A.

3. <important3>Block B has two medium blue squares</important3>. <important4>Medium blue square number one is to the right of medium blue square number two</important4>, and <important5>medium blue square number two is to the left of a small black square</important5>. <important6>The small black square is touching the right edge of this block</important6>. This means the small black square is at the far right of Block B.

4. Block C, which is between Block A and Block B, contains a small yellow circle.

Now, considering the position of the small black circle in Block A, the next block to the right is Block C, which contains the small yellow circle. Therefore, the small yellow circle is directly to the right of the small black circle in Block A.

The medium blue square that is touching the right edge of Block B is not directly to the right of the small black circle in Block A because Block C is in between.

Thus, the answer to what is directly to the right of the small black circle is the small yellow circle in Block C.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to understand the spatial arrangement of the squares in Block B.

1. **Understanding the arrangement:**
   - Block B contains two medium yellow squares and two medium blue squares.
   - <important1>Below medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two is medium yellow square number one</important1>. This means medium yellow square number one is positioned directly below both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two.
   - <important2>Medium yellow square number two is below medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two</important2>. This indicates that medium yellow square number two is also positioned directly below both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two.

2. **Analyzing the positions:**
   - Since both medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two are below both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two, it implies that the medium blue squares are positioned above the medium yellow squares.

3. **Determining which medium blue square is to the left of a medium yellow square:**
   - Given that both medium yellow squares are below both medium blue squares, it suggests that the medium blue squares are aligned horizontally above the medium yellow squares.
   - Therefore, both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two are positioned above and potentially to the left of the medium yellow squares.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two are positioned above the medium yellow squares, and there is no specific information indicating a left-right distinction between the two blue squares, both medium blue squares can be considered to be to the left of the medium yellow squares.

Thus, the answer is {2}.","There are two blocks. We call them A and B. Block A is to the right of B. Block A has a medium yellow square.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the big black circle, let's analyze the given FACTs step by step:

1. We know that <important1>Block A is to the left of B</important1>. This means that anything in Block A is to the left of anything in Block B.

2. <important2>Block A contains a small black circle</important2>. This small black circle is in Block A.

3. <important3>To the left of the small black circle there is a big black circle</important3>. This means the big black circle is also in Block A, and it is positioned to the left of the small black circle.

4. Block B contains a big blue circle, one small blue circle, and <important4>a big yellow triangle</important4>. These objects are all in Block B.

5. <important5>The big yellow triangle is touching the right edge of this block</important5>. This means the big yellow triangle is at the far right of Block B.

1. We know that <important1>Block A is to the left of B</important1> and <important2>Block B is below C</important2>. This means Block C is at the top, Block A is to the left, and Block B is below Block C.

2. <important3>Block A has one medium yellow square</important3>. This square is not specified to be above or below any other square, so we need to consider its position relative to the other blocks.

3. <important4>Block C has two medium yellow squares and two other medium black squares</important4>. This means Block C contains four squares in total.

4. <important5>Below medium black square number two, medium yellow square number two and medium black square number one is medium yellow square number one</important5>. This indicates that medium yellow square number one is below these three squares.

5. <important6>Below medium black square number two there is medium yellow square number two</important6>. This means medium yellow square number two is directly below medium black square number two.

From these FACTs, we can deduce the following:

- Medium yellow square number two is below medium black square number two, as stated in <important6>.
- Medium yellow square number one is below medium black square number two, medium yellow square number two, and medium black square number one, as stated in <important5>.

To determine what is above the object touching the bottom edge of a block, we need to analyze the arrangement of the squares in each block.

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important2>Block A is to the left of B</important2>.
   - <important3>Block A has one medium blue square</important3>.
   - Since there is only one square in Block A, the medium blue square is the only square and it is not touching the bottom edge of a block.

2. **Block B**:
   - <important4>Block B contains a medium black square</important4>.
   - <important5>It also contains a medium yellow square</important5>.
   - <important6>Below the medium black square there is the medium yellow square</important6>.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Block Arrangement**:
   - <important1>Block B is to the left of block C</important1>.
   - <important2>Block B is to the right of block A</important2>.
   - Therefore, the order from left to right is: Block A, Block B, Block C.

2. **Contents of Each Block**:
   - <important3>Block A contains a medium yellow square</important3>.
   - <important4>Below a medium black square there is the medium yellow square</important4> in Block A.
   - <important5>Block B contains a medium black square</important5>.
   - <important6>Block C contains one medium yellow square and one medium blue square</important6>.
   - <important7>The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block C</important7>.
   - <important8>The medium yellow square in Block C is below the medium blue square</important8>.

3. **Position Analysis**:
   - In Block A, the medium yellow square is below the medium black square, so the medium black square is above the medium yellow square, not to the right.
   - In Block B, there is a medium black square, but no mention of a yellow square, so it cannot be to the right of a yellow square in Block B.
   - In Block C, the medium yellow square is at the bottom and below the medium blue square. There is no mention of a black square in Block C.

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, and Block C is to the right of Block B, the only medium black square that could potentially be to the right of a medium yellow square is the one in Block B, relative to the yellow square in Block A.

Therefore, the medium black square in Block B is to the right of the medium yellow square in Block A.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square, let's analyze the arrangement of the squares using the given FACTs.

1. We know from <important1> that below medium black square number three and medium black square number one, there is the medium yellow square. This implies that the medium yellow square is directly below these two black squares.

2. From <important2>, we understand that below medium black square number three, there is medium black square number two. This means medium black square number two is directly below medium black square number three.

3. According to <important3>, medium black square number one is below medium black square number three. This means medium black square number one is positioned below medium black square number three.

4. Finally, <important4> states that medium black square number one is below medium black square number two. This indicates that medium black square number one is positioned below medium black square number two.

Given these positions, the medium yellow square is below medium black square number three and medium black square number one. Since medium black square number two is below medium black square number three, it is not directly to the right of the medium yellow square. Similarly, medium black square number one is below medium black square number two, and it is not directly to the right of the medium yellow square either.

Therefore, neither medium black square number two nor medium black square number one is to the right of a medium yellow square.

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important1>Block B is to the left of block A</important1>. This means that any object in Block B is to the left of any object in Block A.
3. Block B contains two medium yellow squares.
4. <important2>Below block B there is block C</important2>. This means Block C is vertically aligned with Block B, but below it.
5. Block C contains a <important3>medium blue square</important3> and a <important4>medium black square</important4>. The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

Since Block B is to the left of Block A, and Block C is below Block B, the objects in Block C (the medium blue square and the medium black square) are not horizontally aligned with the medium yellow squares in Block A. Therefore, they cannot be to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A.

However, since Block B itself is to the left of Block A, the medium yellow squares in Block B are to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A. But the question asks about the objects in Block C (the blue and black squares).

Since Block C is below Block B, the objects in Block C are not to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block B either.

Therefore, neither the medium blue square nor the medium black square is to the left of a medium yellow square.

To determine which object is above the small blue square, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in Blocks A and B.

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains a small blue square, a small blue triangle, and a medium yellow square. 
   - The small blue square is to the left of and below the medium yellow square. 
   - The small blue triangle is also to the left of and below the medium yellow square.
   - The medium yellow square is touching the right edge of Block A.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains a big yellow square, a big black square, a medium yellow circle, a big yellow triangle, and a small yellow circle.
   - The big black square is below the big yellow square.
   - The medium yellow circle is above the big black square.
   - The small yellow circle is near the big yellow square and above the big yellow triangle.

3. **Relative Positioning**:
   - **Block A is below Block B**: This means all objects in Block B are above those in Block A.

4. **Objects in Block B**:
   - The big black square is below the big yellow square, but since Block A is below Block B, the big black square is still above the small blue square in Block A.
   - The medium yellow circle is above the big black square, so it is also above the small blue square.
   - The small yellow circle is near the big yellow square and above the big yellow triangle, so it is also above the small blue square.

Since both the small yellow circle and the black square are in Block B, which is above Block A, they are both above the small blue square.

To determine which object is above a medium blue square, let's analyze the given FACTs:

1. <important1>Block B is below C</important1> and <important2>block A is above B</important2>. This means the order from top to bottom is: Block A, Block B, Block C.

2. <important5>Block A contains one medium black square</important5>. This square is in Block A, which is the topmost block.

3. <important6>A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of this block</important6>. This means the medium yellow square is at the bottom of Block A, below the medium black square.

4. <important3>Block B has one medium blue square</important3>. Since Block B is below Block A, the medium blue square in Block B is below both the medium black square and the medium yellow square in Block A.

5. <important4>Block C contains one medium blue square</important4> and one medium yellow square. The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square. Since Block C is the lowest block, the medium blue square in Block C is below everything in Blocks A and B.

Now, let's determine which objects are above a medium blue square:

- The medium blue square in Block B is below both the medium black square and the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, both the black object (medium black square) and the thing touching the bottom edge of Block A (medium yellow square) are above the medium blue square in Block B.

- The medium blue square in Block C is below everything in Blocks A and B, so both the medium black square and the medium yellow square in Block A are also above the medium blue square in Block C.

Thus, both the black object and the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block are above a medium blue square.

To determine which object is below a blue thing, let's analyze the given FACTs:

1. <important1>Block C is below A</important1>.
2. <important2>Block A is above B</important2>.
3. <important3>Block A contains one medium blue square</important3>.

From these FACTs, we know that Block A, which contains the medium blue square, is positioned above both Block B and Block C.

4. <important4>Block B has two medium yellow squares</important4>.
5. <important5>A medium black square is also in this block</important5>.
6. <important6>This shape is below medium yellow square number two</important6>.
7. <important7>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important7>.
8. <important8>It is below medium yellow square number two and the medium black square</important8>.

From these FACTs, we understand the arrangement within Block B. Medium yellow square number one is at the bottom edge of Block B, and medium yellow square number two is above it. The medium black square is also above medium yellow square number one.
