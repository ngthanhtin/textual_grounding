Below and to the right of the big blue square there is the small yellow circle. Finally, we have block C which is to the right of block B. It contains a small yellow square. The small yellow square is below and to the left of a big yellow square. The big yellow square is touching the right edge of this block. What is to the right of the circle? a small yellow square or a big yellow square which is touching the right edge of a block?
0: small yellow square 
1: big yellow square  which is touching the right edge of  a block 
2: both of them
3: none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the positions of the objects in each block step by step:

1. **Block A**: Contains a medium black square. This block is not relevant to the question since it doesn't contain any yellow squares or circles.

2. **Block B**: 
   - Contains a small yellow circle and a big blue square.
   - The small yellow circle is below and to the right of the big blue square.
   - Since Block B is to the right of Block A, the small yellow circle is positioned somewhere in Block B, but we don't have any information about anything being to the right of the circle within Block B.

3. **Block C**: 
   - Contains a small yellow square and a big yellow square.
   - The small yellow square is below and to the left of the big yellow square.
   - The big yellow square is touching the right edge of Block C.

Now, let's determine what is to the right of the small yellow circle in Block B:

- The small yellow circle is in Block B. 
- Block C is to the right of Block B.
- In Block C, the big yellow square is touching the right edge of the block, meaning it is positioned on the far right side of Block C.
- The small yellow square in Block C is below and to the left of the big yellow square, meaning it is not on the far right side of Block C.

Therefore, when considering what is directly to the right of the small yellow circle in Block B, the big yellow square in Block C, which is touching the right edge of Block C, is the object that is to the right of the circle.

   - To the right of the black shape which is to the right of the medium black circle, there is the big black square.

Now, let's focus on the specific question: What is to the right of the medium black circle?

- The text states that to the right of and near to the medium black circle, there is the small black triangle.
- It also states that to the right of the black shape (which is the small black triangle) that is to the right of the medium black circle, there is the big black square.

From this, we can conclude:
- Directly to the right of the medium black circle is the small black triangle.
- The medium black triangle is not directly to the right of the medium black circle; it is to the right of the small black triangle.

The medium yellow square is in Block A, which is above Block C, and there is no indication that it is to the right of the medium black circle in Block C.

Therefore, the only shape directly to the right of the medium black circle is the small black triangle, and neither the medium black triangle nor the medium yellow square is directly to the right of the medium black circle.

- Block C is to the left of Block A.
- Block B is to the left of Block C.

This means the order from left to right is: Block B, Block C, Block A.

Next, we need to determine which object is to the right of a medium square, specifically focusing on the medium black squares in Block B and Block C.

- **Medium black square in Block B**: 
  - To the right of Block B is Block C, which contains a medium black square and a medium blue square. 
  - Therefore, the medium black square in Block B has Block C to its right.

- **Medium black square in Block C**: 
  - To the right of Block C is Block A, which contains a medium yellow square.
  - Therefore, the medium black square in Block C has Block A to its right.

The question asks which object is to the right of a medium square, specifically the medium black squares in Block B and Block C. Since both medium black squares have other blocks to their right, we need to determine if any of these blocks contain a medium square directly to the right of the medium black squares.

- For the medium black square in Block B, Block C is to the right, which contains a medium black square and a medium blue square.
- For the medium black square in Block C, Block A is to the right, which contains a medium yellow square.

Now, let's address the question: ""What is below the black shape?""

- The black shape is in Block C, and below it, there is nothing else mentioned in Block C. Therefore, the black shape is at the bottom of Block C.

Next, we need to determine if the black shape is touching the bottom edge of Block C or if there is a medium yellow square in Block B below it.

- Since Block C is above Block A and to the left of Block B, the black shape in Block C is not touching the bottom edge of Block C because Block C is above Block A.
- The medium yellow square in Block B is above the medium blue square, so it is not below the black shape in Block C.

   - The big yellow triangle and the small blue circle are to the left of the first big black square, which is touching the right edge of Block B. This big black square is above and near the small black square.

4. **Block A:**
   - Block A contains:
     - A small yellow circle.
     - A big blue circle touching the bottom edge of the block, below the small yellow circle.

5. **Question Analysis:**
   - We need to determine what is to the right of the small black circle in Block C.
   - Since Block B is immediately to the right of Block C, we look at the contents of Block B.
   - The first big black square in Block B is touching the right edge of Block B. This means it is the rightmost shape in Block B.
   - The small black square is mentioned to be near and below the first big black square, but not to the right of it.

Therefore, the shape that is to the right of the small black circle in Block C is the big black square that is touching the right edge of Block B.

0: the medium blue square 
1: the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2: both of them
3: none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the positions of the squares in each block step by step:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium blue square.
   - A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block A, and it is below the medium blue square.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains a medium black square.

3. **Block C:**
   - Contains two medium black squares and one medium yellow square.
   - The arrangement is as follows:
     - Below the medium yellow square, there is medium black square number two.
     - Below medium black square number two, there is medium black square number one.
     - Therefore, the order from top to bottom in Block C is: medium yellow square, medium black square number two, medium black square number one.

Now, let's determine which object is above a medium black square:

- In Block A, the medium blue square is not above any medium black square. The medium yellow square in Block A is not above any medium black square either.
- In Block B, there is only one medium black square, and there is no information about any object being above it.
- In Block C, the medium yellow square is above medium black square number two. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block C is above a medium black square.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- Option 0: The medium blue square is not above a medium black square.
- Option 1: The object that is touching the bottom edge of a block (the medium yellow square in Block A) is not above a medium black square.
- Option 2: Both of them are not above a medium black square.
- Option 3: None of them is above a medium black square.

Since the medium yellow square in Block C is above a medium black square, but neither the medium blue square nor the medium yellow square in Block A is above a medium black square, the correct answer is that none of the specified objects (medium blue square or the object touching the bottom edge of a block) is above a medium black square.

It has a big black square and one medium blue triangle. The big black square is above a small black triangle and the medium blue triangle. The medium blue triangle is touching the right edge of this block. It is to the right of the small black triangle. What is to the right of the medium square? a big black square or a blue circle?
0: big black square 
1: blue circle 
2: both of them
3: none of them","To solve this problem, let's first visualize the arrangement of the shapes in both blocks A and B based on the given descriptions.

**Block A:**
1. There is a medium blue circle.
2. There is a big blue square.
3. There is a medium yellow square.
4. To the right of the big blue square is a medium black triangle.
5. To the right of the medium yellow square and the big blue square is the medium blue circle.

From the above, we can deduce the following order for Block A:
- The medium yellow square is to the leftmost.
- The big blue square is to the right of the medium yellow square.
- The medium black triangle is to the right of the big blue square.
- The medium blue circle is to the right of both the medium yellow square and the big blue square.

Thus, the order in Block A is:
Medium Yellow Square -> Big Blue Square -> Medium Black Triangle -> Medium Blue Circle

**Block B:**
1. There is a big black square.
2. There is a medium blue triangle.
3. The big black square is above a small black triangle and the medium blue triangle.
4. The medium blue triangle is touching the right edge of this block.
5. The medium blue triangle is to the right of the small black triangle.

From the above, we can deduce the following order for Block B:
- The big black square is at the top.
- The small black triangle is below the big black square.
- The medium blue triangle is to the right of the small black triangle and touches the right edge of Block B.

Thus, the order in Block B is:
Big Black Square (top) -> Small Black Triangle (bottom left) -> Medium Blue Triangle (bottom right)

Now, let's address the question: ""What is to the right of the medium square?"" The medium square in Block A is the medium yellow square.

From the arrangement in Block A:
- To the right of the medium yellow square is the big blue square.

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, we need to consider the rightmost elements of Block A and the leftmost elements of Block B.

- The rightmost element in Block A is the medium blue circle.
- The leftmost element in Block B is the small black triangle (below the big black square).

Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block A is followed by the big blue square, then the medium black triangle, and finally the medium blue circle. The big black square in Block B is not directly to the right of the medium yellow square in Block A.

Thus, the answer to the question is that the blue circle is to the right of the medium yellow square.

2. **Medium Black Triangle**: This is to the right of the small yellow square.
3. **Big Black Square**: This is to the left of and below the small yellow square.
4. **Big Yellow Circle**: This is to the right of the shape formed by the small yellow square, medium black triangle, and big black square. The medium black triangle is above the big yellow circle.

**Block B:**
1. **Medium Yellow Square**: This is the reference point for the medium blue circle.
2. **Medium Blue Circle**: This is to the right of and below the medium yellow square.

- In Block A, the big yellow circle is the rightmost object, and there is no medium circle in Block A.
- In Block B, the medium blue circle is to the right of the medium yellow square.

Since the medium blue circle is the only medium circle present and it is in Block B, we need to determine which object is to the left of it:

- The medium yellow square is to the left of the medium blue circle in Block B.

Therefore, the small yellow square in Block A is not relevant to the position of the medium circle in Block B. The big yellow circle in Block A is also not relevant to the position of the medium circle in Block B.

Thus, the object to the left of the medium circle (medium blue circle) is the medium yellow square in Block B.

- Since Block C is above both Block A and Block B, anything in Block C is above anything in Block A and Block B.
- The medium black square in Block C is directly below the medium yellow square in Block C.

Next, we need to determine what is directly below the medium black square in Block C:

- Since Block C is above both Block A and Block B, the medium black square in Block C is above everything in Block A and Block B.
- Therefore, the medium black square in Block C is not directly above any specific square in Block A or Block B.

Finally, we need to determine if the medium blue square in Block B or medium blue square number one in Block A is directly below the medium yellow square in Block C:

- Since Block C is above both Block A and Block B, neither the medium blue square in Block B nor medium blue square number one in Block A is directly below the medium yellow square in Block C.

1. **Medium Black Square Number One**: This square is touching the bottom edge of block B. Therefore, it is the lowest square in block B.

2. **Medium Black Square Number Two**: This square is below the medium yellow square. Since the medium yellow square is not touching the bottom edge, medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.

3. **Medium Yellow Square**: This square is above medium black square number two.

4. **Medium Blue Square**: This square is below the medium yellow square, but there is no information about its position relative to medium black square number two. However, since medium black square number two is below the medium yellow square, the medium blue square must also be above medium black square number one.

Now, let's determine which object is above a medium black square:

- **Medium Black Square Number One**: This square is touching the bottom edge of block B, so it is the lowest. Therefore, any other square in block B is above it.

- **Medium Black Square Number Two**: This square is above medium black square number one, but below the medium yellow square.

Since medium black square number one is the lowest square, both the medium yellow square and medium black square number two are above it. Therefore, the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium black square number one) has other squares above it.

Since Block C is to the left of Block B, and Block A is to the right of Block C, the order from left to right is: Block C, Block B, Block A.

Now, let's focus on Block B:
- The big blue triangle is in Block B.

We need to determine what is to the left of the big blue triangle in Block B. Since Block C is to the left of Block B, we need to consider the contents of Block C.

Block C contains only small blue triangles, and none of the shapes from Block A (big yellow square, medium blue triangle, small yellow circle) are in Block C. Therefore, neither the big yellow square nor the small yellow circle is to the left of the big blue triangle in Block B.

Thus, the answer is that none of them (big yellow square or small yellow circle) is to the left of the big blue triangle.

- The medium black square is below both medium yellow squares.
- The medium blue square is below the medium black square.

In Block B:
- Medium black square number one is at the bottom.
- Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, we need to determine which medium yellow square in Block A is horizontally aligned with the medium black squares in Block B.

- The small black circle is in Block A, to the left of the medium black square.
- The medium black triangle is in Block B, touching the bottom edge of Block B.

The question asks which object is above a medium black square: the small shape (small black circle) or the object touching the bottom edge of a block (medium black triangle).

- The small black circle is in Block A, and Block C is above Block A. Therefore, the small black circle is not above the medium black square.

- Below both MB1 and MB2 is medium yellow square number one (MY1).
- Medium yellow square number two (MY2) is also below both MB1 and MB2.
- Below MB2 is MB1.

From the description, it seems that MB1 and MB2 are positioned side by side at the top. Below them, MY1 and MY2 are positioned, but the exact horizontal arrangement is not specified. However, the key point is that MB1 is below MB2, indicating a vertical arrangement where MB2 is above MB1.

Now, we need to determine which medium blue square is to the left of a medium yellow square:

- Since MB1 is below MB2, and both MY1 and MY2 are below MB1 and MB2, it implies that MB1 and MB2 are horizontally aligned at the top.
- The problem does not specify any horizontal arrangement for MY1 and MY2, so we cannot definitively say which medium blue square is to the left of a medium yellow square based on the given information.
