--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine what is to the right of the <data1>medium black circle</data1> in block C.

1. We know from <data2> that to the right of and near to the <data1>medium black circle</data1>, there is the small black triangle. This means the small black triangle is immediately to the right of the medium black circle.

2. The problem states that to the right of the black shape (which is the small black triangle) that is to the right of the <data1>medium black circle</data1>, there is the big black square. This confirms the sequence: medium black circle, small black triangle, big black square.

3. The medium black triangle is mentioned to be to the right of the small black triangle, but it is not directly to the right of the medium black circle. Instead, it is part of the sequence that follows the small black triangle.

4. The medium yellow square is in block A, which is above block C, and not directly to the right of the medium black circle in block C.

Therefore, directly to the right of the <data1>medium black circle</data1> is the small black triangle, and not the medium black triangle or the medium yellow square.

The answer is {3: none of them}."

6. <data6>It also contains a big blue square</data6>.
7. <data7>Below and near to the big blue square is the medium black circle</data7>.

From <data6> and <data7>, we know that in Block B, the medium black circle is below the big blue square. Therefore, the medium black circle in Block B is below a big object.

Now, let's consider the options:
- Option 0: The medium black circle which is in Block A. According to <data3>, Block A contains a small black circle, not a medium black circle. Therefore, this option is not applicable.
- Option 1: The thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block. There is no information provided about any object touching the bottom edge of a block.
- Option 2: Both of them. Since the medium black circle in Block A is not mentioned, this option is not applicable.
- Option 3: None of them. This option is not correct because the medium black circle in Block B is below a big object.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the medium black circle in Block B is below a big object, which corresponds to option 1. However, since option 1 refers to something touching the bottom edge of a block, and we have no information about that, the correct interpretation is that the medium black circle in Block B is the only object below a big object.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the medium blue square and what is to its left.

1. **Identify the position of the medium blue square:**
   - According to <data3>, ""A medium blue square is below the medium black square."" This implies that the medium blue square is directly beneath a medium black square.

2. **Determine which block contains the medium blue square:**
   - From <data1>, we know ""One medium black square is in block A.""
   - From <data2>, we know ""Block B contains a medium black square.""
   - Block C contains a medium yellow square and one medium black square, with the yellow square below the black square.

3. **Position of the medium blue square:**
   - Since the medium blue square is below a medium black square, and there is no mention of a blue square in block C, it must be in either block A or block B.
   - Given the information, the medium blue square is likely below the medium black square in block B, as block C's black square is above a yellow square.

4. **Determine what is to the left of the medium blue square:**
   - Block C is to the left of block B, and block A is to the left of block C.
   - Therefore, the medium black square in block A is to the left of the medium blue square in block B.

Based on this reasoning, the medium black square that is in block A is to the left of the medium blue square. Therefore, the answer is {1}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine which object is to the right of a small black shape.

1. **Analyzing Block A:**
   - According to <data1>, there is one small black triangle in block A.
   - <data2> states that there is a big black circle touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - <data3> tells us that below and to the right of the small black triangle is the big black circle.

   From this information, we can conclude that the big black circle is to the right of the small black triangle in block A.

2. **Analyzing Block B:**
   - <data4> indicates that block B contains one small black circle.
   - <data5> mentions that touching and near to a small black square is the small black circle.

   This suggests that the small black square is in block B, and the small black circle is near it. However, the problem does not specify the exact position of the small black square relative to the small black circle, so we cannot definitively say that the square is to the right of the small black circle.

3. **Analyzing Block C:**
   - Block C is to the left of block A and contains one medium blue circle. There are no small black shapes in block C, so it is not relevant to the question.

Based on the analysis, the big black circle in block A is to the right of the small black triangle. The position of the small black square relative to the small black circle in block B is not clearly defined as being to the right. Therefore, the answer is that the big black circle that is touching the bottom edge of a block is to the right of a small black shape.

The correct answer is {0}."

To determine what is below the yellow object, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and squares based on the given data.

1. **Understanding Block C**:
   - According to <data1>, block C is above both blocks A and B.
   - <data2> states that block C contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square.
   - <data3> specifies that below the medium yellow square is the medium black square.

2. **Position of Block C**:
   - Since block C is above both blocks A and B, the medium yellow square and the medium black square in block C are positioned above any squares in blocks A and B.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - Option 0: A medium blue square that is in block B. Since block C is above block B, the medium blue square in block B is below the medium yellow square in block C.
   - Option 1: Medium blue square number one. This square is part of block A, which is also below block C. Therefore, it is also below the medium yellow square in block C.
   - Option 2: Both of them. Since both the medium blue square in block B and medium blue square number one in block A are below block C, they are both below the medium yellow square.
   - Option 3: None of them. This is incorrect because both squares are below the medium yellow square in block C.

   - <data2>The small yellow triangle is above the big blue circle</data2>.

2. **Block B's Layout**:
   - The small yellow triangle is touching the right edge of Block B and is above the big blue circle.
   - The big blue circle is also touching the right edge of Block B.

3. **Block C's Contents**:
   - Block C contains two medium yellow circles and a small yellow circle.
   - The medium yellow circles are positioned such that one is above and to the left of the other.

4. **Block Positions**:
   - Block B is to the left of Block A and below Block C.

Given this information, we know that the small yellow triangle is directly above the big blue circle within Block B. Since Block C is above Block B, it is possible for the medium yellow circles in Block C to be above the big blue circle in Block B, depending on their exact positioning.

However, based on the information provided, the only object explicitly stated to be above the big blue circle is the small yellow triangle within Block B. There is no direct indication that the medium yellow circles from Block C are directly above the big blue circle in Block B.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, let's analyze the information provided about the blocks and their contents.

1. **Block A**: 
   - <data1>One medium yellow square is in block A</data1>.
   - <data2>A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</data2>.

   This means in Block A, the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square.

2. **Block B**:
   - <data3>Block B with one medium yellow square and a medium black square in it</data3>.
   - <data4>Below the medium black square is the medium yellow square</data4>.

   In Block B, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square.

3. **Block C**:
   - <data5>Block C which is to the left of block A</data5>.
   - <data6>Block B is above it</data6>.
   - <data7>It contains a medium yellow square and one medium blue square</data7>.
   - <data8>Below the medium blue square there is the medium yellow square</data8>.

   In Block C, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square.

Now, let's determine the spatial arrangement:

- Block C is to the left of Block A, and Block B is above Block C.
- In Block A, the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square.
- In Block C, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square.

The question asks which object is to the right of a medium blue square. Since Block C is to the left of Block A, the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of the medium blue square in Block C.

The medium yellow square in Block B is not directly related to the position of any medium blue square, as it is only mentioned in relation to the medium black square.

Thus, the medium yellow square which is in Block A is to the right of a medium blue square.

   - <data1>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</data1>.
   - <data2>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two</data2>.
   - <data3>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one</data3>.

From this, we can deduce the arrangement in Block A:
- Medium yellow square number one is at the bottom, touching the bottom edge of Block A.
- Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.
- Medium yellow square number three is above medium yellow square number two.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one there is a medium black square.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

From this, we can deduce the arrangement in Block B:
- Medium yellow square number one is at the bottom, above the medium black square.
- Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.

Now, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

- In Block A, the object touching the bottom edge is medium yellow square number one.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a yellow triangle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have two blocks, A and B, and <data1>Block A is to the right of B</data1>. This means that all objects in Block B are to the left of all objects in Block A.

2. <data2>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle, a big yellow triangle, and one medium yellow square</data2>. According to <data3>the medium yellow triangle is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square</data3>. Therefore, within Block A, the order from left to right is: big yellow triangle, medium yellow square, medium yellow triangle.

3. <data4>Block B has a medium yellow circle and a medium yellow square</data4>. <data5>This block also has a small blue triangle</data5>. <data6>The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block</data6>. The specific order of these objects within Block B is not given, but all are to the left of Block A.

Now, let's address the question: Which object is to the left of a yellow triangle?

- The medium yellow triangle in Block A is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square in Block A, but it is not to the left of any yellow triangle.

- The small blue triangle in Block B is to the left of all objects in Block A, including the yellow triangles. Therefore, it is to the left of a yellow triangle.

Thus, the object that is to the left of a yellow triangle is the small blue object which is touching the bottom edge of a block. The answer is {1}."

To determine which object is above a medium blue square, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have three blocks: <data1>A, B, and C</data1>.
2. <data1>Block A contains one medium black square</data1>.
3. <data2>Block B contains one medium yellow square</data2>.
4. <data3>Block C has two medium blue squares</data3>.
5. <data4>Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of block C</data4>.
6. <data5>Medium blue square number one is below a medium yellow square and medium blue square number two</data5>.
7. <data6>Below medium blue square number two there is the medium yellow square</data6>.

From this information, we can deduce the following:

- In block C, medium blue square number one is at the bottom, and above it is a medium yellow square and medium blue square number two. This means the medium yellow square in block C is above medium blue square number one.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the small yellow triangle, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and the shapes within them.

1. **Block Arrangement**: 
   - <data1>Block A is above blocks B and C</data1>. This means Block A is on top, and Blocks B and C are below it.

2. **Contents of Block A**:
   - <data2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</data2>. This is the only shape in Block A.

3. **Contents of Block B**:
   - <data3>Block B contains one small black square</data3>. There is no mention of any other shapes in Block B.

4. **Contents of Block C**:
   - <data4>Block C has a big yellow triangle</data4>, one big yellow circle, and <data5>a small black circle</data5>.
   - The big yellow circle is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - The medium blue square is above the big yellow triangle.
   - The big yellow circle is to the right of and below the medium blue square and is below the small black circle.
   - The big yellow triangle is to the left of and near to the small black circle.

Since <data1>Block A is above blocks B and C</data1>, and <data2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</data2>, we need to determine what is directly below this small yellow triangle in Block A.

- Block B only contains a small black square, which is not relevant to the question.
- Block C contains a big yellow triangle and a small black circle. The big yellow triangle is positioned below the medium blue square and to the left of the small black circle.

Given the arrangement, the small yellow triangle in Block A is directly above Block C, which contains the big yellow triangle. Therefore, the big yellow triangle is directly below the small yellow triangle in Block A.

To determine which object is above a medium black square, we need to analyze the given information about the blocks and their contents.

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains a medium black square and a small black circle. 
   - The medium black square is to the right of the small black circle. 
   - Since Block A is below Block C, the contents of Block C could potentially be above the medium black square in Block A.

2. **Block B**: 
   - Contains a big black triangle and a medium yellow circle. 
   - The big black triangle is touching the right edge of Block B. 
   - Below and to the right of the medium yellow circle, there is a medium black triangle touching the bottom edge of Block B. 
   - Since Block B is above Block A, the contents of Block B could potentially be above the medium black square in Block A.

3. **Block C**: 
   - Contains a medium yellow triangle. 
   - According to <data3>, the medium yellow triangle is above and near to a medium black square. 
   - Since Block C is above Block A, the medium yellow triangle in Block C is above the medium black square in Block A.

Now, let's consider the options:

- **The small shape**: Refers to the small black circle in Block A. Since the small black circle is in the same block as the medium black square and not above it, this option is not correct.

- **The object that is touching the bottom edge of a block**: Refers to the medium black triangle in Block B, which is touching the bottom edge of Block B. Since Block B is above Block A, this medium black triangle is above the medium black square in Block A.

- **Both of them**: This would mean both the small shape and the object touching the bottom edge of a block are above the medium black square, but as reasoned, only the object touching the bottom edge of a block (medium black triangle) is above the medium black square.

- **None of them**: This would mean neither the small shape nor the object touching the bottom edge of a block is above the medium black square, which is incorrect as reasoned above.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the object touching the bottom edge of a block (the medium black triangle in Block B) is above the medium black square in Block A. The answer is {1}."
