To determine what is to the right of the small yellow circle, let's analyze the key facts step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. 
2. <key_fact1>Block B is to the right of block A</key_fact1>.
3. <key_fact2>Block B contains a small yellow circle</key_fact2> and one big blue square.
4. <key_fact3>The small yellow circle is below and to the right of the big blue square</key_fact3>.

This means the small yellow circle is positioned in block B, and it is to the right of the big blue square within the same block.

5. <key_fact4>Block C is to the right of block B</key_fact4>.
6. <key_fact5>Block C contains a small yellow square</key_fact5>.
7. <key_fact6>The small yellow square is below and to the left of a big yellow square</key_fact6>.
8. <key_fact7>The big yellow square is touching the right edge of this block</key_fact7>.

Since block C is to the right of block B, and the big yellow square in block C is touching the right edge of block C, the big yellow square is the rightmost object in block C.

Now, considering the position of the small yellow circle in block B, the only block to the right of block B is block C. In block C, the big yellow square is touching the right edge, making it the rightmost object in block C.

Therefore, the object to the right of the small yellow circle in block B is the big yellow square in block C, which is touching the right edge of block C.

The answer is {1}."
1578,"There are two blocks, A and B. Block A is to the left of B. Block A contains three medium yellow squares. <key_fact1>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two</key_fact1>. <key_fact2>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one</key_fact2>. This shape is below the medium yellow square number two. Block B has two medium yellow squares. <key_fact3>Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one there is a medium black square</key_fact3>. <key_fact4>Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two</key_fact4>. Which object is below a medium yellow square? the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block or medium yellow square number one?
0: the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
1: medium yellow square number one
2: both of them
3: none of them","There are two blocks, A and B. Block A is to the left of B.

1: medium yellow square number one
2: both of them
3: none of them
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains three medium yellow squares.
   - <key_fact1>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two</key_fact1>.
   - <key_fact2>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one</key_fact2>.
   - This shape is below the medium yellow square number two.

   From this, we can deduce that in Block A, medium yellow square number three is at the top, followed by medium yellow square number two, and then medium yellow square number one is at the bottom. The shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block A is below medium yellow square number one.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares.
   - <key_fact3>Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one there is a medium black square</key_fact3>.
   - <key_fact4>Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two</key_fact4>.

   In Block B, medium yellow square number two is at the top, followed by medium yellow square number one, and below both of them is a medium black square.

Now, let's answer the question: Which object is below a medium yellow square? The options are:
- 0: the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block
- 1: medium yellow square number one
- 2: both of them
- 3: none of them

From the analysis:
- In Block A, the shape that is touching the bottom edge of the block is below medium yellow square number one.
- In Block B, the medium black square is below both medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one.

Therefore, both the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block (in Block A) and medium yellow square number one (in Block B) are below a medium yellow square.

The correct answer is {2}."
