To determine what is to the right of the circle, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important1>Block B is to the right of block A</important1>.
3. <important2>Block B contains a small yellow circle</important2> and one big blue square.
4. <important3>Below and to the right of the big blue square there is the small yellow circle</important3>.
5. <important4>Block C is to the right of block B</important4>.
6. <important5>Block C contains a small yellow square</important5>.
7. <important6>The small yellow square is below and to the left of a big yellow square</important6>.
8. <important7>The big yellow square is touching the right edge of this block</important7>.

Now, let's visualize the arrangement:

- In Block B, the small yellow circle is positioned below and to the right of the big blue square.
- Block C, which is to the right of Block B, contains a small yellow square and a big yellow square.
- The small yellow square is below and to the left of the big yellow square, which is touching the right edge of Block C.

Since Block C is to the right of Block B, and the big yellow square is touching the right edge of Block C, the big yellow square is the rightmost object in Block C.

Therefore, the big yellow square, which is touching the right edge of Block C, is to the right of the small yellow circle in Block B.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the medium blue circle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. <important1>Block B is to the right of A</important1>. This means that anything in Block B is to the right of anything in Block A.

2. <important2>Block A contains a big blue circle, a medium blue circle, and one big yellow triangle</important2>. Additionally, Block A has one big black triangle. The big blue circle is to the left of the big black triangle. <important3>The medium blue circle is below a medium blue triangle and the big black triangle</important3>. This indicates that the medium blue circle is positioned somewhere below these two triangles within Block A.

3. Block B contains a small blue square, one big black square, and a medium blue triangle. The small blue square is to the right of the medium blue triangle and the big black square. Since <important1>Block B is to the right of A</important1>, all items in Block B are to the right of the medium blue circle in Block A.

4. Block C contains a medium yellow triangle. Since Block C is not mentioned as being to the right of Block A, we cannot assume its position relative to Block A or B.

Given this information, the medium blue circle is in Block A, and everything in Block B is to the right of it. The big black square is in Block B, so it is to the right of the medium blue circle. The medium yellow triangle is in Block C, and we do not have enough information to determine its position relative to the medium blue circle.

Therefore, the answer is that the big black square is to the right of the medium blue circle. The correct answer is {1}."

To determine which object is below a medium blue square, let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. 
2. Block A contains two medium black squares and a medium yellow square. The medium yellow square is below medium black square number two, and medium black square number one is below both the medium yellow square and medium black square number two. This means the order from top to bottom in block A is: medium black square number two, medium yellow square, and medium black square number one.
3. Block B is above block A and contains one medium blue square.
4. Block C is below block B and contains a medium black square. Below this medium black square is the medium blue square.

Now, let's determine the position of the medium blue square and the objects below it:

- The medium blue square is in block B.
- According to <important3>, below the medium black square in block C is the medium blue square. This means the medium black square in block C is directly above the medium blue square.

Therefore, the medium black square in block C is below the medium blue square. 

- In block A, the medium black squares are arranged with medium black square number two at the top, followed by the medium yellow square, and then medium black square number one at the bottom. Since block B is above block A, the medium blue square in block B is above all the objects in block A. Therefore, none of the medium black squares in block A are below the medium blue square.

- Option 0: The medium black circle which is in Block A. According to <important3>, Block A contains a small black circle, not a medium black circle. Therefore, this option is not applicable.
- Option 1: The thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block. There is no information provided about any object touching the bottom edge of a block.
- Option 2: Both of them. Since the medium black circle in Block A does not exist, this option is not applicable.
- Option 3: None of them. This option is incorrect because the medium black circle in Block B is below a big object.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the medium black circle in Block B is below a big object, which corresponds to option 3: none of them. However, since the medium black circle in Block B is below a big object, the correct answer should be option 1: the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the medium blue square and what is to its left.

1. **Identify the position of the medium blue square:**
   - According to <important3>, ""A medium blue square is below the medium black square."" This implies that the medium blue square is directly beneath a medium black square.

2. **Determine the positions of the medium black squares:**
   - From <important1>, we know there is ""one medium black square in block A.""
   - From <important2>, we know ""block B contains a medium black square.""
   - Block C also contains a medium black square, as mentioned in the description of block C.

3. **Analyze the arrangement of blocks:**
   - Block C is to the left of block B and to the right of block A.
   - Therefore, the order of the blocks from left to right is: A, C, B.

4. **Determine the position of the medium blue square:**
   - Since the medium blue square is below a medium black square, and given the arrangement of blocks, it is most logical to assume that the medium blue square is in block B, below the medium black square in block B.

5. **Identify what is to the left of the medium blue square:**
   - Since the medium blue square is in block B, the block to its immediate left is block C.
   - Block C contains a medium black square, but it is not directly to the left of the medium blue square in block B.
   - The medium black square in block A is two blocks away from the medium blue square in block B.

Therefore, the medium black square that is directly to the left of the medium blue square in block B is the medium black square in block B itself.

- The medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of Block A is medium blue square number one in Block A. Since Block B is to the right of Block A, the medium blue squares in Block B are to the right of the medium blue squares in Block A.

- Therefore, the medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of Block A (medium blue square number one in Block A) has objects in Block B to its right.

- The medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of Block B is the medium black square, which is below the medium blue squares in Block B. Therefore, there are no objects to the right of the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block B.

Based on this reasoning, the object that is to the right of a medium blue square is the medium blue square number one in Block A. Therefore, the answer is {0}."

   - <important1>Medium yellow square number two is above a big blue triangle</important1>.
   - The big blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - <important2>The big blue square is above and to the right of the big blue triangle</important2>.

From this, we can deduce:
- The big blue triangle is at the bottom of Block B.
- Medium yellow square number two is directly above the big blue triangle.
- The big blue square is above and to the right of the big blue triangle, which means it is also above medium yellow square number two.

2. **Block A and Block C**:
   - These blocks are below Block B, so any object in Block B is above any object in Blocks A and C.

Now, let's answer the question: Which object is above a yellow square?
- The triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block is the big blue triangle in Block B, which is below medium yellow square number two.
- The big blue square is above medium yellow square number two.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine which object is to the right of a small black shape, given the descriptions of the blocks and their contents.

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains <important1>one small black triangle</important1>.
   - Contains <important2>a big black circle touching the bottom edge of this block</important2>.
   - The <important3>big black circle is below and to the right of the small black triangle</important3>.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains <important4>one small black circle</important4>.
   - The <important5>small black circle is touching and near to a small black square</important5>.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains a medium blue circle.
   - Block C is to the left of Block A, and Block A is to the left of Block B.

Now, let's analyze the positions:

- In Block A, the <important3>big black circle is below and to the right of the small black triangle</important3>. Therefore, the big black circle is to the right of a small black shape (the triangle).

- In Block B, the <important5>small black circle is touching and near to a small black square</important5>. This implies that the small black square is to the left of the small black circle, making the small black circle to the right of the small black square.

The question asks which object is to the right of a small black shape: the big black circle that is touching the bottom edge of a block or the square.

- The big black circle in Block A is to the right of the small black triangle.
- The small black circle in Block B is to the right of the small black square.

Therefore, both the big black circle and the small black circle are to the right of a small black shape.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the yellow object, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We know that <important1>block C is above both blocks A and B</important1>. This means that any object in block C is positioned above the objects in blocks A and B.

2. In block C, there is <important2>a medium black square and a medium yellow square</important2>.

3. <important3>Below the medium yellow square is the medium black square</important3>. This indicates that within block C, the yellow square is directly above the black square.

Since block C is above both blocks A and B, the objects in block C do not directly interact with the objects in blocks A and B in terms of vertical positioning. Therefore, the medium yellow square in block C is not directly above any objects in blocks A or B.

Given this, the answer to what is directly below the yellow object is that there is no medium blue square from block B or medium blue square number one directly below it. The correct answer is {3: none of them}."

From <important1> and <important2>, we know that in Block A, there is a small yellow square and a small blue triangle. The small blue triangle is to the right of the small yellow square.

<important3> tells us that Block B is below Block A. However, there is no mention of any specific objects in Block B.

<important4> and <important5> describe Block C, which contains a big black circle and a small yellow triangle above it.

The question asks which object is below a small yellow shape. The small yellow square in Block A does not have any objects mentioned below it. However, <important5> states that the small yellow triangle is above the big black circle in Block C. Therefore, the big black circle is below the small yellow triangle.

Since the big black circle is the only object mentioned as being below a small yellow shape, and it is not referred to as a ""medium thing,"" the answer is that none of the options (the small yellow triangle or the medium thing) are below a small yellow shape.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to understand the arrangement of the blocks and the squares within them.

1. **Block Arrangement:**
   - <important1>Block B is below C</important1>.
   - <important2>Block A is below B</important2>.

   This means the order from top to bottom is: Block C, Block B, Block A.

2. **Block A Details:**
   - <important3>Block A has two medium blue squares</important3>.
   - <important4>Below medium blue square number two is medium blue square number one</important4>.
   - Below both medium blue squares is a medium black square.

   This means in Block A, from top to bottom, the order is: medium blue square number two, medium blue square number one, and then the medium black square.

3. **Block B Details:**
   - Block B contains a medium yellow square.

4. **Block C Details:**
   - Block C has two medium black squares.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

   This means in Block C, from top to bottom, the order is: medium black square number two, then medium black square number one.

Now, let's address the question: ""Which object is above a medium blue square? the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block or medium black square number two?""

- The medium blue squares are in Block A.
- The medium black square number two is in Block C, which is the topmost block.
- The thing touching the bottom edge of a block would be the medium black square in Block A, as it is below the medium blue squares.

Since the medium black square number two is in Block C, it is above the medium blue squares in Block A. The thing touching the bottom edge of a block (medium black square in Block A) is not above the medium blue squares.

Therefore, the object above a medium blue square is the medium black square number two.

3. <important3>Block A contains one medium yellow square</important3>, and <important5>block C contains one medium yellow square</important5>.
4. <important4>Block B contains three medium black squares</important4>.

Now, let's consider the arrangement of the medium black squares within Block B:
- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three and medium black square number two.
- Below medium black square number three is medium black square number two.

This means the order of the medium black squares from top to bottom in Block B is:
- Top: Medium black square number three
- Middle: Medium black square number two
- Bottom: Medium black square number one

Since Block A is above Block B and contains a medium yellow square, the entire Block B is below the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, all medium black squares in Block B are below the medium yellow square in Block A.

Thus, both medium black square number one and medium black square number two are below a medium yellow square.

1. In Block A:
   - <important1>Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important1>.
   - <important2>It is below medium black square number two</important2>.
   - Therefore, medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.

2. In Block B:
   - <important3>The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of this block</important3>.
   - <important4>It is below the medium blue square</important4>.
   - Therefore, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square.

3. Block C is below block B and to the left of block A. It has one medium black square.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and the squares within them.

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important1>One medium yellow square is in block A</important1>.
   - <important2>A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</important2>.

2. **Block B**: 
   - <important3>Block B with one medium yellow square and a medium black square in it</important3>.
   - <important4>Below the medium black square is the medium yellow square</important4>.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important5>Block C which is to the left of block A</important5>.
   - <important6>Block B is above it</important6>.
   - <important7>It contains a medium yellow square and one medium blue square</important7>.
   - <important8>Below the medium blue square there is the medium yellow square</important8>.

Now, let's determine the relative positions:

- **Block C** is to the left of **Block A** (<important5>block C which is to the left of block A</important5>).
- **Block B** is above **Block C** (<important6>block B is above it</important6>).

Given this arrangement, the medium blue square in **Block A** is below the medium yellow square in **Block A** (<important2>A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</important2>).

In **Block C**, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square (<important8>Below the medium blue square there is the medium yellow square</important8>).

Since **Block C** is to the left of **Block A**, the medium blue square in **Block C** is to the left of the medium yellow square in **Block A**. Therefore, the medium yellow square in **Block A** is to the right of the medium blue square in **Block C**.

The medium yellow square in **Block B** is not directly related to the position of any medium blue square in the context of being to the right of it.

Thus, the medium yellow square which is in **Block A** is to the right of a medium blue square.

The answer is {1}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine what is to the left of the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of block A.

1. We know from <important1> that the medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block A.

2. According to <important2>, block B is to the left of block A.

3. From <important3>, we know that block B contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square, with the medium yellow square below the medium blue square.

Since block B is to the left of block A, and the medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block A, we need to determine what is directly to the left of this square in block B.

Given that the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square in block B, the medium yellow square is likely at the bottom of block B. Therefore, the medium yellow square is to the left of the medium black square number one in block A.

However, the question asks specifically about a blue shape or a medium black square. Since the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square in block B, it is not directly to the left of the medium black square number one in block A.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in both blocks A and B.

1. **Block A Analysis:**
   - <important1>There is one medium yellow square in block A</important1>.
   - <important2>Below a medium black square and the medium yellow square is a medium blue square</important2>.
   - This implies that in block A, the medium blue square is below both the medium black square and the medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium yellow square in block A is not to the right of the medium blue square.

2. **Block B Analysis:**
   - <important3>Block B is to the right of block A</important3>.
   - <important4>It has one medium black square, a medium blue square and one medium yellow square</important4>.
   - <important5>Below the medium blue square and the medium yellow square is the medium black square</important5>.
   - This implies that in block B, the medium blue square is above the medium black square, and the medium yellow square is also above the medium black square. The relative horizontal positions of the medium blue and medium yellow squares in block B are not specified, so we cannot definitively say that the medium yellow square in block B is to the right of the medium blue square.

Since neither the medium yellow square in block A nor the medium yellow square in block B is definitively to the right of a medium blue square, the answer is {3}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium thing, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. Block B is positioned between Block A and Block C, meaning Block A is on the left, Block B is in the middle, and Block C is on the right.

2. In Block B, there is <important1>one medium blue triangle</important1> and <important2>one small yellow square</important2>. The medium blue triangle is near to and below the small yellow square.

3. In Block C, there is <important3>one small black square</important3>.

Now, let's consider the positions:

- The medium blue triangle is in Block B.
- The small yellow square is also in Block B, above the medium blue triangle.
- The small black square is in Block C, which is to the right of Block B.

Since Block C is to the right of Block B, the small black square in Block C is to the right of the medium blue triangle in Block B. The small yellow square is in the same block as the medium blue triangle, so it is not to the right of it.

Therefore, the object to the right of a medium thing (the medium blue triangle) is the small black square in Block C.

   - Contains three medium yellow squares.
   - <important1>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important1>.
   - <important2>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two</important2>.
   - <important3>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one</important3>.

From this, we can deduce the arrangement in Block A:
- Medium yellow square number three is above both medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one.
- Medium yellow square number one is at the bottom, touching the bottom edge of Block A.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one, there is a medium black square.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

From this, we can deduce the arrangement in Block B:
- Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.
- The medium black square is below both medium yellow squares.

Now, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block. 

- In Block A, the object touching the bottom edge is <important1>medium yellow square number one</important1>.
- In Block B, the object touching the bottom edge is the medium black square.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, we are interested in what is to the right of <important1>medium yellow square number one</important1> in Block A.

In Block B, the medium yellow square number one is above the medium black square, and medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a yellow triangle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. <important1>Block A is to the right of B</important1>. This means all objects in Block B are to the left of all objects in Block A.

2. <important2>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle, a big yellow triangle, and one medium yellow square</important2>.

3. <important3>The medium yellow triangle is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square</important3>. This means within Block A, the order from left to right is: big yellow triangle, medium yellow square, medium yellow triangle.

4. <important4>Block B has a medium yellow circle and a medium yellow square</important4>.

5. <important5>This block also has a small blue triangle</important5>.

6. <important6>The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block</important6>.

Now, let's determine the position of the objects:

- The small blue triangle is in Block B, which is to the left of Block A. Therefore, it is to the left of all yellow triangles in Block A.

- The medium yellow triangle is in Block A and is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, it is not to the left of any yellow triangle in Block A.

Based on this analysis, the small blue triangle in Block B is to the left of the yellow triangles in Block A. Therefore, the answer is {1}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the small yellow triangle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. <important1>Block A is above blocks B and C</important1>. This means Block A is positioned higher than both Block B and Block C.

2. <important2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</important2>. This indicates that the small yellow triangle is located in Block A.

3. <important3>Block B contains one small black square</important3>. This information is about Block B and does not directly relate to the small yellow triangle in Block A.

4. <important4>Block C has a big yellow triangle</important4>, one big yellow circle, and <important5>a small black circle</important5>. The big yellow triangle and the small black circle are both in Block C.

Since <important1>Block A is above blocks B and C</important1>, and the small yellow triangle is in Block A, it is positioned above both Block B and Block C. Therefore, the small yellow triangle in Block A cannot have anything from Block C directly below it, as Block C is a separate block positioned below Block A.

Thus, there is nothing directly below the small yellow triangle in Block A from Block C. The answer is {3: none of them}."

To determine which object is to the left of a medium black square, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Block A**:
   - <important1>Block A contains two medium blue squares</important1>.
   - It also has a medium black square and a medium yellow square.
   - The medium black square is below medium blue square number two.
   - <important2>Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important2>.

2. **Block B**:
   - <important3>Block B is to the right of block A</important3>.
   - <important4>Block B has a medium black square</important4>.

3. **Block C**:
   - <important5>Block C contains one medium black square</important5>.
   - Block C is to the left of Block B.

Now, let's determine the positions:

- In **Block A**, medium blue square number two is above the medium black square. Therefore, medium blue square number two is to the left of the medium black square in Block A.
- Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block A, and it is below the medium black square in Block A. Therefore, it is not to the left of the medium black square in Block A.

Since Block B and Block C are to the right of Block A, neither medium blue square number two nor the shape touching the bottom edge of Block A (medium blue square number one) can be to the left of the medium black squares in Blocks B or C.

Therefore, the only object to the left of a medium black square is medium blue square number two in Block A.

To determine which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, we need to analyze the spatial arrangement of the blocks and squares based on the given information.

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important1>Block B is to the left of block A</important1>. This means that any object in Block B is to the left of any object in Block A.
3. Block B contains two medium yellow squares.
4. <important2>Below block B there is block C</important2>. This means Block C is vertically aligned with Block B, but below it.
5. Block C contains a <important3>medium blue square</important3> and a <important4>medium black square</important4>. The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

Since Block B is to the left of Block A, and Block C is below Block B, the objects in Block C (the medium blue square and the medium black square) are not to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A. However, since Block B itself is to the left of Block A, the medium yellow squares in Block B are to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A.

Therefore, the objects in Block C (the medium blue square and the medium black square) are not to the left of any medium yellow square in Block A. They are below Block B, and thus not horizontally aligned to be to the left of any medium yellow square.
