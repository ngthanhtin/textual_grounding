--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the medium black circle, let's analyze the key facts provided:

1. In block C, there is a <key_fact1>medium black circle</key_fact1>.
2. According to <key_fact2>, to the right of and near to the medium black circle, there is the small black triangle.

From this information, we can deduce that the small black triangle is directly to the right of the medium black circle. 

Additionally, it is mentioned that the medium black triangle is to the right of the small black triangle. Therefore, the medium black triangle is also to the right of the medium black circle, but not directly adjacent to it.

The medium yellow square is located in block A, which is above block C, and thus not directly to the right of the medium black circle in block C.

Therefore, the only shape directly to the right of the medium black circle is the small black triangle, and further to the right is the medium black triangle. The medium yellow square is not in the same block and thus not to the right of the medium black circle.

The answer is {0}: medium black triangle."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the medium blue circle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. According to <key_fact1>Block B is to the right of A</key_fact1>. This means that anything in Block B is to the right of anything in Block A.

2. In Block A, <key_fact2>Block A contains a big blue circle, a medium blue circle, and one big yellow triangle</key_fact2>. Additionally, there is a big black triangle. The big blue circle is to the left of the big black triangle. <key_fact3>The medium blue circle is below a medium blue triangle and the big black triangle</key_fact3>. This suggests that the medium blue circle is positioned somewhere below these two triangles within Block A.

3. Block B contains a small blue square, one big black square, and a medium blue triangle. The small blue square is to the right of the medium blue triangle and the big black square. Since <key_fact1>Block B is to the right of A</key_fact1>, the big black square in Block B is to the right of everything in Block A, including the medium blue circle.

4. Block C contains a medium yellow triangle. Since Block C is not mentioned as being to the right of Block A, we cannot assume its position relative to Block A or B without additional information.

Based on this analysis, the big black square in Block B is to the right of the medium blue circle in Block A. The medium yellow triangle in Block C's position relative to Block A is not specified, so we cannot definitively say it is to the right of the medium blue circle.

   - <key_fact5>The big black circle is below the small yellow circle</key_fact5>.

4. **Position of the Big Black Circle**:
   - Since the big black circle is below the small yellow circle (<key_fact5>), it must be in Block B.
   - The big yellow circle in Block B is touching the right edge and is above and to the right of the big black circle (<key_fact4>).

5. **What is below the Big Black Circle?**:
   - The big black circle is in Block B, and the big yellow circle touching the right edge is also in Block B.
   - The big yellow triangle is in Block A, which is below Block B (<key_fact1>).

Since the big black circle is in Block B and the big yellow circle touching the right edge is also in Block B, the circle touching the right edge is below the big black circle. The triangle is in Block A, which is below Block B, so it is also below the big black circle.

Therefore, both the circle that is touching the right edge of a block and the triangle are below the big black circle.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is above the big yellow triangle, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and their contents.

1. According to <key_fact1>Block B is above A</key_fact1>, Block B is positioned above Block A.
2. <key_fact2>Block A contains one big yellow triangle</key_fact2>, so the big yellow triangle is in Block A.
3. <key_fact3>Block B has a medium black circle</key_fact3>, which means the medium black circle is in Block B.

Since Block B is directly above Block A, the medium black circle in Block B is directly above the big yellow triangle in Block A. The small yellow circle is in Block C, which is not mentioned as being above Block A. Therefore, the small yellow circle is not above the big yellow triangle.

Thus, the object above the big yellow triangle is the medium black circle.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the small blue circle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Block B Configuration**:
   - Block B contains a medium black circle, a small yellow circle, a small blue triangle, a small blue circle, and a medium yellow triangle.
   - The medium yellow triangle is to the left of the small blue triangle.
   - The small blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - The small blue circle is below both the small blue triangle and the medium yellow triangle.

2. **Position of the Small Blue Circle**:
   - Since the small blue circle is below the small blue triangle and the medium yellow triangle, it must be positioned lower in Block B.

3. **Block C Configuration**:
   - Block C is below Block B and above Block A.
   - Block C contains a medium yellow triangle and a medium yellow square.
   - The medium yellow triangle is to the left of and below the medium yellow square.

4. **Block A Configuration**:
   - Block A contains a small yellow circle.

5. **What is Below the Small Blue Circle?**:
   - The small blue circle is in Block B, and Block C is below Block B.
   - The small blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B, and the small blue circle is below it within Block B.
   - The question asks if below the small blue circle is a small yellow circle or a small blue triangle that is touching the right edge of a block.

Given that the small blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B and the small blue circle is below it, the small blue triangle is not below the small blue circle. The small yellow circle is in Block A, which is below Block C, and thus not directly below the small blue circle in Block B.

- In **Block C**, the medium yellow square is above both medium black squares (as per <key_fact5>), so the medium yellow square is above a medium black square.

- The object touching the bottom edge of Block A is the medium yellow square, but it is not above a medium black square in Block A.

Therefore, the object that is above a medium black square is the medium yellow square in Block C. The medium blue square in Block A is not above a medium black square.

Thus, the answer is {1}: the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block (in Block C) is above a medium black square."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the medium yellow square, let's analyze the key facts step by step:

1. According to <key_fact1>, there is a medium yellow square in block A.

2. <key_fact2> states that to the right of the medium yellow square and the big blue square is the medium blue circle. This indicates that the medium blue circle is positioned to the right of the medium yellow square.

3. <key_fact3> tells us that Block B is to the right of Block A. This means that any elements in Block B are further to the right than those in Block A.

Given these facts, the medium blue circle is directly to the right of the medium yellow square in Block A. The big black square is in Block B, which is to the right of Block A, but it is not directly to the right of the medium yellow square. Therefore, the only object directly to the right of the medium yellow square is the medium blue circle.

Thus, the answer is {1}."

To determine which object is above a medium blue square, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <key_fact1>Block C is to the left of B</key_fact1>.
3. <key_fact2>Block B is below A</key_fact2>.
4. <key_fact3>Block A has two medium blue squares</key_fact3>.

8. <key_fact8>Block C contains a medium blue square</key_fact8>.
9. <key_fact9>A medium black square is below the medium blue square</key_fact9>.

Now, let's reason through the question:

- In Block A, we have two medium blue squares. According to <key_fact4>, medium blue square number one is below a medium yellow square, and according to <key_fact5>, this yellow square is below medium blue square number two. Therefore, the medium yellow square is above medium blue square number one in Block A.

- <key_fact6> mentions that something is touching the bottom edge of a block, but it doesn't specify which block or what object it is. However, it is not directly stated to be above a medium blue square.

- In Block C, <key_fact8> states that there is a medium blue square, and <key_fact9> indicates that a medium black square is below this medium blue square. Therefore, there is no object above the medium blue square in Block C.

Based on this analysis, the only object that is above a medium blue square is the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, the answer is {1}, as the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block is not specified to be above a medium blue square, and the medium blue square in Block C has nothing above it."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in both blocks A and B.

1. **Block A Analysis:**
   - According to <key_fact1>, Block A contains a medium black triangle, a big black square, and a big yellow circle.
   - <key_fact2> states that the medium black triangle is to the right of a small yellow square.
   - The big black square is to the left of and below the small yellow square, and this shape is to the left of the big yellow circle.
   - The medium black triangle is above the big yellow circle.

   From this, we can deduce that the small yellow square is to the left of the medium black triangle and the big yellow circle.

2. **Block B Analysis:**
   - According to <key_fact3>, Block B contains a medium blue circle and a medium yellow square.
   - <key_fact4> states that to the right of and below the medium yellow square, there is the medium blue circle.

   This indicates that the medium yellow square is to the left of the medium blue circle.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of a medium circle:

- In Block A, the small yellow square is to the left of the medium black triangle, but there is no medium circle in Block A.
- In Block B, the medium yellow square is to the left of the medium blue circle.

Therefore, the small square (in Block A) is not to the left of a medium circle, but the medium yellow square (in Block B) is to the left of the medium blue circle.

Thus, the answer is {1: the small square}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the yellow object, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and squares based on the given information.

1. **Understanding Block C**: 
   - According to <key_fact1>, block C is above both blocks A and B.
   - <key_fact2> states that block C contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square.
   - <key_fact3> specifies that below the medium yellow square is the medium black square.

2. **Position of the Yellow Square**:
   - Since the medium black square is directly below the medium yellow square in block C, the yellow square is at the topmost position in block C.

3. **Position of Block C Relative to Blocks A and B**:
   - Block C is above both blocks A and B, as per <key_fact1>.

4. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - Option 0: A medium blue square that is in block B. Since block C is above block B, the medium blue square in block B is not directly below the yellow square in block C.
   - Option 1: Medium blue square number one. Since block C is above block A, and medium blue square number one is in block A, it is not directly below the yellow square in block C.
   - Option 2: Both of them. This would imply that both the medium blue square in block B and medium blue square number one in block A are below the yellow square, which is not possible as block C is above both blocks A and B.
   - Option 3: None of them. Since block C is above both blocks A and B, neither the medium blue square in block B nor medium blue square number one in block A is directly below the yellow square.

Therefore, the correct answer is {3}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the circle, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Block Arrangement**: We have three blocks: A, B, and C. Block C is to the right of Block B, and Block A is above Block C. This means Block B and Block C are horizontally aligned, with Block C on the right.

2. **Contents of Block B**: According to <key_fact1>, Block B contains a medium blue circle. Since Block C is to the right of Block B, anything in Block C is to the right of the circle.

3. **Contents of Block C**: As per <key_fact2>, Block C contains a medium black square, a small black triangle, and a medium yellow triangle.

4. **Relative Positions in Block C**: <key_fact3> states that the medium black square is below and to the left of the small black triangle, which is near the medium yellow triangle. This suggests that the small black triangle and the medium yellow triangle are positioned close to each other, with the small black triangle being above and to the right of the medium black square.

5. **Conclusion**: Since Block C is entirely to the right of Block B, both the small black triangle and the medium yellow triangle are to the right of the medium blue circle in Block B.

Therefore, the answer is {2}, indicating that both the medium yellow triangle and the small black triangle are to the right of the circle."

   - <key_fact5>Above the big black circle is the small yellow triangle</key_fact5>.

Now, let's determine the position of the objects:

- In Block A, the small yellow square is to the left of the small blue triangle.
- Block B is below Block A, but there is no mention of any specific object in Block B.
- In Block C, the small yellow triangle is above the big black circle.

The question asks which object is below a small yellow shape. We have two small yellow shapes mentioned: a small yellow square in Block A and a small yellow triangle in Block C.

- The small yellow square in Block A does not have any object mentioned below it.
- The small yellow triangle in Block C is above the big black circle, meaning the big black circle is below the small yellow triangle.

Therefore, the object below a small yellow shape is the big black circle, which is below the small yellow triangle. Since the options are about the small yellow triangle or the medium thing, and neither of these is below a small yellow shape, the correct answer is {3: none of them}."

2. <key_fact2> states that medium black square number one is below medium black square number two. Therefore, medium black square number two is above medium black square number one within Block A.

3. **Block B** is below Block A, as stated in <key_fact3>. Block B contains a medium yellow square. According to <key_fact4>, the medium yellow square is below a medium black square. Since Block B is below Block A, the medium black square referred to in <key_fact4> must be the medium black square number one from Block A, which is touching the bottom edge of Block A.

4. **Block C** is above Block B and contains a medium blue square. However, this information is not directly relevant to the question about which object is above a medium square.

Now, let's determine which object is above a medium square:

- Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one in Block A.
- The medium black square in Block B is actually the medium black square number one from Block A, which is not above any medium square in Block B.

   - <key_fact3>Block A contains one medium yellow square</key_fact3>.
   - <key_fact4>Block B contains three medium black squares</key_fact4>.
   - <key_fact5>Block C contains one medium yellow square</key_fact5>.

3. We need to determine which medium black square is below a medium yellow square. Since Block A is above Block B, the medium yellow square in Block A is above the medium black squares in Block B.

4. The arrangement of the medium black squares in Block B is as follows:
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three and medium black square number two.
   - Below medium black square number three is medium black square number two.

   This means the order from top to bottom within Block B is: medium black square number three, medium black square number two, and medium black square number one.

5. Since Block A is above Block B, the medium yellow square in Block A is above all the medium black squares in Block B. Therefore, all the medium black squares in Block B are below the medium yellow square in Block A.

6. The medium yellow square in Block C is above Block A, so it does not affect the position of the medium black squares in Block B.

Therefore, both medium black square number one and medium black square number two are below a medium yellow square (the one in Block A).

   - <key_fact2>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle</key_fact2>, one medium black square, and a medium black circle. The medium yellow triangle is touching the right edge of this block and is below the medium black circle. This shape is below and to the right of the medium black square.

3. **Contents of Block B**:
   - <key_fact3>Block B has a big blue triangle, one medium blue square, and one small black square</key_fact3>. One small yellow triangle is also touching the right edge of this block. It is touching and above the medium blue square. The big blue triangle is to the left of the triangle which is touching the medium blue square. It is far from and above the medium blue square.

4. **Contents of Block C**:
   - Block C contains a big blue square. To the right of a small black square, there is a medium blue circle. Near to and below the small black square, there is the big blue square. This shape is above the circle which is to the right of the small black square.

Now, let's determine what is directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A:

- Since Block B is directly above Block A, we need to consider the contents of Block B.
- In Block B, there is no mention of a medium blue circle. The shapes mentioned are a big blue triangle, a medium blue square, and a small black square.
- Since Block C is above Block B, the contents of Block C are not directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A.

Therefore, based on the arrangement and the contents of the blocks, there is no medium blue circle directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A. The big blue square in Block C is not directly above the medium yellow triangle either, as it is in a different block.

Thus, the answer is {3: none of them}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and the squares within them.

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains a medium yellow square. <key_fact1>One medium yellow square is in block A</key_fact1>.
   - Below the medium yellow square is a medium blue square. <key_fact2>A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</key_fact2>.

   - Contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square. <key_fact7>It contains a medium yellow square and one medium blue square</key_fact7>.
   - Below the medium blue square is the medium yellow square. <key_fact8>Below the medium blue square there is the medium yellow square</key_fact8>.

Now, let's determine the relative positions:

- **Block C** is to the left of **Block A**, and **Block B** is above **Block C**. This means that **Block A** is to the right of **Block C**.
- In **Block A**, the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square, so the medium yellow square is directly above the medium blue square.
- In **Block C**, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square, so the medium yellow square is directly below the medium blue square.

Since **Block C** is to the left of **Block A**, the medium blue square in **Block C** is to the left of the medium yellow square in **Block A**. Therefore, the medium yellow square in **Block A** is to the right of the medium blue square in **Block C**.

The medium yellow square in **Block B** is not directly related to the medium blue squares in **Block A** or **Block C** in terms of horizontal positioning, as **Block B** is above **Block C**.

Thus, the medium yellow square which is in **Block A** is to the right of a medium blue square (specifically, the one in **Block C**).

To solve this problem, let's analyze the key facts step by step:

1. **Block Arrangement**: 
   - <key_fact1>Block A is to the left of B</key_fact1>. This means all objects in Block A are to the left of all objects in Block B.

2. **Block A Composition**:
   - <key_fact2>Block A has one medium blue square</key_fact2>. This means there is only one medium blue square in Block A.

3. **Block B Composition**:
   - <key_fact3>Block B has two medium blue squares</key_fact3> and <key_fact4>two other medium black squares</key_fact4>. This means Block B contains two medium blue squares and two medium black squares.

4. **Relative Positioning in Block B**:
   - Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two, medium black square number one, and medium black square number two.
   - Medium blue square number two is below medium black square number two.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

From these facts, we can deduce the vertical arrangement within Block B:
- At the top is medium black square number two.
- Below it is medium black square number one.
- Below medium black square number one is medium blue square number two.
- At the bottom is medium blue square number one.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square. Since Block A is entirely to the left of Block B, the medium blue square in Block A cannot have any object to its right within Block A. Therefore, we focus on Block B.

In Block B:
- Medium blue square number one is at the bottom and is below all other squares, so it cannot have any square to its right.
- Medium blue square number two is below medium black square number two, but there is no indication of horizontal positioning that places any square to the right of medium blue square number two.

Since block B is to the left of block A (<key_fact2>), we need to consider the contents of block B. Block B contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square (<key_fact3>), with the medium yellow square below the medium blue square.

Therefore, to the left of the medium black square number one (which is touching the bottom edge of block A), there is a medium yellow square in block B. However, the question asks if there is a blue shape or a medium black square to the left of the thing touching the bottom edge of a block.

Since the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square in block B, the medium blue square is also to the left of the medium black square number one in block A.

Thus, the answer is that a blue shape (the medium blue square in block B) is to the left of the thing touching the bottom edge of block A.

   - <key_fact2>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two</key_fact2>.
   - <key_fact3>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one</key_fact3>.

From these key facts, we can deduce the arrangement in Block A:
- Medium yellow square number three is above both medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one.
- Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.
- Therefore, the order from top to bottom in Block A is: medium yellow square number three, medium yellow square number two, and medium yellow square number one.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one there is a medium black square.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

From this, we can deduce the arrangement in Block B:
- Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.
- Below both of these squares is a medium black square.

Now, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block. According to <key_fact1>, medium yellow square number one in Block A is touching the bottom edge of Block A. In Block B, the medium black square is touching the bottom edge.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, we need to determine what is to the right of medium yellow square number one in Block A. The only object that can be to the right of medium yellow square number one in Block A is the medium black square in Block B.

To determine what is below the small yellow triangle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. <key_fact1>Block A is above blocks B and C</key_fact1>. This means Block A is positioned on top of the other two blocks.

2. <key_fact2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</key_fact2>. This indicates that the small yellow triangle is located within Block A.

3. <key_fact3>Block B contains one small black square</key_fact3>. This tells us that the small black square is in Block B, which is below Block A.

4. <key_fact4>Block C has a big yellow triangle</key_fact4>, one big yellow circle, and <key_fact5>a small black circle</key_fact5>. This means these shapes are in Block C, which is also below Block A.

Since Block A is above both Block B and Block C, and the small yellow triangle is in Block A, neither the small black circle nor the big yellow triangle can be directly below the small yellow triangle in Block A. They are in different blocks (Block C), which are positioned below Block A.

Therefore, the answer is that there is {3: none of them} below the small yellow triangle."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is above the small blue square, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks.

1. **Understanding the Layout of Block A:**
   - Block A contains a big yellow square, a big blue circle, and a medium black circle.
   - The medium black circle is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - The big yellow square is to the right of the medium black circle.
   - The big blue circle is near the medium black circle and to the left of the small yellow square.
   - The small yellow square is above the medium black circle.

2. **Position of Block C:**
   - According to <key_fact1>, Block C is below Block A.
   - Block C contains a small blue square and a big blue triangle.
   - <key_fact2> states that one big blue circle is also in Block C.
   - <key_fact3> indicates that the small blue square is to the right of and below the big blue triangle and near the big blue circle.

3. **Determining What is Above the Small Blue Square:**
   - Since Block C is below Block A, the objects in Block A are above the objects in Block C.
   - The big blue circle is present in both Block A and Block C, but the one in Block C is near the small blue square.
   - The big yellow square is in Block A, which is above Block C.

Given that Block A is directly above Block C, the big yellow square in Block A is above the small blue square in Block C. The big blue circle in Block C is near the small blue square, but it is not above it since it is in the same block.

Therefore, the object above the small blue square is the big yellow square from Block A.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium black square, let's analyze the key facts step by step:

1. **Block A Configuration:**
   - <key_fact1>Block A contains two medium blue squares</key_fact1>.
   - It also has a medium black square and a medium yellow square.
   - The medium black square is below medium blue square number two.
   - <key_fact2>Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</key_fact2>.

2. **Block B Configuration:**
   - <key_fact3>Block B is to the right of block A</key_fact3>.
   - <key_fact4>Block B has a medium black square</key_fact4>.

3. **Block C Configuration:**
   - <key_fact5>Block C contains one medium black square</key_fact5>.
   - Block C is to the left of Block B.

Now, let's determine the position of the objects relative to the medium black squares:

- In **Block A**, the medium black square is below medium blue square number two. Therefore, medium blue square number two is above the medium black square in Block A, not to the left of it.
- <key_fact2>Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</key_fact2>, which means it is at the bottom of Block A. Since Block B is to the right of Block A, medium blue square number one is to the left of the medium black square in Block B.

- In **Block C**, there is one medium black square. Since Block C is to the left of Block B, the medium black square in Block C is to the left of the medium black square in Block B.

Therefore, the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium blue square number one) is to the left of a medium black square in Block B. Medium blue square number two is not to the left of any medium black square.

   - <key_fact4>The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</key_fact4>.
   - <key_fact5>Block C is to the left of block A</key_fact5>.

Now, let's visualize the arrangement:

- Block C is to the left of Block A, and both contain a medium blue square below a medium yellow square.
- Block B contains only a medium blue square.

Since Block C is to the left of Block A, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of the medium blue square in Block C. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of a medium blue square.

The medium yellow square in Block C is above the medium blue square in Block C, not to the right of it.

Thus, the object to the right of a medium blue square is the medium yellow square that is in Block A.

The correct answer is {1}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium blue square, let's analyze the information provided:

1. <key_fact1>Block A contains one medium blue square</key_fact1>. This means there is a medium blue square in Block A.

2. <key_fact2>Block B is above block A</key_fact2>. This indicates that Block B is positioned above Block A, but it doesn't specify the contents of Block B.

3. <key_fact3>Block C with one medium blue square and one medium yellow square in it</key_fact3>. This tells us that Block C contains both a medium blue square and a medium yellow square.

4. <key_fact4>The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block</key_fact4>. This suggests that the medium blue square in Block C is at the bottom of Block C.

5. <key_fact5>The medium yellow square is below a medium black square</key_fact5>. This implies that there is a medium black square above the medium yellow square, but it doesn't specify which block this arrangement is in.

6. <key_fact6>The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square and the medium black square</key_fact6>. This indicates that the medium blue square is positioned below both the medium yellow square and the medium black square.

Now, let's consider the possible arrangements:

- In Block A, there is only a medium blue square, so there is no medium yellow square to the left of it.

- In Block C, the medium blue square is at the bottom, and the medium yellow square is above it. Since the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square, the medium yellow square cannot be to the left of the medium blue square in Block C.

- Block B is above Block A, but we have no information about the contents of Block B, so we cannot determine if there is a medium yellow square in Block B that is to the left of a medium blue square.

Based on the information provided, neither the medium yellow square in Block B nor the medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of a medium blue square. Therefore, the answer is {3}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in the blocks based on the given key facts.

1. <key_fact1>There is one medium blue square in block A</key_fact1>. This square is in block A.

2. <key_fact2>To the right of block A there is block B</key_fact2>, which <key_fact3>contains two medium blue squares</key_fact3>. This means block B is to the right of block A.

3. <key_fact4>Medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square</key_fact4> in block B. This indicates that medium blue square number two is in block B.

Since block B is to the right of block A, the medium blue square in block A is to the left of the medium blue squares in block B. Therefore, the medium blue square in block A is not to the right of any medium square.

Now, considering the medium blue squares in block B:
- Medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square in block B, but it is not specified to be to the right of any other medium square.

Therefore, neither the medium blue square in block A nor medium blue square number two is to the right of a medium square.

2. **Block A**:
   - <key_fact2>Block A has two medium yellow squares</key_fact2>.
   - <key_fact3>Below a medium blue square there is medium yellow square number two</key_fact3>. This implies that Block A contains a medium blue square above a medium yellow square.

3. **Block B**:
   - <key_fact4>Block B contains one medium blue square</key_fact4> and one medium black square. The medium blue square is below the medium black square. This means Block B has a medium blue square, but it is to the right of both Block A and Block C.

   - <key_fact5>Block C contains two medium blue squares</key_fact5>.
   - <key_fact6>Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</key_fact6>. It is below medium blue square number two. This means Block C has two medium blue squares, with one at the bottom and another above it.

Now, let's determine which object is to the left of a medium blue square:

- Since <key_fact1>Block B is to the right of blocks A and C</key_fact1>, any medium blue square in Block B cannot have anything to its left from Block A or Block C.
- In Block A, there is a medium blue square above a medium yellow square (<key_fact3>), but no information about any object to the left of the medium blue square.
- In Block C, there are two medium blue squares (<key_fact5>), with one touching the bottom edge (<key_fact6>). Since Block C is to the left of Block B, the medium blue squares in Block C are to the left of the medium blue square in Block B.

Therefore, the medium blue square in Block B is the only one that has objects (from Block A and Block C) to its left. However, the question asks about the medium blue squares in Block C, and since Block C is to the left of Block B, the medium blue squares in Block C do not have any objects to their left within Block C itself.

To determine which object is above a medium black square, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <key_fact1>Block B is below block A</key_fact1>, and it contains one medium black square.
3. <key_fact2>Block C is above block A</key_fact2>.
4. <key_fact3>Block C contains two medium blue squares</key_fact3>.
5. <key_fact4>Below medium blue square number two and a medium yellow square there is medium blue square number one</key_fact4>. The medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two.

From these facts, we can deduce the following:

- Block C is at the top, Block A is in the middle, and Block B is at the bottom.
- Block A contains a medium black square.
- Block C contains two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square.
- According to <key_fact4>, medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two and a medium yellow square. This implies that medium blue square number two is at the topmost position in Block C, followed by the medium yellow square, and then medium blue square number one.

Since Block C is above Block A, and Block A contains a medium black square, the objects in Block C are above the medium black square in Block A.

Therefore, medium blue square number two, which is at the top of Block C, is above the medium black square in Block A.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is below a blue thing, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and the squares within them.

1. **Block Arrangement**:
   - According to <key_fact1>Block C is below A</key_fact1> and <key_fact2>Block A is above B</key_fact2>, the order from top to bottom is: Block A, Block B, Block C.

2. **Contents of Block A**:
   - <key_fact3>Block A contains one medium blue square</key_fact3>.

3. **Contents of Block B**:
   - <key_fact4>Block B has two medium yellow squares</key_fact4>.
   - <key_fact5>A medium black square is also in this block</key_fact5>.
   - <key_fact6>This shape is below medium yellow square number two</key_fact6>.
   - <key_fact7>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</key_fact7>.
   - <key_fact8>It is below medium yellow square number two and the medium black square</key_fact8>.

4. **Contents of Block C**:
   - Block C has a medium black square.

Now, let's determine which object is below the blue square in Block A:

- Since Block A is above Block B, the entire Block B is below the blue square in Block A.
- Within Block B, <key_fact6>the shape is below medium yellow square number two</key_fact6> and <key_fact8>it is below medium yellow square number two and the medium black square</key_fact8>.
- <key_fact7>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</key_fact7>, meaning it is at the bottom of Block B.

Therefore, the shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block B is below the blue square in Block A, while medium yellow square number two is not directly below the blue square in Block A.

Thus, the object that is below a blue thing is the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

The answer is {1}."
