Therefore, the medium blue circle in Block A cannot have the medium yellow triangle from Block C directly to its right. The big black square is in Block B, which is to the right of Block A, so it is possible for the big black square to be to the right of the medium blue circle.

Thus, the answer is that the big black square is to the right of the medium blue circle.

   - <fact5> states that Block C has one medium blue square, one medium black square, and one medium yellow square.
   - <fact6> indicates that the medium blue square is below the medium black square and the medium yellow square, meaning the medium yellow square is not at the bottom of Block C.
   - <fact7> states that below the medium yellow square is the medium black square, confirming the medium yellow square is above the medium black square in Block C.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of a medium yellow square. The question asks us to compare the medium yellow square in Block C and the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

- The medium yellow square in Block C is not touching the bottom edge of Block C.
- The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block is the one in Block A (medium yellow square number one).

Since the question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, and we have no information about the relative horizontal positions of the blocks or squares, we cannot definitively say that any object is to the left of either medium yellow square based on the given facts.

Therefore, the correct answer is that none of them have an object to the left based on the provided information.

- The medium blue square is below a medium black square. We need to determine which block this configuration is in.

- Block C has a medium black square with a medium yellow square below it, so the medium blue square cannot be in Block C.

- Block A has a medium black square, but there is no information about a medium blue square being below it.

- Block B has a medium black square, and since Block C is to the left of Block B, the medium blue square could be below the medium black square in Block B.

Now, let's address the questions:

- **Which object is above a medium blue square?**
  - In Block A, the medium blue squares are above the medium black square. Therefore, the medium black square is below the medium blue squares.
  - Since Block A is at the bottom, there is no block or object below it. Therefore, nothing is above the medium blue squares in Block A.

- **The thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block:**
  - Block A is the bottommost block, so it is touching the surface or ground. The medium black square in Block A is at the bottom of Block A, touching the bottom edge of Block A.

- **Medium black square number two:**
  - In Block C, medium black square number two is above medium black square number one. Therefore, medium black square number two is not touching the bottom edge of Block C.

Based on the analysis, the medium black square in Block A is touching the bottom edge of Block A, and medium black square number two in Block C is not touching the bottom edge of Block C. Therefore, the correct answer is that the thing touching the bottom edge of a block is the medium black square in Block A.

3: none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the arrangement of the squares in Block B, as Block A's configuration is not directly relevant to the question.

1. **Block B Configuration:**
   - According to <fact1>, Block B contains one medium yellow square, one medium black square, and one medium blue square.
   - According to <fact2>, the medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
   - According to <fact3>, the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square and the medium black square.

2. **Arrangement in Block B:**
   - The medium yellow square is at the bottom.
   - Above the medium yellow square, there are the medium blue square and the medium black square.
   - The problem states: ""Below the medium blue square is the medium black square.""

3. **Vertical Arrangement:**
   - From the bottom to the top in Block B:
     - Bottom: Medium yellow square
     - Middle: Medium black square
     - Top: Medium blue square

4. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks what is to the right of the yellow object.
   - Since the yellow square is at the bottom, the objects directly above it are the medium black square and the medium blue square.
   - However, the question is about the horizontal arrangement, not the vertical one.
   - Given the vertical stack, the medium yellow square is at the bottom, and the medium black square is directly above it, followed by the medium blue square at the top.

5. **Horizontal Arrangement:**
   - The problem does not specify any horizontal arrangement within Block B, so we assume the squares are stacked vertically.
   - Therefore, horizontally, there is nothing directly to the right of the yellow square within Block B.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the question is about what is to the right of the yellow object and there is no horizontal arrangement specified, the answer is that there is nothing to the right of the yellow square.

1. **Block C Analysis:**
   - Block C contains a big blue triangle, a medium black square, and a small black triangle.
   - According to <fact2>, the medium black square is touching the bottom edge of block C.
   - According to <fact3>, the medium black square is to the right of and below the small black triangle.
   - The big blue triangle is to the right of the small black triangle and is above the black shape (medium black square) which is to the right of the small black triangle.

2. **Position of the Small Black Triangle:**
   - The small black triangle is to the left of both the medium black square and the big blue triangle.
   - The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of block C and is to the right of the small black triangle.

3. **Question Analysis:**
   - The question asks what is to the right of the small black triangle.
   - We know from the analysis that the medium black square is to the right of the small black triangle and is touching the bottom edge of block C.
   - The big blue triangle is also to the right of the small black triangle, but it is not touching the left edge of the block; it is above the medium black square.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The object to the right of the small black triangle is the medium black square, which is touching the bottom edge of block C.
   - The big blue triangle is not touching the left edge of the block, so it does not satisfy the condition of being a triangle touching the left edge of a block.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the object to the right of the small black triangle is an object which is touching the bottom edge of a block.

**Block A:**
1. Block A contains three medium yellow squares.
2. According to <fact1>, medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
3. <fact2> and <fact3> both state that below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two, and below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one. This implies that medium yellow square number three is above both medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one.
4. Since medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge, it must be at the bottom of Block A. Therefore, the order from top to bottom in Block A is: medium yellow square number three, medium yellow square number two, and medium yellow square number one.

**Block B:**
1. Block B has two medium yellow squares.
2. Below both medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one in Block B, there is a medium black square.
3. Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two in Block B.

Now, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block. The object touching the bottom edge of Block A is medium yellow square number one. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, we need to check the position of the squares in Block B.

In Block B, medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two. Therefore, the order from top to bottom in Block B is: medium yellow square number two, medium yellow square number one, and then the medium black square at the bottom.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, the object to the right of medium yellow square number one in Block A (which is touching the bottom edge) is the medium black square in Block B. Neither medium yellow square number two nor medium yellow square number three is directly to the right of the object touching the bottom edge of Block A.

   - Fact 6 states that the small blue triangle is near to, below, and to the right of the medium yellow circle.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of a small triangle. We have two small triangles mentioned:
- The small black triangle in block A.
- The small blue triangle in block C.

Let's consider the small black triangle in block A:
- The medium blue triangle is to the left of the small black triangle (Fact 3).

Now, let's consider the small blue triangle in block C:
- The medium yellow circle is above and to the left of the small blue triangle (Fact 6).

The question asks which object is to the left of a small triangle: the medium yellow circle or the big yellow square.

- The medium yellow circle is to the left of the small blue triangle in block C.
- The big yellow square is not mentioned in relation to any small triangle.

Therefore, the medium yellow circle is to the left of a small triangle (the small blue triangle in block C), while the big yellow square is not mentioned as being to the left of any small triangle.

   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two (from fact4).

3. **Block A**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
   - A medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of Block A and is below medium yellow square number one.

Now, let's determine what is below the black object in Block B:

- Since Block B is above Block C, the contents of Block C are below Block B.
- In Block C, medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block C and is below medium yellow square number two.

Given the options:
- Option 0: Medium yellow square number one.
- Option 1: Medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block.
- Option 2: Both of them.
- Option 3: None of them.

Since medium yellow square number one in Block C is touching the bottom edge of Block C, it satisfies both being medium yellow square number one and touching the bottom edge of a block. Therefore, the correct answer is that both conditions are satisfied.

1. **Fact 1**: Block A contains one big blue circle and a small yellow square. The big blue circle is near to and touching the small yellow square.

2. **Fact 2**: Block B contains one big black square.

3. **Fact 3**: Block C is below Block B.

4. **Fact 4**: Block C is also below Block A.

From these facts, we can deduce the following:

- Block B is above Block C, as stated in Fact 3.
- Block A is also above Block C, as stated in Fact 4.
- Therefore, both Block A and Block B are above Block C.

Now, let's consider the objects:

- The big black square is in Block B.
- The big blue circle and the small yellow square are in Block A.

Since Block C is below both Block A and Block B, any object in Block C would be below the big black square in Block B.

Block C contains two medium blue squares and one small blue square. These are the only objects that are below the big black square in Block B.

The big blue circle and the small yellow square are in Block A, which is above Block C. Therefore, neither the big blue circle nor the small yellow square is below the big black square in Block B.

Thus, the answer is that none of the objects (the blue circle or the yellow object) are below a black thing.

- **Block B**: 
  - Medium yellow square is at the top.
  - Below the medium yellow square is medium blue square number two.
  - Medium blue square number one is below both the medium yellow square and medium blue square number two.

- **Block C**: 
  - Medium yellow square number two is at the top.
  - Below medium yellow square number two is medium yellow square number one.
  - Below both medium yellow squares is the medium blue square.

Now, let's address the question: Which object is above a black object?

- The medium blue square which is touching the bottom edge of a block is in Block C, below both medium yellow squares.
- Medium blue square number two is in Block B, below the medium yellow square.

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, and Block C is above Block A, the medium blue square in Block C is above the black square in Block A. Medium blue square number two in Block B is not above the black square in Block A.

1. **Block A**: Contains one small blue circle. According to fact 2, Block A is below Block B.

2. **Block B**: Contains a small blue triangle, a big blue triangle, and a big blue circle. The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B and is far from the big blue circle. The small blue triangle is below the big blue triangle and is to the right of and above the big blue circle.

3. **Block C**: Contains a medium yellow square, a big black square, a medium blue triangle, and a medium black square. Block C is above Block A (from fact 1).

Now, let's determine the relative positions of the objects in Block B:

- The big blue triangle is at the right edge of Block B.
- The small blue triangle is below the big blue triangle and above the big blue circle.

Since Block A is below Block B, the small blue circle in Block A is below all the objects in Block B. Therefore, both the big blue triangle and the small blue triangle in Block B are above the small blue circle in Block A.

Thus, the answer is that both the big blue triangle and the small blue triangle are above the small blue circle.

3. **Block C**: 
   - Contains a medium yellow triangle.

4. **Fact 3**: 
   - Above and near to a medium black square, there is a medium yellow triangle.

Now, let's determine the position of the medium yellow triangle in relation to the medium black square:

- According to Fact 3, the medium yellow triangle is above and near the medium black square. 
- From Fact 1, we know the medium black square is in Block A.
- From Fact 2, we know the medium yellow triangle is in Block C.
- Therefore, Block C must be above Block A, and the medium yellow triangle in Block C is above the medium black square in Block A.

Now, let's address the question: ""Which object is above a medium black square? the small shape or the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block?""

- The small shape (small black circle) is in Block A, and it is not above the medium black square; it is to the left of it.
- The object touching the bottom edge of a block is the medium black triangle in Block B. Block B is above Block A, but the medium black triangle is at the bottom of Block B, not directly above the medium black square in Block A.

Therefore, neither the small shape nor the object touching the bottom edge of a block is directly above the medium black square. The object directly above the medium black square is the medium yellow triangle in Block C.

- Medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one.
- Medium yellow square number one is below both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two.
- Medium yellow square number two is also below both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two.

Since both medium yellow squares are below the medium blue squares, we need to determine which medium blue square is to the left of a medium yellow square.

Given that medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one, and both medium yellow squares are below these blue squares, the arrangement suggests that medium blue square number one is directly above medium yellow square number one, and medium blue square number two is directly above medium yellow square number two.

Therefore, neither medium blue square number one nor medium blue square number two is to the left of a medium yellow square. They are directly above the medium yellow squares.

2: both of them
3: none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given facts and the arrangement of the blocks and squares:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains a medium yellow square (Fact 1).
   - A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square (Fact 2).

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains a medium blue square.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains a medium blue square and a medium yellow square (Fact 3).
   - The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square (Fact 4).

4. **Positioning of Blocks**:
   - Block C is to the left of Block A (Fact 5).

Now, let's determine the position of the medium blue squares and the medium yellow squares:

- In **Block A**, the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block A is above the medium blue square in Block A.

- In **Block C**, the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block C is above the medium blue square in Block C.

- Block C is to the left of Block A, so the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of the medium blue square in Block A.

The question asks which object is to the right of a medium blue square. We need to consider the medium blue squares in both Block A and Block C:

- The medium blue square in **Block A**: The medium yellow square in Block A is above it, not to the right. There is no information about any object to the right of this medium blue square.

- The medium blue square in **Block C**: Since Block C is to the left of Block A, the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of the medium blue square in Block A. There is no information about any object to the right of the medium blue square in Block C.

Based on the given information, neither the medium yellow square in Block C nor the medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of a medium blue square. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. **Fact 1**: Near to and to the left of a medium blue triangle, there is a big blue circle. This fact does not directly mention the small black squares, so it doesn't help us determine their relative positions.

2. **Fact 2**: Below, far from, and to the left of small black square number two is a medium blue circle. This indicates that the medium blue circle is positioned to the left of small black square number two.

3. **Fact 3**: The medium blue circle is touching the left edge of this block. This reinforces that the medium blue circle is indeed on the far left side of the block.

Additionally, it is mentioned that near to a big yellow triangle is the medium blue triangle. However, this does not provide information about the position of the medium blue triangle relative to the small black squares.

From the analysis of the facts, we can conclude:

- The medium blue circle is to the left of small black square number two, as stated in Fact 2.
- There is no information indicating that the medium blue triangle is to the left of any small black square.

Therefore, the object to the left of a small black square is the medium blue circle that is touching the left edge of the block.

5. **Fact 5**: The medium yellow square is below a medium black square.
6. **Fact 6**: The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square and the medium black square.

From these facts, we can deduce the following:

- Block A has a medium blue square.
- Block C has a medium blue square and a medium yellow square. The blue square is at the bottom of Block C, and the yellow square is above it.
- There is no mention of a medium yellow square in Block B in the given facts. Therefore, we cannot assume there is a medium yellow square in Block B.

Now, let's address the question: Which object is to the left of a medium blue square?

- The medium blue square in Block A is not mentioned to have any other squares in Block A, so there is no medium yellow square to its left.
- In Block C, the medium blue square is at the bottom, and the medium yellow square is above it. There is no information about the horizontal arrangement of these squares, so we cannot definitively say that the medium yellow square is to the left of the medium blue square.

Since there is no medium yellow square in Block B and we cannot confirm the horizontal position of the medium yellow square in Block C relative to the medium blue square, the answer is that none of the medium yellow squares are to the left of a medium blue square.

1. **Block B is below C**: This means Block C is on top, and Block B is directly below it.

2. **Block A is above B**: This means Block A is on top of Block B.

3. **Block A contains one medium black square**: This square is inside Block A.

4. **A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block A**: This square is below the medium black square in Block A.

5. **Block B has one medium blue square**: This square is inside Block B.

6. **Block C contains one medium blue square and one medium yellow square**: The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square in Block C.

Now, let's determine which object is above a medium blue square:

- In **Block B**, there is a medium blue square. Since Block A is above Block B, the medium black square in Block A is above the medium blue square in Block B. The medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of Block A is also above the medium blue square in Block B.

- In **Block C**, the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square. There is no mention of any object above the medium blue square in Block C.

1. **Fact 1**: Block B is to the right of blocks A and C. This means Block A and Block C are to the left of Block B.

2. **Fact 2**: Block A has two medium yellow squares. This fact doesn't directly help us with the position of the blue squares, but it tells us about the contents of Block A.

3. **Fact 3**: Below a medium blue square, there is medium yellow square number two. This suggests that one of the blue squares is above a yellow square, but it doesn't specify which block this is in.

4. **Fact 4**: Block B contains one medium blue square and one medium black square. The medium blue square is below the medium black square. This tells us the position of the blue square in Block B.

5. **Fact 5**: Block C contains two medium blue squares. This is important because it tells us that Block C has more than one blue square.

6. **Fact 6**: Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block. It is below medium blue square number two. This fact is about Block C, as it contains two blue squares. Medium blue square number one is at the bottom, and medium blue square number two is above it.

Now, let's determine which object is to the left of a medium blue square:

- **Medium blue square number two** is in Block C, above medium blue square number one.
- **The medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block** is medium blue square number one in Block C.

Since Block B is to the right of both Block A and Block C, any object in Block A or Block C is to the left of the medium blue square in Block B. However, the question asks about the relative position of objects to the left of a medium blue square, specifically between medium blue square number two and the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of a block.

- Medium blue square number two is in Block C, and there is no indication of any object to its left within Block C.
- The medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium blue square number one) is also in Block C, and similarly, there is no indication of any object to its left within Block C.

Therefore, neither medium blue square number two nor the medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block has an object to its left within their respective blocks.
