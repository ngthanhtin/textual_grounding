--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a small black circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in block C, as this is where the small black circles are located.

1. We know from <FACT1>block C</FACT1> that it contains the objects we are interested in.
2. <FACT2>Block C contains two small black circles</FACT2>.
3. <FACT3>The medium black square is below and to the right of small black circle number two</FACT3>.

Now, let's consider the positions of the small blue circle and the medium blue triangle:

- The small blue circle is located in block B, which is above block A. There is no indication that it is in block C, where the small black circles are located.
- The medium blue triangle is also in block B, as it is mentioned in the context of block B's contents.

Since both the small blue circle and the medium blue triangle are in block B, and the small black circles are in block C, neither the small blue circle nor the medium blue triangle is to the left of a small black circle in block C.

Therefore, the answer is {3: none of them}."

To determine what is to the right of the medium blue circle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Block A Configuration**:
   - <FACT2>Block A contains a big blue circle, a medium blue circle, and one big yellow triangle</FACT2>.
   - The big blue circle is to the left of the big black triangle.
   - <FACT3>The medium blue circle is below a medium blue triangle and the big black triangle</FACT3>.

2. **Block B Configuration**:

   - Block B contains a small blue square, one big black square, and a medium blue triangle.
   - The small blue square is to the right of the medium blue triangle and the big black square.

3. **Block C Configuration**:
   - Block C contains a medium yellow triangle.

Now, let's determine the position of the medium blue circle in Block A:
- The medium blue circle is below the medium blue triangle and the big black triangle in Block A. This suggests that the medium blue circle is positioned under these shapes within Block A.

Next, we need to determine what is to the right of the medium blue circle:
- Since <FACT1>Block B is to the right of A</FACT1>, any elements in Block B would be to the right of elements in Block A.
- Block B contains a big black square, which is to the left of the small blue square. Therefore, the big black square is positioned in Block B, which is to the right of Block A.

- Block C, which contains a medium yellow triangle, is not specified to be to the right of Block A or B, so we cannot assume its position relative to the medium blue circle in Block A.

Therefore, the big black square in Block B is to the right of the medium blue circle in Block A. The medium yellow triangle in Block C is not specified to be to the right of the medium blue circle.

To determine what is below the black shape, let's analyze the given facts step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. 
2. <FACT1>Block C is above block A and to the left of block B</FACT1>. This means Block C is positioned such that it is not directly above Block B, but rather to the left of it.
3. <FACT2>Block C has a medium black square</FACT2>. This black square is within Block C.
4. <FACT3>The medium black square is below a medium yellow square</FACT3>. This indicates that within Block C, there is a medium yellow square above the medium black square.

- 0: A thing which is touching the bottom edge of a block
- 1: A medium yellow square that is in block B
- 2: Both of them
- 3: None of them

Since the black square is in Block C, and Block C is above Block A and to the left of Block B, the black square cannot be directly above anything in Block B. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block B cannot be below the black square in Block C.

Additionally, since Block C is above Block A, the black square in Block C is not touching the bottom edge of Block C. Therefore, there is nothing below the black square that touches the bottom edge of a block.

Thus, the correct answer is that there is {3: none of them} below the black shape."

2. **Block B**: 
   - According to <FACT2>, block B contains two medium blue squares.
   - <FACT3> states that medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B.
   - <FACT4> indicates that below a medium black square, there is medium blue square number two. This implies that the medium black square is above medium blue square number two.
   - <FACT5> tells us that medium blue square number one is below both medium blue square number two and the medium black square. This means the order from top to bottom in block B is: medium black square, medium blue square number two, and medium blue square number one.

3. **Block C**: 
   - Block C contains one medium blue square, but its position is not relevant to the question about the medium black squares.

Now, we need to determine which medium black square is to the left of a medium blue square:

- The medium black square in block A is not directly related to any medium blue square in block A, as there are no medium blue squares in block A.
- In block B, the medium black square is above medium blue square number two and not to the left of it.

Since the medium black square in block A is not to the left of any medium blue square, and the medium black square in block B is above, not to the left of, medium blue square number two, neither of the medium black squares is to the left of a medium blue square.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is above a yellow square, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks using the given facts.

1. **Block B Analysis:**
   - Block B contains two medium yellow squares.
   - <FACT1>Medium yellow square number two is above a big blue triangle</FACT1>.
   - The big blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
   - <FACT2>The big blue square is above and to the right of the big blue triangle</FACT2>.

From these facts, we can deduce:
- The big blue triangle is at the bottom of Block B, and medium yellow square number two is above it.
- The big blue square is above the big blue triangle, and since it is also above and to the right, it is positioned higher than the big blue triangle.

2. **Position Relative to Yellow Squares:**
   - The big blue triangle is at the bottom of Block B, and medium yellow square number two is above it, so the big blue triangle is not above any yellow square.
   - The big blue square is above the big blue triangle and is positioned above medium yellow square number two, which means it is above a yellow square.

Therefore, the object that is above a yellow square is the big blue square. The triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block (the big blue triangle) is not above a yellow square.

   - <FACT2>The medium blue triangle is touching the right edge of this block</FACT2>.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <FACT3>Block C contains a small blue circle</FACT3>.

Since the medium blue triangle in Block B is touching the right edge of Block B, it is positioned at the far right of Block B. Block C is to the right of Block B, so the small blue circle in Block C is to the right of the medium blue triangle in Block B.

The small blue circle in Block A is not to the right of the medium blue triangle in Block B because Block A is to the left of Block B.

Therefore, the object to the right of the medium blue triangle is the small blue circle in Block C.

   - <fact2>The medium black triangle is to the right of a small yellow square</fact2>.
   - The big black square is to the left of and below the small yellow square.
   - The big black square is to the left of the big yellow circle.
   - The medium black triangle is above the big yellow circle.

   From this, we can deduce:
   - The small yellow square is to the left of the medium black triangle.
   - The big black square is to the left of the big yellow circle.

2. **Block B Analysis:**
   - <fact3>Block B contains a medium blue circle and one medium yellow square</fact3>.
   - <fact4>To the right of and below the medium yellow square there is the medium blue circle</fact4>.

To determine what is to the right of the circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks based on the given facts.

1. We know from <FACT1> that Block B contains a medium blue circle. Since Block C is to the right of Block B, any objects in Block C would be to the right of the circle.

2. According to <FACT2>, Block C contains a medium black square, a small black triangle, and a medium yellow triangle.

3. <FACT3> states that the medium black square is below and to the left of the small black triangle, which is near to the medium yellow triangle. This implies that the small black triangle and the medium yellow triangle are positioned close to each other in Block C.

Since both the small black triangle and the medium yellow triangle are in Block C, which is to the right of Block B (where the circle is located), both of these triangles are to the right of the circle.

Therefore, the answer is {2}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is below a small yellow shape, let's analyze the given facts step by step:

1. <FACT1>Block A has one small blue triangle and a small yellow square</FACT1>. This tells us that Block A contains these two shapes.

2. <FACT2>To the right of the small yellow square there is the small blue triangle</FACT2>. This indicates the relative position of the small blue triangle to the small yellow square within Block A.

3. <FACT3>Block B is below A</FACT3>. This means that Block B is positioned directly beneath Block A.

4. <FACT4>Block C has a big black circle</FACT4>. This tells us that Block C contains a big black circle.

5. <FACT5>Above the big black circle is the small yellow triangle</FACT5>. This indicates that the small yellow triangle is positioned above the big black circle within Block C.

Now, let's determine which object is below a small yellow shape:

- The small yellow square is in Block A, and Block B is below Block A. However, we do not have information about what is in Block B, so we cannot determine if anything specific is below the small yellow square.

- The small yellow triangle is above the big black circle in Block C, as per <FACT5>.

Given the information, the only object we know for certain is below a small yellow shape is the big black circle, which is below the small yellow triangle in Block C.

Therefore, the answer is {0}, as the small yellow triangle is the object below a small yellow shape."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium black square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in each block based on the given facts.

1. **Block A**:
   - <FACT1>Block A has two medium black squares</FACT1>.
   - <FACT2>Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and a medium blue square</FACT2>.
   - <FACT3>The medium blue square is below medium black square number two</FACT3>.

   From these facts, we can deduce that in Block A, the medium blue square is above medium black square number one and below medium black square number two. Therefore, the medium blue square in Block A is vertically aligned with the black squares and not to the left of any black square.

2. **Block C**:
   - <FACT4>Block C contains one medium blue square and a medium black square</FACT4>.
   - <FACT5>Below the medium black square is the medium blue square</FACT5>.

   In Block C, the medium blue square is below the medium black square, indicating a vertical alignment. Since Block B is to the right of Block C, the medium blue square in Block C is not to the left of the medium black square in Block C.

Considering the spatial arrangement of the blocks:
- Block B is to the right of Block C and below Block A. This means that the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of the medium black square in Block B.

Therefore, the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of a medium black square (the one in Block B), while the medium blue square in Block A is not to the left of any medium black square.

The answer is {1}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is below a medium black square, let's analyze the given facts step by step:

1. <FACT1>One medium black square is in block A</FACT1>. This means there is a medium black square in block A, but we don't have information about any yellow squares in block A.

2. <FACT2>Block C is below block A and above block B</FACT2>. This indicates the order of the blocks from top to bottom is A, C, B.

3. <FACT3>Block C has one medium black square</FACT3>. This tells us there is a medium black square in block C.

4. <FACT4>The medium black square is below a medium yellow square</FACT4>. This means in block C, the medium black square is positioned below a medium yellow square.

5. <FACT5>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B</FACT5>. This implies that medium yellow square number one is at the very bottom of block B, and it is below medium yellow square number two.

Now, let's determine the positions:

- In block C, the medium black square is below a medium yellow square, as per <FACT4>. Therefore, the medium yellow square in block C is above the medium black square in block C.

- In block B, medium yellow square number one is at the bottom, and medium yellow square number two is above it, as per <FACT5>.

Since the medium yellow square in block C is above the medium black square in block C, it is not below a medium black square. However, medium yellow square number two in block B is not below any medium black square either, as block B is below block C, and there is no black square in block B.

Therefore, neither medium yellow square number two nor the medium yellow square in block C is below a medium black square.

The answer is {3}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is above the medium yellow triangle, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and the shapes within them.

1. **Block Arrangement**: 
   - According to <FACT1>Block B is above block A</FACT1> and below block C. This means Block A is at the bottom, Block B is in the middle, and Block C is at the top.

2. **Contents of Block A**:
   - <FACT2>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle</FACT2>, one medium black square, and a medium black circle. The medium yellow triangle is touching the right edge of this block and is below the medium black circle. This shape is below and to the right of the medium black square.

3. **Contents of Block B**:
   - <FACT3>Block B has a big blue triangle, one medium blue square, and one small black square. One small yellow triangle is also touching the right edge of this block. It is touching and above the medium blue square. The big blue triangle is to the left of the triangle which is touching the medium blue square. It is far from and above the medium blue square.

4. **Contents of Block C**:
   - Block C contains a big blue square. To the right of a small black square, there is a medium blue circle. Near to and below the small black square, there is the big blue square. This shape is above the circle which is to the right of the small black square.

Now, let's determine what is directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A:

- Since Block B is directly above Block A, we need to consider the shapes in Block B.
- In Block B, the small yellow triangle is touching the right edge and is above the medium blue square. The big blue triangle is to the left of the small yellow triangle and far from the medium blue square.
- None of these shapes in Block B are directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A.

Next, consider Block C, which is above Block B:

- Block C contains a big blue square and a medium blue circle. The big blue square is near to and below the small black square, and the medium blue circle is to the right of the small black square.
- The big blue square is above the medium blue circle.

Since Block C is above Block B, and Block B is above Block A, the shapes in Block C are above the shapes in Block A. However, the specific question asks what is directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A.

- The big blue square in Block C is above the medium blue circle, but neither is directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A due to the arrangement of blocks and shapes.

- Block C is to the left of Block A (<FACT5>).
- Block B is above Block C (<FACT6>).

Since Block C is to the left of Block A, the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of the medium blue square in Block C.

The medium yellow square in Block B is not directly related to any medium blue square in terms of horizontal positioning, as the facts only describe vertical arrangements within Block B.

Thus, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of a medium blue square (specifically, the one in Block C).

To determine which object is to the right of a medium thing, let's analyze the given facts:

1. <FACT1>Block B has one medium blue triangle</FACT1>.
2. <FACT2>Block B also contains one small yellow square</FACT2>. The medium blue triangle is near to and below the small yellow square.
3. <FACT3>Block C contains one small black square</FACT3>.

- Since the medium blue triangle is in Block B, we need to determine if either the small yellow square or the small black square is to the right of this medium blue triangle.
- The small yellow square is in the same block (Block B) as the medium blue triangle, and it is mentioned that the triangle is near to and below the small yellow square. This implies that the small yellow square is above the medium blue triangle, not necessarily to the right.
- The small black square is in Block C, which is to the right of Block B. Therefore, the small black square is to the right of the medium blue triangle in Block B.

Thus, the object to the right of a medium thing (the medium blue triangle) is the small black square in Block C.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the yellow object, we need to analyze the arrangement of the objects in Block B.

1. According to <FACT1>, Block B contains one medium yellow square, a medium black square, and one medium blue square.

2. <FACT2> states that the medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block B. This means the yellow square is at the bottom of the block.

3. <FACT3> indicates that the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square and the medium black square. This means the blue and black squares are positioned above the yellow square.

Given this arrangement, the yellow square is at the bottom, and the blue and black squares are above it. Since Block A is to the right of Block B, and Block A contains only black squares, the only objects that can be directly to the right of the yellow square in Block B are the black squares from Block A.

Therefore, to the right of the yellow object, there is a medium black square from Block A. There is no blue shape directly to the right of the yellow square because the blue shape is above the yellow square in Block B.

To solve this problem, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

Let's analyze Block A first:

- Block A contains three medium yellow squares.
- <FACT1>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</FACT1>.
- <FACT2>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two</FACT2>.
- <FACT3>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one</FACT3>.

From these facts, we can deduce the following arrangement for Block A:
- Medium yellow square number three is at the top.
- Medium yellow square number two is below medium yellow square number three.
- Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two and is touching the bottom edge of Block A.

Now, let's analyze Block B:

- Block B has two medium yellow squares.
- Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one there is a medium black square.
- Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

From these facts, we can deduce the following arrangement for Block B:
- Medium yellow square number two is at the top.
- Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
- A medium black square is below both medium yellow squares.

Now, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block. The object touching the bottom edge of Block A is medium yellow square number one. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, the right of medium yellow square number one in Block A would be the left side of Block B.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a yellow triangle, let's analyze the given facts step by step:

1. We have two blocks, A and B, and <FACT1>Block A is to the right of B</FACT1>. This means that all objects in Block B are to the left of all objects in Block A.

2. <FACT2>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle, a big yellow triangle, and one medium yellow square</FACT2>. 

3. <FACT3>The medium yellow triangle is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square</FACT3>. This means within Block A, the order from left to right is: big yellow triangle, medium yellow square, and then the medium yellow triangle.

4. <FACT4>Block B has a medium yellow circle and a medium yellow square</FACT4>. 

5. <FACT5>This block also has a small blue triangle</FACT5>. 

6. <FACT6>The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block</FACT6>. This indicates the position of the small blue triangle within Block B, but it doesn't affect its horizontal position relative to the yellow triangles in Block A.

Now, considering the relative positions:

- The medium yellow triangle in Block A is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, within Block A, the medium yellow triangle is not to the left of any yellow triangle.

- Since <FACT1>Block A is to the right of B</FACT1>, all objects in Block B, including the small blue triangle, are to the left of all objects in Block A, including the yellow triangles.

Therefore, the small blue triangle in Block B is to the left of the yellow triangles in Block A.

Thus, the object to the left of a yellow triangle is the small blue object which is touching the bottom edge of a block. The answer is {1}."

To determine which object is above a medium blue square, let's analyze the given facts step by step:

1. We have three blocks: <FACT1>A, B, and C</FACT1>. Block A contains one medium black square, which is not relevant to the question about medium blue squares and medium yellow squares.

2. <FACT2>Block B contains one medium yellow square</FACT2>. This block is separate from block C, which is above it.

3. <FACT3>Block C has two medium blue squares</FACT3>. This is important because we need to determine the position of these blue squares relative to the yellow squares.

4. <FACT4>Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of block C</FACT4>. This means it is at the lowest position within block C.

5. <FACT5>Medium blue square number one is below a medium yellow square and medium blue square number two</FACT5>. This indicates that within block C, there is a medium yellow square above medium blue square number one.

6. <FACT6>Below medium blue square number two there is the medium yellow square</FACT6>. This confirms that the medium yellow square in block C is above medium blue square number one.

Now, let's determine which medium yellow square is above a medium blue square:

- The medium yellow square in block C is above medium blue square number one, as established by <FACT5> and <FACT6>.

- The medium yellow square in block B is not mentioned to be above any medium blue square, and since block B is separate from block C, it cannot be above the medium blue squares in block C.

Therefore, the medium yellow square that is in block C is above a medium blue square. The answer is {0}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the small yellow triangle, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and their contents.

1. **Block Arrangement**: 
   - <FACT1>Block A is above blocks B and C</FACT1>. This means Block A is positioned on top of both Block B and Block C.

2. **Contents of Block A**:
   - <FACT2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</FACT2>. This is the triangle in question.

3. **Contents of Block B**:
   - <FACT3>Block B contains one small black square</FACT3>. There is no mention of any circles or triangles in Block B.

4. **Contents of Block C**:
   - <FACT4>Block C has a big yellow triangle</FACT4>, one big yellow circle, and <FACT5>a small black circle</FACT5>.
   - The big yellow circle is touching the bottom edge of Block C, below the small black circle.
   - The big yellow triangle is below the medium blue square and to the left of and near the small black circle.

Since Block A is above both Block B and Block C, the small yellow triangle in Block A is positioned above the contents of both Block B and Block C. 

- In Block C, the small black circle is above the big yellow circle and near the big yellow triangle. However, since Block A is above Block C, the small yellow triangle in Block A is above the small black circle in Block C.

Therefore, the small yellow triangle in Block A is above the small black circle in Block C, making the small black circle the object directly below the small yellow triangle.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the spatial arrangement of the objects in block B, as described in the facts.

1. We know that <FACT1>block B</FACT1> contains a <FACT2>big blue triangle</FACT2> that is touching the right edge of the block. This means the big blue triangle is positioned on the right side of block B.

2. The block also contains a <FACT3>medium blue circle</FACT3>. According to <FACT4>, this medium blue circle is ""far from, below and to the left of the big blue triangle."" This indicates that the medium blue circle is positioned towards the bottom left of block B, away from the big blue triangle.

3. The question asks what is far from the big thing (the big blue triangle). We have two options to consider:
   - An object that is touching the bottom edge of a block that is in block B.
   - A medium blue circle which is touching the bottom edge of a block that is in block B.

4. Since the medium blue circle is described as being ""far from, below and to the left of the big blue triangle,"" it fits the description of being far from the big blue triangle. It is also likely touching the bottom edge of block B, given its position.

5. There is no mention of any other object touching the bottom edge of block B in the provided facts, so the medium blue circle is the only object that fits the description of being far from the big blue triangle and potentially touching the bottom edge.

4. According to <FACT4>, medium blue square number one is to the right of medium blue square number two. 

5. <FACT5> states that medium blue square number two is to the left of a small black square. 

6. <FACT6> indicates that the small black square is touching the right edge of Block B. 

7. Block C has one small yellow circle.

Now, let's determine what is to the right of the small black circle in Block A:

- Since Block A is to the left of Block C, and Block B is to the right of Block C, the small black circle in Block A is to the left of both Block C and Block B.

- The small yellow circle is in Block C, which is directly to the right of Block A.

- The medium blue square that is touching the right edge of a block is in Block B, which is further to the right of Block C.

Therefore, directly to the right of the small black circle in Block A is the small yellow circle in Block C. The medium blue square that is touching the right edge of Block B is not directly to the right of the small black circle in Block A.

- Block B is on top, containing a black square above a yellow square.
- Block A is below Block B and contains one medium black square.
- Block C is below Block A and contains two medium black squares and one medium blue square.

Since Block B is on top and the yellow square is below the black square in Block B, the yellow square is directly above Block A. Block A only contains a medium black square, and Block C is below Block A.

Therefore, directly below the yellow square in Block B is the medium black square in Block A. There is no medium blue square directly below the yellow square because the blue square is in Block C, which is below Block A.

To determine which object is to the left of a medium black square, let's analyze the given facts:

1. We have two blocks, A and B, with Block A to the left of Block B.
2. Block A contains two medium yellow squares and a medium blue square.
3. <FACT1>A medium black square is below medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two</FACT1>.
4. <FACT2>Below medium yellow square number two there is medium yellow square number one</FACT2>.
5. Below the medium black square and medium yellow square number two is the medium blue square.

From <FACT1>, we know that the medium black square is positioned below both medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two. This suggests that the medium black square is vertically aligned with both yellow squares.

From <FACT2>, we understand that medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two. This implies a vertical arrangement where medium yellow square number two is on top, followed by medium yellow square number one, and then the medium black square.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and the medium black square in Block A is below both medium yellow squares, it is not possible for either medium yellow square to be to the left of the medium black square within Block A. Therefore, neither medium yellow square number one nor medium yellow square number two is to the left of the medium black square.

- Block C is to the left of Block B, and it contains a medium black square. However, the question asks about objects within the same block, so we focus on Block A and Block B.

Based on the above reasoning, the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium blue square number one) is to the left of a medium black square in Block B. Therefore, the answer is:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a big black circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks based on the given facts.

1. <FACT1>Block B contains one big black circle</FACT1>. This means the big black circle is in Block B.

2. <FACT2>Block C has one big black square</FACT2> and <FACT3>this block also contains one small black circle</FACT3>. Therefore, Block C contains both a big black square and a small black circle.

3. <FACT4>Far from and to the left of the small black circle is the big black square</FACT4>. This indicates that within Block C, the big black square is positioned to the left of the small black circle.

4. <FACT5>Block A contains a big yellow circle and one small blue square</FACT5>. This means Block A has no black circles or squares.

5. <FACT6>The big yellow circle is to the right of the small blue square</FACT6>. This provides the relative positions of the objects within Block A, but does not affect the position of the big black circle in Block B.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of the big black circle in Block B:

- The small black circle is in Block C, not Block B, so it cannot be to the left of the big black circle in Block B.
- The blue object (small blue square) is in Block A, which is separate from Block B, so it also cannot be to the left of the big black circle in Block B.

Therefore, neither the small black circle nor the blue object is to the left of the big black circle in Block B.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is above a medium yellow square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in the blocks based on the given facts.

1. We know that <FACT1>Block A is to the left of B</FACT1> and <FACT2>Block B is below C</FACT2>. This gives us a spatial arrangement where Block C is on top, Block B is below Block C, and Block A is to the left of Block B.

2. <FACT3>Block A has one medium yellow square</FACT3>. This square is not specified to be above or below any other square, so we need to consider its position relative to the other blocks.

3. <FACT4>Block C has two medium yellow squares and two other medium black squares</FACT4>. This means Block C contains four squares in total.

4. <FACT5>Below medium black square number two, medium yellow square number two and medium black square number one is medium yellow square number one</FACT5>. This indicates a vertical arrangement within Block C where medium yellow square number one is at the bottom.

5. <FACT6>Below medium black square number two there is medium yellow square number two</FACT6>. This further clarifies that medium yellow square number two is below medium black square number two in Block C.

From these facts, we can deduce the following:

- In Block C, medium yellow square number two is below medium black square number two, and medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two. Therefore, medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.

- The medium yellow square in Block A is not specified to be above or below any other square, and since Block A is to the left of Block B, it does not have any vertical relationship with the squares in Block C.

Therefore, the only square that is above another medium yellow square is medium yellow square number two in Block C, which is above medium yellow square number one.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium blue square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in the blocks based on the given facts.

1. <FACT1>Block A contains one medium blue square</FACT1>. This means there is a medium blue square in Block A.

2. <FACT2>Block B is above block A</FACT2>. This indicates that Block B is positioned above Block A, but it does not specify the contents of Block B.

3. <FACT3>Block C with one medium blue square and one medium yellow square in it</FACT3>. This tells us that Block C contains both a medium blue square and a medium yellow square.

4. <FACT4>The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block</FACT4>. This implies that the medium blue square in Block C is at the bottom of Block C.

5. <FACT5>The medium yellow square is below a medium black square</FACT5>. This suggests that there is a medium black square above the medium yellow square, but it does not specify which block this arrangement is in.

6. <FACT6>The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square and the medium black square</FACT6>. This indicates that the medium blue square is positioned below both the medium yellow square and the medium black square.

Now, let's consider the possible arrangements:

- In Block A, there is only a medium blue square, so there is no medium yellow square to the left of it.

- In Block C, the medium blue square is at the bottom, and there is a medium yellow square in the same block. However, the facts do not specify the horizontal arrangement of the squares, only the vertical arrangement. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of the medium blue square.

- There is no information about a medium yellow square in Block B, so we cannot conclude that there is a medium yellow square to the left of a medium blue square in Block B.

Based on the information provided, we cannot determine that any medium yellow square is to the left of a medium blue square. Therefore, the answer is {3: none of them}."

To determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square, let's analyze the given facts:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. Block A has a medium blue square. Block B, to the left of Block A, has one medium yellow square. Block C, to the right of Block A, contains three medium black squares and one medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of this block.

2. <fact1>Below medium black square number three and medium black square number one there is the medium yellow square</fact1>. This indicates that the medium yellow square is positioned below both medium black square number three and medium black square number one.

3. <fact2>Below medium black square number three there is medium black square number two</fact2>. This means that medium black square number two is directly below medium black square number three.

4. <fact3>Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three</fact3>. This confirms that medium black square number one is positioned below medium black square number three.

5. <fact4>It is below medium black square number two</fact4>. This indicates that medium black square number one is also below medium black square number two.

From these facts, we can deduce the following arrangement in Block C:

- Medium black square number three is at the top.
- Below it is medium black square number two.
- Below medium black square number two is medium black square number one.
- The medium yellow square is at the bottom, below both medium black square number three and medium black square number one.

Given this arrangement, the medium yellow square is directly below medium black square number one and medium black square number three, but not directly below medium black square number two. Therefore, medium black square number two is to the right of the medium yellow square.

Thus, the object to the right of a medium yellow square is medium black square number two. The answer is {0}."

To determine which object is to the right of a medium square, let's analyze the positions of the squares in the blocks:

1. **Block A**: 
   - <FACT1>There is one medium blue square in block A</FACT1>.

2. **Block B**: 
   - <FACT2>To the right of block A there is block B</FACT2>.
   - <FACT3>Block B contains two medium blue squares</FACT3> and one medium yellow square.
   - <FACT4>Medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square</FACT4>.
   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.

3. **Block C**: 
   - To the left of block A, there is block C.
   - Block C contains one medium black square and one medium yellow square.
   - The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block, below the medium yellow square.

Now, let's determine the relative positions:

- The medium blue square in block A is to the left of block B, which contains the medium blue squares number one and two.
- Since block B is to the right of block A, the medium blue square in block A is to the left of both medium blue squares in block B.
- Therefore, the medium blue square in block A is not to the right of any medium square.

- In block B, medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square, and medium blue square number one is at the bottom. Since block B is to the right of block A, the medium blue squares in block B are to the right of the medium blue square in block A.

Thus, neither the medium blue square in block A nor medium blue square number two is to the right of another medium square. Therefore, the answer is {3}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a big blue triangle, let's analyze the given facts:

1. <FACT1>Block B has three big blue triangles</FACT1>. This means there are multiple triangles in Block B, and we need to consider their positions relative to other objects.

2. <FACT2>Big blue triangle number one is above and to the right of a small blue circle</FACT2>. This indicates that the small blue circle is positioned to the left and below big blue triangle number one.

3. The small blue circle is also described as being <FACT3>touching the bottom edge of this block</FACT3>. This means it is at the bottom of Block B.

4. The small blue circle is to the right of and below big blue triangle number three, which is touching the right edge of Block B. This means big blue triangle number three is at the far right of Block B.

Now, let's determine the positions:

- The small blue circle is to the right of big blue triangle number three, which is touching the right edge of Block B. Therefore, the small blue circle is positioned to the right of a big blue triangle.

- Big blue triangle number three, which is touching the right edge of Block B, is not to the right of any other big blue triangle because it is at the far right.

Thus, the object that is to the right of a big blue triangle is the small blue circle, which is touching the bottom edge of Block B.

To determine which object is to the right of a black shape, let's analyze the given facts:

1. <FACT1>Block B contains a big blue triangle and a big blue square</FACT1>. The big blue triangle is near to and to the left of the big blue square.

2. <FACT2>Block C contains a big yellow triangle and one big black circle</FACT2>.

3. <FACT3>To the left of the big black circle is the big yellow triangle</FACT3>.

From these facts, we can deduce the following:

- In Block C, the big yellow triangle is to the left of the big black circle, meaning the big black circle is to the right of the big yellow triangle.

- The question asks which object is to the right of a black shape. The black shape in question is the big black circle in Block C.

- The big blue triangle in Block B is not in Block C, so it cannot be to the right of the big black circle in Block C.

- The big blue triangle that is touching the bottom edge of Block A is also not in Block C, so it cannot be to the right of the big black circle in Block C.

Therefore, neither the big blue triangle in Block B nor the big blue triangle touching the bottom edge of a block is to the right of the black shape (big black circle) in Block C.

This indicates the arrangement within block C: medium blue square number two is at the top, followed by a medium yellow square, and then medium blue square number one at the bottom.

Now, let's determine the position of the medium black squares:
- Block A contains a medium black square.
- Block B also contains a medium black square.

Since block C is above block A, and block A contains a medium black square, we need to determine which medium blue square in block C is directly above the medium black square in block A.

Given the arrangement in block C:
- Medium blue square number two is at the top.
- The medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two.
- Medium blue square number one is below the medium yellow square.

Since block C is directly above block A, the medium blue square number one, being the lowest in block C, is directly above the medium black square in block A.
