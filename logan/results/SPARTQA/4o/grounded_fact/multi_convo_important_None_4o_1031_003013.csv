To determine what is to the right of the small yellow circle, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. 
2. <important1>Block B is to the right of block A</important1>. 
3. <important2>Block B contains a small yellow circle</important2> and one big blue square. 
4. <important3>The small yellow circle is below and to the right of the big blue square</important3>.

Now, let's consider block C:
5. <important4>Block C is to the right of block B</important4>.
6. <important5>Block C contains a small yellow square</important5>.
7. <important6>The small yellow square is below and to the left of a big yellow square</important6>.
8. <important7>The big yellow square is touching the right edge of this block</important7>.

Since block C is to the right of block B, and the small yellow circle is in block B, we need to determine what is to the right of the circle in block B. 

- In block C, the big yellow square is touching the right edge of the block, and the small yellow square is below and to the left of the big yellow square. Therefore, the big yellow square is positioned further to the right than the small yellow square.

Given this arrangement, the big yellow square, which is touching the right edge of block C, is to the right of the small yellow circle in block B.

Thus, the answer is {1}."

To determine what is to the right of the medium black circle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. In block C, there is a <important1>medium black circle</important1>.
2. <important2>To the right of and near to the medium black circle there is the small black triangle</important2>.

From this, we know that immediately to the right of the medium black circle is the small black triangle.

3. The medium black triangle is to the right of the small black triangle.

This means that the medium black triangle is further to the right of the small black triangle, which is already to the right of the medium black circle.

Therefore, the medium black triangle is ultimately to the right of the medium black circle, but not immediately adjacent to it.

The medium yellow square is in block A, which is above block C, and not directly to the right of the medium black circle.

Thus, the answer to what is to the right of the medium black circle is the medium black triangle, but not immediately adjacent to it.

3. <important2>Block C has a medium black square</important2>.
4. <important3>The medium black square is below a medium yellow square</important3>.

From this, we can infer the following:

- Since <important1>Block C is above block A and to the left of block B</important1>, the medium black square in Block C is positioned above Block A and to the left of Block B.
- <important3>The medium black square is below a medium yellow square</important3> in Block C, indicating that the yellow square is directly above the black square within Block C.

- Option 0: A thing which is touching the bottom edge of a block.
- Option 1: A medium yellow square that is in block B.
- Option 2: Both of them.
- Option 3: None of them.

Since the black square is in Block C and is below a yellow square in Block C, it is not directly below any element in Block B. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block B is not below the black shape.

Additionally, since Block C is above Block A and to the left of Block B, the black square in Block C is not touching the bottom edge of any block.

To determine what is below the yellow object, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and squares based on the given information.

1. We know that <important1>block C is above both blocks A and B</important1>. This means that any object in block C is positioned above the objects in blocks A and B.

2. In block C, there is <important2>a medium black square and a medium yellow square</important2>. 

3. The arrangement within block C is such that <important3>below the medium yellow square is the medium black square</important3>. This indicates that the medium black square is directly beneath the medium yellow square within block C.

4. Since block C is above both blocks A and B, the objects in block C do not directly interact with the objects in blocks A and B in terms of vertical positioning. Therefore, the medium yellow square in block C is not directly above any squares in blocks A or B.

5. Given that the medium yellow square is in block C and block C is above both blocks A and B, there is no direct vertical alignment between the medium yellow square and any medium blue squares in blocks A or B.

Therefore, the answer to what is below the yellow object is {3: none of them}."

To determine what is to the right of the circle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. Block C is to the right of Block B, and Block A is above Block C.
2. <important1>Block B contains a medium blue circle</important1>. This means the circle is in Block B.
3. <important2>Block C contains one medium black square, a small black triangle, and one medium yellow triangle</important2>. These shapes are in Block C, which is to the right of Block B.
4. <important3>The medium black square is below and to the left of the small black triangle, which is near to the medium yellow triangle</important3>. This describes the relative positions of the shapes within Block C.

Since Block C is to the right of Block B, all the shapes in Block C are to the right of the medium blue circle in Block B. Therefore, both the medium yellow triangle and the small black triangle are to the right of the circle.

Thus, the answer is {2}."

To determine which object is below a small yellow shape, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important1>Block A has one small blue triangle and a small yellow square</important1>.
   - <important2>To the right of the small yellow square there is the small blue triangle</important2>.

2. **Block B**:

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important4>Block C has a big black circle</important4>.
   - <important5>Above the big black circle is the small yellow triangle</important5>.

Now, let's reason through the question:

- In **Block A**, the small yellow square is positioned with the small blue triangle to its right. There is no mention of any object being below the small yellow square in Block A.

- **Block B** is below Block A, but there is no information about what is in Block B, so we cannot determine if there is any object below the small yellow square in Block A.

- In **Block C**, the small yellow triangle is above the big black circle. Therefore, the big black circle is below the small yellow triangle.

The question asks which object is below a small yellow shape. Based on the information:

- The big black circle is below the small yellow triangle in Block C.

Therefore, the object below a small yellow shape is the big black circle, which is not listed as an option. However, since the question asks about the small yellow triangle or the medium thing, and neither of these is below a small yellow shape, the correct answer is:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium black square, we need to analyze the positions of the squares in each block.

1. **Block A**:
   - <important1>Block A has two medium black squares</important1>.
   - <important2>Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and a medium blue square</important2>.
   - <important3>The medium blue square is below medium black square number two</important3>.

   From this, we can deduce that in Block A, the medium blue square is below the top medium black square and above the bottom medium black square. Therefore, the medium blue square in Block A is not to the left of any medium black square in Block A.

2. **Block B**:
   - Block B contains one medium black square. There is no mention of a medium blue square in Block B, so we can ignore Block B for this question.

3. **Block C**:
   - <important4>Block C contains one medium blue square and a medium black square</important4>.
   - <important5>Below the medium black square is the medium blue square</important5>.

   In Block C, the medium blue square is below the medium black square, not to the left of it.

Since Block B does not contain a medium blue square, and in both Block A and Block C, the medium blue squares are below the medium black squares, neither of the medium blue squares is to the left of a medium black square.

Therefore, the answer is {3}."

To determine which object is below a medium black square, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important1>One medium black square is in block A</important1>. 
   - There is no mention of any yellow square in block A, so no yellow square can be below the black square in block A.

2. **Block C**: 
   - <important2>Block C is below block A and above block B</important2>.
   - <important3>It has one medium black square</important3>.
   - <important4>The medium black square is below a medium yellow square</important4>. 
   - This means the medium yellow square in block C is above the medium black square in block C.

3. **Block B**: 
   - Block B contains two medium yellow squares.
   - <important5>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important5>, meaning it is at the bottom of block B.
   - Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one, so it is not at the bottom of block B.

Now, let's determine which object is below a medium black square:

- The medium yellow square in block C is above the medium black square in block C, so it is not below a black square.
- Medium yellow square number two in block B is not mentioned to be below any black square, and since block B is below block C, it cannot be below the black square in block C.

Therefore, neither medium yellow square number two nor the medium yellow square in block C is below a medium black square.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in blocks A and B.

1. **Block A** contains:
   - <important1>One big blue square</important1>
   - <important2>Medium blue triangle</important2>
   - <important3>Small yellow circle</important3>
   - One medium blue square
   - One big yellow circle

2. **Block B** contains:
   - <important4>Medium black circle</important4>
   - Big yellow square

3. The <important5>big blue square is touching the bottom edge of block A</important5> and is below and to the right of the <important2>medium blue triangle</important2>.

4. The <important3>small yellow circle is below the medium blue triangle</important3>.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a medium blue triangle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks based on the given information.

1. **Block B Analysis:**
   - <important1>Block B contains a big black triangle, one big yellow square, and one medium blue triangle</important1>.
   - <important2>The big black triangle is near to and to the left of the medium blue triangle</important2>.
   - <important3>To the left of and far from the medium blue triangle is the big yellow square</important3>.

   From this, we can deduce that in Block B, the big yellow square is to the left of the medium blue triangle. The big black triangle is also to the left of the medium blue triangle, but it is closer to it than the big yellow square.

2. **Block A Analysis:**
   - Block A contains one medium blue square. There is no mention of a medium blue triangle in Block A, so the medium blue square in Block A is not relevant to the position of the medium blue triangle in Block B.

3. **Block C Analysis:**
   - <important4>Block C has one medium blue triangle</important4>. The medium blue triangle is below the small yellow circle.

   There is no mention of any object to the left of the medium blue triangle in Block C.

Based on the analysis, the big yellow square in Block B is to the left of the medium blue triangle. The medium blue square in Block A is not related to the medium blue triangle in Block B or Block C.

Therefore, the object to the left of a medium blue triangle is the big yellow square.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine which medium black square is to the left of a medium yellow square.

1. **Block B Analysis**:
   - According to <important1>block B</important1>, it contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square. The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block and is below the medium yellow square. Therefore, in block B, the medium black square is not to the left of the medium yellow square; it is below it.

2. **Block C Analysis**:
   - According to <important2>block C</important2>, it has two medium yellow squares and a medium black square. The medium black square is below medium yellow square number two. Therefore, in block C, the medium black square is not to the left of the medium yellow square; it is below it.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is above the medium yellow triangle, we need to analyze the positions of the blocks and the shapes within them.

1. **Block Arrangement**: 
   - <important1>Block B is above block A</important1> and below block C. This means Block A is at the bottom, Block B is in the middle, and Block C is at the top.

2. **Contents of Block A**:
   - <important2>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle</important2>, one medium black square, and a medium black circle. The medium yellow triangle is touching the right edge of this block and is below the medium black circle. This shape is below and to the right of the medium black square.

3. **Contents of Block B**:
   - <important3>Block B has a big blue triangle, one medium blue square, and one small black square</important3>. One small yellow triangle is also touching the right edge of this block. It is touching and above the medium blue square. The big blue triangle is to the left of the triangle which is touching the medium blue square. It is far from and above the medium blue square.

4. **Contents of Block C**:
   - Block C contains a big blue square. To the right of a small black square, there is a medium blue circle. Near to and below the small black square, there is the big blue square. This shape is above the circle which is to the right of the small black square.

Now, let's determine what is directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A:

- Since Block B is directly above Block A, we need to consider the shapes in Block B.
- In Block B, the small yellow triangle is touching the right edge and is above the medium blue square. The big blue triangle is to the left of the small yellow triangle and far from the medium blue square.
- The small black square is not mentioned to be on the right edge, so it is likely not directly above the medium yellow triangle.

Since Block C is above Block B, we need to consider the shapes in Block C:

- The big blue square is near to and below the small black square, and the medium blue circle is to the right of the small black square.
- The big blue square is above the medium blue circle.

Given the arrangement, the medium blue circle in Block C is positioned to the right of the small black square and below the big blue square. Since Block C is above Block B, and Block B is above Block A, the medium blue circle is directly above the medium yellow triangle in Block A.

Therefore, the answer is {1}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the spatial arrangement of the blocks and the squares within them.

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains <important1>one medium yellow square</important1>.
   - <important2>A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</important2>.

2. **Block B**: 
   - Contains <important3>one medium yellow square and a medium black square</important3>.
   - <important4>Below the medium black square is the medium yellow square</important4>.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important5>Block C is to the left of block A</important5>.
   - <important6>Block B is above it</important6>.
   - <important7>It contains a medium yellow square and one medium blue square</important7>.
   - <important8>Below the medium blue square there is the medium yellow square</important8>.
   - Below the medium yellow square and the medium blue square there is the medium black square.

Now, let's determine the position of the medium blue squares and the medium yellow squares in relation to each other:

- In **Block A**, the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.
- In **Block B**, the medium yellow square is below the medium black square.
- In **Block C**, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square.

Since **Block C** is to the left of **Block A**, the medium blue square in **Block C** is not directly related to the medium yellow square in **Block A** in terms of horizontal positioning. Similarly, the medium yellow square in **Block B** is below the medium black square, and there is no indication that it is to the right of any medium blue square.

Therefore, neither the medium yellow square in **Block A** nor the medium yellow square in **Block B** is to the right of a medium blue square.

3. **Block C**:
   - <important4>Block C has a big yellow circle</important4>.

Now, let's reason through the positions:

- In **Block A**, the small yellow triangle is above the medium blue square. The big yellow circle in Block A is above the medium blue square, meaning it is not directly below the small yellow triangle in Block A.

- **Block B** is above Block A and contains a small yellow triangle. Since Block B is above Block A, the big yellow circle in Block A is below the small yellow triangle in Block B.

- **Block C** is below Block B. The big yellow circle in Block C is not below any small yellow triangle because Block C is below Block B, and there is no mention of a small yellow triangle in Block C.

Therefore, the big yellow circle in Block A is below a small yellow triangle (the one in Block B), while the big yellow circle in Block C is not below any small yellow triangle.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to understand the spatial arrangement of the squares within blocks A and B.

1. **Block Arrangement**: 
   - <important1>Block A is to the left of B</important1>. This means all squares in Block A are to the left of all squares in Block B.

2. **Squares in Block A**:
   - <important2>Block A has one medium blue square</important2>. This is the only square in Block A.

3. **Squares in Block B**:
   - <important3>Block B has two medium blue squares</important3> and <important4>two other medium black squares</important4>.

4. **Vertical Arrangement in Block B**:
   - Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two, medium black square number one, and medium black square number two.
   - Medium blue square number two is below medium black square number two.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

   From this, we can deduce the vertical order from top to bottom in Block B:
   - Top: Medium black square number two
   - Below it: Medium black square number one
   - Below it: Medium blue square number two
   - Bottom: Medium blue square number one

5. **Horizontal Arrangement**:
   - Since <important1>Block A is to the left of B</important1>, the medium blue square in Block A is to the left of all squares in Block B.

6. **Determining the Object to the Right of a Medium Blue Square**:
   - The medium blue square in Block A is to the left of all squares in Block B, so all squares in Block B are to the right of this medium blue square.
   - In Block B, medium blue square number one is below all other squares, so it cannot have any square to its right.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

Let's analyze the information given:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains three medium yellow squares.
   - <important1>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important1>.
   - <important2>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two</important2>.
   - <important3>Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number one</important3>.

From this, we can deduce the arrangement in Block A:
- Medium yellow square number three is at the top.
- Below it is medium yellow square number two.
- At the bottom, touching the edge, is medium yellow square number one.

2. **Block B**:
   - Has two medium yellow squares.
   - Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one, there is a medium black square.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

From this, we can deduce the arrangement in Block B:
- Medium yellow square number two is at the top.
- Below it is medium yellow square number one.
- At the bottom, touching the edge, is a medium black square.

Now, we need to determine what is to the right of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

- In Block A, the object touching the bottom edge is medium yellow square number one.
- In Block B, the object touching the bottom edge is the medium black square.

The question asks what is to the right of the object touching the bottom edge of a block. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, the object to the right of medium yellow square number one (touching the bottom edge of Block A) is the medium black square in Block B.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of a yellow triangle, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have two blocks, A and B, and <important1>Block A is to the right of B</important1>. This means that all objects in Block B are to the left of all objects in Block A.

2. <important2>Block A contains a medium yellow triangle, a big yellow triangle, and one medium yellow square</important2>. 

3. <important3>The medium yellow triangle is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square</important3>. This means within Block A, the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square are to the left of the medium yellow triangle.

4. <important4>Block B has a medium yellow circle and a medium yellow square</important4>. 

5. <important5>This block also has a small blue triangle</important5>. 

6. <important6>The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block</important6>. 

Now, let's determine the position of the objects relative to the yellow triangles:

- The medium yellow triangle in Block A is to the right of the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow square in Block A. Therefore, within Block A, the medium yellow triangle is not to the left of any yellow triangle.

- Since <important1>Block A is to the right of B</important1>, all objects in Block B, including the small blue triangle, are to the left of all objects in Block A, including the yellow triangles in Block A.

Therefore, the small blue triangle, which is in Block B, is to the left of the yellow triangles in Block A. The medium yellow triangle is not to the left of any yellow triangle.

Thus, the object to the left of a yellow triangle is the small blue object which is touching the bottom edge of a block. The answer is {1}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is below the small yellow triangle, let's analyze the information given:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. According to <important1>Block A is above blocks B and C</important1>, Block A is positioned at the top, with Blocks B and C below it.

2. <important2>Block A has one small yellow triangle</important2>. This means the small yellow triangle is located in Block A.

3. <important3>Block B contains one small black square</important3>. This indicates that the small black square is in Block B, not in Block A or C.

4. <important4>Block C has a big yellow triangle</important4>, one big yellow circle, and <important5>a small black circle</important5>. The big yellow triangle and the small black circle are both in Block C.

Since Block A is above Blocks B and C, and the small yellow triangle is in Block A, we need to determine what is directly below Block A. 

Block C contains the big yellow triangle and the small black circle. The description of Block C indicates that the big yellow triangle is positioned below the medium blue square and to the left of the small black circle. However, the specific arrangement of Block C's contents does not affect what is directly below Block A, as Block A is above both Blocks B and C.

Given that Block A is above both Blocks B and C, and Block C contains the big yellow triangle, the big yellow triangle is directly below the small yellow triangle in Block A.

Therefore, the answer is {1: big yellow triangle}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine what is to the right of the small yellow square, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks based on the given information.

1. **Block B is above block A**: This means that the small yellow square is in Block B, and we need to consider the layout of Block B and its relation to Block C.

2. **Block B contains one big yellow circle, one small blue circle, one medium blue triangle, and one small yellow square**: The small yellow square is in Block B.

3. **To the right of block B there is block C**: This indicates that Block C is adjacent to Block B on the right side.

4. **Block C contains two small black circles and one medium black square**: These are the objects in Block C.

Since the small yellow square is in Block B and Block C is to the right of Block B, we need to check if any objects from Block C are directly to the right of the small yellow square.

- The small black circles and the medium black square are in Block C, which is to the right of Block B. However, the problem asks specifically about what is directly to the right of the small yellow square within the context of the blocks.

Given that Block C is entirely to the right of Block B, and the small yellow square is in Block B, there is no direct overlap or adjacency of objects from Block C to the small yellow square in Block B. Therefore, neither a small black circle nor a big black square is directly to the right of the small yellow square.

To determine what is below the black object, let's analyze the information provided:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important2>Block B is above block C</important2> and to the left of block A.
3. <important1>Block B has a medium black square</important1>.
4. <important3>Block C contains two medium yellow squares</important3>.
5. <important4>Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block</important4>. This object is below medium yellow square number two.

Given this information, we need to determine what is below the black object in Block B.

- Since <important2>Block B is above block C</important2>, and Block C contains two medium yellow squares, with <important4>medium yellow square number one touching the bottom edge of this block</important4>, it implies that the medium yellow square number one in Block C is at the bottom of Block C.

- Since Block B is above Block C, the medium yellow square number one in Block C, which is touching the bottom edge of Block C, is directly below Block B.

Therefore, the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (Block C) is below the black object in Block B.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is below a black thing, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and their contents.

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains <important1>one big blue circle and a small yellow square</important1>.
   - The big blue circle is near and touching the small yellow square.

2. **Block B**: 
   - Contains <important2>one big black square</important2>.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important3>Below block B</important3> and <important4>below block A</important4>.
   - Contains two medium blue squares and a small blue square.

Now, let's consider the spatial arrangement:

- Block B, which contains the big black square, is above Block C.
- Block A, which contains the big blue circle and the small yellow square, is also above Block C.

Since Block C is below both Block A and Block B, and Block B contains the black square, we need to determine if any objects from Block A are directly below Block B.

- The problem states that Block C is below both Block A and Block B, but it does not specify that any part of Block A is directly below Block B.
- Therefore, neither the blue circle nor the yellow object from Block A is directly below the black square in Block B.

Thus, the answer is {3: none of them}."

3. **Block C**: 
   - Is to the right of Block A.
   - Contains a small blue triangle and a medium yellow square.
   - The small blue triangle is near to and to the left of the medium yellow square.

Now, let's determine what is directly below the medium black triangle in Block A:

- Since Block B is directly below Block A, we need to check the objects in Block B.
- The small yellow square in Block B is touching the right edge of the block, as stated in <important4>.
- The medium black triangle in Block A is above the yellow object and to the right of it, which suggests it is positioned towards the right side of Block A.
- Therefore, the small yellow square in Block B, which is touching the right edge, is likely to be directly below the medium black triangle in Block A.

The small blue triangle is in Block C, which is to the right of Block A, so it cannot be directly below the medium black triangle in Block A.

Thus, the object directly below the medium black triangle is the small yellow square that is touching the right edge of Block B.

   - <important2>It has a medium yellow square and one medium black square</important2>.
   - <important3>The medium yellow square is below the medium black square</important3>.

   This means in Block B, the arrangement from top to bottom is: medium black square, then medium yellow square.

2. **Block A's Composition**:
   - Block A contains one medium black square.

3. **Block C's Composition**:
   - Block C is below Block A.
   - It has two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
   - The medium blue square is below medium black square number two.
   - Below the square which is below medium black square number two is medium black square number one, which is touching the bottom edge of this block.

Now, considering the arrangement:

- In Block B, the medium yellow square is directly below the medium black square.
- Since Block B is directly above Block A, and Block A contains a medium black square, the medium yellow square in Block B is directly above the medium black square in Block A.

Therefore, directly below the medium yellow square in Block B is the medium black square in Block A.

Thus, the answer to what is below the yellow thing is {1: medium black square}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the left of the small blue circle, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks.

1. **Block A**: Contains a big black circle and a big yellow square. The big black circle is in block A, and the big yellow square is to the right of the big black circle.

2. **Block B**: Contains a big yellow circle, a big black triangle, and a big blue square. The big yellow circle is to the left of, below, and near the big blue square. The big black triangle is below the big blue square.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important1>Block C is to the right of block A</important1>.
   - <important2>Block B is to the right of it</important2>.
   - <important3>It contains one small blue circle</important3>, one big blue triangle, and a small black square.
   - <important4>The small blue circle is above the small black square and the big blue triangle</important4>.

Since the small blue circle is in block C, and block C is to the right of block A and to the left of block B, we need to determine the relative positions of the big black circle and the big black triangle with respect to the small blue circle.

- The big black circle is in block A, which is to the left of block C.
- The big black triangle is in block B, which is to the right of block C.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine what is to the right of the big black circle based on the given information.

1. We know that <important1>Block A is to the left of B</important1>. This means that anything in Block A is to the left of anything in Block B.

2. In <important2>Block A, there is a small black circle</important2>.

3. <important3>To the left of the small black circle, there is a big black circle</important3>. This means the big black circle is in Block A, and the small black circle is to its right.

4. In Block B, there is <important4>a big yellow triangle</important4>.

5. <important5>The big yellow triangle is touching the right edge of this block</important5>, meaning it is at the far right of Block B.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and the big black circle is in Block A, the small black circle is directly to the right of the big black circle within Block A. The big yellow triangle is in Block B, which is to the right of Block A, but it is not directly to the right of the big black circle; it is at the far right of Block B.

Therefore, directly to the right of the big black circle is the small black circle, not the big yellow triangle.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, let's analyze the arrangement of the blocks and squares step by step using the important information provided:

1. **Block A**: 
   - <important1>Block A contains a medium yellow square</important1>.
   - <important2>A medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</important2>.

2. **Block B**: 
   - Contains a medium blue square.

3. **Block C**: 
   - <important3>It contains a medium blue square and one medium yellow square</important3>.
   - <important4>The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square</important4>.
   - <important5>Block C is to the left of block A</important5>.

Now, let's visualize the arrangement:

- **Block C** is to the left of **Block A**. In **Block C**, the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square.
- **Block A** has a medium yellow square above a medium blue square.
- **Block B** is not mentioned in relation to the other blocks, but it contains a medium blue square.

Considering the spatial arrangement:
- In **Block A**, the medium yellow square is directly above the medium blue square, so it is not to the right of it.
- In **Block C**, the medium yellow square is directly above the medium blue square, so it is not to the right of it.
- Since **Block C** is to the left of **Block A**, the medium yellow square in **Block C** is not to the right of the medium blue square in **Block A**.

Therefore, neither of the medium yellow squares is to the right of a medium blue square.

To determine which object is below a blue thing, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. <important1>Block C is below A</important1>, and <important2>Block A is above B</important2>. This means the order from top to bottom is A, C, B.
3. <important3>Block A contains one medium blue square</important3>. Therefore, the blue square is in Block A.

7. <important8>It is below medium yellow square number two and the medium black square</important8>. This confirms that the shape touching the bottom edge is below both the second medium yellow square and the medium black square in Block B.

Now, we need to determine which object is below a blue thing. Since the blue square is in Block A, and Block C is below Block A, anything in Block C is below the blue square. However, the question asks about objects in Block B.

- Medium yellow square number two is in Block B, and Block B is below Block A, but it is not directly below the blue square because Block C is between them.
- The shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block B is also in Block B, and similarly, it is not directly below the blue square because Block C is between them.

Therefore, neither medium yellow square number two nor the shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block B is directly below the blue square in Block A. The answer is {3}."
