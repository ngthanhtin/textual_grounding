Answer_Reasoning: Block A contains a medium blue square and a medium black square, with the black square below the blue square. Block B, to the left of Block A, has one medium blue square. Block C, to the left of Block B, contains two medium black squares. Since Block C is to the left of Block B, and Block B is to the left of Block A, the medium black squares in Block C are to the left of the medium blue square in Block B. Therefore, the medium black square number two in Block C is to the left of the medium blue square in Block B. The medium black square in Block A is not to the left of any medium blue square, as it is in the same block as the medium blue square. Thus, the correct answer is option 0.
