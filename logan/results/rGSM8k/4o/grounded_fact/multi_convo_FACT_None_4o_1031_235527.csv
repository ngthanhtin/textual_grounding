The other is an unknown temperature. If he <FACT3>pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</FACT3> into his water bottle and <FACT4>one ounce from the other bottle</FACT4>, <FACT5>he is now able to drink the water</FACT5>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle that allows Donny to drink the water, given the conditions.

1. **Understanding the Requirement**: 
   - <FACT1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</FACT1>. This means the final mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

2. **Details of the Mugs**:
   - <FACT2>One mug is 33 degrees</FACT2>. This is the temperature of the first mug.
   - The temperature of the second mug is unknown, and we need to find the minimum temperature that makes the final mixture drinkable.

3. **Mixing Process**:
   - <FACT3>He pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</FACT3> into his water bottle.
   - <FACT4>He pours one ounce from the other bottle</FACT4> into his water bottle.

4. **Final Condition**:
   - <FACT5>He is now able to drink the water</FACT5>. This means the final temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Temperature**:
   - Let \( T \) be the temperature of the second mug.
   - The total volume of the mixture is 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, totaling 5 ounces.
   - The equation for the final temperature \( T_f \) of the mixture is:
     \[
     T_f = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
     \]
   - We need \( T_f \geq 40 \).

6. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     \frac{(4 \times 33) + T}{5} \geq 40
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 5:
     \[
     132 + T \geq 200
     \]
   - Solve for \( T \):
     \[
     T \geq 200 - 132
     \]
     \[
     T \geq 68
     \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The answer is {68}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate both the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven per week:**
   - <FACT1>His work is 30 miles away</FACT1>, so a round trip is 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles.
   - <FACT3>He goes to work 5 days a week</FACT3>, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles per week.

2. **Calculate the total miles driven per year:**
   - <FACT4>He works for 50 weeks a year</FACT4>, so he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles per year.

3. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - <FACT5>He gets charged $2 per mile driven</FACT5>, so the cost is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

4. **Calculate the total bonus paid per year:**
   - <FACT6>He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month</FACT6>.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months = $1,800.

5. **Calculate the total cost per year:**
   - Add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, John pays a total of {31,800} per year for driving."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to calculate the total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister and then find out how many of those were from the average trees.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: <FACT1>Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees</FACT1>.
   - From the shortest trees: <FACT2>half this amount from the shortest trees</FACT2>, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( x \).

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: <FACT3>her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees</FACT3>, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: <FACT4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</FACT4>, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
   - From the average trees: She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

3. **Total Apples Gathered:**
   - Combined total: <FACT5>combined total of 500 apples</FACT5>.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of apples:

Joanne's apples: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + \( x \) (average) = 45 + \( x \).

Sister's apples: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

Combined total: 45 + \( x \) + 105 = 500.

Solving for \( x \):

150 + \( x \) = 500

\( x \) = 500 - 150

\( x \) = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered {350} apples from the average trees."

He then spends <FACT5>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</FACT5> as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the weekdays and the additional time he spends on the weekend.

1. **Calculate the total number of classes per day:**
   - A normal student has <FACT1>6 periods in the day</FACT1>.
   - John has to take <FACT2>2 extra classes</FACT2>.
   - Therefore, John has 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day.

2. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class per day:**
   - Each class is <FACT3>40 minutes long</FACT3>.
   - Therefore, John spends 8 classes * 40 minutes = 320 minutes per day in class.

3. **Calculate the total minutes spent in class per week:**
   - John goes to class for <FACT4>5 days a week</FACT4>.
   - Therefore, he spends 320 minutes/day * 5 days = 1600 minutes per week in class.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - John spends <FACT5>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</FACT5>.
   - Total extra learning time for the weekend = 2 * (1/16 * 1600 minutes) = 2 * 100 minutes = 200 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total learning time per week:**
   - Total learning time = 1600 minutes (weekdays) + 200 minutes (weekend) = 1800 minutes.

How long did the trip take?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long John's entire trip took, we need to calculate the time for both the trip to his friend's house and the return trip home.

1. **Trip to Friend's House:**
   - The original distance to his friend's house is <FACT1>200 miles</FACT1>.
   - He had to take a <FACT3>detour that added 10 miles</FACT3>, making the total distance 210 miles.
   - He drives at a <FACT2>speed of 70 mph</FACT2>.

   The time taken for this part of the trip is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Return Trip Home:**
   - The route home is <FACT4>240 miles</FACT4>.
   - He drives at a <FACT5>speed of 80 mph</FACT5>.

   The time taken for the return trip is calculated as:
   \[

   \]

3. **Total Trip Time:**
   - The total time for the entire trip is the sum of the time taken for both parts:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time John took for the trip is {6} hours."

On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week.

- From <FACT1>, Mack saw a total of 50 birds on days one and two.
- From <FACT2>, Mack saw none on day three.
- From <FACT3>, Mack saw 120 birds on days four and five.
- From <FACT4>, Mack saw 20 birds on day six.

What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, Rita removed <FACT1>39 Junebugs</FACT1>.

2. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. Therefore, on each of these days, she removed 2 * <FACT1>39</FACT1> = 78 Junebugs. So, for both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed a total of 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.

3. On Thursday, she removed <FACT3>48 Junebugs</FACT3>.

4. On Friday, she removed <FACT4>57 Junebugs</FACT4>.

Now, we sum up the Junebugs removed over the five days:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
Average = 300 / 5 = 60

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is {60}."

She <FACT4>sells an average of 4 cups per hour</FACT4> that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue she earns from selling all the lemonade and then subtract her initial costs. Finally, we'll divide the profit by the number of hours she spends selling the lemonade.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups Millie can sell.
<FACT2>Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade</FACT2>, and she makes 3 pitchers. Therefore, the total number of cups is:
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
<FACT3>She sells each cup of lemonade for $1</FACT3>. Therefore, the total revenue is:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of supplies.
<FACT1>She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade</FACT1>.

Step 4: Calculate the total profit.
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost = $36 - $18 = $18.

Step 5: Calculate the number of hours Millie spends selling the lemonade.
<FACT4>She sells an average of 4 cups per hour</FACT4>. Therefore, the number of hours she spends selling is:
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

How many boys are in the third class?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many boys are in the third class, let's analyze the information step by step using the key facts provided:

1. According to <FACT1>, each class in the school has 20 students.

2. There are 3 classes in total as per <FACT2>.

3. The school is evenly split between boys and girls, with 50% boys and 50% girls, as stated in <FACT3>.

4. The first class has 15 girls, according to <FACT4>. Since each class has 20 students, this means there are 20 - 15 = 5 boys in the first class.

5. The second class has 12 girls, as per <FACT5>. Therefore, there are 20 - 12 = 8 boys in the second class.

6. To find out how many boys are in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of boys in the school. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, and there are 3 classes with 20 students each, the total number of students is 3 * 20 = 60. Therefore, there are 60 / 2 = 30 boys in the entire school.

7. We already know there are 5 boys in the first class and 8 boys in the second class. So, the number of boys in the third class is 30 (total boys) - 5 (boys in the first class) - 8 (boys in the second class) = 17 boys.

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is {17}."

How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day using the given facts.

**Step 1: Calculate Thursday's Revenue**

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs:
- <FACT3>6 truck tires</FACT3> at <FACT1>$60 each</FACT1>
- <FACT3>4 car tires</FACT3> at <FACT2>$40 each</FACT2>

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160

Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Step 2: Calculate Friday's Revenue**

On Friday, the mechanic repairs:
- <FACT4>12 car tires</FACT4> at <FACT2>$40 each</FACT2>
- <FACT4>No truck tires</FACT4>

To determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - According to <FACT2>, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - From <FACT1>, the tattered jeans cost $28.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - <FACT3> states that Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings distribution:**
   - According to <FACT4>, Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of $6, which is $2.
   - According to <FACT5>, the rest of the savings came from the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.

4. **Calculate the original cost of the jogger jeans:**

And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, <FACT3>the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel</FACT3>. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to use the information provided in the key facts.

1. From <FACT1>, we know that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

2. From <FACT2>, we know that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.

3. From <FACT3>, we know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds.

Now, we can calculate the capacity of Gary's truck by subtracting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total combined capacity:

Total combined capacity = 11,600 pounds
Capacity of Gissela's truck = 4,000 pounds
Capacity of Gordy's truck = 4,800 pounds

Capacity of Gary's truck = Total combined capacity - (Capacity of Gissela's truck + Capacity of Gordy's truck)
Capacity of Gary's truck = 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800)
Capacity of Gary's truck = 11,600 - 8,800

How fast does the faster car go?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how fast the fastest car goes, we need to use the information provided in the key facts step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   According to <FACT2>, the 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. 
   From <FACT3>, we know the average car can go 120 miles per hour.
   Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 5 times 120 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the speed of the fastest car:**
   According to <FACT1>, the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
   We have already calculated the speed of the 2nd fastest car as 600 miles per hour.
   Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 1.25 times 600 miles per hour:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour. The answer is {750}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate how much money he has already spent and how much he has left.

1. **Calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:**

   - **Movies on Fridays or Saturdays:** 
     Colby saw <FACT6>5 movies on a Friday or Saturday</FACT6>. Each ticket costs <FACT2>$10</FACT2>.
     Total cost for these movies = 5 * $10 = $50.

   - **Movies on other days:**
     Colby saw <FACT7>8 movies on other days</FACT7>. Each ticket costs <FACT3>$7</FACT3>.
     Total cost for these movies = 8 * $7 = $56.

   - **Popcorn:**
     Colby had <FACT8>2 tubs of popcorn</FACT8>. Each tub costs <FACT4>$8</FACT4>.
     Total cost for popcorn = 2 * $8 = $16.

   - **Boxes of candy:**
     Colby had <FACT9>four boxes of candy</FACT9>. Each box costs <FACT5>$2</FACT5>.
     Total cost for candy = 4 * $2 = $8.

   - **Total spent so far:**
     Total spent = $50 (movies on Fri/Sat) + $56 (movies on other days) + $16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) = $130.

2. **Calculate the remaining budget:**

   - Colby's parents give him <FACT1>$150</FACT1> each month.
   - Remaining budget = $150 - $130 = $20.

3. **Determine how many movies he can see on the last day:**

   - It's a Friday, so the ticket cost is <FACT2>$10</FACT2>.
   - Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost <FACT4>$8</FACT4> + <FACT5>$2</FACT5> = $10.

   - Total cost for one movie, popcorn, and candy = $10 (ticket) + $10 (popcorn and candy) = $20.

   - Since Colby has $20 left, he can afford exactly one movie with popcorn and candy.

Therefore, Colby can see {1} movie on the last day of the month."

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the situation step by step using the key facts provided.

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Ellen has a <FACT1>case of 12 sodas</FACT1>.
   - Out of these, <FACT2>3 sodas are shaken</FACT2>.

2. **Ellen's Action**:
   - Ellen <FACT3>took 1 unshaken soda for herself</FACT3>.
   - This leaves 11 sodas in the case, with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.

3. **Brother's Action**:
   - Ellen's <FACT4>brother took 1 of the shaken sodas</FACT4>.
   - He also took <FACT5>2 of the unshaken sodas</FACT5>.
   - After the brother's action, the remaining sodas are:
     - Shaken: 3 - 1 = 2
     - Unshaken: 8 - 2 = 6
   - Total remaining sodas: 2 shaken + 6 unshaken = 8 sodas.

4. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Ellen's friend comes along and picks a soda at random from the remaining 8 sodas.
   - The probability that the friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas.
   - Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas) = 2/8 = 1/4.

5. **Convert to Percentage**:
   - To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100.
   - (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is {25%}."

If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before he has to recycle it, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then see how many days it will last if he uses 20% of the original length each day.

1. **Initial Length of Chalk**: The teacher starts with a <FACT1>5-inch piece of chalk</FACT1>.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: On Monday, the teacher <FACT2>used up 45% of the chalk</FACT2>. 
   - 45% of 5 inches is \(0.45 \times 5 = 2.25\) inches.
   - Therefore, the remaining length of the chalk after Monday is \(5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

3. **Daily Usage from Tuesday Onwards**: The teacher plans to <FACT3>only use 20% of the chalk each day</FACT3>.
   - 20% of the original 5-inch piece is \(0.20 \times 5 = 1\) inch per day.

4. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher <FACT4>recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches</FACT4>.

5. **Calculate Remaining Days**:
   - After Monday, the chalk is 2.75 inches long.
   - The teacher uses 1 inch per day.
   - After one more day (Tuesday), the chalk will be \(2.75 - 1 = 1.75\) inches long.

Since the chalk will be 1.75 inches long after Tuesday, which is smaller than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle it after Tuesday.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day after Monday before he has to recycle it.

The answer is {1}."

She also has <FACT3>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each</FACT3>. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the selling price of the boards after the price increase and then subtract the original cost.

1. **Calculate the original cost of the lumber:**
   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
     - <key_fact2>Each board cost her $10</key_fact2>, so the total cost is 10 boards x $10 = $100.
   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - <key_fact3>Each board cost her $16</key_fact3>, so the total cost is 5 boards x $16 = $80.
   - Total original cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

2. **Calculate the selling price after the price increase:**
   - The prices have gone up by 50%, so the selling price for each type of board is:
     - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
       - Original price = $10, increased by 50% = $10 + (0.50 x $10) = $15 per board.
       - Total selling price for 10 boards = 10 x $15 = $150.
     - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
       - Original price = $16, increased by 50% = $16 + (0.50 x $16) = $24 per board.
       - Total selling price for 5 boards = 5 x $24 = $120.
   - Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of {90}."

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   The total cost after applying the discount is:
   \[
   150 - 60 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount earned from selling 5 CDs:**
   James sold 5 of the CDs for <FACT4>40 dollars</FACT4>.

5. **Calculate the net amount James was out:**

There are <FACT3>10 cages of hamsters</FACT3> that are kept alone and <FACT4>each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw</FACT4>. There is also a pen of rabbits where <FACT5>20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</FACT5>. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <FACT6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed</FACT6> among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many rats are in each cage, we need to use the information provided in the key facts to calculate the total number of pieces of straw used and then solve for the number of rats.

1. **Calculate the straw used by the hamsters:**
   - There are <FACT3>10 cages of hamsters</FACT3>.
   - Each hamster is given <FACT4>5 pieces of straw</FACT4>.
   - Therefore, the total straw used by the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the straw used by the rabbits:**
   - The rabbits are given <FACT5>20 pieces of straw</FACT5> in total.

3. **Calculate the straw used by the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is <FACT6>160 pieces of straw</FACT6>.
   - Subtract the straw used by the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw to find the straw used by the rats:
     \[
     160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \text{ pieces of straw for the rats}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given <FACT2>6 pieces of straw</FACT2>.
   - Let \( r \) be the total number of rats. Then, \( 6r = 90 \).
   - Solving for \( r \), we get \( r = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) rats in total.

5. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**
   - The rats are kept in <FACT1>3 cages in equal groups</FACT1>.
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

Thus, there are {5} rats in each cage."

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

1. **First Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - The first venue charges a flat fee of <FACT1>$200</FACT1>.
   - Additionally, Mark estimates that food will cost <FACT2>$5 for each person</FACT2>.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue with \( x \) guests is: 
     \[
     200 + 5x
     \]

2. **Second Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - The second venue charges <FACT3>$25 per person</FACT3>, which includes food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue with \( x \) guests is:
     \[
     25x
     \]

3. **Setting the Costs Equal:**
   - To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
     \[
     200 + 5x = 25x
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is {10}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool**: 
   The volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying its width, length, and depth. 
   Using the given measurements:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} = \text{<FACT1>14 feet wide</FACT1>} \times \text{<FACT2>25 feet long</FACT2>} \times \text{<FACT3>4 feet deep</FACT3>}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert Volume to Gallons**:
   According to the instructions, multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = \text{Volume} \times \text{<FACT4>5.9</FACT4>} = 1400 \times 5.9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 8260
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost to Fill the Pool**:
   The cost is determined by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons} \times \text{<FACT5>$0.10 per gallon</FACT5>} = 8260 \times 0.10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 826
   \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \(\text{\$826}\). The final answer is \{826\}."

He also buys a <FACT4>finale firework that costs $150</FACT4>. How much did he spend in total?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after applying the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

1. Calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks:
   - The second pack is worth twice the first pack, so it costs <FACT2>2 * $400 = $800</FACT2>.

2. Calculate the total cost of the two packs before the discount:
   - The total cost of the two packs is <FACT1>$400</FACT1> + <FACT2>$800</FACT2> = $1200.

3. Apply the discount to the total cost of the two packs:
   - The discount is <FACT3>20%</FACT3>, so the discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.
   - The cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

4. Add the cost of the finale firework:
   - The finale firework costs <FACT4>$150</FACT4>.
   - The total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of {1110}."

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by all workers during their shift and compare it to the order requirement.

1. **Calculate the total number of toys needed:**
   - The manufacturer receives an <FACT1>order for 400 toys</FACT1>.

2. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:**
   - <FACT2>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</FACT2>. Therefore, in a <FACT4>10-hour shift</FACT4>, these two workers produce:
     \[
     2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - <FACT3>Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</FACT3>. Therefore, in a <FACT4>10-hour shift</FACT4>, these two workers produce:
     \[
     2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by all five workers:**
   - By the end of their shift, the manufacturer <FACT5>still needs another 20 toys</FACT5> to complete the order. This means they produced:
     \[
     400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The first four workers produced a total of:
     \[
     120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fifth worker produced:
     \[
     380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Calculate the toys per hour produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for a <FACT4>10-hour shift</FACT4>, so they produced:
     \[
     \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}
     \]

How many bandages did they start with on the first day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days, and the number of bandages left at the end.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The nurses' station orders <FACT1>bandages in bulk packs of 50</FACT1>.

2. **First Day:**
   - They used <FACT2>38 bandages</FACT2>.
   - They ordered <FACT3>one bulk pack of bandages</FACT3>, which is 50 bandages.

3. **Second Day:**
   - They used <FACT4>ten fewer bandages</FACT4> than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

4. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered <FACT5>two bulk packs of bandages</FACT5>, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used <FACT6>only half a pack</FACT6>, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

5. **End of Third Day:**
   - They had <FACT7>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</FACT7>.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered:

- Total bandages used over three days = 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages ordered = 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day. The equation for the total bandages is:

\[ x - 91 + 150 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x + 59 = 78 \]

\[ x = 78 - 59 \]

\[ x = 19 \]

Therefore, the nurses' station started with {19} bandages on the first day."

What is their average guess?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to calculate each friend's guess and then find the average.

1. The first friend's guess is straightforward: <FACT1>One says 80</FACT1>. So, the first guess is 80.

2. The second friend's guess is calculated as follows: <FACT2>Another says 20 more than half the first one</FACT2>. Half of the first guess (80) is 40. Adding 20 to this gives us 40 + 20 = 60. So, the second guess is 60.

3. The third friend's guess is calculated as follows: <FACT3>A third says 25% more than the first one</FACT3>. 25% of the first guess (80) is 0.25 * 80 = 20. Adding this to the first guess gives us 80 + 20 = 100. So, the third guess is 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:

Average = (First guess + Second guess + Third guess) / 3
Average = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3
Average = 240 / 3
Average = 80

Therefore, the average guess is {80}."

In the end, the <FACT5>charge remaining was 28%</FACT5>. What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to account for the total percentage of the power bank's capacity that was lost over the entire period.

1. **Initial Loss Calculation:**
   - For the first 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour.
   - Total loss in the first 5 hours = 5 hours * <FACT1>9%</FACT1> = 45%.

2. **Subsequent Loss Calculation:**
   - After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
   - Total loss in the next 3 hours = 3 hours * <FACT3>7%</FACT3> = 21%.

3. **Total Loss Calculation:**
   - Total loss over the 8 hours = 45% (first 5 hours) + 21% (next 3 hours) = 66%.

4. **Remaining Charge Calculation:**
   - After losing 66% of its capacity, the power bank had <FACT5>28%</FACT5> charge remaining.

5. **Initial Charge Calculation:**
   - Let the initial charge be X%.
   - After losing 66% of X, the remaining charge is 28%.
   - Therefore, X - 66% of X = 28%.
   - This can be expressed as: X * (1 - 0.66) = 28%.
   - X * 0.34 = 28%.
   - X = 28% / 0.34 = 82.35%.

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately {82.35%}."

   - From <FACT3>, we know that one banana costs twice as much as an apple. Since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs 2 * $0.5 = $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost for bananas is 5 bananas * $1/banana = $5.

3. **Calculate the cost of oranges:**
   - According to <FACT1>, there are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - From <FACT4>, we know that one orange costs three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 * $1 = $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for oranges is 7 oranges * $3/orange = $21.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the crate:**
   - The total cost of the crate is the sum of the costs of all the fruits: $6 (apples) + $5 (bananas) + $21 (oranges) = $32.

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is {32}."

When James came back yet again, <FACT4>3 dogs were gone</FACT4> so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many toys James needs in total, let's break down the problem step by step using the key facts provided:

1. Initially, <FACT1>James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</FACT1>. This means he has 1 toy per dog.

2. <FACT2>There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</FACT2>. This means there are now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs in total. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 12 toys in total. He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

3. After buying the toys, <FACT3>there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</FACT3>. When he left, there were 12 dogs. Now, there are twice as many, which means there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. He needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 he bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

4. When James came back yet again, <FACT4>3 dogs were gone</FACT4>. This means there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. He needs 21 toys in total. He already has 24 toys, so he doesn't need to buy any more toys. In fact, he has 3 extra toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21. 

The answer is {21}."

If <FACT5>Erika now only needs an extra $50</FACT5> to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in and then account for the money she has received and still needs.

1. **Initial Cost of the Laptop**: 
   - The <FACT1>laptop she wants costs $600</FACT1>.

2. **Trade-in Reduction**:
   - The <FACT2>price of the new one would be reduced by $200</FACT2> if she trades in her old laptop.
   - Therefore, the new cost of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

3. **Money from Part-time Job**:
   - Erika has been <FACT3>paid $150 this week for her part-time job</FACT3>.

- Money from part-time job: $150
- Money from mom: $80
- Additional money needed: $50

Total money accounted for (excluding purse savings) = $150 + $80 + $50 = $280

Since the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in is $400, and she has accounted for $280 from other sources, the remaining amount must be what she has in her purse.

Amount needed from purse = Total cost - Total accounted money
= $400 - $280
= $120

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse. The answer is {120}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, we need to work through the problem step by step using the key facts provided.

1. **Determine the intended number of cookies Henry wanted to bake this year:**
   - According to <FACT1>, Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's denote the number of cookies he baked last year as \( x \). Therefore, the intended number of cookies he wanted to bake this year is \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the actual number of cookies Henry baked:**
   - According to <FACT2>, Henry baked 15 more cookies than he intended. Therefore, the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2x + 15 \).

3. **Account for the dropped cookies:**
   - According to <FACT3>, Henry dropped 5 cookies. Therefore, the number of cookies he had after dropping them is \( (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 \).

4. **Use the total number of cookies to find last year's count:**
   - According to <FACT4>, after dropping the cookies, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2x + 10 = 110
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:

     \[
     x = 50
     \]

Therefore, Henry baked {50} cookies last year."

On average, how many branches did he climb per day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to use the key facts provided:

1. <FACT1>Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25</FACT1>.
2. <FACT2>During the week he made $105</FACT2>.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- First, calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week. Since each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

  Total branches climbed = Total money earned / Cost per branch
  = $105 / $0.25
  = 420 branches

- Next, determine the average number of branches climbed per day. Since a week consists of 7 days, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

  Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
  = 420 branches / 7 days
  = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day. The final answer is {60}."

If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, we need to consider the following key facts:

1. <FACT1>There are 10 students in each grade</FACT1> who get to try the escape room. Since there are <FACT2>grades 4 – 7</FACT2>, this means there are 4 grades in total. Therefore, the total number of students is 10 students/grade * 4 grades = 40 students.

2. <FACT3>Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time</FACT3>. This means we need to divide the total number of students (40) by the number of students that can participate at one time (8) to determine how many groups are needed. 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.

3. <FACT4>They have 45 minutes to try and escape</FACT4>. Each group uses the full 45 minutes.

Therefore, if each of the 5 groups uses 45 minutes, the total time required is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

The answer is {225}."

She uses <FACT4>twice as much oil as salt</FACT4> and <FACT5>twice as much salt as zest</FACT5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to analyze the relationships between the ingredients based on the key facts provided.

1. **Total Amount**: Tanya makes enough to <key_fact1>fill a 10-ounce jar</key_fact1>.

2. **Citrus Zest and Fragrance**: She uses the <key_fact2>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</key_fact2>. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance each as \( z \).

3. **Salt and Sugar**: She uses the <key_fact3>same amount of salt as sugar</key_fact3>. Let's denote the amount of salt and sugar each as \( s \).

4. **Oil and Salt**: She uses <key_fact4>twice as much oil as salt</key_fact4>. Therefore, the amount of oil is \( 2s \).

5. **Salt and Zest**: She uses <key_fact5>twice as much salt as zest</key_fact5>. Therefore, \( s = 2z \).

Now, we can set up the equation for the total amount of ingredients:

\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the equation:

\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 2(2z) = 10 \]

Simplifying:

\[ 2z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]

\[ 10z = 10 \]

Solving for \( z \):

\[ z = 1 \]

Since \( s = 2z \), we have:

\[ s = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil, which is twice the amount of salt, is:

\[ 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses {4} ounces of oil."

The <FACT3>shore was 64 seconds away</FACT3>. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use the rate at which the boat was taking on water.

1. **Calculate the total distance rowed:**
   - According to <FACT3>, the shore was 64 seconds away.
   - From <FACT2>, we know it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, in 64 seconds, she would row: 
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - From <FACT1>, the boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet rowed.
   - Therefore, for 80 feet, the boat would take on:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on {16} liters of water."

When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <FACT4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</FACT4>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store, given the conditions.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond.
   - <FACT1>3 were orange</FACT1>.
   - <FACT2>4 were white</FACT2>.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store:**
   - Bob bought <FACT3>17 fish</FACT3> from the store.

3. **Final Condition:**
   - After adding the new fish, Bob found that he had <FACT4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</FACT4>.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of orange fish bought.
- \( y \) as the number of white fish bought.

From the initial count, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish.
- 4 white fish.

After buying the fish, the total number of fish is:
- Orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
- White fish: \( 4 + y \)

According to the problem, the total number of fish bought is 17:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

The final condition states that the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

From the equation \( x + y = 17 \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ x = 17 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):
\[ 3 + (17 - y) = 2(4 + y) \]
\[ 20 - y = 8 + 2y \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2y + y \]
\[ 12 = 3y \]
\[ y = 4 \]

Thus, Bob bought {4} white fish at the store."

If the rink has <FACT4>75 cars in total</FACT4>, how many yellow cars do they have?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the number of yellow cars, we need to calculate the number of each type of car and then use the total to find the yellow cars.

1. **Red Cars**: According to <FACT1>, there are 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars**: According to <FACT2>, there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

3. **Blue Cars**: According to <FACT3>, there are 3 times the number of blue cars as there are green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

4. **Total Cars**: According to <FACT4>, the total number of cars is 75.

Now, we can calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

Total number of cars = Red cars + Green cars + Blue cars + Yellow cars

75 = 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) + Yellow cars

75 = 52 + Yellow cars

Yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is {23}."

**Step 2: Calculate Sheila's total cost on Wednesday.**

<key_fact3>The price shot to $30 per fruit</key_fact3>, so the initial cost for 20 pomegranates is:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$30/\text{pomegranate} = \$600 \]

<key_fact4>The store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost</key_fact4>. Therefore, the discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times \$600 = \$60 \]

So, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ \$600 - \$60 = \$540 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between the final prices paid.**

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:
\[ \$540 - \$398 = \$142 \]

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \{\$142\}."

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve the problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set:

Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

According to <FACT1>, in the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls in the first set.

According to <FACT2>, in the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls in the third set.

According to <FACT3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combine the terms:

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

\[
2(2x + 4) + x = 38
\]

Simplify:

\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now, substitute back to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The answer is {10}."

How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the petals for each type of flower Rose picked and then account for the flowers she dropped.

1. **Initial Petal Count:**
   - Rose picks <FACT1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</FACT1>. This gives her 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
   - She then picks <FACT2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</FACT2>. This gives her 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
   - She adds another <FACT3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</FACT3>. This gives her 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
   - Lastly, she picks <FACT4>6 flowers with 7 petals each</FACT4>. This gives her 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Adding these up, the total number of petals before any are dropped is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

3. **Adjusting for Dropped Flowers:**
   - Rose <FACT5>drops 1 of each</FACT5> type of flower. We need to subtract the petals of one flower from each type:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: 5 petals
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: 6 petals
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: 4 petals
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: 7 petals

4. **Total Petals Dropped:**
   - The total number of petals dropped is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

5. **Final Petal Count in the Vase:**
   - Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total: 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is {79}."

What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**: 
   - There's a <FACT1>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</FACT1>. 
   - This means there's a 50% chance he won't have to turn it in because of the substitute teacher.

2. **Normal Teacher with Class Extension**:
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there's a <FACT2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</FACT2>.
   - The probability that the normal teacher comes in is 1 - 50% = 50%.
   - Therefore, the probability that the normal teacher comes in and gives an extension is 50% * 40% = 20%.

3. **Normal Teacher with Personal Extension**:
   - If the normal teacher does not give a class extension, there's a <FACT3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</FACT3>.
   - The probability that the normal teacher comes in and does not give a class extension is 50% * (1 - 40%) = 30%.
   - Therefore, the probability that Marcus gets a personal extension is 30% * 20% = 6%.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Class extension: 20%
- Personal extension: 6%

Total probability of not turning in homework = 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 100% - 76% = 24%.

The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is {24}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both pricing options and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 5 am is 12 hours, and from 5 am to 10 am is an additional 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the total duration of Cameron's stay is 12 + 5 = 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The initial 12-hour stay costs <FACT1>1000 pesos</FACT1>.
   - For the additional 5 hours, Cameron pays <FACT3>70 pesos for every additional hour</FACT3>.
   - Additional cost = 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost for 17 hours using this option = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The 24-hour stay costs <FACT2>1600 pesos</FACT2>.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 17-hour stay using the 12-hour option
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save {250} pesos by choosing the 12-hour stay option with additional hours."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the weight that Jamaal now uses, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Weight**: Jamaal starts with an <FACT1>8-pound weight</FACT1>.

2. **Increase by 50%**: He then <FACT2>increases the weight that he uses by 50%</FACT2>. To calculate this, we take 50% of 8 pounds, which is 0.5 * 8 = 4 pounds. Adding this to the original weight gives us 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.

3. **Adjust for Too Heavy**: Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal <FACT3>uses a weight two pounds lighter than that</FACT3>. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds, resulting in 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.

Thus, the weight that Jamaal now uses is {10}."

How many slices of pizza were left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
<FACT1>Each pizza had 12 slices</FACT1>, and there are 5 people, so the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends.
<FACT2>Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas</FACT2>. Each of these three people had a pizza with 12 slices, so they ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices each. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by these three people is 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends.
<FACT3>The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas</FACT3>. Each of these two people had a pizza with 12 slices, so they ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices each. Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by these two people is 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of slices eaten.
The total number of slices eaten by all five people is 24 (from Bryce and two friends) + 18 (from the two remaining friends) = 42 slices.

Step 5: Calculate the number of slices left.
The total number of slices was 60, and 42 slices were eaten, so the number of slices left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is {18}."

The <FACT4>passion fruit costs $6 per pound</FACT4>, the <FACT5>jackfruit is $8 per pound</FACT5>, and the <FACT6>honey is $10 per pound</FACT6>. He <FACT7>sells each jar for $50</FACT7>. How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of making one jar and then the total cost for 10 jars. After that, we will calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars and subtract the total cost from the revenue to find the profit.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of making one jar.
- <FACT1>2 pounds of passion fruit</FACT1> at <FACT4>$6 per pound</FACT4> costs 2 * 6 = $12.
- <FACT2>1.5 pounds of jackfruit</FACT2> at <FACT5>$8 per pound</FACT5> costs 1.5 * 8 = $12.
- <FACT3>2 pounds of special honey</FACT3> at <FACT6>$10 per pound</FACT6> costs 2 * 10 = $20.

Total cost to make one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.
Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440.

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars.
- <FACT7>He sells each jar for $50</FACT7>, so for 10 jars, the revenue is 10 * 50 = $500.

Step 4: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Revenue - Total Cost = $500 - $440 = $60.

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is {60}."

If <FACT3>it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</FACT3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to consider the following key facts:

1. <FACT3>It takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</FACT3>.
2. <FACT2>The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</FACT2>.
3. <FACT1>Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne</FACT1>.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- Since <FACT3>it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</FACT3>, the drive from Wayne's hotel to the theater is 4 minutes.
- According to <FACT2>, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. Therefore, Bernadette's drive takes 4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes.
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, as stated in <FACT1>.

To ensure Bernadette arrives 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to calculate the total time difference:

- Bernadette's drive time: 16 minutes
- Wayne's drive time: 4 minutes
- Additional time Bernadette wants to arrive before Wayne: 5 minutes

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes (her drive time) + 5 minutes (to arrive earlier) - 4 minutes (Wayne's drive time) = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

If his <FACT5>truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</FACT5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed he is buying and then divide that by the truck's capacity.

1. **Calculate the total weight of each type of feed:**

   - **Sugar cubes:** The farmer buys <FACT1>two 1-pound boxes of them</FACT1>. Therefore, the total weight of sugar cubes is 2 pounds.

   - **Carrots:** The farmer buys <FACT2>four 12-pound bags</FACT2>. Therefore, the total weight of carrots is 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds.

   - **Hay:** The farmer buys <FACT3>forty-two 75-pound bales</FACT3>. Therefore, the total weight of hay is 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.

   - **Oats:** The farmer buys <FACT4>twenty 65-pound sacks</FACT4>. Therefore, the total weight of oats is 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**

   Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds.

3. **Determine the number of trips needed:**

   The truck can carry <FACT5>2250 pounds at a time</FACT5>. Therefore, the number of trips required is the total weight divided by the truck's capacity, rounded up to the nearest whole number because the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip.

   Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make {2} trips to transport all the feed."

   - <FACT1>Jim has a 20 pack of gum</FACT1>.

2. **Gum Chewed at School**:
   - <FACT2>Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school</FACT2>.
   - <FACT3>The school day lasts 8 hours</FACT3>.
   - Therefore, Jim chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**:
   - <FACT4>Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school</FACT4>.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**:
   - <FACT5>Jim chews 1 stick after dinner</FACT5>.

5. **Total Gum Chewed Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Total chewed = 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces.

6. **Gum Remaining Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Jim started with 20 pieces and chewed 6 pieces, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.

7. **Gum Given to Sister**:
   - <FACT6>Jim gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister</FACT6>.
   - Half of 14 pieces is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

8. **Gum Left at the End of the Day**:
   - After giving 7 pieces to his sister, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left.

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has {7} pieces of gum left."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Fred initially made <FACT1>24 gallons of root beer on the first day</FACT1>. 

On the same day, his <FACT2>children drank 4 gallons</FACT2>, leaving him with 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, <FACT3>his wife Barbie spilled 7 gallons</FACT3>, reducing the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, <FACT4>Ronnie drank 5 gallons</FACT4>, leaving Fred with 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, <FACT5>3 people showed up for the party</FACT5>, making a total of 4 people (including Fred) to share the remaining root beer.

Therefore, each person could drink 8 / 4 = 2 gallons of root beer.

The answer is {2}."

How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"<FACT1>Gary bought a boat for $9000</FACT1>. <FACT2>Over the first year it depreciated 30%</FACT2>. <FACT3>The second year it depreciated another 30%</FACT3>. <FACT4>The third year it depreciated 20%</FACT4>. How much is the boat worth after the three years?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially to the initial purchase price.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: 
   <FACT1>Gary bought a boat for $9000</FACT1>.

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount for the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth {3528} after three years."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, let's go through the key facts step by step:

1. Sally initially had <FACT1>25 red balloons</FACT1>, <FACT2>7 green balloons</FACT2>, and <FACT3>12 yellow balloons</FACT3>.

2. A gust of wind caused <FACT4>40% of the red balloons to burst</FACT4>. 
   - 40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. Sally accidentally <FACT5>released half of the yellow balloons</FACT5>.
   - Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

4. Sally found <FACT6>8 blue balloons caught in a tree</FACT6> and <FACT7>added 75% of them</FACT7> to her collection.
   - 75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school:

- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Total balloons = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34

Therefore, Sally finally carried {34} balloons into the school."
