The other is an unknown temperature. If he <data3>pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</data3> into his water bottle and <data4>one ounce from the other bottle</data4>, <data5>he is now able to drink the water</data5>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that allows Donny to drink the water mixture, which must be at least 40 degrees.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - <data1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</data1>.
   - He has two mugs of water. <data2>One mug is 33 degrees</data2>.
   - The other mug has an unknown temperature.
   - He pours <data3>4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</data3> into his water bottle.
   - He also pours <data4>one ounce from the other bottle</data4>.
   - <data5>He is now able to drink the water</data5>.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The total mixture is 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the unknown temperature mug, making a total of 5 ounces.
   - Let \( x \) be the temperature of the second mug.
   - The average temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

3. **Calculating the Average Temperature:**
   - The formula for the average temperature of the mixture is:
     \[
     \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5} \geq 40
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     \frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     132 + x \geq 200
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x \geq 200 - 132
     \]
     \[
     x \geq 68
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for the mixture to be at least 40 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle is {68}."

She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a <data5>combined total of 500 apples</data5>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to calculate the number of apples each sister gathered and use the total to find the missing amount.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: <data1>Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees</data1>.
   - From the shortest trees: <data2>half this amount from the shortest trees</data2>, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( x \).

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: <data3>her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees</data3>, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: <data4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</data4>, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
   - From the average trees: She doesn't take any from the average trees, so 0 apples.

3. **Total Apples Gathered:**
   - Combined total: <data5>combined total of 500 apples</data5>.

4. **Equation Setup:**
   - Joanne's total: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + \( x \) (average) = 45 + \( x \).
   - Sister's total: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.
   - Combined total: 45 + \( x \) + 105 = 500.

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - 45 + \( x \) + 105 = 500
   - \( x \) + 150 = 500
   - \( x \) = 500 - 150
   - \( x \) = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered {350} apples from the average trees."

Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes John attends each day.
- A normal student has <data1>6 periods in the day</data1>.
- John has to take <data2>2 extra classes</data2>.
- Therefore, John attends 6 + 2 = 8 classes each day.

Step 2: Calculate the total minutes John spends in class each day.
- Each class is <data3>40 minutes long</data3>.
- Therefore, John spends 8 classes * 40 minutes = 320 minutes in class each day.

Step 3: Calculate the total minutes John spends in class each week.
- John goes to class for <data4>5 days a week</data4>.
- Therefore, he spends 320 minutes/day * 5 days = 1600 minutes in class each week.

Step 4: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend.
- John spends <data5>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</data5>.
- Total extra learning time for the weekend = 2 * (1/16 * 1600 minutes) = 2 * 100 minutes = 200 minutes.

Step 5: Calculate the total learning time in minutes per week.
- Total weekly learning time = 1600 minutes (weekdays) + 200 minutes (weekend) = 1800 minutes.

Step 6: Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours.
- 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

Therefore, John spends {30} hours a week learning."

And <data4>quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service</data4>. How many checks does Buford write per year?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check he writes and how often he writes them.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   - <data1>12 checks per year for the electric bill</data1>.

2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. Therefore, he writes:
   - <data2>12 checks per year for the gas bill</data2>.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Thus, he writes:
   - <data3>2 checks per month x 12 months = 24 checks per year for the church</data3>.

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly for the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   - <data4>4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service</data4>.

Now, we add up all the checks he writes per year:
- Electric Bill: 12 checks
- Gas Bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and Lawn Service: 4 checks

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks.

Therefore, Buford writes a total of {52} checks per year."

And <data5>Mei finds half as many as Charlie</data5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to calculate the total number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei, and then subtract that from the total number of eggs Cole hid.

1. **Total Eggs Hidden**: 
   - <data1>Cole hid 3 dozen eggs</data1>. 
   - Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen eggs is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

2. **Eggs Found by Lamar**:
   - <data2>Lamar finds 5 eggs</data2>.

3. **Eggs Found by Stacy**:
   - <data3>Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar</data3>.
   - Stacy finds 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.

4. **Eggs Found by Charlie**:
   - <data4>Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy</data4>.
   - Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. **Eggs Found by Mei**:
   - <data5>Mei finds half as many as Charlie</data5>.
   - Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

6. **Total Eggs Found**:
   - Total eggs found = Lamar's eggs + Stacy's eggs + Charlie's eggs + Mei's eggs
   - Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

7. **Eggs Still Hidden**:
   - Total eggs hidden = 36 eggs.
   - Eggs still hidden = Total eggs hidden - Total eggs found
   - Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is {9}."

He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used <data5>8 slices of cheese in it</data5>. How many slices of cheese did he use?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to consider each meal separately and then sum the total.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day this week, which means he ate sandwiches for 7 days.
   - He used <data1>2 slices of cheese on each sandwich</data1>.
   - Therefore, for sandwiches, he used: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices of cheese.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast <data4>3 days in the week</data4>.
   - He used <data3>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</data3>. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, for omelets, he used: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices of cheese.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used <data5>8 slices of cheese in it</data5>.

Now, we sum the slices of cheese used for all meals:
- Total slices for sandwiches: 14
- Total slices for omelets: 9
- Total slices for macaroni and cheese: 8

Total slices of cheese used = \(14 + 9 + 8 = 31\).

Therefore, Carl used a total of {31} slices of cheese."

If <data4>Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute</data4>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference.

1. **Convert Miles to Feet:**
   - Steve lives 3 miles from the school. Since 1 mile = 5280 feet, Steve's distance in feet is:
     \[
     3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Tim lives 2 miles from the school. His distance in feet is:
     \[
     2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate Time for Each to Get Home:**
   - Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute. The time it takes for Steve to get home is:
     \[
     \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute. The time it takes for Tim to get home is:
     \[
     \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the Waiting Time:**
   - Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the faster one. The waiting time for Steve before Tim finishes is:
     \[
     40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the winner, Steve, will be waiting for 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race. The answer is {4}."

He had to take a <data3>detour that added 10 miles</data3> to his trip. After he gets there he takes a <data4>route home that is 240 miles</data4> but he <data5>goes 80 mph</data5>. How long did the trip take?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long John's entire trip took, we need to calculate the time for both the trip to his friend's house and the return trip home.

1. **Trip to Friend's House:**
   - The original distance to his friend's house is <data1>200 miles</data1>.
   - He had to take a <data3>detour that added 10 miles</data3>, making the total distance 210 miles.
   - He drives at a <data2>speed of 70 mph</data2>.

   The time taken for this part of the trip is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Return Trip Home:**
   - The route home is <data4>240 miles</data4>.
   - He drives at a <data5>speed of 80 mph</data5>.

   The time taken for the return trip is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Total Trip Time:**
   - The total time for the entire trip is the sum of the time taken for both parts:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time for John's trip is {6} hours."

On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week.

- From <data1>On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds</data1>, we know he saw 50 birds in total on these two days.
- From <data2>On day three he saw none</data2>, he saw 0 birds on day three.
- From <data3>On days four and five, he saw 120 birds</data3>, he saw 120 birds in total on these two days.
- From <data4>On day six he saw 20</data4>, he saw 20 birds on day six.
- From <data5>on day seven he saw 90</data5>, he saw 90 birds on day seven.

Now, add up all the birds he saw:

50 (days one and two) + 0 (day three) + 120 (days four and five) + 20 (day six) + 90 (day seven) = 280 birds in total.

Step 2: Calculate the average number of birds seen per day.

There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of birds by 7:

280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day on average.

Therefore, Mack saw an average of {40} birds per day."

What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: Rita removed <data1>39 Junebugs</data1>.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday**: On each of these days, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. Therefore, for each day, she removed 2 * <data1>39</data1> = 78 Junebugs. So, for both days combined, she removed 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs.

3. **Thursday**: She removed <data3>48 Junebugs</data3>.

4. **Friday**: She removed <data4>57 Junebugs</data4>.

Now, we sum up the Junebugs removed over the five days:

- Monday: 39
- Tuesday and Wednesday: 156
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):

Average = 300 / 5 = 60

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is {60}."

She <data4>sells an average of 4 cups per hour</data4> that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade and then find out how much profit she makes per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups Millie can sell.
Millie makes <data1>3 pitchers of lemonade</data1>, and <data2>each pitcher holds 12 cups</data2>. Therefore, the total number of cups is:
3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
Millie <data3>sells each cup of lemonade for $1</data3>. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is:
36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of supplies.
Millie <data1>spends $18 to buy enough supplies</data1>.

Step 4: Calculate the total profit.
Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profit = $36 - $18 = $18.

Step 5: Calculate the profit per hour.
Millie <data4>sells an average of 4 cups per hour</data4>. Since she sells 36 cups in total, the number of hours she spends running the lemonade stand is:
36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours.

Therefore, the profit per hour is:
Total profit / Total hours = $18 / 9 hours = $2 per hour.

To determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to analyze the given data step by step.

1. **Cost of Tattered Jeans**: 
   - According to <data1>, the tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Cost of Jogger Jeans**:
   - From <data2>, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

3. **Total Savings**:
   - <data3> states that Cole saved a total of $6.

4. **Distribution of Savings**:
   - According to <data4>, Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans. Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of $6, which is $2.
   - From <data5>, the rest of the savings, which is 2/3 of $6, comes from the tattered jeans. This amounts to $4.

5. **Original Cost of Jogger Jeans**:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate how much money he has already spent and how much he has left.

1. **Calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:**

   - **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:** 
     Colby saw <data6>5 movies on a Friday or Saturday</data6>. 
     Each ticket costs <data2>$10</data2>.
     Total cost for these movies = 5 * $10 = $50.

   - **Movies on other days:**
     Colby saw <data7>8 movies on other days</data7>.
     Each ticket costs <data3>$7</data3>.
     Total cost for these movies = 8 * $7 = $56.

   - **Popcorn:**
     Colby had <data8>2 tubs of popcorn</data8>.
     Each tub costs <data4>$8</data4>.
     Total cost for popcorn = 2 * $8 = $16.

   - **Candy:**
     Colby had <data9>four boxes of candy</data9>.
     Each box costs <data5>$2</data5>.
     Total cost for candy = 4 * $2 = $8.

2. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   Total spent = $50 (movies on Fri/Sat) + $56 (movies on other days) + $16 (popcorn) + $8 (candy) = $130.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount:**
   Colby's parents give him <data1>$150 to spend at the movies</data1>.
   Remaining amount = $150 - $130 = $20.

4. **Determine how many movies he can see on the last day:**
   It's a Friday, so the ticket cost is <data2>$10</data2>.
   Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy, which will cost <data4>$8</data4> + <data5>$2</data5> = $10.

   - Total cost for one movie, popcorn, and candy = $10 (movie) + $10 (popcorn and candy) = $20.

   Since Colby has exactly $20 left, he can see 1 movie on the last day.

Therefore, the number of movies Colby can see on the last day is {1}."

If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then see how many days it can last with the daily usage of 20%.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a <data1>5-inch piece of chalk</data1>.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: By the end of Monday, the teacher <data2>used up 45% of the chalk</data2>. 
   - 45% of 5 inches is \(0.45 \times 5 = 2.25\) inches.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk length after Monday is \(5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

3. **Daily Usage from Tuesday Onwards**: The teacher plans to use <data3>20% of the chalk each day</data3>.
   - 20% of the remaining 2.75 inches is \(0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55\) inches per day.

4. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher <data4>recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches</data4>.
   - The chalk is currently 2.75 inches long. 
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to reduce from 2.75 inches to below 2 inches.

5. **Calculating Days Until Recycling**:
   - After 1 day of using 0.55 inches, the chalk will be \(2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20\) inches.
   - After 2 days, the chalk will be \(2.20 - 0.55 = 1.65\) inches.

Since the chalk will be less than 2 inches after 2 days, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days before it needs to be recycled.

Therefore, the teacher has {2} days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk."

She also has <data3>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each</data3>. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the selling price of the boards after the price increase and then subtract the original cost.

1. **Original Cost Calculation:**
   - Sasha has <data2>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each</data2>. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is 10 boards * $10/board = $100.
   - She also has <data3>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each</data3>. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is 5 boards * $16/board = $80.
   - The total original cost for all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.

2. **Selling Price Calculation:**
   - The prices for lumber have gone up <data1>50%</data1>. Therefore, the selling price for each type of board will be 150% of the original price.
   - The selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 * 1.50 = $15. For ten boards, the total selling price is 10 boards * $15/board = $150.
   - The selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 * 1.50 = $24. For five boards, the total selling price is 5 boards * $24/board = $120.
   - The total selling price for all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is calculated as the total selling price minus the total original cost.
   - Profit = $270 (total selling price) - $180 (total original cost) = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of {90}."

If <data6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed</data6> among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of straw used by each type of rodent and then solve for the number of rats.

1. **Calculate the straw used by the hamsters:**
   - There are <data3>10 cages of hamsters</data3>.
   - <data4>Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw</data4>.
   - Therefore, the total straw used by the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Calculate the straw used by the rabbits:**
   - <data5>20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</data5>.
   - Therefore, the total straw used by the rabbits is 20 pieces.

3. **Calculate the straw used by the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is <data6>160 pieces</data6>.
   - The straw used by the hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.
   - Therefore, the straw used by the rats is \(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - <data2>Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw</data2>.
   - Let \(r\) be the total number of rats. Then, \(6r = 90\).
   - Solving for \(r\), we get \(r = 90 / 6 = 15\).

5. **Determine the number of rats in each cage:**
   - <data1>Rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups</data1>.
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(15 / 3 = 5\).

The number of rats in each cage is {5}."

How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Carmen spends on the desk, we need to consider the sequence of bids and how they increase.

1. **Initial Bid**: Carmen starts with the <data1>opening bid of $200</data1>.

2. **Bid Increments**: Each bid increases by <data2>$50</data2>.

3. **Other Bidders**: There are <data3>3 other people each bidding once</data3>.

4. **Carmen's Bids**: Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, as stated in <data4>Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people</data4>.

Let's break down the bidding process:

- Carmen's initial bid: $200
- First other person bids: $200 + $50 = $250
- Carmen bids after the first person: $250 + $50 = $300
- Second other person bids: $300 + $50 = $350
- Carmen bids after the second person: $350 + $50 = $400
- Third other person bids: $400 + $50 = $450
- Carmen bids after the third person: $450 + $50 = $500

Carmen wins the auction with her final bid of $500.

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen {500} dollars."

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the costs of each venue.

1. **First Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - The first venue charges a flat fee of <data1>$200</data1>.
   - Additionally, Mark estimates that food will cost <data2>$5 for each person</data2>.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue with \( x \) guests is: 
     \[
     \text{Cost for first venue} = 200 + 5x
     \]

2. **Second Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - The second venue charges <data3>$25 per person</data3>, which includes food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue with \( x \) guests is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for second venue} = 25x
     \]

3. **Setting the Costs Equal:**
   - To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, set the two cost equations equal to each other:
     \[
     200 + 5x = 25x
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20} = 10
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is {10}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool**:
   The volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying its width, length, and depth.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} \times \text{Depth}
   \]
   Using the given measurements:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{<data1>14 feet wide</data1>} \times \text{<data2>25 feet long</data2>} \times \text{<data3>4 feet deep</data3>}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert Volume to Gallons**:
   According to the instructions, multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons.
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = \text{Volume} \times \text{<data4>5.9</data4>}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost to Fill the Pool**:
   The cost is determined by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons} \times \text{<data5>$0.10 per gallon</data5>}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars}

How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many were in it yet.

2. <data1>Her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons</data1> and gave them to Julia. This means Julia received an additional 5 spoons from her husband.

3. <data2>She used three of the spoons to sample her stew</data2>. This implies that 3 spoons were temporarily unavailable for setting the table.

4. <data3>She had a total of 12 spoons</data3> when she went to set the table. This total includes the spoons from both packages minus the 3 spoons used for sampling.

Let's calculate the number of spoons in the package Julia bought:

- Let x be the number of spoons in the package Julia bought.
- The total number of spoons she had after receiving the 5 spoons from her husband is x + 5.
- She used 3 spoons, so the number of spoons available for setting the table is (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.
- According to <data3>, she had a total of 12 spoons available for setting the table.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 2 = 12

How much did he lose on average that day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

1. **First Race:**
   - He <data1>lost $5</data1>.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He <data2>won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</data2>.
   - Twice the amount he lost in the first race is 2 * $5 = $10.
   - Therefore, he won $10 + $1 = $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   - He <data3>lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</data3>.
   - He won $11 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total loss:

- Total loss = Loss in the first race + Loss in the third race
- Total loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5

Since there were three races, the average loss per race is:

- Average loss = Total loss / Number of races
- Average loss = $21.5 / 3 ≈ $7.17

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost on average approximately $7.17 that day. The answer is {7.17}."

   - Geometry set: <data8>one geometry set</data8> at <data4>$10</data4> = 1 * 10 = $10.00

2. Add up the total cost of all items:
   Total cost = $7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (pens) + $12.00 (calculator) + $10.00 (geometry set) = $30.00

3. Apply the discount:
   - The shop gives a <data9>10% discount</data9> on all the purchased items.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * 30.00 = $3.00

4. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   - Final cost = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend {27} dollars on all the items he wants to buy."

How many bandages did they start with on the first day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days, and the number of bandages left at the end.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The nurses' station orders <data1>bandages in bulk packs of 50</data1>.

2. **First Day:**
   - They used <data2>38 bandages</data2>.
   - They ordered <data3>one bulk pack of bandages</data3>, which is 50 bandages.

3. **Second Day:**
   - They used <data4>ten fewer bandages</data4> than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

4. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered <data5>two bulk packs of bandages</data5>, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.
   - They used <data6>half a pack</data6>, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

5. **End of Third Day:**
   - They had <data7>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</data7>.

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered:

- Total bandages used over three days = 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
- Total bandages ordered = 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day. The equation for the total bandages is:

\[ x - 91 + 150 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x + 59 = 78 \]

\[ x = 78 - 59 \]

\[ x = 19 \]

Therefore, the nurses' station started with {19} bandages on the first day."

If <data4>she has 110 books</data4>, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase and then see how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books.

1. **Middle Shelves Capacity**:
   - <data1>Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books</data1>.
   - Therefore, the total capacity of the middle shelves is 2 * 10 = 20 books.

2. **Bottom Shelf Capacity**:
   - <data2>The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf</data2>.
   - Since a middle shelf holds 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

3. **Top Shelf Capacity**:
   - <data3>The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf</data3>.
   - The bottom shelf holds 20 books, so the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

4. **Total Capacity of One Bookcase**:
   - Adding up the capacities: 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books per bookcase.

5. **Number of Bookcases Needed**:
   - <data4>She has 110 books</data4>.
   - To find out how many bookcases are needed, divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 / 55 = 2.

Therefore, Elly needs {2} bookcases to hold all of her books."

1. **Monday and Tuesday:**
   - According to <data2>, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night. Therefore, he watched 2 hours in total on these two days.

2. **Thursday:**
   - As per <data3>, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. This totals 1.5 hours for Thursday.

3. **Friday:**
   - According to <data4>, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which equals 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total hours accounted for so far:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these up gives us:
2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

4. **Total TV watching:**
   - According to <data1>, Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in total.

5. **Wednesday:**
   - The remaining time for Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

When James came back yet again, <data4>3 dogs were gone</data4> so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many toys James needs in total, let's break down the situation step by step using the provided data:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - <data1>James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</data1>. This means initially, there is a 1:1 ratio of toys to dogs.

2. **First Change:**
   - <data2>There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</data2>. This means there are now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs in total.
   - To maintain the 1:1 ratio, James needs 12 toys in total. Since he already has 4 toys, he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

3. **Second Change:**
   - After buying the toys, <data3>there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</data3>. Initially, there were 12 dogs, so now there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
   - To maintain the 1:1 ratio, James needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

4. **Third Change:**
   - <data4>3 dogs were gone</data4>, so there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs.
   - To maintain the 1:1 ratio, James needs 21 toys in total. He already has 24 toys, so he doesn't need to buy any more toys and actually has 3 extra toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21. 

The answer is {21}."

With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to consider both the flashlights and the candles separately.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights.**

- There are <data1>4 people living there</data1>, and <data2>a flashlight for every person</data2>. Therefore, there are 4 flashlights for the people.
- Additionally, there are <data3>8 rooms in the house</data3>, and there are two flashlights for each room. Therefore, there are 8 rooms x 2 flashlights per room = 16 flashlights for the rooms.

Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of candles.**

- There are <data3>8 rooms in the house</data3>. Half of the rooms have <data4>4 small candles each</data4>, and the other half have <data5>5 medium candles each</data5>.
- Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 rooms x 4 candles = 16 small candles.
- The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 rooms x 5 candles = 20 medium candles.

Total candles = 16 (small candles) + 20 (medium candles) = 36 candles.

**Step 3: Combine the total number of candles and flashlights.**

Total candles and flashlights = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.

Therefore, Brianna's family is using a total of {56} candles and flashlights when the lights go out."

If <data5>Erika now only needs an extra $50</data5> to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in and then account for the money she has received and still needs.

1. **Initial Cost of the Laptop**: 
   - The laptop costs <data1>$600</data1>.

2. **Trade-in Reduction**:
   - The price is reduced by <data2>$200</data2> if she trades in her old laptop.
   - New cost of the laptop = $600 - $200 = $400.

3. **Money from Part-time Job**:
   - Erika was paid <data3>$150</data3> this week.

4. **Money from Mom**:
   - Her mom gives her <data4>$80</data4>.

5. **Additional Money Needed**:
   - Erika still needs an extra <data5>$50</data5> to buy the laptop.

Now, let's calculate how much money Erika has in total, excluding her purse savings:

- Total money from job and mom = $150 + $80 = $230.

Since she still needs an extra $50, we can set up the equation:

- Total money needed = New cost of the laptop - Total money from job and mom + Extra money needed
- $400 = $230 + $50 + Money in purse

Solving for the money in her purse:

- Money in purse = $400 - $230 - $50 = $120.

Therefore, Erika has {120} dollars in her purse."

On average, how many branches did he climb per day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to use the information provided in the data tags.

First, we know that <data1>every branch he has to climb up costs $0.25</data1>. This means that for each branch, Felix earns $0.25.

Next, we know that <data2>during the week he made $105</data2>. This is the total amount he earned for the entire week.

To find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week, we divide the total earnings by the amount earned per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Earnings per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25

Calculating this gives us:

Total branches climbed = 420

Since a week typically consists of 7 days, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 / 7

Calculating this gives us:

Average branches per day = 60

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day. The final answer is {60}."

The <data3>shore was 64 seconds away</data3>. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use the rate of water intake to find the total amount of water.

1. **Calculate the rowing speed and total distance:**
   - From <data2>it took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet</data2>, we can determine her rowing speed. She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, which means she rows 1.25 feet per second.
   - The <data3>shore was 64 seconds away</data3>. At a speed of 1.25 feet per second, the total distance to the shore is 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - The boat takes on <data1>two liters of water for every ten feet</data1> she rows. 
   - For 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters = 16 liters.

Therefore, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on {16} liters of water."

When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <data4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</data4>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break it down step by step using the provided data.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had a total of 7 fish in his pond.
   - Out of these, <data1>3 were orange</data1> and <data2>4 were white</data2>.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store:**
   - Bob bought <data3>17 fish</data3> from the store.

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob found that he had <data4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</data4>.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of orange fish bought.
- \( y \) as the number of white fish bought.

From the initial count, we know:
- Initial orange fish = 3
- Initial white fish = 4

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish is \( 4 + y \).

According to the condition given:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

We also know:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

From the equation \( x + y = 17 \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[ x = 17 - y \]

Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):
\[ 3 + (17 - y) = 2(4 + y) \]
\[ 20 - y = 8 + 2y \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2y + y \]
\[ 12 = 3y \]
\[ y = 4 \]

Thus, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is {4}."

If the rink has <data4>75 cars in total</data4>, how many yellow cars do they have?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the number of yellow cars, we need to calculate the number of each type of car and then subtract from the total.

1. **Red Cars**: The rink has <data1>12 red cars</data1>.

2. **Green Cars**: They have <data2>2 fewer green cars than they have red cars</data2>. Therefore, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

3. **Blue Cars**: They have <data3>3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars</data3>. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

4. **Total Cars**: The rink has <data4>75 cars in total</data4>.

Now, we calculate the number of yellow cars:

- Total number of red, green, and blue cars = 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

- Therefore, the number of yellow cars = Total cars - (Red + Green + Blue) = 75 - 52 = 23.

Thus, the number of yellow cars is {23}."

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate Clara's total cost on Tuesday.**

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each:
- Total cost before discount = 20 pomegranates * $20 each = $400.

Clara had a $2 voucher:
- Total cost after voucher = $400 - $2 = $398.

**Step 2: Calculate Sheila's total cost on Wednesday.**

The price per pomegranate increased to $30:
- Total cost before discount = 20 pomegranates * $30 each = $600.

The store offered a 10% discount:
- Discount amount = 10% of $600 = 0.10 * $600 = $60.
- Total cost after discount = $600 - $60 = $540.

**Step 3: Find the difference between the final prices paid.**

Difference = Sheila's total cost - Clara's total cost = $540 - $398 = $142.

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is {142}."

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the data tags.

1. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

2. According to <data1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).

3. According to <data2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

4. According to <data3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   \[
   2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
   \]

6. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   4x + x + 8 = 38
   \]
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

7. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

8. Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

9. Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:
   \[
   x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
   \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved {10} tennis balls in the first set."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To calculate the total time they all took to do their chores, we need to determine the time each person spent on their task and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - According to <data1>Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours</data1>, Amalia spent 4 hours on her task.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - From <data2>Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia</data2>, we know Megan took 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 2 hours = 6 hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - According to <data3>Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn</data3>, Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia. Since ""well over"" suggests a significant amount more, let's assume Dior took at least 5 hours longer than Amalia. Therefore, Dior took 4 hours (Amalia's time) + 5 hours = 9 hours.

Now, we sum the times for all three:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours

Total time = 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is {19}."

How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the petals for each type of flower Rose picked, account for the flowers she dropped, and then sum the petals of the remaining flowers.

1. **Initial Petal Count:**
   - Rose picks <data1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</data1>. This gives her 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
   - She then picks <data2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</data2>. This gives her 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
   - She adds another <data3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</data3>. This gives her 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
   - Lastly, she picks <data4>6 flowers with 7 petals each</data4>. This gives her 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Adding these up, the total number of petals before any are dropped is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

3. **Adjusting for Dropped Flowers:**
   - Rose <data5>drops 1 of each type of flower</data5>. This means:
     - She drops 1 flower with 5 petals, losing 5 petals.
     - She drops 1 flower with 6 petals, losing 6 petals.
     - She drops 1 flower with 4 petals, losing 4 petals.
     - She drops 1 flower with 7 petals, losing 7 petals.

4. **Total Petals Lost:**
   - The total number of petals lost is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

5. **Final Petal Count in the Vase:**
   - Subtracting the lost petals from the initial total, we have 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is {79}."

What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not have to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**: 
   - There's a <data1>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</data1>. 
   - This means there's a 50% chance he won't have to turn it in because of the substitute teacher.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher comes in (which is the remaining 50% chance), there's a <data2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</data2>.
   - This means there's a 50% * 40% = 20% chance he won't have to turn it in because of a class-wide extension.

3. **Personal Extension Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give a class-wide extension (which is 50% * 60% = 30% chance), there's still a <data3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</data3>.
   - This means there's a 30% * 20% = 6% chance he won't have to turn it in because of a personal extension.

Now, we add up all the probabilities where Marcus does not have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute Teacher: 50%
- Class-wide Extension: 20%
- Personal Extension: 6%

Total probability of not turning in the homework = 50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is the complement of this probability:
100% - 76% = 24%.

The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is {24}."

He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 5 am is 12 hours, and from 5 am to 10 am is an additional 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the total duration of Cameron's stay is 12 + 5 = 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The cost for the first 12 hours is <data1>1000 pesos</data1>.
   - For the additional 5 hours, Cameron pays <data3>70 pesos for every additional hour</data3>.
   - Additional cost = 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost for this option = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is <data2>1600 pesos</data2>.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay with additional hours
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save {250} pesos by choosing the 12-hour stay option with additional hours instead of the 24-hour stay option."

How many slices of pizza were left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
There are 5 people, and <data1>each pizza had 12 slices</data1>. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Step 2: Calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and two friends.
<data2>Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas</data2>. Since there are 3 people in this group, they each ate:
2/3 * 12 = 8 slices per person.
Total slices eaten by this group = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends.
<data3>The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas</data3>. Since there are 2 people in this group, they each ate:
3/4 * 12 = 9 slices per person.
Total slices eaten by this group = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

Step 4: Calculate the total slices eaten.
Total slices eaten = 24 (by Bryce and two friends) + 18 (by the two remaining friends) = 42 slices.

Step 5: Calculate the slices left.
Total slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is {18}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit required:**
   Andy wants to lose <data1>30 lbs.</data1> and he needs to <data4>burn 3500 calories to lose a pound</data4>. Therefore, the total calorie deficit required is:
   \[
   30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105,000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the time frame for achieving the goal:**
   Andy wants to achieve this goal by his birthday, which is <data2>July 19th</data2>. Today is <data3>December 31st</data3>. We need to calculate the number of days between these two dates.

   - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
   - March: 31 days
   - April: 30 days
   - May: 31 days
   - June: 30 days
   - July: 19 days

   Adding these up gives:
   \[
   31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 200 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ days}} = 525 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal by July 19th. The answer is {525}."

If <data3>it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</data3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to consider the following information:

1. <data3>It takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</data3>. This means Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes.

2. <data2>The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</data2>. Since Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, Bernadette's drive will take 4 times 4 minutes, which is 16 minutes.

3. <data1>Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne</data1>. This means Bernadette needs to complete her journey 5 minutes earlier than Wayne.

Now, let's calculate the time difference in their departure times:

- Wayne's total time to arrive at the theater is 4 minutes.
- Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to complete her 16-minute drive 5 minutes before Wayne's 4-minute drive ends.

To achieve this, Bernadette should leave 16 minutes (her drive time) + 5 minutes (to arrive earlier) = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first. The answer is {21}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Fred initially made <data1>24 gallons of root beer on the first day</data1>. 

On the same day, <data2>his children drank 4 gallons</data2>, leaving him with 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, <data3>his wife Barbie spilled 7 gallons</data3>, reducing the amount to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, <data4>Ronnie drank 5 gallons</data4>, leaving Fred with 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, <data5>3 people showed up for the party</data5>. Including Fred, there were 4 people in total.

The remaining 8 gallons of root beer were shared equally among the 4 people, so each person got 8 / 4 = 2 gallons.

Therefore, each person at the party had {2} gallons of root beer to drink."

How much is the boat worth after the three years?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially to the initial purchase price.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: 
   - <data1>Gary bought a boat for $9000</data1>.

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount for the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years of depreciation. The final answer is {3528}."

What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, let's go through the information step by step:

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Sally initially had <data1>25 red balloons</data1>, <data2>7 green balloons</data2>, and <data3>12 yellow balloons</data3>.

2. **Red Balloons Burst:**
   - A gust of wind caused <data4>40% of the red balloons to burst</data4>.
   - 40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally accidentally <data5>released half of the yellow balloons</data5>.
   - Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

4. **Blue Balloons Added:**
   - Sally found <data6>8 blue balloons caught in a tree</data6>.
   - She <data7>added 75% of them</data7> to her remaining balloons.
   - 75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

5. **Total Balloons Carried into School:**
   - Total balloons = Remaining red balloons + Green balloons + Remaining yellow balloons + Added blue balloons.
   - Total balloons = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34 balloons.

Therefore, Sally finally carried {34} balloons into the school."
