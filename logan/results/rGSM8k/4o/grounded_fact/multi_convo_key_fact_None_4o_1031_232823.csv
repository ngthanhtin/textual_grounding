At least how many degrees is the second bottle?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water that allows Donny to drink the mixture, which must be at least 40 degrees.

1. **Understanding the Requirement:**
   - <key_fact1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</key_fact1>.

2. **Details of the Mugs:**
   - <key_fact2>One mug is 33 degrees</key_fact2>.
   - The other mug has an unknown temperature.

3. **Mixture Composition:**
   - <key_fact3>He pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</key_fact3>.
   - <key_fact4>He pours one ounce from the other bottle</key_fact4>.

4. **Resulting Mixture:**
   - <key_fact5>He is now able to drink the water</key_fact5>, meaning the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

5. **Calculating the Required Temperature:**
   - The total volume of the mixture is 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, totaling 5 ounces.
   - Let \( x \) be the temperature of the second mug.
   - The average temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

   The equation for the average temperature is:
   \[
   \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5} \geq 40
   \]

   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40
   \]

   Multiply both sides by 5:
   \[
   132 + x \geq 200
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x \geq 200 - 132
   \]
   \[
   x \geq 68
   \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The answer is {68}."

He gets <key_fact5>charged $2 per mile driven</key_fact5> and he also gives his driver a <key_fact6>$150 bonus per month</key_fact6>. How much does he pay a year for driving?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate both the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonuses.

1. **Calculate the total miles driven per week:**
   - <key_fact1>His work is 30 miles away</key_fact1>, so he travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day.
   - Therefore, he drives 30 * 2 = 60 miles per day.
   - <key_fact3>He goes to work 5 days a week</key_fact3>, so he drives 60 * 5 = 300 miles per week.

2. **Calculate the total miles driven per year:**
   - <key_fact4>He works for 50 weeks a year</key_fact4>, so he drives 300 * 50 = 15,000 miles per year.

3. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - <key_fact5>He gets charged $2 per mile driven</key_fact5>, so the cost for the miles is 15,000 * 2 = $30,000 per year.

4. **Calculate the total bonus paid per year:**
   - <key_fact6>He gives his driver a $150 bonus per month</key_fact6>.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is 150 * 12 = $1,800 per year.

5. **Calculate the total cost per year:**
   - Add the cost of the miles and the bonuses: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, John pays a total of {31,800} per year for driving."

   - Total cost for magnets = 4 * $0.25 = $1.00

4. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total spent = Cost of taffy + Cost of seashells + Cost of magnets
   - Total spent = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

5. **Calculate the remaining money:**
   - <key_fact1>Her parents gave her $10</key_fact1>
   - Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, Sally has {3.00} left."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Shawnda made that day, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert the total cost from cents to dollars.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - According to <key_fact2>5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated</key_fact2>.
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles have 5 * 2 = 10 tires.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - According to <key_fact3>3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated</key_fact3>.
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles have 3 * 3 = 9 tires.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - According to <key_fact4>one person actually came by on a unicycle</key_fact4>.
   - A unicycle has 1 tire, so 1 unicycle has 1 tire.

4. **Total Tires:**
   - Total tires inflated = 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - According to <key_fact1>each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</key_fact1>.
   - Total cost in cents = 20 tires * 25 cents/tire = 500 cents.

6. **Convert to Dollars:**

She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a <key_fact5>combined total of 500 apples</key_fact5>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to calculate the number of apples each sister gathered and use the total number of apples gathered.

1. **Joanne's Apple Gathering:**
   - From the tallest trees: <key_fact1>Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees</key_fact1>.
   - From the shortest trees: <key_fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</key_fact2>, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( x \).

2. **Sister's Apple Gathering:**
   - From the tallest trees: <key_fact3>her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees</key_fact3>, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: <key_fact4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</key_fact4>, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
   - From the average trees: She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

3. **Total Apples Gathered:**
   - According to <key_fact5>the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples</key_fact5>.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of apples:

Joanne's apples: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + \( x \) (average) = 45 + \( x \).

Sister's apples: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest) = 105.

Combined total: 45 + \( x \) + 105 = 500.

Solving for \( x \):

150 + \( x \) = 500

\( x \) = 500 - 150

\( x \) = 350

Therefore, Joanne gathered {350} apples from the average trees."

How many cups of mint tea are in each row?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many cups of mint tea are in each row, let's break down the problem using the key facts provided:

1. Lana has a total of <key_fact1>27 cups</key_fact1>.
2. She divides these into <key_fact2>3 rows</key_fact2>.
3. She uses the <key_fact3>remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea</key_fact3>.

Step-by-step reasoning:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total cost James incurred to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   - The plane cost James <key_fact1>$150,000</key_fact1>.

2. **Monthly Hanger Rent:**
   - James pays <key_fact2>$5000 a month to rent a hanger</key_fact2>.
   - For one year, the total hanger rent is 12 months * $5000/month = $60,000.

3. **Monthly Fuel Cost:**
   - James spends <key_fact3>twice as much as the hanger rent on fuel per month</key_fact3>.
   - Therefore, the monthly fuel cost is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.
   - For one year, the total fuel cost is 12 months * $10,000/month = $120,000.

4. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   - Add the initial cost of the plane, the total hanger rent for the year, and the total fuel cost for the year:
   - Total cost = $150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000.

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is {330,000}."

He then spends <key_fact5>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</key_fact5> as extra learning time. How many hours a week does he spend learning?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total minutes he spends in class during the week and then add the extra learning time on the weekend.

1. **Calculate the daily class time:**
   - A normal student has <key_fact1>6 periods in the day</key_fact1>.
   - John has to take <key_fact2>2 extra classes</key_fact2>.
   - Therefore, John has 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day.
   - Each class is <key_fact3>40 minutes long</key_fact3>.
   - So, John spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class per day.

2. **Calculate the weekly class time:**
   - John goes to class for <key_fact4>5 days a week</key_fact4>.
   - Therefore, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class per week.

3. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - John spends <key_fact5>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</key_fact5>.
   - Total weekly minutes in class = 1600.
   - Extra learning time per day on the weekend = 1600 / 16 = 100 minutes.
   - Total extra learning time for Saturday and Sunday = 100 * 2 = 200 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total weekly learning time:**
   - Total weekly learning time = 1600 (class time) + 200 (extra learning time) = 1800 minutes.

5. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - 1800 minutes = 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

Therefore, John spends {30} hours a week learning."

How long did it take him to get across the lake?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem using the key facts provided.

1. **Calculate the initial swimming distance and time:**
   - James swims across a <key_fact1>20-mile lake</key_fact1>.
   - He swims <key_fact3>60% of the distance</key_fact3>.
   - 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
   - He swims at a pace of <key_fact2>2 miles per hour</key_fact2>.
   - Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - After swimming 60% of the distance, he rests for <key_fact4>half as long as the swimming time</key_fact4>.
   - Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

If <key_fact4>Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute</key_fact4>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home and then find the difference between these times.

1. **Calculate Steve's travel time:**
   - Steve lives <key_fact1>3 miles from the school</key_fact1>.
   - Convert miles to feet: 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet.
   - Steve's speed is <key_fact2>440 feet per minute</key_fact2>.
   - Time for Steve = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes.

2. **Calculate Tim's travel time:**
   - Tim lives <key_fact3>2 miles away from the school</key_fact3>.
   - Convert miles to feet: 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet.
   - Tim's speed is <key_fact4>264 feet per minute</key_fact4>.
   - Time for Tim = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes.

3. **Determine the winner and calculate the waiting time:**
   - Steve takes 36 minutes, and Tim takes 40 minutes.
   - Steve is the winner since he takes less time.
   - The waiting time for Steve before Tim finishes = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

Therefore, the winner, Steve, will be waiting for {4} minutes before Tim finishes the race."

How much did everything cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Suits:**
   - James buys <key_fact1>10 suits</key_fact1>.
   - Each suit costs <key_fact4>$750</key_fact4>.
   - Total cost for suits = 10 suits * $750/suit = $7,500.

2. **Cost of Dress Pants:**
   - James buys <key_fact2>10 dress pants</key_fact2>.
   - The cost of each dress pant is <key_fact5>1/5 the cost of a suit</key_fact5>.
   - Cost per dress pant = $750/5 = $150.
   - Total cost for dress pants = 10 dress pants * $150/dress pant = $1,500.

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys <key_fact3>3 dress shirts per suit</key_fact3>.
   - Total number of dress shirts = 10 suits * 3 shirts/suit = 30 shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs <key_fact6>$60</key_fact6>.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = 30 shirts * $60/shirt = $1,800.

4. **Total Cost:**

After he gets there he takes a <key_fact4>route home that is 240 miles</key_fact4> but he <key_fact5>goes 80 mph</key_fact5>. How long did the trip take?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long the entire trip took, we need to calculate the time for both the trip to the friend's house and the return trip home.

**Trip to the Friend's House:**
1. The original distance to the friend's house is <key_fact1>200 miles</key_fact1>.
2. John had to take a <key_fact3>detour that added 10 miles</key_fact3>, making the total distance 210 miles.
3. He drives at a <key_fact2>speed of 70 mph</key_fact2>.

The time taken for this part of the trip is calculated as:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

**Return Trip Home:**
1. The route home is <key_fact4>240 miles</key_fact4>.
2. He drives at a <key_fact5>speed of 80 mph</key_fact5>.

The time taken for the return trip is calculated as:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

**Total Trip Time:**
The total time for the entire trip is the sum of the time taken to drive to the friend's house and the time taken to return home:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total trip took {6} hours."

What is the average number of Junebugs that she removes per day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

1. On Monday, Rita removed <key_fact1>39 Junebugs</key_fact1>.

2. On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. Therefore, on each of these days, she removed 2 * <key_fact1>39</key_fact1> = 78 Junebugs. So, for Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she removed 78 + 78 = 156 Junebugs.

3. On Thursday, she removed <key_fact3>48 Junebugs</key_fact3>.

4. On Friday, she removed <key_fact4>57 Junebugs</key_fact4>.

Now, we sum up the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:

- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

Total = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):

Average = 300 / 5 = 60

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is {60}."

What percent of the plants are flowering plants?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   According to <key_fact2>one-fourth of her plants are indoor plants</key_fact2>. Therefore, the number of indoor plants is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \text{<key_fact1>100 plants</key_fact1>} = 25 \text{ indoor plants}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants:**
   Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total number of plants:
   \[
   \text{<key_fact1>100 plants</key_fact1>} - 25 = 75 \text{ remaining plants}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   According to <key_fact3>two-thirds of the remaining are outdoor plants</key_fact3>. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

   \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \text{ outdoor plants}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of flowering plants:**
   The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:
   \[
   75 - 50 = 25 \text{ flowering plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   To find the percentage of flowering plants out of the total number of plants:
   \[
   \frac{25}{\text{<key_fact1>100 plants</key_fact1>}} \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is {25%}."

If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to calculate the total revenue she earns from selling all the lemonade, subtract the cost of supplies, and then divide by the number of hours she spends selling.

1. **Calculate the total number of cups Millie can sell:**
   - Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade.
   - <key_fact2>Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade</key_fact2>.
   - Therefore, the total number of cups is 3 pitchers * 12 cups/pitcher = 36 cups.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:**
   - Millie <key_fact3>sells each cup of lemonade for $1</key_fact3>.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 36 cups is 36 cups * $1/cup = $36.

3. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - Millie <key_fact1>spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade</key_fact1>.

4. **Calculate the total profit:**

How many boys are in the third class?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many boys are in the third class, we need to use the key facts provided:

1. <key_fact1>Each class in a school has 20 students</key_fact1>.
2. <key_fact2>There are 3 classes</key_fact2>.
3. <key_fact3>The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls</key_fact3>.
4. <key_fact4>The first class has 15 girls</key_fact4>.
5. <key_fact5>The second class has 12 girls</key_fact5>.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- First, calculate the total number of students in the school. Since <key_fact1>each class has 20 students</key_fact1> and <key_fact2>there are 3 classes</key_fact2>, the total number of students is 20 * 3 = 60 students.

- According to <key_fact3>, the school is 50% boys and 50% girls. Therefore, there are 60 * 0.5 = 30 girls and 30 boys in the entire school.

- From <key_fact4>, the first class has 15 girls. Since each class has 20 students, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5 boys.

- From <key_fact5>, the second class has 12 girls. Therefore, the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8 boys.

- Now, calculate the total number of girls in the first and second classes: 15 (from the first class) + 12 (from the second class) = 27 girls.

- Since there are 30 girls in total in the school, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

- Finally, since the third class also has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is {17}."

How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day separately using the given key facts.

**Step 1: Calculate Thursday's Revenue**

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs:
- <key_fact3>6 truck tires</key_fact3> at <key_fact1>$60 per truck tire</key_fact1>
- <key_fact3>4 car tires</key_fact3> at <key_fact2>$40 per car tire</key_fact2>

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160

Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Step 2: Calculate Friday's Revenue**

On Friday, the mechanic repairs:
- <key_fact4>12 car tires</key_fact4> at <key_fact2>$40 per car tire</key_fact2>
- No truck tires are repaired on Friday

Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480

Total revenue on Friday = $480

**Step 3: Determine the Day with Higher Revenue and the Difference**

Thursday's revenue = $520
Friday's revenue = $480

The day with higher revenue is Thursday. The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is $520 - $480 = $40.

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on the day with higher revenue. The answer is {40}."

To determine how many buttons Lorraine has by the end, we need to follow the steps of her trades using the key facts provided.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with <key_fact1>30 small stickers</key_fact1> and <key_fact2>40 large stickers</key_fact2>.

2. **Trading Small Stickers:**
   - She trades <key_fact3>90% of her small stickers for large buttons</key_fact3>.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers is 27 small stickers.
   - Since each large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons from this trade.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - After trading 90% of her small stickers, she has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers left.

4. **Trading Large Stickers:**
   - She trades <key_fact4>50% of her large stickers for large buttons</key_fact4>.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers is 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

5. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons.
   - The remaining 20 large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons from this trade.

6. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons: 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Small buttons: 3 (remaining small stickers) + 60 (from large stickers) = 63 small buttons.

Therefore, by the end, Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 63 small buttons. The total number of buttons is 29 large buttons + 63 small buttons = 92 buttons.

The final answer is {92}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we need to analyze the given key facts step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - We know from <key_fact1> that the tattered jeans cost $28.
   - According to <key_fact2>, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22.

2. **Understand the savings distribution:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6, as stated in <key_fact3>.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, as per <key_fact4>. This means he saved $6 / 3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.
   - The rest of the savings, which is $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans, as indicated in <key_fact5>.

3. **Calculate the original prices:**
   - Since Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22 + $2 = $24.
   - Since Cole saved $4 on the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans was $28 + $4 = $32.

4. **Determine the difference in original prices:**
   - The jogger jeans originally cost $24, and the tattered jeans originally cost $32.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $8 less than the tattered jeans.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is {8}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the situation step by step using the key facts provided.

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Ellen has a <key_fact1>case of 12 sodas</key_fact1>.
   - She <key_fact2>shook 3 of them up</key_fact2>.

2. **Ellen's Action**:
   - Ellen <key_fact3>took 1 unshaken soda for herself</key_fact3>.
   - This leaves 11 sodas in total, with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.

3. **Ellen's Brother's Action**:
   - Ellen's brother <key_fact4>took 1 of the shaken sodas</key_fact4>.
   - He also <key_fact5>took 2 of the unshaken sodas</key_fact5>.
   - After this, there are 10 sodas left: 2 shaken and 7 unshaken.

4. **Ellen's Friend's Situation**:
   - Ellen's friend comes along and chooses from the remaining 9 sodas.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

Calculating the probability:
- There are 2 shaken sodas left out of a total of 9 sodas.
- Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas) = 2/9.

To express this probability as a percentage:
- (2/9) * 100% ≈ 22.22%.

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately {22.22%}."

If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then see how many days it can last with the daily usage of 20%.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a <key_fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</key_fact1>.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: On Monday, the teacher <key_fact2>used up 45% of the chalk</key_fact2>. 
   - 45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

3. **Daily Usage**: The teacher plans to <key_fact3>only use 20% of the chalk each day</key_fact3>.
   - 20% of the original 5-inch piece is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

4. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher <key_fact4>recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches</key_fact4>.

5. **Days Before Recycling**: 
   - The chalk is currently 2.75 inches long.
   - The teacher uses 1 inch per day.
   - After 1 day of use, the chalk will be 2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches, which is less than 2 inches.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day before it needs to be recycled.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the selling price of the boards and then subtract the original cost.

1. **Calculate the original cost:**
   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
     - <key_fact2>Each board cost her $10</key_fact2>.
     - Total cost for these boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.
   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - <key_fact3>Each board cost her $16</key_fact3>.
     - Total cost for these boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.
   - Total original cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

2. **Calculate the selling price:**
   - The prices have gone up by 50%, so the selling price for each type of board is 150% of the original cost.
   - Selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board = $10 * 1.50 = $15.
   - Selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board = $16 * 1.50 = $24.
   - Total selling price for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.
   - Total selling price for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.
   - Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of {90}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs he purchased, the discount he received, and the amount he recouped from selling some of them.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:**
   James gets <key_fact1>10 new CDs</key_fact1>, and each CD costs <key_fact2>$15</key_fact2>. Therefore, the total cost before the discount is:
   \[
   10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   James gets a <key_fact3>40% off</key_fact3> discount. The discount amount is:
   \[
   150 \times 0.40 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   The total cost after applying the discount is:
   \[
   150 - 60 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount recouped from selling 5 CDs:**
   James sells 5 of the CDs for <key_fact4>40 dollars</key_fact4>.

5. **Calculate the net amount James is out:**
   The net amount James is out is the total cost after the discount minus the amount he recouped from selling the CDs:
   \[
   90 - 40 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, James was out {50} dollars."

If <key_fact6>160 pieces of straw have been distributed</key_fact6> among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many rats are in each cage, we need to use the information provided in the key facts to calculate the total number of pieces of straw used and then solve for the number of rats.

1. **Calculate the total straw used by the hamsters:**
   - There are <key_fact3>10 cages of hamsters</key_fact3>.
   - Each hamster is given <key_fact4>5 pieces of straw</key_fact4>.
   - Therefore, the total straw used by the hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used by the rabbits:**
   - The pen of rabbits uses <key_fact5>20 pieces of straw</key_fact5>.

3. **Calculate the total straw used by the rats:**
   - The total straw distributed is <key_fact6>160 pieces of straw</key_fact6>.
   - Subtract the straw used by the hamsters and rabbits from the total straw to find the straw used by the rats:
     \[
     160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \text{ pieces of straw used by the rats}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - Each rat is given <key_fact2>6 pieces of straw</key_fact2>.
   - Let \( r \) be the total number of rats. Then, \( 6r = 90 \).
   - Solving for \( r \), we get \( r = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \) rats in total.

5. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**
   - The rats are kept in <key_fact1>3 cages in equal groups</key_fact1>.
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

1. **First Venue Cost**: 
   - The first venue charges a flat fee of <key_fact1>$200</key_fact1>.
   - Additionally, Mark estimates that food will cost <key_fact2>$5 for each person</key_fact2>.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue with \( x \) guests is: 
     \[
     200 + 5x
     \]

2. **Second Venue Cost**:
   - The second venue charges <key_fact3>$25 per person</key_fact3>, which includes food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue with \( x \) guests is:
     \[
     25x
     \]

3. **Setting the Costs Equal**:
   - To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
     \[
     200 + 5x = 25x
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is {10}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool**: 
   The volume of a rectangular pool is calculated by multiplying its width, length, and depth. 
   Using the given dimensions:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{depth} = \text{<key_fact1>14 feet wide</key_fact1>} \times \text{<key_fact2>25 feet long</key_fact2>} \times \text{<key_fact3>4 feet deep</key_fact3>}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert Volume to Gallons**:
   According to the instructions, multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert cubic feet to gallons.
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = \text{Volume} \times \text{<key_fact4>5.9</key_fact4>} = 1400 \times 5.9
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 8260
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost**:
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons} \times \text{<key_fact5>$0.10 per gallon</key_fact5>} = 8260 \times 0.10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 826
   \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \{826\} dollars."

1. <key_fact1>Her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons</key_fact1>. This means that, in addition to the spoons Julia bought, there are 5 spoons from her husband's purchase.

2. <key_fact2>She used three of the spoons to sample her stew</key_fact2>. This indicates that 3 spoons were used, but it doesn't affect the total count of spoons available for setting the table later.

3. <key_fact3>She had a total of 12 spoons</key_fact3> when she went to set the table. This is the total number of spoons available after both purchases and using 3 spoons for sampling.

To find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, we can set up the equation:

Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

The total number of spoons is the sum of the spoons from Julia's package and her husband's package:

\[ x + 5 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 12 - 5 \]
\[ x = 7 \]

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained {7} spoons."

If he also <key_fact4>paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount</key_fact4> of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate the total deductions from the selling price and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Selling Price**: Mr. Tan sold his house for <key_fact1>$400,000</key_fact1>.

2. **Transfer Fees**: The transfer fees are <key_fact2>3% of the selling price</key_fact2>. Therefore, the transfer fees amount to:
   \[
   0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

3. **Brokerage Fee**: The brokerage fee is <key_fact3>5% of the selling price</key_fact3>. Therefore, the brokerage fee amounts to:
   \[
   0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: Mr. Tan paid <key_fact4>$250,000 for the remaining loan amount</key_fact4>.

5. **Total Deductions**: The total deductions from the selling price are the sum of the transfer fees, brokerage fee, and the remaining loan amount:
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000
   \]

6. **Net Proceeds**: The net proceeds from selling the house are the selling price minus the total deductions:
   \[
   400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are {118,000}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to calculate the total number of toys Sophie had before buying the bouncy balls and then find the difference between that total and the new total after adding the bouncy balls.

1. Calculate the total number of toys before the bouncy balls:
   - According to <key_fact1>, the bag of building blocks has 31 blocks.
   - According to <key_fact2>, the bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals.
   - According to <key_fact3>, the tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings.

   Adding these together gives us:
   31 (blocks) + 8 (stuffed animals) + 9 (rings) = 48 toys.

2. According to <key_fact4>, the total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls is 62.

3. To find the number of bouncy balls, subtract the total number of toys before the bouncy balls from the total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls:
   62 (total toys after) - 48 (total toys before) = 14 bouncy balls.

How much did he lose on average that day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then find the average over the three races.

1. **First Race Loss:**
   - Johnny's dad <key_fact1>lost $5</key_fact1>.

2. **Second Race Win:**
   - He <key_fact2>won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</key_fact2>.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race is 2 * $5 = $10.
   - Therefore, he won $10 + $1 = $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race Loss:**
   - He <key_fact3>lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</key_fact3>.
   - He won $11 in the second race, so he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5 in the third race.

4. **Total Loss Calculation:**
   - Total loss = First race loss + Third race loss = $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

5. **Average Loss Calculation:**
   - The average loss over the three races is the total loss divided by the number of races.
   - Average loss = Total loss / Number of races = $21.5 / 3 ≈ $7.17.

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost on average approximately $7.17 that day. The answer is {7.17}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees each year and then account for the percentage of trees that die.

1. **Initial Number of Trees**: 
   - Tom starts with <key_fact3>50 trees</key_fact3>.

2. **Annual Change in Number of Trees**:
   - Each year, Tom plants <key_fact1>10 trees</key_fact1> and chops down <key_fact2>2 trees</key_fact2>.
   - Net increase per year = 10 - 2 = 8 trees.

3. **Total Change Over 10 Years**:
   - Over <key_fact4>10 years</key_fact4>, the total increase in the number of trees is 10 years * 8 trees/year = 80 trees.

4. **Total Number of Trees Before Deaths**:
   - Initial trees + Total increase = 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

5. **Accounting for Tree Deaths**:
   - After 10 years, <key_fact5>30% of the trees die</key_fact5>.
   - Number of trees that die = 30% of 130 = 0.3 * 130 = 39 trees.

6. **Final Number of Trees**:
   - Total trees after deaths = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has {91} trees left."

How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we will use the key facts provided:

1. <key_fact1>In the first year, they will build 12 homes</key_fact1>. This means that by the end of the first year, the town will have built 12 homes.

2. <key_fact2>In the next year, they will build three times this many homes</key_fact2>. This means in the second year, they will build 3 times 12 homes, which is 36 homes. By the end of the second year, the total number of homes built will be 12 (from the first year) + 36 (from the second year) = 48 homes.

3. <key_fact3>In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount</key_fact3>. By the end of the second year, they have built 48 homes. In the third year, they will double this amount, so they will build 48 * 2 = 96 homes in the third year.

To find the total number of homes built over the three years, we add the homes built each year:

- First year: 12 homes
- Second year: 36 homes
- Third year: 96 homes

Total homes built = 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.

Therefore, the town will have built a total of {144} homes over the next three years."

What is the total area, in square feet, of the house?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of each part of the house and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the area of one bedroom:**
   - Each bedroom measures <key_fact2>20 by 12 feet</key_fact2>.
   - The area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.

2. **Calculate the total area of all bedrooms:**
   - Tom has <key_fact1>4 bedrooms</key_fact1>.
   - The total area of all bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.

3. **Calculate the area of the living room:**
   - The living room is <key_fact3>5 times bigger than one bedroom</key_fact3>.
   - The area of the living room is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

4. **Calculate the total area of the house:**
   - The rest of the house is <key_fact4>1000 square feet</key_fact4>.
   - The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
     - Total area = 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

Therefore, the total area of Tom's house is {3160} square feet."

Stephen also added a <key_fact4>$4.00 tip</key_fact4>. After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the extra fees, we need to consider each component of the cost:

1. **Initial Bill**: Stephen's initial grocery bill was <key_fact1>$40.00</key_fact1>.

2. **Vendor Fee**: A <key_fact2>25% fee</key_fact2> was added to the initial bill. To calculate this fee:
   - 25% of $40.00 is \(0.25 \times 40 = 10\).
   - Therefore, the vendor fee is $10.00.

3. **Delivery Fee**: Stephen was charged an additional <key_fact3>$3.00 in delivery fees</key_fact3>.

4. **Tip**: Stephen added a <key_fact4>$4.00 tip</key_fact4>.

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the final price:

- Initial Bill: $40.00
- Vendor Fee: $10.00
- Delivery Fee: $3.00
- Tip: $4.00

Total = $40.00 + $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries, after all the extra fees, is {57}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to calculate the number of rings for each time the alarm went off and then sum them up.

1. According to <key_fact1>the first time it went off today, it rang four times</key_fact1>. So, the first alarm rang 4 times.

2. For the second time, <key_fact2>it rang for three times as long as the first time</key_fact2>. Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.

3. For the third time, <key_fact3>it rang for half as long as the second time</key_fact3>. Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, we add up all the rings:
- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total rings = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of {22} times."

1. **Monday's Apples:**
   - Lucy sells apples at <key_fact1>$4 per piece</key_fact1>.
   - On Monday, she earned <key_fact2>$56</key_fact2> from selling all the apples.
   - To find the number of apples sold on Monday, we divide the total earnings by the price per apple: 
     \[
     \text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{\text{\$56}}{\text{\$4 per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Tuesday's Apples:**
   - On Tuesday, Lucy picked <key_fact3>12 apples</key_fact3>.

3. **Wednesday's Apples:**
   - On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday.

     \[
     \text{Number of apples on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Tuesday's apples} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
     \]

4. **Total Apples Over Three Days:**
   - Now, we sum the apples picked over the three days:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = \text{Monday's apples} + \text{Tuesday's apples} + \text{Wednesday's apples} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \text{ apples}
     \]

Therefore, Lucy picked a total of {50} apples over the three days."

     2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:**
   - Total toys produced by the first four workers:
     \[
     120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of toys still needed:**
   - By the end of their shift, the manufacturer <key_fact5>still needs another 20 toys</key_fact5> to be able to ship the order. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers is:
     \[
     400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
     \[
     380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of toys per hour the fifth worker produces:**
   - Since the fifth worker worked a <key_fact4>10-hour shift</key_fact4>, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days, and the number of bandages left at the end.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.

2. **First Day:**
   - They used <key_fact2>38 bandages</key_fact2>.
   - They ordered <key_fact3>one bulk pack of bandages</key_fact3>, which is <key_fact1>50 bandages</key_fact1>.
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \( x - 38 + 50 \).

3. **Second Day:**
   - They used <key_fact4>ten fewer bandages</key_fact4> than the first day, which is \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \( x - 38 + 50 - 28 \).

4. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered <key_fact5>two bulk packs of bandages</key_fact5>, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used <key_fact6>half a pack</key_fact6>, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \( x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 \).

5. **Final Count:**
   - At the end of the third day, they had <key_fact7>78 bandages left</key_fact7>.
   - Therefore, the equation is: 
     \[
     x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
     \]

6. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     x + 59 = 78
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 78 - 59 = 19
     \]

Thus, the nurses' station started with {19} bandages on the first day."

What is their average guess?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average guess, we need to calculate each friend's guess and then find the average of those guesses.

1. The first friend's guess is straightforward: <key_fact1>80</key_fact1>.

2. The second friend's guess is calculated as follows:
   - Half of the first friend's guess is 80 / 2 = 40.
   - Adding 20 more gives us 40 + 20 = <key_fact2>60</key_fact2>.

3. The third friend's guess is calculated as follows:
   - 25% more than the first friend's guess is 80 * 0.25 = 20.
   - Adding this to the first friend's guess gives us 80 + 20 = <key_fact3>100</key_fact3>.

Now, we calculate the average of these three guesses:
- The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.
- The sum of these guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.
- The average is 240 / 3 = 80.

How much will it cost to paint the room?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine how many gallons of paint are required.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the north and south walls.
Each of the <key_fact1>north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet</key_fact1>, so the area of one wall is 10 * 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

Step 2: Calculate the area of the east and west walls.
Each of the <key_fact2>east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet</key_fact2>, so the area of one wall is 5 * 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Step 3: Calculate the total area to be painted.
The total area of all four walls is 160 (north and south) + 80 (east and west) = 240 square feet.

Step 4: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.
<key_fact3>A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</key_fact3>. Therefore, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the paint.
<key_fact4>Each gallon of paint costs $12</key_fact4>. Therefore, the total cost is 12 gallons * $12 = $144.

The total cost to paint the room is {144}."

   - 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.30 * 800 = 240 kilometers.
   - This 240 kilometers is the total distance for the next 2 days.

3. **Next Day:**
   - According to <key_fact3>On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all</key_fact3>, Tom did not travel any distance on this day.
   - Distance for this day = 0 kilometers.

4. **Second Week:**
   - According to <key_fact4>During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day</key_fact4>, Tom traveled 300 kilometers per day for 7 days.

- Friday: 2 hours

Total hours from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Since Frankie watched <key_fact1>7 hours of TV in all</key_fact1>, the remaining time he watched on Wednesday is:

7 hours (total) - 5.5 hours (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) = 1.5 hours

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes long, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:

1.5 hours = 90 minutes

90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

Therefore, Frankie watched {3} 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. **Final Charge**: We know that the final charge of the power bank was <key_fact5>28%</key_fact5>.

2. **Charge Loss in the Last 3 Hours**: For the last <key_fact4>3 hours</key_fact4>, the power bank was losing <key_fact3>7% of the total capacity each hour</key_fact3>. Therefore, over these 3 hours, the power bank lost a total of 3 * 7% = 21% of its total capacity.

3. **Charge Before the Last 3 Hours**: To find the charge before these last 3 hours, we add back the 21% lost during this period to the final charge:
   - Charge before the last 3 hours = 28% + 21% = 49%.

4. **Charge Loss in the First 5 Hours**: For the first <key_fact2>5 hours</key_fact2>, the power bank was losing <key_fact1>9% of the total capacity each hour</key_fact1>. Therefore, over these 5 hours, the power bank lost a total of 5 * 9% = 45% of its total capacity.

5. **Initial Charge**: To find the initial charge when Maria went out to the park, we add back the 45% lost during the first 5 hours to the charge before the last 3 hours:
   - Initial charge = 49% + 45% = 94%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was {94%}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the total time from when he starts waiting until the fourth train arrives.

1. **First Train:**
   - <key_fact1>The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes</key_fact1>.
   - <key_fact2>This train will stay in the station for 20 minutes</key_fact2>.
   - Therefore, the first train leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - <key_fact3>The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves</key_fact3>.
   - Half an hour is 30 minutes, so the second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
   - <key_fact4>This second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed</key_fact4>.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Therefore, the second train leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - <key_fact5>The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves</key_fact5>.
   - An hour is 60 minutes, so the third train arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
   - <key_fact6>This third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives</key_fact6>.
   - Therefore, the third train leaves 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - <key_fact7>The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves</key_fact7>.
   - Therefore, the fourth train arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

Thus, Paul will wait a total of 145 minutes for his train. The answer is {145}."

When James came back yet again, <key_fact4>3 dogs were gone</key_fact4> so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many toys James needs in total, let's break down the situation step by step using the key facts provided:

1. Initially, <key_fact1>James currently has 4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</key_fact1>. This means he has 1 toy per dog.

2. <key_fact2>There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</key_fact2>. This means the total number of dogs is now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 12 toys in total. He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

3. After buying the toys, <key_fact3>there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</key_fact3>. When he left, there were 12 dogs. Now, there are twice as many, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. He needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 he bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

4. When James came back yet again, <key_fact4>3 dogs were gone</key_fact4>. This means there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. He needs 21 toys in total. He already has 24 toys (12 original + 12 he bought), so he doesn't need to buy any more toys. In fact, he has 24 - 21 = 3 extra toys.

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is 21.

Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students needing each size based on the given key facts.

1. **Extra-Small Shirts**: According to <key_fact1>, 11 students need size extra-small shirts.

2. **Small Shirts**: According to <key_fact2>, twice as many students need size small as extra small. Therefore, the number of students needing size small is 2 * 11 = 22.

3. **Medium Shirts**: According to <key_fact3>, four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size medium is 22 - 4 = 18.

4. **Large Shirts**: According to <key_fact4>, half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, the number of students needing size large is 18 / 2 = 9.

5. **Extra-Large Shirts**: According to <key_fact5>, six more students need size extra-large than large. Therefore, the number of students needing size extra-large is 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, we sum up all the shirts needed for each size:
- Extra-Small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-Large: 15

Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

Therefore, Krissa needs to order a total of {75} shirts."

With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to consider each key fact step by step.

1. **Flashlights for People:**
   - There are <key_fact1>4 people living there</key_fact1>.
   - There is <key_fact2>a flashlight for every person</key_fact2>.
   - Therefore, they have 4 flashlights for the people.

2. **Flashlights for Rooms:**
   - There are <key_fact3>8 rooms in the house</key_fact3>.
   - There are two flashlights for each room.
   - Therefore, they have 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights for the rooms.

3. **Candles:**
   - Half of the rooms have <key_fact4>4 small candles each</key_fact4>.
   - The other half of the rooms have <key_fact5>5 medium candles each</key_fact5>.
   - Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is 4 rooms.
   - Therefore, for the rooms with small candles: 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.
   - For the rooms with medium candles: 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

4. **Total Calculation:**
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.
   - Total candles = 16 (small candles) + 20 (medium candles) = 36 candles.

Adding the total number of flashlights and candles gives us:
- Total = 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.

Therefore, Brianna's family is using a total of {56} candles and flashlights when the lights go out."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the problem using the key facts provided.

1. **Total Movies**: Mike has <key_fact1>600 movies</key_fact1>.

2. **Movies in Series**: According to <key_fact2>, a third of the movies are in various series. Therefore, the number of movies in series is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
   \]

3. **Cost of Series Movies**: Mike can get these series movies for $6 each, which is a reduced price from the <key_fact3>cost of a normal movie</key_fact3>. Therefore, the cost for the series movies is:

   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]

5. **Older Movies**: According to <key_fact4>, 40% of the remaining movies are older movies. Therefore, the number of older movies is:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
   \]

6. **Cost of Older Movies**: These older movies cost <key_fact5>$5</key_fact5> each. Therefore, the cost for the older movies is:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Normal Movies**: The remaining movies, which are not in series or older, are:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
   \]

8. **Cost of Normal Movies**: These normal movies cost <key_fact6>$10</key_fact6> each. Therefore, the cost for the normal movies is:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}

The <key_fact4>choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them</key_fact4>. How many people sang in the performance?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many people sang in the performance, let's go through the key facts step by step:

1. The choir has <key_fact1>52 members</key_fact1>.
2. <key_fact2>50% of the choir members are girls</key_fact2>. Therefore, the number of girls in the choir is 52 * 0.5 = 26.
3. The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so initially, 26 girls are supposed to perform.
4. On the day of the performance, <key_fact3>half the people performing can't make it</key_fact3> because their bus breaks down. Therefore, only half of the 26 girls can perform, which is 26 / 2 = 13 girls.
5. The <key_fact4>choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them</key_fact4>. So, we add these 3 teachers to the 13 girls who can perform.

Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 (girls) + 3 (teachers) = 16.

The answer is {16}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount she needs and subtract the contributions from her job and her mom, as well as the remaining amount she needs.

1. **Calculate the reduced price of the laptop:**
   - The original price of the laptop is <key_fact1>$600</key_fact1>.
   - With the trade-in, the price is reduced by <key_fact2>$200</key_fact2>.
   - Therefore, the reduced price is $600 - $200 = $400.

2. **Determine the total amount Erika has from other sources:**
   - She was paid <key_fact3>$150</key_fact3> from her part-time job.
   - Her mom gives her <key_fact4>$80</key_fact4>.
   - Total from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

3. **Calculate the total amount Erika needs:**
   - The reduced price of the laptop is $400.
   - Erika still needs an extra <key_fact5>$50</key_fact5>.

4. **Calculate how much Erika has in her purse:**
   - The total amount needed is $400.
   - She has $230 from her job and her mom.
   - She still needs $50 more.
   - Therefore, the amount she has in her purse is $400 - $230 - $50 = $120.

Thus, Erika has {120} dollars in her purse."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, let's go through the key facts step by step:

1. **Understanding the current situation:**
   - Henry has a <key_fact4>total of 110 cookies</key_fact4> after dropping some.
   - He <key_fact3>dropped 5 of his cookies</key_fact3>, so before dropping them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

2. **Understanding his baking goal:**
   - He wanted to make <key_fact1>twice as many as he did last year</key_fact1>.
   - However, he baked <key_fact2>15 more cookies than he meant to</key_fact2>.

3. **Setting up the equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
   - He intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies this year.
   - He actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

4. **Relating the actual number of cookies baked to the total:**
   - We know he ended up with 115 cookies after accounting for the extra 15 he baked.
   - Therefore, \( 2x + 15 = 115 \).

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 15 from both sides: \( 2x = 100 \).
   - Divide by 2: \( x = 50 \).

Thus, Henry baked {50} cookies last year."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the profit Mark made, we need to calculate both his total revenue from selling the cards and his total cost for purchasing the packs.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Mark bought <key_fact1>3 packs for $1800 each</key_fact1>. Therefore, his total cost is:
   \[
   3 \times 1800 = 5400
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - He sold <key_fact2>1 card that is worth $4000</key_fact2>.
   - He sold <key_fact3>another card worth $1000</key_fact3>.
   - He has <key_fact4>30 more cards worth an average of $50 each</key_fact4>. Therefore, the total value of these 30 cards is:
     \[
     30 \times 50 = 1500
     \]

   Adding these amounts gives the total revenue:
   \[
   4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:
   \[
   6500 - 5400 = 1100
   \]

Therefore, Mark made a profit of {1100}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: <key_fact1>one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies</key_fact1>. This means she initially had 12 brownies.

2. At her office, they sent her home with <key_fact2>1/2 a dozen brownies</key_fact2>. This adds 6 brownies to her total.

3. Her friends had <key_fact3>4 dozen brownies</key_fact3> waiting for her at the surprise party. This adds 48 brownies to her total.

4. During the party, <key_fact4>1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten</key_fact4>. This means 18 brownies were consumed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had:

- Total brownies received: 12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

- Brownies eaten: 18 brownies.

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:

66 (total received) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

The final answer is {48}."

The <key_fact3>third player ate a one-pound steak</key_fact3>. And the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals. In total, how many ounces of meat were consumed by the team?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to add up the meat consumed by each player who ate meat.

1. The <key_fact1>first player ate a 6-ounce steak</key_fact1>. So, the first player consumed 6 ounces of meat.

2. The <key_fact2>second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size</key_fact2>. Therefore, the second player consumed 8 ounces of meat.

3. The <key_fact3>third player ate a one-pound steak</key_fact3>. Since one pound is equivalent to 16 ounces, the third player consumed 16 ounces of meat.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is {30}."

On average, how many branches did he climb per day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to use the key facts provided:

1. <key_fact1>Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25</key_fact1>.
2. <key_fact2>During the week he made $105</key_fact2>.

First, we calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week. Since each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total money earned / Cost per branch
= <key_fact2>$105</key_fact2> / <key_fact1>$0.25</key_fact1>
= 420 branches

Next, we calculate the average number of branches climbed per day. Assuming a week consists of 7 days, we divide the total number of branches by 7:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
= 420 branches / 7 days
= 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day. The final answer is {60}."

If every group uses their full 45 minutes, how long will it take for everyone to try the escape room?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long it will take for all the students to try the escape room, we need to consider the following key facts:

1. <key_fact2>Grades 4 – 7</key_fact2> are involved, which means there are 4 grades in total.
2. <key_fact1>10 students in each grade</key_fact1> are selected to try the escape room. Therefore, there are 10 students x 4 grades = 40 students in total.
3. <key_fact3>Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time</key_fact3>.
4. <key_fact4>They have 45 minutes to try and escape</key_fact4>.

Now, let's calculate the number of groups needed:

- Since only 8 students can participate at a time, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group: 40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups.

Next, we calculate the total time required:

- Each group uses 45 minutes, so for 5 groups, the total time is 5 groups x 45 minutes per group = 225 minutes.

Therefore, it will take a total of {225} minutes for all the students to try the escape room."

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many skeins of wool Martha will need to buy, we need to calculate the total amount of wool required for each type of winter wear for all her grandchildren.

1. **Hats**: Martha has <key_fact1>3 grandchildren</key_fact1>, and it takes <key_fact2>2 skeins of wool to make a hat</key_fact2>. Therefore, for 3 hats, she will need:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ skeins of wool}
   \]

2. **Scarves**: It takes <key_fact3>4 skeins of wool to make a scarf</key_fact3>. Therefore, for 3 scarves, she will need:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ skeins of wool}
   \]

3. **Sweaters**: It takes <key_fact4>12 skeins of wool to make a sweater</key_fact4>. Therefore, for 3 sweaters, she will need:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ skeins of wool}
   \]

4. **Mittens**: It takes <key_fact5>1 skein of wool to make a pair of mittens</key_fact5>. Therefore, for 3 pairs of mittens, she will need:
   \[
   3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ skeins of wool}
   \]

5. **Socks**: It takes <key_fact6>2 skeins of wool to make a pair of socks</key_fact6>. Therefore, for 3 pairs of socks, she will need:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ skeins of wool}
   \]

Now, we add up all the skeins of wool needed for each item:
\[
6 \text{ (hats)} + 12 \text{ (scarves)} + 36 \text{ (sweaters)} + 3 \text{ (mittens)} + 6 \text{ (socks)} = 63 \text{ skeins of wool}
\]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy a total of {63} skeins of wool."

The <key_fact5>true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900</key_fact5>. How far off was his guess?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans based on the given information and compare it to the true number.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.
The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. Therefore, the volume of the jar is:
\[ \text{Volume of jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]
<key_fact1>The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall</key_fact1>.

Step 2: Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.
Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, and the packing efficiency is 80%. Therefore, the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{540}{0.15} \times 0.80 = 2880 \]
<key_fact2>A jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches</key_fact2> and <key_fact3>80% efficiency in packing</key_fact3>.

Step 3: Estimate the number of red jelly beans.
Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]
<key_fact4>Estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red</key_fact4>.

Step 4: Calculate how far off Tim's guess was.
The true number of red jelly beans is 900. Therefore, the difference between Tim's estimate and the true number is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]
<key_fact5>The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900</key_fact5>.

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by {36}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to break down the information given in the key facts and set up equations based on them.

1. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \). According to <key_fact2>the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</key_fact2>, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).

2. According to <key_fact5>twice as much salt as zest</key_fact5>, the amount of salt is \( 2z \).

3. According to <key_fact3>the same amount of salt as sugar</key_fact3>, the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \).

4. According to <key_fact4>twice as much oil as salt</key_fact4>, the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \).

5. The total amount of the scrub is <key_fact1>10 ounces</key_fact1>. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   10z = 10
   \]
   Solving for \( z \), we find:
   \[
   z = 1
   \]

6. Since the amount of oil is \( 4z \), and \( z = 1 \), the amount of oil is:
   \[
   4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Therefore, Tanya uses {4} ounces of oil."

The <key_fact3>shore was 64 seconds away</key_fact3>. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use the rate at which the boat was taking on water.

1. **Calculate the total distance rowed:**
   - We know from <key_fact2> that it took Julia sixteen seconds to row twenty feet</key_fact2>.
   - From <key_fact3>, the shore was 64 seconds away</key_fact3>.
   - Therefore, the total time to reach the shore is 64 seconds.

2. **Determine the distance rowed in 64 seconds:**
   - Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, in 64 seconds, she would row:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - From <key_fact1>, the boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet</key_fact1>.
   - Therefore, for 80 feet, the boat would take on:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on {16} liters of water."

When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <key_fact4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</key_fact4>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break it down step by step using the key facts provided.

1. Initially, Bob had a total of 7 fish in his pond: <key_fact1>3 were orange</key_fact1> and <key_fact2>4 were white</key_fact2>.

2. Bob bought <key_fact3>17 fish</key_fact3> from the pet store. These fish were a mix of orange and white fish.

3. After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob found that he now had <key_fact4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</key_fact4>.

Let's denote the number of white fish Bob bought as W and the number of orange fish he bought as O.

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish in the pond is 3 (initial orange fish) + O (orange fish bought), and the total number of white fish is 4 (initial white fish) + W (white fish bought).

According to <key_fact4>, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

3 + O = 2(4 + W)

We also know from <key_fact3> that the total number of fish bought is 17:

O + W = 17

Now, we have two equations:

1. 3 + O = 2(4 + W)
2. O + W = 17

Let's solve these equations:

From equation 1:
3 + O = 8 + 2W
O = 8 + 2W - 3
O = 5 + 2W

Substitute O = 5 + 2W into equation 2:
(5 + 2W) + W = 17
5 + 3W = 17
3W = 17 - 5
3W = 12
W = 12 / 3
W = 4

Therefore, Bob bought {4} white fish at the store."

If the rink has <key_fact4>75 cars in total</key_fact4>, how many yellow cars do they have?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the number of yellow cars, we need to calculate the number of each type of car and then use the total to find the yellow cars.

1. **Red Cars**: According to <key_fact1>, there are 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars**: According to <key_fact2>, there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10.

3. **Blue Cars**: According to <key_fact3>, there are 3 times the number of blue cars as there are green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30.

4. **Total Cars**: According to <key_fact4>, the total number of cars is 75.

Now, we can calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

- Total number of red, green, and blue cars = 12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52.

- Therefore, the number of yellow cars = 75 (total) - 52 = 23.

Thus, the number of yellow cars is {23}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many lollipops Oscar has, let's go through the key facts step by step:

1. Start with the initial number of lollipops: <key_fact1>Oscar has 24 lollipops</key_fact1>.

2. Oscar eats some lollipops on his way to school: <key_fact2>eats 2 on his way to school</key_fact2>. 
   - 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops remaining.

3. Oscar gives some lollipops to his friends: <key_fact3>passes 14 out to his friends</key_fact3>.
   - 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining.

4. Oscar buys more lollipops on his way home: <key_fact4>buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends</key_fact4>.
   - He gave 14 to his friends, so he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.
   - 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops now.

5. Oscar eats more lollipops that night: <key_fact5>eats 3 more that night</key_fact5>.
   - 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops remaining.

6. Oscar eats more lollipops in the morning: <key_fact6>eats 2 more in the morning</key_fact6>.
   - 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops remaining.

Therefore, Oscar has {31} lollipops."

What is the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the total cost for each day and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate Clara's total cost on Tuesday.**

<key_fact1>Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each</key_fact1>. Therefore, the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$20/\text{pomegranate} = \$400 \]

<key_fact2>She got $2 off because she had a voucher</key_fact2>. Therefore, the final cost for Clara is:
\[ \$400 - \$2 = \$398 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Sheila's total cost on Wednesday.**

<key_fact3>The price shot to $30 per fruit</key_fact3>. Therefore, the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \text{ pomegranates} \times \$30/\text{pomegranate} = \$600 \]

<key_fact4>The store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost</key_fact4>. Therefore, the discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times \$600 = \$60 \]

So, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ \$600 - \$60 = \$540 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between the final prices paid.**

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:
\[ \$540 - \$398 = \$142 \]

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \{\$142\}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is <key_fact1>$2000</key_fact1>.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at <key_fact2>75% of its original price</key_fact2>.
   - Therefore, the price Mr. Rogers paid is 75% of $2000, which is:
     \[
     0.75 \times 2000 = 1500
     \]

2. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend:**
   - Mr. Rogers sold the watch at <key_fact3>120% of the price that he bought it</key_fact3>.
   - Therefore, the selling price to his friend is 120% of $1500, which is:

     1.20 \times 1500 = 1800
     \]

3. **Determine the percentage discount from the original price:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The price Mr. Roger's friend paid is $1800.
   - The discount from the original price is $2000 - $1800 = $200.
   - To find the percentage discount, we calculate:

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the key facts.

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to <key_fact1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</key_fact1>, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls in the first set.

According to <key_fact2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</key_fact2>, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls in the third set.

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is given by <key_fact3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</key_fact3>. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved {10} tennis balls in the first set."

How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to calculate the number of laps each person can run based on the given key facts.

1. **Bethany's Laps**: According to <key_fact1>Bethany can run 10 laps</key_fact1> in one hour.

2. **Trey's Laps**: Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany. So, according to <key_fact2>Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany</key_fact2>, Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.

3. **Shaelyn's Laps**: Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey. So, according to <key_fact3>Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey</key_fact3>, Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.

4. **Quinn's Laps**: Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn. So, according to <key_fact4>Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn</key_fact4>, Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

Finally, we compare the number of laps Bethany can run to the number of laps Quinn can run. Bethany can run 10 laps, and Quinn can run 5 laps. Therefore, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

The answer is {5}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To calculate the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to complete their chores, we need to determine the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - According to <key_fact1>Amalia's work was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours</key_fact1>, Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - <key_fact2>Megan had to walk the dog and this took her 2 hours longer than Amalia</key_fact2>. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Megan took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - <key_fact3>Dior's work was to do laundry and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn</key_fact3>. ""Well over 4 hours"" suggests a time significantly greater than 4 hours more than Amalia's time.

How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the petals for each type of flower Rose picked and then account for the flowers she dropped.

1. **Initial Petal Count:**
   - Rose picks <key_fact1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</key_fact1>. This gives her 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
   - She then picks <key_fact2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</key_fact2>. This gives her 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
   - Next, she picks <key_fact3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</key_fact3>. This gives her 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
   - Lastly, she picks <key_fact4>6 flowers with 7 petals each</key_fact4>. This gives her 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Adding these up, the total number of petals before any are dropped is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

3. **Adjusting for Dropped Flowers:**
   - Rose drops <key_fact5>1 of each type of flower</key_fact5>. This means:
     - She loses 1 flower with 5 petals, reducing the total by 5 petals.
     - She loses 1 flower with 6 petals, reducing the total by 6 petals.
     - She loses 1 flower with 4 petals, reducing the total by 4 petals.
     - She loses 1 flower with 7 petals, reducing the total by 7 petals.

4. **Total Petals After Dropping:**
   - The total number of petals lost is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.
   - Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

The total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is {79}."

What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the complementary probabilities of the events where he does not have to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**: 
   - There is a <key_fact1>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</key_fact1>. 
   - Therefore, there is a 50% chance that the regular teacher will be present.

2. **Regular Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the regular teacher is present, there is a <key_fact2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</key_fact2>.
   - This means there is a 60% chance that she will not give an extension to the whole class.

3. **Personal Extension Scenario**:
   - If the regular teacher does not give an extension to the whole class, there is a <key_fact3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</key_fact3>.
   - This means there is an 80% chance that Marcus will not get a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- Probability that the regular teacher is present and does not give a class extension and Marcus does not get a personal extension:
  - Probability of regular teacher being present = 50%
  - Probability of no class extension = 60%
  - Probability of no personal extension = 80%

The combined probability of all these events happening (i.e., Marcus has to turn in his homework) is:
\[ 0.50 \times 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.24 \]

Therefore, there is a 24% chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

The answer is {24}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both options and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 5 am is 12 hours, and from 5 am to 10 am is an additional 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the total duration of Cameron's stay is 12 + 5 = 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The cost for the first 12 hours is <key_fact1>1000 pesos</key_fact1>.
   - For the additional 5 hours, the cost is 5 hours * <key_fact3>70 pesos per hour</key_fact3> = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost using this option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The cost for a 24-hour stay is <key_fact2>1600 pesos</key_fact2>.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay with additional hours
   - Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, Cameron would save {250} pesos by choosing the 12-hour stay option with additional hours instead of the 24-hour stay option."

How many slices of pizza were left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate how many slices were eaten and then subtract that from the total number of slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
<key_fact1>Each pizza had 12 slices</key_fact1>, and there are 5 people, so the total number of slices is 5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Step 2: Calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and two friends.
<key_fact2>Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas</key_fact2>. Since there are 3 people in this group, they each ate 2/3 of their pizza:
- Each person ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices.
- Total slices eaten by this group = 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends.
<key_fact3>The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas</key_fact3>. Since there are 2 people in this group, they each ate 3/4 of their pizza:
- Each person ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices.
- Total slices eaten by this group = 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

Step 4: Calculate the total slices eaten.
Total slices eaten = 24 (by Bryce and two friends) + 18 (by the two remaining friends) = 42 slices.

Step 5: Calculate the slices left.
Total slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 - 42 = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is {18}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find his commission based on that profit.

1. **Calculate the total sales revenue:**
   James sold <key_fact1>10 cars</key_fact1> at a price of <key_fact2>$25,000 each</key_fact2>. Therefore, the total sales revenue is:
   \[
   10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid <key_fact3>30% of that price to acquire the cars</key_fact3>. Therefore, the cost to acquire one car is:
   \[
   25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   For 10 cars, the total acquisition cost is:
   \[
   10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit:**
   The profit is the total sales revenue minus the total acquisition cost:
   \[
   250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   James got a <key_fact4>10% commission on the profits</key_fact4>. Therefore, his commission is:

If <key_fact3>it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</key_fact3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to consider the following key facts:

1. <key_fact3>It takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</key_fact3>.
2. <key_fact2>The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</key_fact2>.
3. <key_fact1>Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne</key_fact1>.

First, calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater. Since her drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, and Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, Bernadette's drive will take:

4 minutes (Wayne's drive) * 4 = 16 minutes.

Next, consider that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, she needs to account for both the longer drive and the earlier arrival. 

Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes and she wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave:

16 minutes (her drive time) + 5 minutes (to arrive earlier) = 21 minutes before Wayne.

Thus, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before him.

The answer is {21}."

If his <key_fact5>truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</key_fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and then divide it by the truck's capacity.

1. **Calculate the total weight of sugar cubes:**
   - The farmer buys <key_fact1>two 1-pound boxes of them</key_fact1>.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight of carrots:**
   - The farmer buys <key_fact2>four 12-pound bags</key_fact2>.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total weight of hay:**
   - The farmer buys <key_fact3>forty-two 75-pound bales</key_fact3>.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.

4. **Calculate the total weight of oats:**
   - The farmer buys <key_fact4>twenty 65-pound sacks</key_fact4>.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

5. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**
   - Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds.

6. **Determine the number of trips needed:**
   - The truck can carry <key_fact5>2250 pounds at a time</key_fact5>.
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make {2} trips to transport all the feed."

How many students are leaving early?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many students are leaving early, we need to calculate the number of students in each group and sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of football players:**
   - According to <key_fact2>20% of the class are football players</key_fact2>, we calculate 20% of <key_fact1>30 students</key_fact1>.
   - 20% of 30 is \(0.20 \times 30 = 6\) students.

2. **Calculate the remaining students after accounting for football players:**
   - The total number of students is <key_fact1>30</key_fact1>.
   - After removing the 6 football players, there are \(30 - 6 = 24\) students remaining.

3. **Calculate the number of cheerleaders or band members:**
   - Out of the remaining 24 students, <key_fact3>25% of the students are cheerleaders or part of band</key_fact3>.
   - 25% of 24 is \(0.25 \times 24 = 6\) students.

4. **Calculate the total number of students leaving early:**
   - The students leaving early are the football players and the cheerleaders or band members.
   - Total students leaving early = 6 (football players) + 6 (cheerleaders or band members) = 12 students.

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is {12}."

He also <key_fact6>gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister</key_fact6> when she asks for some right before bed. How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, let's go through the key facts step by step:

1. **Initial Amount of Gum**: 
   - <key_fact1>Jim has a 20 pack of gum</key_fact1>.

2. **Gum Chewed at School**:
   - Jim chews <key_fact2>1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school</key_fact2>.
   - The school day lasts <key_fact3>8 hours</key_fact3>.
   - Therefore, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**:
   - He chews <key_fact4>1 piece on the way home from school</key_fact4>.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**:
   - He chews <key_fact5>1 stick after dinner</key_fact5>.

5. **Total Gum Chewed Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Total chewed = 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces.

6. **Gum Remaining Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Gum remaining = 20 (initial) - 6 (chewed) = 14 pieces.

7. **Gum Given to Sister**:
   - He gives <key_fact6>half the gum he has remaining to his sister</key_fact6>.
   - Half of 14 = 7 pieces given to his sister.

8. **Gum Left at the End of the Day**:
   - Gum left = 14 (remaining before giving to sister) - 7 (given to sister) = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has {7} pieces of gum left at the end of the day."

How much is the boat worth after the three years?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially to the initial purchase price.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: 
   <key_fact1>Gary bought a boat for $9000</key_fact1>.

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount for the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth {3528} after three years."

What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the remaining balloons after each event described in the key facts.

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Sally starts with <key_fact1>25 red balloons</key_fact1>, <key_fact2>7 green balloons</key_fact2>, and <key_fact3>12 yellow balloons</key_fact3>.

2. **Red Balloons Burst:**
   - A gust of wind caused <key_fact4>40% of the red balloons to burst</key_fact4>.
   - 40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally accidentally <key_fact5>released half of the yellow balloons</key_fact5>.
   - Half of 12 yellow balloons = 0.5 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons released.
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

4. **Blue Balloons Added:**
   - Sally found <key_fact6>8 blue balloons caught in a tree</key_fact6>.
   - She <key_fact7>added 75% of them</key_fact7> to her clutch.
   - 75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

5. **Total Balloons Carried into School:**
   - Total balloons = Remaining red balloons + green balloons + remaining yellow balloons + added blue balloons.
   - Total balloons = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34 balloons.

Therefore, Sally finally carried {34} balloons into the school."
