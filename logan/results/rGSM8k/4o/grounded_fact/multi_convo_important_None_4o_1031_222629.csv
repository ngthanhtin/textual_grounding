At least how many degrees is the second bottle?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle that allows Donny to drink the water, given the conditions.

1. **Understanding the Requirement**: 
   - <important1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</important1>. This means the final mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

2. **Details of the Water Mugs**:
   - <important2>One mug is 33 degrees</important2>. This is the temperature of the first mug.
   - The other mug has an unknown temperature, which we need to find.

3. **Mixing Process**:
   - Donny pours <important3>4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</important3> into his water bottle.
   - He also pours <important4>one ounce from the other bottle</important4> into the water bottle.

4. **Final Condition**:
   - After mixing, <important5>he is now able to drink the water</important5>, meaning the mixture must be at least 40 degrees.

5. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the temperature of the second bottle.
   - The total volume of the mixture is 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, totaling 5 ounces.
   - The equation for the final temperature \( T \) of the mixture is:
     \[
     T = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5}
     \]
   - Since Donny can drink the water, \( T \geq 40 \).

6. **Solving the Equation**:
   \[
   \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5} \geq 40
   \]
   \[
   (4 \times 33) + x \geq 200
   \]
   \[
   132 + x \geq 200
   \]
   \[
   x \geq 68
   \]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The answer is {68}."

He gets <important5>charged $2 per mile driven</important5> and he also gives his driver a <important6>$150 bonus per month</important6>. How much does he pay a year for driving?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate both the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonuses.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven per week.
- John's work is <important1>30 miles away</important1>, and he has to go there and back each day, so he drives 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.
- He goes to work <important3>5 days a week</important3>, so he drives 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total miles driven per year.
- John works <important4>50 weeks a year</important4>, so he drives 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles per year.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the miles driven.
- He gets <important5>charged $2 per mile driven</important5>, so the cost for the miles is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Step 4: Calculate the total bonus paid per year.
- John gives his driver a <important6>$150 bonus per month</important6>.
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months = $1,800.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost per year.
- Add the cost of the miles driven and the total bonus: $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, John pays a total of {31,800} per year for driving."

Finally, <important4>one person actually came by on a unicycle</important4>. How many dollars did she make that day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - <important2>5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated</important2>.
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires, so 5 bicycles have 5 x 2 = 10 tires.

2. **Tricycles:**
   - <important3>3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated</important3>.
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires, so 3 tricycles have 3 x 3 = 9 tires.

3. **Unicycle:**
   - <important4>One person actually came by on a unicycle</important4>.
   - A unicycle has 1 tire, so there is 1 tire.

Now, we add up all the tires:
- Total tires = 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- <important1>Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</important1>.
- Total cost in cents = 20 tires x 25 cents = 500 cents.

Finally, convert cents to dollars:
- 500 cents = 500 / 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made {5} dollars that day."

She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a <important5>combined total of 500 apples</important5>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need to calculate the total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister and then find out how many of those were from the average trees.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: <important1>Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees</important1>.
   - From the shortest trees: <important2>half this amount from the shortest trees</important2>, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( x \).

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: <important3>her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees</important3>, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: <important4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</important4>, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
   - From the average trees: She doesn't take any from the average trees.

3. **Total Apples Gathered:**
   - Combined total: <important5>combined total of 500 apples</important5>.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total apples gathered:

\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered {350} apples from the average trees."

   \]

2. Sandra ordered <important1>four times as many red roses as white carnations</important1>. Since we have calculated the number of white carnations to be 40, the number of red roses is 4 times 40.

   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver {160} red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."

- Therefore, John spends 8 classes * 40 minutes = 320 minutes in class each day.

Step 3: Calculate the total minutes John spends in class each week.
- John goes to class for <important4>5 days a week</important4>.
- Therefore, he spends 320 minutes/day * 5 days = 1600 minutes in class each week.

Step 4: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend.
- John spends <important5>1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday</important5>.
- Total extra learning time for the weekend = 2 * (1/16 * 1600 minutes) = 2 * 100 minutes = 200 minutes.

Step 5: Calculate the total learning time in minutes per week.
- Total weekly learning time = 1600 minutes (weekdays) + 200 minutes (weekend) = 1800 minutes.

Step 6: Convert the total learning time from minutes to hours.
- 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

Therefore, John spends {30} hours a week learning."

And <important4>quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service</important4>. How many checks does Buford write per year?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check he writes and how often he writes them.

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   - <important1>12 checks per year for the electric bill</important1>.

2. **Gas Bill**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. Therefore, he writes:
   - <important2>12 checks per year for the gas bill</important2>.

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Thus, he writes:
   - <important3>2 checks per month x 12 months = 24 checks per year for the church</important3>.

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: Buford writes a check quarterly for this service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, he writes:
   - <important4>4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service</important4>.

Now, we add up all the checks he writes per year:
- Electric Bill: 12 checks
- Gas Bill: 12 checks
- Church: 24 checks
- Pest and Lawn Service: 4 checks

Total checks per year = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks.

Therefore, Buford writes a total of {52} checks per year."

   - <important4>Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy</important4>.
   - Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Mei**: 
   - <important5>Mei finds half as many as Charlie</important5>.
   - Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

6. **Total eggs found**: 
   - Lamar: 5 eggs
   - Stacy: 10 eggs
   - Charlie: 8 eggs
   - Mei: 4 eggs
   - Total found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs

7. **Eggs still hidden**: 
   - Total hidden = 36 eggs
   - Total found = 27 eggs
   - Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is {9}."

He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used <important5>8 slices of cheese in it</important5>. How many slices of cheese did he use?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to consider each meal separately and then sum the total slices used.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day this week, which means he ate sandwiches for 7 days.
   - He used <important1>2 slices of cheese on each sandwich</important1>.
   - Therefore, for sandwiches, he used: 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices of cheese.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast <important4>3 days in the week</important4>.
   - He used <important3>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</important3>. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices per omelet.
   - Therefore, for omelets, he used: 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices of cheese.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used <important5>8 slices of cheese in it</important5>.

Now, we sum up all the slices of cheese used:
- Sandwiches: 14 slices

He then <important5>finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed</important5>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem using the key facts provided.

1. **Initial Swim Distance and Time:**
   - James swims across a <important1>20-mile lake</important1>.
   - He swims <important3>60% of the distance</important3>.
   - 60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.
   - He swims at a pace of <important2>2 miles per hour</important2>.
   - Time taken to swim 12 miles = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

2. **Rest Time:**
   - After swimming 60% of the distance, he rests on an island.
   - He rests for <important4>half as long as the swimming time</important4>.
   - Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

3. **Remaining Swim Distance and Time:**

How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to calculate the daily banana consumption of all three monkeys and then find out how many are left for the third monkey.

1. **Calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first monkey in a week:**
   - The first monkey eats <important2>10 bananas each day</important2>.
   - Therefore, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

2. **Calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the second monkey in a week:**
   - The second monkey eats <important3>4 more bananas than the first monkey</important3> each day.
   - So, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - Therefore, in a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas consumed by both the first and second monkeys in a week:**
   - Together, they eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

4. **Calculate the total number of bananas available for the third monkey in a week:**
   - Mr. Robles buys <important1>315 bananas</important1> for the week.
   - The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.

5. **Calculate the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day:**
   - The third monkey eats \(147 \div 7 = 21\) bananas each day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats {21} bananas each day."

If <important4>they are there for 3 days</important4> how much did the trip cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay, taking into account the increase in hotel prices.

1. **Plane Tickets Cost:**
   - The cost of each plane ticket is <important1>$5000</important1>.
   - Since there are two tickets (one for Tom and one for his wife), the total cost for the plane tickets is 2 x <important1>$5000</important1> = $10,000.

2. **Hotel Cost:**
   - The normal price of the hotel per day is <important3>$1500</important3>.
   - The hotel is <important2>20% more expensive than normal</important2>. To find the increased price, we calculate 20% of $1500: 
     - 20% of $1500 = 0.20 x $1500 = $300.
   - Therefore, the increased price per day is $1500 + $300 = $1800.
   - They are staying for <important4>3 days</important4>, so the total hotel cost is 3 x $1800 = $5400.

3. **Total Trip Cost:**
   - The total cost of the trip is the sum of the plane tickets and the hotel stay: $10,000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15,400.

Thus, the total cost of the trip is {15400}."

After he gets there he takes a <important4>route home that is 240 miles</important4> but he <important5>goes 80 mph</important5>. How long did the trip take?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long John's entire trip took, we need to calculate the time for both the trip to his friend's house and the return trip home.

**Step 1: Calculate the time for the trip to his friend's house.**

John's friend's house is <important1>200 miles away</important1>, but he had to take a <important3>detour that added 10 miles</important3> to his trip. Therefore, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

John drives at a <important2>speed of 70 mph</important2>.

Time taken to reach his friend's house = Total distance / Speed = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the return trip home.**

The route home is <important4>240 miles</important4>, and John drives at a <important5>speed of 80 mph</important5>.

Time taken for the return trip = Total distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate the total time for the entire trip.**

Total time = Time to friend's house + Time for return trip = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Therefore, the total time for the trip is {6} hours."

How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for each day separately and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate Thursday's Revenue**

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs:
- <important3>6 truck tires</important3> at <important1>$60 each</important1>
- <important3>4 car tires</important3> at <important2>$40 each</important2>

Revenue from truck tires on Thursday = 6 * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires on Thursday = 4 * $40 = $160

Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**Step 2: Calculate Friday's Revenue**

On Friday, the mechanic repairs:
- <important4>12 car tires</important4> at <important2>$40 each</important2>
- <important4>No truck tires</important4>

Revenue from car tires on Friday = 12 * $40 = $480

If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before he has to recycle it, we need to calculate the remaining length of the chalk after Monday and then see how many days it will last if he uses 20% of the original length each day.

1. **Initial Length of Chalk**: The teacher starts with a <important1>5-inch piece of chalk</important1>.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: On Monday, the teacher <important2>used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day</important2>. 
   - 45% of 5 inches is 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Therefore, the remaining length of the chalk after Monday is 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches.

3. **Daily Usage from Tuesday Onwards**: The teacher plans to <important3>only use 20% of the chalk each day</important3>.
   - 20% of the original 5-inch piece is 0.20 * 5 = 1 inch per day.

4. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher <important4>recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches</important4>.

5. **Calculate Remaining Days**:
   - After Monday, the chalk is 2.75 inches long.
   - On Tuesday, he uses 1 inch, leaving 2.75 - 1 = 1.75 inches.
   - Since 1.75 inches is less than 2 inches, he will have to recycle the chalk after Tuesday.

Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day (Tuesday) before he has to recycle it. The answer is {1}."

   - The total straw used by the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \).
   - Set this equal to the straw used by the rats:
     \[
     18r = 90
     \]
   - Solve for \( r \):
     \[
     r = \frac{90}{18} = 5
     \]

Therefore, there are {5} rats in each cage."

However, the first venue does not include <important2>food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person</important2> who attends. At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the costs provided.

1. **First Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - The first venue charges a flat fee of <important1>$200</important1>.
   - Additionally, Mark estimates that food will cost <important2>$5 for each person</important2>.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the first venue with \( x \) guests is: \( 200 + 5x \).

2. **Second Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - The second venue charges <important3>$25 per person</important3>, which includes food.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the second venue with \( x \) guests is: \( 25x \).

3. **Setting the Costs Equal:**
   - To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we set the two cost equations equal to each other:
     \[
     200 + 5x = 25x
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20} = 10
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is {10}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many were in it.

2. <important1>Her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons</important1> and gave them to Julia. This means Julia received an additional 5 spoons from her husband.

3. <important2>She used three of the spoons to sample her stew</important2>. This implies that 3 spoons were temporarily unavailable for setting the table.

4. <important3>She had a total of 12 spoons</important3> when she went to set the table. This total includes the spoons from both packages minus the 3 spoons used for sampling.

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package Julia bought as \( x \).

The total number of spoons she had after receiving the 5 spoons from her husband is \( x + 5 \).

After using 3 spoons to sample the stew, the number of spoons available for setting the table is \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \).

According to the information, she had a total of 12 spoons available for setting the table, so:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained {10} spoons."

To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to finish reading the book and then compare it to the time he has before he needs to leave for the airport.

1. **Calculate the total number of words in the book:**
   - The book is <important1>45 pages long</important1>.
   - It averages <important2>200 words a page</important2>.
   - Total words = 45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words.

2. **Calculate the time it takes Toby to read the book:**
   - Toby can read at a rate of <important3>300 words per minute</important3>.
   - Time to read the book = 9000 words / 300 words/minute = 30 minutes.

3. **Determine the total time Toby has before he needs to leave:**
   - Toby has to be at the airport in <important4>60 minutes</important4>.
   - It takes <important5>10 minutes to get to the airport</important5>.
   - Therefore, Toby needs to leave in 60 minutes - 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

4. **Calculate how many minutes early Toby will be:**
   - Toby finishes reading in 30 minutes.
   - He needs to leave in 50 minutes.
   - Minutes early = 50 minutes - 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount and then apply the discount.

1. Calculate the cost of each type of item:
   - Notebooks: <important5>five notebooks</important5> at <important1>$1.50 each</important1> = 5 * 1.50 = $7.50
   - Pens: <important6>two pens</important6> at <important2>$0.25 each</important2> = 2 * 0.25 = $0.50
   - Calculator: <important7>one calculator</important7> at <important3>$12 each</important3> = 1 * 12 = $12.00
   - Geometry set: <important8>one geometry set</important8> at <important4>$10</important4> = 1 * 10 = $10.00

2. Add up the total cost of all items before the discount:
   Total cost = $7.50 (notebooks) + $0.50 (pens) + $12.00 (calculator) + $10.00 (geometry set) = $30.00

3. Apply the <important9>10% discount</important9>:
   Discount amount = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * 30.00 = $3.00

4. Subtract the discount from the total cost:
   Final cost = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

Therefore, Daniel has to spend {27} dollars on all the items he wants to buy."

He <important3>starts with 50 trees</important3>. <important4>After 10 years</important4> <important5>30% of the trees die</important5>. How many trees does he have left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to calculate the net change in the number of trees each year and then account for the percentage of trees that die.

1. **Initial Number of Trees:**
   Tom starts with <important3>50 trees</important3>.

2. **Annual Change in Number of Trees:**
   Each year, Tom plants <important1>10 trees</important1> and chops down <important2>2 trees</important2>. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]

3. **Total Change Over 10 Years:**
   Over <important4>10 years</important4>, the total increase in the number of trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Total Number of Trees After 10 Years:**
   Adding the total increase to the initial number of trees gives:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Accounting for Tree Deaths:**
   After 10 years, <important5>30% of the trees die</important5>. Therefore, the number of trees that die is:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

6. **Final Number of Trees:**
   Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees gives:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

Therefore, after 10 years, Tom has {91} trees left."

To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the fireworks after applying the discount and then add the cost of the finale firework.

1. **Calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks:**
   - The first package is worth <important1>$400</important1>.
   - The second package is worth <important2>twice that much</important2>, so it costs 2 * $400 = $800.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two packages before the discount:**
   - Total cost before discount = $400 + $800 = $1200.

3. **Apply the discount:**
   - Tim gets a <important3>20% discount</important3> on the two packages.
   - The discount amount is 20% of $1200, which is 0.20 * $1200 = $240.
   - The cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.

4. **Add the cost of the finale firework:**
   - The finale firework costs <important4>$150</important4>.
   - Total cost = $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is {1110}."

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by all workers during their shift and compare it to the order requirement.

1. **Calculate the total number of toys needed:**
   - The manufacturer receives an <important1>order for 400 toys</important1>.

2. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:**
   - <important2>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</important2>. Therefore, in a <important4>10-hour shift</important4>, these two workers produce:
     \[
     2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - <important3>Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</important3>. Therefore, in a <important4>10-hour shift</important4>, these two workers produce:
     \[
     2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:**
   - Total toys produced by the first four workers:
     \[
     120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of toys still needed:**
   - By the end of their shift, the manufacturer <important5>still needs another 20 toys</important5> to be able to ship the order. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers is:
     \[
     400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
     \[
     380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of toys per hour the fifth worker produces:**
   - Since the fifth worker worked a <important4>10-hour shift</important4>, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
     \[
     \frac{180}{10} = 18 \text{ toys per hour}

If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to calculate how many toothpicks she has already saved and how many more she needs.

1. **Calculate the number of toothpicks saved so far:**
   Melanie has been saving toothpicks at a rate of <important2>10 toothpicks each week</important2> for <important3>the past 12 weeks</important3>. Therefore, the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:
   \[
   10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
   \]

2. **Determine how many more toothpicks are needed:**
   The blueprint requires <important1>200 toothpicks</important1>. Since Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks, she needs:
   \[
   200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more weeks are needed:**
   Melanie continues to save at the rate of <important2>10 toothpicks each week</important2>. To find out how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the rate of saving:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the 200 toothpicks needed for her sculpture. The answer is {8}."

They had <important7>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</important7>. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days, and the number of bandages left at the end.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day.

2. **First Day:**
   - They used <important2>38 bandages</important2>.
   - They ordered <important3>one bulk pack of bandages</important3>, which is <important1>50 bandages</important1>.

   After the first day, the number of bandages is:
   \[
   x - 38 + 50
   \]

3. **Second Day:**
   - They used <important4>ten fewer bandages</important4> than the first day, which is \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages.

   After the second day, the number of bandages is:
   \[
   x - 38 + 50 - 28
   \]

4. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered <important5>two bulk packs of bandages</important5>, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
   - They used <important6>half a pack</important6>, which is \( 50 / 2 = 25 \) bandages.

   After the third day, the number of bandages is:
   \[
   x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25
   \]

5. **Final Count:**
   - They had <important7>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</important7>.

   Therefore, the equation is:
   \[
   x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
   \]

6. **Solving the Equation:**
   \[
   x - 38 + 50 - 28 + 100 - 25 = 78
   \]
   \[
   x + 59 = 78
   \]
   \[
   x = 78 - 59
   \]
   \[
   x = 19
   \]

Thus, the nurses' station started with {19} bandages on the first day."

If <important4>she has 110 books</important4>, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase and then see how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books.

1. **Middle Shelves Capacity:**
   - <important1>Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books</important1>.
   - Therefore, the two middle shelves together can hold 10 books/shelf * 2 shelves = 20 books.

2. **Bottom Shelf Capacity:**
   - <important2>The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf</important2>.
   - Since a middle shelf holds 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 10 books * 2 = 20 books.

3. **Top Shelf Capacity:**
   - <important3>The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf</important3>.
   - Since the bottom shelf holds 20 books, the top shelf can hold 20 books - 5 books = 15 books.

4. **Total Capacity of One Bookcase:**
   - Adding up the capacities: 20 books (middle shelves) + 20 books (bottom shelf) + 15 books (top shelf) = 55 books per bookcase.

5. **Number of Bookcases Needed:**
   - <important4>She has 110 books</important4>.
   - To find out how many bookcases are needed, divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: 110 books / 55 books/bookcase = 2 bookcases.

Therefore, Elly needs {2} bookcases to hold all of her books."

What is their average guess?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average guess of Gunter's friends, we need to calculate each friend's guess and then find the average.

1. The first friend guesses <important1>80</important1> jelly beans.

2. The second friend guesses <important2>20 more than half the first one</important2>. Half of the first guess is 80 / 2 = 40. Adding 20 to this gives 40 + 20 = 60.

3. The third friend guesses <important3>25% more than the first one</important3>. 25% of the first guess (80) is 0.25 * 80 = 20. Adding this to the first guess gives 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

- First guess: 80
- Second guess: 60
- Third guess: 100

The sum of the guesses is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

The average guess is 240 / 3 = 80.

If he watched <important1>7 hours of TV in all</important1>, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to account for all the TV watching he did throughout the week and ensure it totals to <important1>7 hours of TV in all</important1>.

1. **Monday and Tuesday:**
   - Frankie watched <important2>1-hour episode each night</important2>, so that's 2 hours in total for these two days.

2. **Thursday:**
   - He watched <important3>a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show</important3>, which totals 1.5 hours.

3. **Friday:**
   - He watched <important4>two 1-hour episodes</important4>, which totals 2 hours.

Now, let's add up the hours from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Total for these days = 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

Since Frankie watched <important1>7 hours of TV in all</important1>, the remaining time must have been spent on Wednesday. Therefore, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is:
- Total time watched: 7 hours
- Time accounted for (Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri): 5.5 hours

Time spent on Wednesday = 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours

Since the shows on Wednesday were 30-minute episodes, we calculate the number of episodes by dividing the time spent by the duration of each episode:
- 1.5 hours = 90 minutes
- Number of 30-minute episodes = 90 / 30 = 3

Therefore, Frankie watched {3} 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pink and white flamingos on Sue's front yard at noon on Sunday and then find the difference between them.

1. **Initial Count of Pink Flamingos:**
   - On Friday morning, the neighbors placed <important1>18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard</important1>.

2. **Saturday Morning Changes:**
   - On Saturday morning, the <important2>neighbors took back one third of the flamingos</important2>. 
   - One third of 18 flamingos is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos.
   - These 6 flamingos were <important3>painted white</important3> and put back on the yard.

3. **Sunday Morning Additions:**
   - On Sunday morning, they <important4>added another 18 pink plastic flamingos</important4> to the collection.

4. **Final Count on Sunday Noon:**
   - Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
   - After taking 6 flamingos to paint them white, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos left.
   - On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, making the total pink flamingos 12 + 18 = 30.
   - The number of white flamingos is 6, as they were painted and returned on Saturday.

5. **Difference Between Pink and White Flamingos:**
   - At noon on Sunday, the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is 30 (pink) - 6 (white) = 24.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were {24} more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos."

Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine how many articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the time it takes to write each article.

1. **Monday:**
   - Meredith wrote <important2>5 articles on Monday</important2>.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, she wrote <important3>2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday</important3>.
   - This means she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, she wrote <important4>twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday</important4>.
   - This means she wrote \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles on Wednesday.

Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 7 articles
- Wednesday: 14 articles

Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

4. **Total Hours:**
   - Each article takes <important1>4 hours to research and write</important1>.
   - Total hours spent = 26 articles \(\times\) 4 hours/article = 104 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days is {104}."

How many tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and account for the returns.

1. **Friday Sales**: The store sold <important1>14 pairs of tennis shoes</important1>.

2. **Saturday Sales**: On the next day, they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, they sold <important2>2 x 14 = 28 pairs</important2> of tennis shoes on Saturday.

3. **Sunday Sales**: On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before. Therefore, they sold <important3>28 / 2 = 14 pairs</important3> of tennis shoes on Sunday.

4. **Total Sales Before Returns**: Adding up the sales from each day, we have:
   - Friday: 14 pairs
   - Saturday: 28 pairs
   - Sunday: 14 pairs

   Total pairs sold before returns = 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.

5. **Returns**: Six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. Therefore, we need to subtract these returns from the total sales:
   - Total pairs sold after returns = 56 - <important4>6</important4> = 50 pairs.

Thus, by the end of the sale, the store sold a total of {50} pairs of tennis shoes."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to account for the percentage of the total capacity lost over time.

1. **Initial Loss Rate**: The power bank was losing <important1>9% of the total capacity each hour</important1>.

2. **Duration of Initial Loss**: This loss rate continued for <important2>5 hours</important2>.

3. **Total Loss in First Phase**: Over 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% * 5 = 45% of its total capacity.

4. **Subsequent Loss Rate**: After 5 hours, the power bank started to lose <important3>7% of the total capacity each hour</important3>.

5. **Duration of Subsequent Loss**: This new loss rate continued for <important4>3 hours</important4>.

6. **Total Loss in Second Phase**: Over 3 hours, the power bank lost 7% * 3 = 21% of its total capacity.

7. **Total Loss**: The total loss over the 8 hours (5 hours + 3 hours) is 45% + 21% = 66% of the total capacity.

8. **Remaining Charge**: At the end of this period, the <important5>charge remaining was 28%</important5>.

9. **Initial Charge Calculation**: If 28% is the remaining charge after losing 66%, the initial charge must have been 28% + 66% = 94%.

When James came back yet again, <important4>3 dogs were gone</important4> so he no longer needed those toys. How many toys in total does James need?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many toys James needs in total, let's break down the situation step by step using the important information provided:

1. Initially, James has <important1>4 toys on hand for 4 dogs</important1>. This means he has 1 toy per dog.

2. <important2>There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now</important2>. This means the total number of dogs is now 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 12 toys in total. He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy 12 - 4 = 8 more toys.

3. After buying the toys, James finds that <important3>there are twice as many more dogs than when he left</important3>. When he left, there were 12 dogs. Now, there are twice as many, so there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs. He needs 24 toys in total. He already has 12 toys (4 original + 8 he bought), so he needs to buy 24 - 12 = 12 more toys.

4. When James comes back again, <important4>3 dogs were gone</important4>. This means there are now 24 - 3 = 21 dogs. He needs 21 toys in total. He already has 24 toys (12 original + 12 he bought), so he no longer needs 3 toys. Therefore, he needs 21 toys in total.

Thus, the total number of toys James needs is {21}."

With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to consider both the flashlights and the candles separately.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - There are <important1>4 people living there</important1>, and <important2>a flashlight for every person</important2>. Therefore, there are 4 flashlights for the people.
   - Additionally, there are <important3>8 rooms in the house</important3>, and there are two flashlights for each room. Therefore, there are 8 rooms x 2 flashlights per room = 16 flashlights for the rooms.
   - Total flashlights = 4 (for people) + 16 (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

2. **Candles:**
   - There are <important3>8 rooms in the house</important3>. Half of the rooms have <important4>4 small candles each</important4>, and the other half have <important5>5 medium candles each</important5>.
   - Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, 4 rooms have 4 small candles each, which is 4 rooms x 4 candles = 16 small candles.
   - The other 4 rooms have 5 medium candles each, which is 4 rooms x 5 candles = 20 medium candles.
   - Total candles = 16 (small) + 20 (medium) = 36 candles.

3. **Purchase of Frying Pan**: Sheila bought a frying pan that was on sale for <important3>20% off $20.00</important3>. To find the sale price, we calculate 20% of $20.00:

   Discount on frying pan = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

   Sale price of frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

4. **Purchase of Towels**: Sheila also bought a set of towels that was <important4>10% off $30.00</important4>. To find the sale price, we calculate 10% of $30.00:

   Discount on towels = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

   Sale price of towels = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

5. **Adding New Purchases**: Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the new balance after the return:

   Total cost of new purchases = $16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00

6. **Final Balance**: Add the total cost of new purchases to the balance after the return:

   New balance on credit card = $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is {113.00}."

How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, let's go through the information step by step:

1. **Initial Order of Sub Sandwiches**:
   - Sidney ordered <important2>3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches</important2>. This means Sidney initially ordered 10 - 3 = 7 sub sandwiches.

2. **Meatballs in Initial Order**:
   - Each sub sandwich contains <important1>4 meatballs</important1>. Therefore, the initial order of 7 sub sandwiches contained 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs.

3. **Sub Sandwiches Eaten by Mark**:
   - Mark ate <important3>4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches</important3>. This means Mark ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs.

4. **Remaining Sub Sandwiches After Mark Ate**:
   - After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.

5. **Additional Order of Sub Sandwiches**:
   - Sidney ordered <important4>another three sub sandwiches</important4>. This means Sidney added 3 * 4 = 12 meatballs to the remaining sub sandwiches.

6. **Total Remaining Meatballs**:
   - After Mark ate and Sidney ordered more, the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney had was 3 (remaining) + 3 (additional) = 6 sub sandwiches.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is 6 * 4 = 24 meatballs.

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is {24}."

If <important5>Erika now only needs an extra $50</important5> to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total cost of the laptop after the trade-in and then account for the money she has received and still needs.

1. **Calculate the reduced price of the laptop:**
   - The original cost of the laptop is <important1>$600</important1>.
   - With the trade-in, the price is reduced by <important2>$200</important2>.
   - Therefore, the new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

2. **Determine the total amount Erika has or will receive:**
   - She has been paid <important3>$150</important3> this week.
   - Her mom will give her <important4>$80</important4>.
   - She still needs an extra <important5>$50</important5> to buy the laptop.

3. **Calculate the total amount needed to reach the reduced price:**
   - The total amount she needs to have is $400 (the reduced price of the laptop).

4. **Calculate the total amount she currently has:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse.
   - The total amount she has or will receive is \( x + 150 + 80 \).
   - She still needs an extra $50, so the equation is:
     \[
     x + 150 + 80 + 50 = 400
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     x + 280 = 400
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 400 - 280 = 120
     \]

Therefore, Erika has {120} dollars in her purse."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to consider the meat consumed by each player who ate meat.

1. The <important1>first player ate a 6-ounce steak</important1>. Therefore, the first player consumed 6 ounces of meat.

2. The <important2>second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size</important2>. Therefore, the second player consumed 8 ounces of meat.

3. The <important3>third player ate a one-pound steak</important3>. Since one pound is equivalent to 16 ounces, the third player consumed 16 ounces of meat.

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we add up the ounces of meat consumed by the first three players:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

Total meat consumed = 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

Next, we know that <important2>during the week he made $105</important2>. This is the total amount he earned for the week.

To find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week, we divide the total earnings by the amount earned per branch:

Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Earnings per branch
= <important2>$105</important2> / <important1>$0.25</important1>
= 420 branches

Since a week typically consists of 7 days, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7:

Average branches per day = Total branches climbed / Number of days in a week
= 420 branches / 7 days
= 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed {60} branches per day."

What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then sum them up.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts.
- The store has a <important1>buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts</important1>.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the <important2>original price of each T-shirt is $8</important2>.

For the first T-shirt, Jake pays the full price of $8. For the second T-shirt, he gets 50% off, so he pays $8 * 0.5 = $4. Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes.

The <important5>true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900</important5>. How far off was his guess?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to calculate the number of red jelly beans he estimated and compare it to the true number.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.
The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall. Therefore, the volume of the jar is:
\[ \text{Volume of jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]
<important1>The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall</important1>.

Step 2: Calculate the effective volume for jelly beans.
Since the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume for jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.8 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]
<important3>80% efficiency in packing</important3>.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans.
Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so the total number of jelly beans is:
\[ \text{Total jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]
<important2>A jelly bean is .15 cubic inches</important2>.

Step 4: Calculate the estimated number of red jelly beans.
Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so:
\[ \text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.3 = 864 \]
<important4>Estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red</important4>.

Step 5: Determine how far off Tim's guess was.
The true number of red jelly beans is 900, so the difference is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]
<important5>The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900</important5>.

Therefore, Tim's guess was off by {36}."

She uses <important4>twice as much oil as salt</important4> and <important5>twice as much salt as zest</important5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many ounces of oil Tanya uses, we need to break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance, since they are the same).
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (and sugar, since they are the same).
   - Let \( o \) be the amount of oil.

2. **Establish relationships between the variables:**
   - From <important5>twice as much salt as zest</important5>, we have \( s = 2z \).
   - From <important4>twice as much oil as salt</important4>, we have \( o = 2s \).

3. **Express the total amount:**
   - The total amount of the scrub is 10 ounces, as per <important1>fill a 10-ounce jar</important1>.
   - The total amount is the sum of all components: \( z + z + s + s + o = 10 \).

4. **Substitute the relationships into the total:**
   - Substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation: \( z + z + 2z + 2z + o = 10 \).
   - Simplify: \( 6z + o = 10 \).

5. **Substitute \( o = 2s = 4z \) into the equation:**
   - Replace \( o \) with \( 4z \): \( 6z + 4z = 10 \).
   - Simplify: \( 10z = 10 \).

6. **Solve for \( z \):**
   - \( z = 1 \).

7. **Calculate \( o \):**
   - Since \( o = 4z \), and \( z = 1 \), then \( o = 4 \times 1 = 4 \).

Therefore, Tanya uses {4} ounces of oil."

The <important3>shore was 64 seconds away</important3>. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached the shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and then use the rate at which the boat was taking on water.

1. **Calculate the total distance rowed:**
   - We know from <important2>it took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet</important2> that Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
   - The <important3>shore was 64 seconds away</important3>. Therefore, the total time she rows is 64 seconds.
   - To find the total distance, we calculate how many 16-second intervals fit into 64 seconds: 64 seconds / 16 seconds = 4 intervals.
   - Since each interval corresponds to 20 feet, the total distance rowed is 4 intervals * 20 feet/interval = 80 feet.

2. **Calculate the amount of water taken on:**
   - The boat was taking on <important1>two liters of water for every ten feet</important1> rowed.
   - Since Julia rowed 80 feet, we calculate the total water taken on: (80 feet / 10 feet) * 2 liters = 8 * 2 liters = 16 liters.

Therefore, by the time Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken on {16} liters of water."

When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <important4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</important4>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break it down step by step using the important information provided:

1. Initially, Bob had a total of 7 fish in his pond: <important1>3 were orange</important1> and <important2>4 were white</important2>.

2. Bob bought <important3>17 fish</important3> from the pet store. These fish were a mix of orange and white fish.

3. After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob found that he now had <important4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</important4>.

Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish as \( y \).

- The total number of orange fish after the purchase is \( 3 + x \).
- The total number of white fish after the purchase is \( 4 + y \).

According to the condition <important4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</important4>, we have:
\[ 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \]

We also know that the total number of fish bought is 17:
\[ x + y = 17 \]

Now, let's solve these equations:

1. From the equation \( x + y = 17 \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[ x = 17 - y \]

2. Substitute \( x = 17 - y \) into the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):
   \[ 3 + (17 - y) = 2(4 + y) \]
   \[ 20 - y = 8 + 2y \]
   \[ 20 - 8 = 2y + y \]
   \[ 12 = 3y \]
   \[ y = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store. Therefore, the answer is {4}."

4. **Total Cars**: The rink has <important4>75 cars in total</important4>.

Now, we add up the number of red, green, and blue cars:
- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Total number of red, green, and blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

5. **Yellow Cars**: To find the number of yellow cars, subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
75 - 52 = 23.

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is {23}."

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the <important> tags.

1. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

2. According to <important1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).

3. According to <important2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

4. According to <important3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   \[
   2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
   \]

6. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19)
   \]
   \[
   4x + x + 8 = 38
   \]
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

7. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

8. Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

9. Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:
   \[
   x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
   \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved {10} tennis balls in the first set."

How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers.

Step 1: Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and <important1>edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week</important1>, he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Step 2: Calculate earnings from Publisher A.

How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the petals for each type of flower Rose picked and then account for the flowers she dropped.

1. **Initial Petal Count:**
   - Rose picks <important1>3 flowers with 5 petals each</important1>. This gives her 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
   - She then picks <important2>4 flowers with 6 petals each</important2>. This gives her 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
   - She adds another <important3>5 flowers with 4 petals each</important3>. This gives her 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
   - Lastly, she picks <important4>6 flowers with 7 petals each</important4>. This gives her 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Adding these up, the total number of petals before any are dropped is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

3. **Adjusting for Dropped Flowers:**
   - Rose drops <important5>1 of each</important5> type of flower. This means:
     - She drops 1 flower with 5 petals, losing 5 petals.
     - She drops 1 flower with 6 petals, losing 6 petals.
     - She drops 1 flower with 4 petals, losing 4 petals.
     - She drops 1 flower with 7 petals, losing 7 petals.

4. **Total Petals Lost:**
   - The total number of petals lost is 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.

5. **Final Petal Count in the Vase:**
   - Subtracting the lost petals from the initial total, we have 101 - 22 = 79 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is {79}."

What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the complementary probabilities of each event that would allow him not to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**: 
   - There's a <important1>50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework</important1>. 
   - Therefore, there's a 50% chance that the regular teacher will be there.

2. **Extension for Everyone Scenario**:
   - If the regular teacher is there, there's a <important2>40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</important2>.
   - Therefore, there's a 60% chance that she will not give an extension.

3. **Personal Extension Scenario**:
   - If the regular teacher is there and does not give an extension to everyone, there's a <important3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</important3>.
   - Therefore, there's an 80% chance that he will not get a personal extension.

Now, we calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- The probability that the regular teacher is there and does not give an extension to everyone is 50% * 60% = 30%.
- The probability that Marcus does not get a personal extension is 30% * 80% = 24%.

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is {24}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both pricing options and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 10 am is a total of 17 hours.

2. **Cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The initial 12-hour stay costs <important1>1000 pesos</important1>.
   - Cameron stays for 17 hours, which is 5 hours more than the 12-hour stay.
   - For each additional hour, he pays <important3>70 pesos</important3>.
   - Additional cost for 5 hours = 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost for this option = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

3. **Cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The 24-hour stay costs <important2>1600 pesos</important2>.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay with additional hours

It turns out to be too heavy, so he <important3>uses a weight two pounds lighter than that</important3>. What is the weight, in pounds, that he now uses?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the weight Jamaal now uses, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Weight**: Jamaal starts with an <important1>8-pound weight</important1>.

2. **Increase by 50%**: He then <important2>increases the weight that he uses by 50%</important2>. To calculate this, we find 50% of 8 pounds:
   \[
   0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   Adding this to the original weight gives:
   \[
   8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Adjust for Too Heavy**: Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, Jamaal <important3>uses a weight two pounds lighter than that</important3>. Therefore, we subtract 2 pounds from 12 pounds:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds}

How many slices of pizza were left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate how many slices were eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
There are 5 people, and <important1>each pizza had 12 slices</important1>. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

Step 2: Calculate how many slices Bryce and two friends ate.
Bryce and two friends ate <important2>2/3 of their pizzas</important2>. Since there are 3 people in this group, they each had a pizza with 12 slices. Therefore, they ate:
3 people * (2/3 * 12 slices) = 3 * 8 slices = 24 slices.

Step 3: Calculate how many slices the two remaining friends ate.
The two remaining friends ate <important3>3/4 of their pizzas</important3>. Since there are 2 people in this group, they each had a pizza with 12 slices. Therefore, they ate:
2 people * (3/4 * 12 slices) = 2 * 9 slices = 18 slices.

He <important7>sells each jar for $50</important7>. How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then for 10 jars, and compare it to the revenue from selling 10 jars.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.
- <important1>2 pounds of passion fruit</important1> at <important4>$6 per pound</important4> costs 2 * 6 = $12.
- <important2>1.5 pounds of jackfruit</important2> at <important5>$8 per pound</important5> costs 1.5 * 8 = $12.
- <important3>2 pounds of special honey</important3> at <important6>$10 per pound</important6> costs 2 * 10 = $20.

Total cost for one jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44.

Step 2: Calculate the cost for 10 jars.
- Total cost for 10 jars = 10 * $44 = $440.

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars.
- <important7>Each jar sells for $50</important7>, so 10 jars sell for 10 * 50 = $500.

Step 4: Calculate the profit.
- Profit = Revenue - Cost = $500 - $440 = $60.

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is {60}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much James made, we need to calculate the profit from selling the cars and then find his commission based on that profit.

1. **Calculate the total sales revenue:**
   James sold <important1>10 cars</important1> at a price of <important2>$25,000 each</important2>.
   Total sales revenue = 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.

To determine how much money is used, we need to calculate the total playtime for Jack and his three friends and then convert that into the number of quarters used.

1. **Jack's Playtime:**
   - <important1>Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes</important1>.
   - <important4>They play for 4 hours</important4>, which is 240 minutes.
   - Jack can play for 240 minutes.

2. **Two Friends' Playtime:**
   - <important2>Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long</important2>.
   - Each of these two friends can play for half of Jack's playtime, which is 240 / 2 = 120 minutes.
   - Together, these two friends play for 120 + 120 = 240 minutes.

3. **One Friend's Playtime:**
   - <important3>One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long</important3>.

If <important3>it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</important3>, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to consider the following key facts:

1. <important3>It takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater</important3>.
2. <important2>The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</important2>.
3. <important1>Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne</important1>.

Step-by-step reasoning:

- First, calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. Since <important2>the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel</important2>, and <important3>it takes Wayne four minutes</important3>, Bernadette's drive will take 4 times 4 minutes, which is 16 minutes.

- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Therefore, she needs to complete her 16-minute drive and arrive 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

- Since Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes, if he leaves at time T, he will arrive at T + 4 minutes.

- To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at T - 1 minute (since T + 4 - 5 = T - 1).

- Therefore, Bernadette should start her 16-minute drive at T - 1 - 16 = T - 17 minutes.

- Thus, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The answer is {17}."

He <important4>chews 1 piece on the way home from school</important4> and <important5>1 stick after dinner</important5>. He also <important6>gives half the gum he has remaining to his sister</important6> when she asks for some right before bed. How many pieces of gum does Jim have left at the end of the day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculations based on the important information provided.

1. **Initial Amount of Gum**: 
   - <important1>Jim has a 20 pack of gum</important1>.

2. **Gum Chewed at School**:
   - Jim chews <important2>1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school</important2>.
   - The school day lasts <important3>8 hours</important3>.
   - Therefore, Jim chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.

3. **Gum Chewed on the Way Home**:
   - Jim chews <important4>1 piece on the way home from school</important4>.

4. **Gum Chewed After Dinner**:
   - Jim chews <important5>1 stick after dinner</important5>.

5. **Total Gum Chewed Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Total gum chewed = 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = 6 pieces.

6. **Gum Remaining Before Giving to Sister**:
   - Initial gum = 20 pieces.
   - Gum remaining after chewing = 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

7. **Gum Given to Sister**:
   - Jim gives <important6>half the gum he has remaining to his sister</important6>.
   - Half of 14 pieces = 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

8. **Gum Left at the End of the Day**:
   - Gum remaining after giving to sister = 14 - 7 = 7 pieces.

Therefore, Jim has {7} pieces of gum left at the end of the day."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much root beer was available for each person to drink during the party, we need to calculate the total amount of root beer remaining after each day's events and then divide it by the number of people sharing it.

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made <important1>24 gallons of root beer on the first day</important1>.

2. **After the First Day**: Fred's <important2>children drank 4 gallons</important2>, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After the Second Day**: Fred's wife <important3>Barbie spilled 7 gallons</important3>, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After the Third Day**: Fred's friend <important4>Ronnie drank 5 gallons</important4>, so the remaining amount is:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **On the Fourth Day**: <important5>3 people showed up for the party</important5>, and including Fred, there are 4 people in total. The remaining 8 gallons of root beer are shared equally among them:
   \[
   \frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ gallons per person}
   \]

Therefore, each person had 2 gallons of root beer to drink during the party. The final answer is {2}."

How much is the boat worth after the three years?,"<important1>Gary bought a boat for $9000</important1>. <important2>Over the first year it depreciated 30%</important2>. <important3>The second year it depreciated another 30%</important3>. <important4>The third year it depreciated 20%</important4>. How much is the boat worth after the three years?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially to the initial purchase price.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: 
   - <important1>Gary bought a boat for $9000</important1>.

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by 30% in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by another 30% in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by 20% in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount for the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, after three years, the boat is worth {3528}."

What number of balloons did she finally carry into the school?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the remaining balloons after each event described in the text.

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Sally starts with <important1>25 red balloons</important1>, <important2>7 green balloons</important2>, and <important3>12 yellow balloons</important3>.

2. **Red Balloons Bursting:**
   - A gust of wind caused <important4>40% of the red balloons to burst</important4>.
   - 40% of 25 red balloons = 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.
   - Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally accidentally <important5>released half of the yellow balloons</important5>.
   - Half of 12 yellow balloons = 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons released.
   - Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

4. **Adding Blue Balloons:**
   - Sally found <important6>8 blue balloons caught in a tree</important6>.
   - She <important7>added 75% of them</important7> to her remaining clutch.
   - 75% of 8 blue balloons = 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons added.

5. **Total Balloons Carried into School:**
   - Total balloons = Remaining red balloons + green balloons + remaining yellow balloons + added blue balloons.
   - Total balloons = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 34 balloons.

Therefore, Sally finally carried {34} balloons into the school."
