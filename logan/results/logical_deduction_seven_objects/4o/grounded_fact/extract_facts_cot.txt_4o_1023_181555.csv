216,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: an owl, a crow, a falcon, a cardinal, a hummingbird, a quail, and a hawk. The falcon is to the left of the crow. The quail is to the right of the cardinal. The hummingbird is to the right of the quail. The falcon is the second from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk. The owl is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The owl is the leftmost
(B) The crow is the leftmost
(C) The falcon is the leftmost
(D) The cardinal is the leftmost
(E) The hummingbird is the leftmost
(F) The quail is the leftmost
(G) The hawk is the leftmost","### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine which bird is the leftmost, we need to analyze the positional relationships between the birds. The key facts involve the relative positions of the falcon, crow, quail, cardinal, hummingbird, hawk, and owl. Specifically, the position of the falcon being second from the right, the owl being third from the left, and the relative positions of the other birds are crucial to deducing the leftmost bird.

### Key Facts:
<fact1>The falcon is to the left of the crow</fact1>
<fact2>The quail is to the right of the cardinal</fact2>
<fact3>The hummingbird is to the right of the quail</fact3>
<fact4>The falcon is the second from the right</fact4>
<fact5>The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk</fact5>
<fact6>The owl is the third from the left</fact6>

### Reformatted Question:
On a branch, there are seven birds: an owl, a crow, a falcon, a cardinal, a hummingbird, a quail, and a hawk. <fact1>The falcon is to the left of the crow</fact1>. <fact2>The quail is to the right of the cardinal</fact2>. <fact3>The hummingbird is to the right of the quail</fact3>. <fact4>The falcon is the second from the right</fact4>. <fact5>The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk</fact5>. <fact6>The owl is the third from the left</fact6>.
Options:
(A) The owl is the leftmost
(B) The crow is the leftmost
(C) The falcon is the leftmost
(D) The cardinal is the leftmost
(E) The hummingbird is the leftmost
(F) The quail is the leftmost
(G) The hawk is the leftmost
### Final Answer Reasoning
To determine which bird is the leftmost, we analyze the positions of the birds based on the given facts. <fact4>The falcon is the second from the right</fact4>, which means there is only one bird to its right. <fact1>The falcon is to the left of the crow</fact1>, so the crow must be the rightmost bird. <fact6>The owl is the third from the left</fact6>, which means there are two birds to its left. <fact2>The quail is to the right of the cardinal</fact2>, and <fact3>the hummingbird is to the right of the quail</fact3>, indicating that the cardinal is further left than both the quail and the hummingbird. <fact5>The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk</fact5>, so the hawk is not the leftmost. Given these positions, the cardinal must be the leftmost bird. Therefore, the answer is {D}."
98,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe.
Options:
(A) Ana finished last
(B) Eve finished last
(C) Ada finished last
(D) Dan finished last
(E) Rob finished last
(F) Amy finished last
(G) Joe finished last","### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine who finished last in the golf tournament, we need to analyze the order of the golfers based on the given conditions. The key facts involve the relative positions of the golfers, especially focusing on Amy, who is explicitly mentioned as finishing last. This directly answers the question without needing to consider the positions of the other golfers.

### Key Facts:
<fact1>Amy finished last</fact1>

### Reformatted Question:
In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. <fact1>Amy finished last</fact1>. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe. Options: (A) Ana finished last (B) Eve finished last (C) Ada finished last (D) Dan finished last (E) Rob finished last (F) Amy finished last (G) Joe finished last
### Final Answer Reasoning
In the golf tournament, the key fact is that <fact1>Amy finished last</fact1>. This directly answers the question of who finished last among the golfers. Therefore, the correct option is {F}."
