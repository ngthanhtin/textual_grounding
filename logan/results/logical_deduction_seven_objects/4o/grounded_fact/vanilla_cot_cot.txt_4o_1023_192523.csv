216,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: an owl, a crow, a falcon, a cardinal, a hummingbird, a quail, and a hawk. The falcon is to the left of the crow. The quail is to the right of the cardinal. The hummingbird is to the right of the quail. The falcon is the second from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk. The owl is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The owl is the leftmost
(B) The crow is the leftmost
(C) The falcon is the leftmost
(D) The cardinal is the leftmost
(E) The hummingbird is the leftmost
(F) The quail is the leftmost
(G) The hawk is the leftmost","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds on the branch according to the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions one by one and see how they help us determine the order:

1. **The falcon is to the left of the crow.**
2. **The quail is to the right of the cardinal.**
3. **The hummingbird is to the right of the quail.**
4. **The falcon is the second from the right.**
5. **The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk.**
6. **The owl is the third from the left.**

Let's start with condition 4: ""The falcon is the second from the right."" This means the falcon is in the 6th position.

_ _ _ _ _ Falcon _

Next, condition 6: ""The owl is the third from the left."" This means the owl is in the 3rd position.

_ _ Owl _ _ Falcon _

Now, let's use condition 1: ""The falcon is to the left of the crow."" Since the falcon is in the 6th position, the crow must be in the 7th position.

_ _ Owl _ _ Falcon Crow

Condition 2: ""The quail is to the right of the cardinal."" This means the cardinal must be to the left of the quail.

Condition 3: ""The hummingbird is to the right of the quail."" This means the quail must be to the left of the hummingbird.

Condition 5: ""The hummingbird is to the left of the hawk."" This means the hummingbird must be to the left of the hawk.

Let's place the remaining birds: cardinal, quail, hummingbird, and hawk.

Since the falcon is in the 6th position and the crow is in the 7th, the hawk must be in the 5th position to satisfy condition 5.

_ _ Owl _ _ Falcon Crow
_ _ Owl _ Hawk Falcon Crow

Now, we need to place the cardinal, quail, and hummingbird. The quail must be to the right of the cardinal and to the left of the hummingbird. The hummingbird must be to the left of the hawk.

The only way to satisfy all these conditions is:

1. Cardinal
2. Quail
3. Owl
4. Hummingbird
5. Hawk
6. Falcon
7. Crow

Now, let's check the leftmost bird. According to this arrangement, the cardinal is the leftmost bird.

In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Ana, Eve, Ada, Dan, Rob, Amy, and Joe. Dan finished third. Ana finished above Ada. Amy finished last. Dan finished below Rob. Eve finished below Ada. Rob finished below Joe.
Options:
(A) Ana finished last
(B) Eve finished last
(C) Ada finished last
(D) Dan finished last
(E) Rob finished last
(F) Amy finished last
(G) Joe finished last","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. Dan finished third.
   - This means Dan is in the 3rd position.

2. Ana finished above Ada.
   - Ana's position is higher (better) than Ada's.

3. Amy finished last.
   - Amy is in the 7th position.

4. Dan finished below Rob.
   - Rob's position is higher (better) than Dan's, so Rob is either 1st or 2nd.

5. Eve finished below Ada.
   - Eve's position is lower (worse) than Ada's.

6. Rob finished below Joe.
   - Joe's position is higher (better) than Rob's, so Joe is 1st and Rob is 2nd.

Now, let's place the golfers based on these conditions:

- Joe is 1st (since he is above Rob).
- Rob is 2nd (since he is above Dan and below Joe).
- Dan is 3rd (given).
- Ana must be above Ada, and both must be above Eve. Since positions 1, 2, and 3 are taken, Ana and Ada must be in 4th and 5th positions, respectively, and Eve must be in 6th.
- Amy is 7th (given).

Thus, the order is:
1. Joe
2. Rob
3. Dan
4. Ana
5. Ada
6. Eve
7. Amy

The question asks who finished last, and based on our arrangement, Amy finished last.

(D) The robin is the second from the right
(E) The falcon is the second from the right
(F) The owl is the second from the right
(G) The blue jay is the second from the right","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions one by one and place the birds accordingly:

1. **The blue jay is the second from the right.**
   - This means the blue jay is in the 6th position.

2. **The blue jay is to the left of the falcon.**
   - Since the blue jay is in the 6th position, the falcon must be in the 7th position.

3. **The owl is the third from the right.**
   - The owl is in the 5th position.

4. **The raven is the third from the left.**
   - The raven is in the 3rd position.

5. **The raven is to the left of the robin.**
   - Since the raven is in the 3rd position, the robin must be in a position to the right of the 3rd position.

6. **The hummingbird is to the left of the quail.**
   - The hummingbird must be in a position to the left of the quail.

Now, let's fill in the positions based on the above conditions:

- Position 1: Unknown
- Position 2: Unknown
- Position 3: Raven
- Position 4: Unknown
- Position 5: Owl
- Position 6: Blue Jay
- Position 7: Falcon

Since the raven is in the 3rd position and must be to the left of the robin, the robin can only be in the 4th position. This leaves positions 1 and 2 for the hummingbird and the quail. Since the hummingbird must be to the left of the quail, the hummingbird is in position 1 and the quail is in position 2.

Now, the arrangement is:

1. Hummingbird
2. Quail
3. Raven
4. Robin
5. Owl
6. Blue Jay
7. Falcon

Finally, we need to determine which bird is the second from the right. According to our arrangement, the second from the right is the blue jay.

Therefore, the final answer is: {G}"

212,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eve, Ana, Amy, Dan, Eli, Rob, and Mya. Mya finished above Eli. Eve finished below Rob. Amy finished second. Rob finished below Dan. Ana finished second-to-last. Dan finished fourth.
Options:
(A) Eve finished first
(B) Ana finished first
(C) Amy finished first
(D) Dan finished first
(E) Eli finished first
(F) Rob finished first
(G) Mya finished first","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions one by one:

1. Mya finished above Eli.
2. Eve finished below Rob.
3. Amy finished second.
4. Rob finished below Dan.
5. Ana finished second-to-last.
6. Dan finished fourth.

Let's start by placing the golfers based on the information given:

- Amy is in 2nd place.
- Dan is in 4th place.
- Ana is in 6th place (second-to-last).

Now, let's use the remaining conditions to place the other golfers:

- Mya finished above Eli. This means Mya cannot be in 7th place, and Eli cannot be in 5th or higher.
- Eve finished below Rob. This means Eve cannot be in 1st, 3rd, or 5th place.
- Rob finished below Dan. Since Dan is in 4th place, Rob must be in 5th or lower.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- Since Dan is 4th and Rob is below Dan, Rob can be 5th or 7th. But Ana is 6th, so Rob must be 5th.
- Eve must be below Rob, so Eve can be 7th.
- Mya must be above Eli, so Mya can be 1st or 3rd, and Eli can be 7th or 3rd.

Let's try placing Mya and Eli:

- If Mya is 1st, then Eli can be 3rd or 7th. But Eli cannot be 3rd because Amy is 2nd and Dan is 4th, leaving no room for Eli in 3rd. So Eli must be 7th.
- This leaves Mya in 1st place.

Now we have the order:

1. Mya
2. Amy
3. (Open)
4. Dan
5. Rob
6. Ana
7. Eli

Since Eve must be below Rob, Eve is 7th, but Eli is already 7th, so Eve must be 3rd.

The final order is:

1. Mya
2. Amy
3. Eve
4. Dan
5. Rob
6. Ana
7. Eli

Therefore, Mya finished first.

7. Purple

Next, we need to place the brown, black, and green books:

- The brown book is to the left of the green book, so the green book cannot be in position 2.
- The brown book is to the right of the black book, so the black book must be placed before the brown book.

Let's try placing the black book in position 2:

1. Yellow
2. Black

(D) The watermelons are the third-most expensive
(E) The pears are the third-most expensive
(F) The peaches are the third-most expensive
(G) The oranges are the third-most expensive","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the information provided in the paragraph.

1. We know that the pears are the third-cheapest. This means there are two fruits cheaper than pears and four fruits more expensive than pears.

2. The kiwis are the second-most expensive. This means there is only one fruit more expensive than kiwis.

3. The pears are more expensive than the plums. Since pears are the third-cheapest, plums must be either the cheapest or the second-cheapest.

4. The oranges are less expensive than the kiwis. Since kiwis are the second-most expensive, oranges must be cheaper than kiwis.

5. The mangoes are the third-most expensive. This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes.

6. The peaches are the second-cheapest. This means there is only one fruit cheaper than peaches.

Let's arrange the fruits based on these constraints:

- Since peaches are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2.
- Since pears are the third-cheapest, they are in position 3.
- Since pears are more expensive than plums, plums must be the cheapest, in position 1.
- Since kiwis are the second-most expensive, they are in position 6.
- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, they are in position 5.
- Since oranges are less expensive than kiwis, they must be in position 4.
- The only fruit left is watermelons, which must be the most expensive, in position 7.

The order from cheapest to most expensive is:
1. Plums
2. Peaches
3. Pears
4. Oranges
5. Mangoes
6. Kiwis
7. Watermelons

Now, we need to identify which fruit is the third-most expensive. According to our arrangement, the mangoes are the third-most expensive.

Therefore, the correct answer is option (C).

5. **The raven is to the left of the quail.**
   - This means the raven must be to the left of the quail.

6. **The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.**
   - This means the hummingbird must be to the left of the robin.

Now, let's start placing the birds based on these clues:

- Position 2: Blue Jay

3. **The blue jay is the third from the right.**
   - Since there are seven positions, the blue jay is in position 5.

4. **The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.**
   - Since the hummingbird is in position 4, the crow must be in a position to the right of 4, which means it can be in position 5, 6, or 7. However, the blue jay is already in position 5, so the crow must be in position 6 or 7.

5. **The quail is to the right of the crow.**
   - This means the quail must be in a position to the right of the crow. If the crow is in position 6, the quail must be in position 7. If the crow is in position 7, there is no position for the quail to be to the right of it, so the crow must be in position 6 and the quail in position 7.

6. **The raven is to the left of the robin.**

4. The brown book is to the right of the yellow book.  
   - This means the yellow book must be to the left of the brown book.

5. The green book is to the left of the orange book.  
   - Since the green book is in position 5, the orange book must be in position 6 or 7.

6. The orange book is to the left of the gray book.  
   - This means the gray book must be in position 7 if the orange book is in position 6.

Now, let's place the books based on these conditions:

- Position 1: Purple book
- Position 2: (unknown)
- Position 3: Black book
- Position 4: (unknown)
- Position 5: Green book
- Position 6: Orange book
- Position 7: Gray book

The remaining books are the brown book and the yellow book. According to condition 4, the yellow book must be to the left of the brown book. Therefore, the yellow book must be in position 2, and the brown book must be in position 4.

Now, the complete order is:

1. Purple book
2. Yellow book
3. Black book
4. Brown book
5. Green book

The motorcyle is newer than the truck. The station wagon is older than the hatchback. The minivan is newer than the hatchback. The bus is newer than the minivan. The truck is newer than the limousine.
Options:
(A) The bus is the third-newest
(B) The motorcyle is the third-newest
(C) The hatchback is the third-newest
(D) The station wagon is the third-newest
(E) The minivan is the third-newest
(F) The truck is the third-newest
(G) The limousine is the third-newest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest based on the given clues. Let's analyze each statement:

1. The station wagon is the fourth-newest.
2. The motorcycle is newer than the truck.
3. The station wagon is older than the hatchback.
4. The minivan is newer than the hatchback.
5. The bus is newer than the minivan.
6. The truck is newer than the limousine.

Let's start by placing the station wagon in the fourth position since it is the fourth-newest:

- _ _ _ Station Wagon _ _ _

Next, we know the motorcycle is newer than the truck, and the truck is newer than the limousine. This gives us the order: Motorcycle > Truck > Limousine.

We also know the station wagon is older than the hatchback, and the minivan is newer than the hatchback. The bus is newer than the minivan. This gives us the order: Bus > Minivan > Hatchback > Station Wagon.

Now, let's try to fit these orders into the seven positions:

1. Bus
2. Minivan
3. Hatchback
4. Station Wagon
5. Motorcycle
6. Truck
7. Limousine

This order satisfies all the given conditions:

- The station wagon is the fourth-newest.
- The motorcycle is newer than the truck.
- The station wagon is older than the hatchback.
- The minivan is newer than the hatchback.
- The bus is newer than the minivan.

Now, let's use the other conditions to fill in the remaining positions:

4. The falcon is to the right of the quail.
5. The raven is to the left of the quail.
6. The robin is to the right of the hummingbird.

Since the robin is already placed as the third from the left, the hummingbird must be to the left of the robin. The only available position to the left of the robin is the first position:

- Hummingbird Blue Jay Robin _ _ Cardinal _

Now, we need to place the raven, quail, and falcon. The raven must be to the left of the quail, and the falcon must be to the right of the quail. The only available positions are the fourth, fifth, and seventh positions. Since the cardinal is already in the sixth position, the quail must be in the fifth position to satisfy the condition that the falcon is to the right of the quail:

- Hummingbird Blue Jay Robin Raven Quail Cardinal Falcon

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:

- The blue jay is the second from the left.
- The robin is the third from the left.
- The cardinal is the third from the right.
- The falcon is to the right of the quail.

- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, which means it is in the 4th position.
- The raven is the second from the left, which means it is in the 2nd position.

Now, let's place the remaining birds: blue jay, falcon, and robin.

- The robin is to the left of the owl, so it must be in one of the first three positions.
- The blue jay is to the left of the robin, so it must also be in one of the first three positions, and to the left of the robin.

Let's consider the possible placements for the robin and blue jay:

- If the robin is in the 3rd position, the blue jay must be in the 1st position (since the raven is in the 2nd position).
- This leaves the falcon to be placed in the 6th position.

3. The black book is the third from the right.
4. The red book is to the right of the yellow book.
5. The red book is to the left of the green book.
6. The blue book is to the right of the black book.

Let's start placing the books based on these conditions:

- From condition 1, we know the orange book is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.
- From condition 2, the white book is second from the right, which means it is in position 6.
- From condition 3, the black book is third from the right, which means it is in position 5.
- From condition 6, the blue book is to the right of the black book. Since the black book is in position 5, the blue book must be in position 7 (the only position to the right of position 5).
- Now, we have positions 2, 3, and 4 left for the yellow, red, and green books.
- From condition 4, the red book is to the right of the yellow book. This means the yellow book must be in position 2 or 3, and the red book must be in position 3 or 4.
- From condition 5, the red book is to the left of the green book. This means the green book must be in position 4 if the red book is in position 3, or in position 3 if the red book is in position 2.

Let's try to place the yellow, red, and green books:

- If the yellow book is in position 2, the red book can be in position 3, and the green book in position 4. This satisfies all conditions.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
1. Orange
2. Yellow
3. Red
4. Green
5. Black
6. White
7. Blue

The leftmost book is the orange book.

25,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a blue jay, an owl, a falcon, a hawk, a raven, a crow, and a hummingbird. The falcon is the second from the left. The crow is the rightmost. The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay. The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird. The blue jay is to the right of the owl. The raven is to the left of the falcon.
Options:
(A) The blue jay is the fourth from the left
(B) The owl is the fourth from the left
(C) The falcon is the fourth from the left
(D) The hawk is the fourth from the left
(E) The raven is the fourth from the left
(F) The crow is the fourth from the left
(G) The hummingbird is the fourth from the left","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven birds on the branch based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. **The falcon is the second from the left.**
   - This means the falcon is in position 2.

2. **The crow is the rightmost.**
   - This means the crow is in position 7.

3. **The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.**
   - This means the blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.

4. **The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird.**
   - This means the hummingbird is to the left of the hawk.

5. **The blue jay is to the right of the owl.**
   - This means the owl is to the left of the blue jay.

6. **The raven is to the left of the falcon.**
   - This means the raven is in position 1.

Now, let's place the birds based on these conditions:

- Position 1: Raven (from condition 6)
- Position 2: Falcon (from condition 1)
- Position 7: Crow (from condition 2)

Next, we need to place the remaining birds: blue jay, owl, hummingbird, and hawk.

- From condition 5, the owl must be to the left of the blue jay. The only available positions to the left of the blue jay are 3 and 4. So, the owl must be in position 3, and the blue jay must be in position 4.

- From condition 3, the hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay. The only available positions to the right of the blue jay are 5 and 6. So, the hummingbird must be in position 5.

- From condition 4, the hawk is to the right of the hummingbird. The only available position to the right of the hummingbird is 6. So, the hawk must be in position 6.

Now, let's verify the positions:
- Position 1: Raven
- Position 2: Falcon
- Position 3: Owl
- Position 4: Blue Jay
- Position 5: Hummingbird
- Position 6: Hawk
- Position 7: Crow

The blue jay is indeed the fourth from the left. Therefore, the correct answer is:

In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Joe, Rob, Eli, Dan, Mya, Ada, and Ana. Joe finished above Ana. Ana finished second-to-last. Mya finished fourth. Dan finished third. Ada finished second. Eli finished third-to-last.
Options:
(A) Joe finished second-to-last
(B) Rob finished second-to-last
(C) Eli finished second-to-last
(D) Dan finished second-to-last
(E) Mya finished second-to-last
(F) Ada finished second-to-last
(G) Ana finished second-to-last","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the seven golfers finished based on the given information. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Ana finished second-to-last.**  
   This means Ana finished in 6th place.

2. **Joe finished above Ana.**  
   Since Ana is 6th, Joe must be in one of the positions 1st to 5th.

3. **Mya finished fourth.**  
   Mya is in 4th place.

4. **Dan finished third.**  
   Dan is in 3rd place.

5. **Ada finished second.**  
   Ada is in 2nd place.

6. **Eli finished third-to-last.**  
   This means Eli finished in 5th place.

Now, let's arrange the positions we know:

- 1st: Unknown
- 2nd: Ada
- 3rd: Dan
- 4th: Mya
- 5th: Eli
- 6th: Ana
- 7th: Unknown

The remaining golfers are Joe and Rob. Since Joe must finish above Ana, Joe cannot be 7th. Therefore, Joe must be 1st, and Rob must be 7th.

The final order is:

1. Joe
2. Ada
3. Dan
4. Mya
5. Eli
6. Ana
7. Rob

From the options given, we need to identify who finished second-to-last. We already determined that Ana finished second-to-last (6th place).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) The minivan is the third-oldest
(D) The bus is the third-oldest
(E) The tractor is the third-oldest
(F) The station wagon is the third-oldest
(G) The convertible is the third-oldest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **The station wagon is the fourth-newest.**
   - This means there are three vehicles newer than the station wagon.

2. **The minivan is the third-newest.**
   - This means there are two vehicles newer than the minivan.

3. **The tractor is the second-oldest.**
   - This means there is only one vehicle older than the tractor.

4. **The convertible is older than the station wagon.**
   - This places the convertible somewhere before the station wagon in the order.

5. **The truck is newer than the bus.**
   - This places the truck somewhere after the bus in the order.

6. **The hatchback is older than the convertible.**
   - This places the hatchback somewhere before the convertible in the order.

Now, let's try to arrange the vehicles based on these clues:

- Since the tractor is the second-oldest, it must be in the second position from the oldest.
- The hatchback is older than the convertible, so it must be placed before the convertible.
- The convertible is older than the station wagon, so it must be placed before the station wagon.
- The minivan is the third-newest, so it must be placed in the fifth position from the oldest.
- The station wagon is the fourth-newest, so it must be placed in the fourth position from the oldest.
- The truck is newer than the bus, so the bus must be placed before the truck.

Let's try to place these vehicles in order:

1. Oldest: ?
2. Second-oldest: Tractor
3. Third-oldest: ?
4. Fourth-oldest: Station Wagon
5. Fifth-oldest: Minivan
6. Sixth-oldest: ?
7. Newest: ?

Given the constraints, let's fill in the gaps:

- The hatchback must be older than the convertible, and the convertible must be older than the station wagon. Therefore, the hatchback must be the oldest, and the convertible must be the third-oldest.
- The bus must be older than the truck, so the bus must be the sixth-oldest, and the truck must be the newest.

Thus, the order from oldest to newest is:
1. Hatchback
2. Tractor
3. Convertible
4. Station Wagon
5. Minivan
6. Bus
7. Truck

Therefore, the third-oldest vehicle is the convertible.

1. The robin is to the left of the owl.
2. The crow is the rightmost.
3. The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.
4. The owl is the third from the right.
5. The blue jay is to the left of the robin.
6. The raven is the second from the left.

Let's start by placing the birds based on the most specific conditions:

- The crow is the rightmost, so it is in position 7.
- The owl is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5.
- The hummingbird is the fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.
- The raven is the second from the left, so it is in position 2.

Mel finished above Ada.
Options:
(A) Mel finished fourth
(B) Rob finished fourth
(C) Eli finished fourth
(D) Dan finished fourth
(E) Ana finished fourth
(F) Ada finished fourth
(G) Mya finished fourth","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. Ana finished last. This means Ana is in the 7th position.

2. Mya finished above Rob. This means Mya's position is better (lower number) than Rob's position.

3. Dan finished above Mya. This means Dan's position is better than Mya's position.

4. Rob finished fourth. This means Rob is in the 4th position.

5. Eli finished second. This means Eli is in the 2nd position.

6. Mel finished above Ada. This means Mel's position is better than Ada's position.

Now, let's use these conditions to determine the order:

- Since Rob is 4th, we have: \[ \_\_ \_\_ \_\_ \text{Rob} \_\_ \_\_ \text{Ana} \]

- Eli is 2nd, so we have: \[ \_\_ \text{Eli} \_\_ \text{Rob} \_\_ \_\_ \text{Ana} \]

- Mya finished above Rob, so Mya must be in 1st or 3rd position. 

- Dan finished above Mya, so Dan must be in 1st position if Mya is 3rd. 

- Mel finished above Ada, so Mel must be in 3rd or 5th position, and Ada must be in 5th or 6th position.

Let's try to fit these into the sequence:

- If Dan is 1st, then Mya is 3rd, and Mel must be 5th (since Mel is above Ada), and Ada must be 6th.

This gives us the order: Dan, Eli, Mya, Rob, Mel, Ada, Ana.

Now, let's verify:

- Ana is last (7th) - correct.
- Mya is above Rob - correct (3rd vs. 4th).
- Dan is above Mya - correct (1st vs. 3rd).
- Rob is 4th - correct.
- Eli is 2nd - correct.
- Mel is above Ada - correct (5th vs. 6th).

Everything checks out, so the order is: Dan, Eli, Mya, Rob, Mel, Ada, Ana.

Since Rob is 4th, the correct answer is option (B).

(D) The robin is the third from the left
(E) The falcon is the third from the left
(F) The owl is the third from the left
(G) The blue jay is the third from the left","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds on the branch according to the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions one by one and place the birds accordingly:

1. **The blue jay is the second from the right.**
   - This means the blue jay is in the 6th position.

2. **The owl is the third from the right.**
   - This means the owl is in the 5th position.

3. **The blue jay is to the left of the falcon.**
   - Since the blue jay is in the 6th position, the falcon must be in the 7th position.

4. **The raven is the third from the left.**
   - This means the raven is in the 3rd position.

5. **The raven is to the left of the robin.**
   - Since the raven is in the 3rd position, the robin must be in a position to the right of the 3rd position.

6. **The hummingbird is to the left of the quail.**
   - This means the hummingbird must be in a position to the left of the quail.

Now, let's place the birds based on the information we have:

- Position 1: Unknown
- Position 2: Unknown
- Position 3: Raven
- Position 4: Unknown
- Position 5: Owl
- Position 6: Blue Jay
- Position 7: Falcon

Since the raven is in the 3rd position and must be to the left of the robin, the robin can be in either the 4th position. 

The hummingbird must be to the left of the quail, so they can occupy positions 1 and 2, but we need to determine which is which. 

Let's try placing the robin in the 4th position:

- Position 1: Hummingbird
- Position 2: Quail
- Position 3: Raven
- Position 4: Robin
- Position 5: Owl
- Position 6: Blue Jay
- Position 7: Falcon

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:
- The blue jay is to the left of the falcon.
- The blue jay is the second from the right.
- The raven is to the left of the robin.
- The owl is the third from the right.
- The hummingbird is to the left of the quail.
- The raven is the third from the left.

Next, the raven is the third from the right:

- _ _ _ Raven _ _ Falcon

The cardinal is the second from the left:

- _ Cardinal _ _ _ _ Falcon

The owl is to the left of the cardinal. Since the cardinal is second from the left, the owl must be the leftmost:

- Owl Cardinal _ _ _ _ Falcon

Now, we know the quail is to the left of the hummingbird, and the raven is to the right of the hummingbird. The only positions left are the third, fourth, and fifth from the left. The raven is already placed, so the hummingbird must be to the left of the raven, and the quail must be to the left of the hummingbird:

(D) The pears are the fourth-most expensive
(E) The cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive
(F) The oranges are the fourth-most expensive
(G) The peaches are the fourth-most expensive","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven fruits in order of their prices based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions one by one:

1. The oranges are more expensive than the peaches.
2. The cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive.
3. The pears are less expensive than the cantaloupes.
4. The peaches are the second-most expensive.
5. The mangoes are the cheapest.
6. The kiwis are the third-cheapest.

Let's start by placing the fruits based on the information given:

- Since the mangoes are the cheapest, they are in the 7th position.
- The kiwis are the third-cheapest, which means they are in the 5th position.
- The peaches are the second-most expensive, so they are in the 2nd position.
- The cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive, so they are in the 4th position.

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions:

- The pears are less expensive than the cantaloupes, so they must be in the 6th position (since the 5th position is already taken by kiwis).
- The oranges are more expensive than the peaches, so they must be in the 1st position.
- The only fruit left is the watermelons, which must be in the 3rd position.

Now, let's list the fruits in order of their prices from most expensive to least expensive:

1. Oranges
2. Peaches
3. Watermelons

(D) The pears are the second-cheapest
(E) The watermelons are the second-cheapest
(F) The apples are the second-cheapest
(G) The loquats are the second-cheapest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues.

1. **Plums are the cheapest.**  
   This means plums are in the 1st position.

2. **Loquats are the third-cheapest.**  
   This means loquats are in the 3rd position.

3. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**  
   This means watermelons are in the 6th position.

4. **Watermelons are more expensive than cantaloupes.**  
   Since watermelons are in the 6th position, cantaloupes cannot be in the 6th or 7th position. They must be in the 5th position.

5. **Apples are less expensive than cantaloupes.**  
   Since cantaloupes are in the 5th position, apples must be in a position lower than 5th. They cannot be in the 1st or 3rd position (occupied by plums and loquats), so they must be in the 4th position.

6. **Apples are more expensive than loquats.**  
   This is consistent with apples being in the 4th position and loquats in the 3rd position.

7. **Loquats are less expensive than kiwis.**  
   Since loquats are in the 3rd position, kiwis must be in a position higher than 3rd. They cannot be in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th positions, so they must be in the 2nd position.

8. **Pears are the only fruit left.**  
   Since all other positions are filled, pears must be in the 7th position.

Now, let's list the fruits in order of increasing price:

1. Plums
2. Kiwis
3. Loquats
4. Apples
5. Cantaloupes

4. The blue book is to the left of the red book.
5. The blue book is the second from the right.
6. The green book is to the left of the purple book.

Let's start by placing the books based on the conditions:

  1. [ ]
  2. Gray
  3. [ ]
  4. [ ]
  5. [ ]
  6. [ ]
  7. [ ]

- From condition 5, the blue book is the second from the right. So, the position is:
  1. [ ]
  2. Gray
  3. [ ]
  4. [ ]
  5. [ ]
  6. Blue
  7. [ ]

- From condition 4, the blue book is to the left of the red book. Therefore, the red book must be in position 7:

  5. [ ]
  6. Blue
  7. Red

- From condition 1, the brown book is to the left of the green book. The only available positions for these books are 3, 4, and 5. Since the green book must also be to the left of the purple book (condition 6), the only possible arrangement is:
  1. Black
  2. Gray

(C) Eli finished second-to-last
(D) Rob finished second-to-last
(E) Joe finished second-to-last
(F) Eve finished second-to-last
(G) Ana finished second-to-last","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Rob finished second.**
   - This means Rob is in position 2.

2. **Rob finished above Eve.**
   - Since Rob is second, Eve must be in a position lower than 2.

3. **Joe finished above Ada.**
   - Joe's position is higher (better) than Ada's.

4. **Joe finished below Eve.**
   - Since Joe is below Eve, Eve must be in a position higher than Joe.

5. **Ada finished above Ana.**
   - Ada's position is higher (better) than Ana's.

6. **Eli finished third-to-last.**
   - With seven golfers, the third-to-last position is position 5. So, Eli is in position 5.

Now, let's use this information to deduce the positions:

- Rob is in position 2.
- Eli is in position 5.
- Eve must be above Joe, and both must be below Rob. Therefore, Eve can only be in position 3 or 4, and Joe must be in the position directly below Eve.
- Ada is above Ana, so Ada cannot be in the last position.

Let's try to fill in the positions:

- **Position 1:** Since Rob is in position 2, and Eve and Joe are below him, the only candidates for position 1 are Amy or Ada.
- **Position 2:** Rob
- **Position 3 or 4:** Eve (since she is above Joe)
- **Position 3 or 4:** Joe (since he is below Eve)
- **Position 5:** Eli
- **Position 6 or 7:** Ada (since she is above Ana)
- **Position 6 or 7:** Ana

Now, let's consider the options for who finished second-to-last (position 6):

- **Position 1:** Amy or Ada
- **Position 2:** Rob
- **Position 3:** Eve
- **Position 4:** Joe
- **Position 5:** Eli
- **Position 6:** Ada or Ana
- **Position 7:** Ana or Ada

Since Ada is above Ana, Ada must be in position 6, and Ana must be in position 7.

Therefore, Ada finished second-to-last.

83,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a sedan, a truck, a bus, a station wagon, a tractor, a convertible, and a limousine. The truck is the oldest. The tractor is the newest. The sedan is older than the station wagon. The station wagon is the third-newest. The bus is older than the convertible. The sedan is newer than the convertible.
Options:
(A) The sedan is the fourth-newest
(B) The truck is the fourth-newest
(C) The bus is the fourth-newest
(D) The station wagon is the fourth-newest
(E) The tractor is the fourth-newest
(F) The convertible is the fourth-newest
(G) The limousine is the fourth-newest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **The truck is the oldest.**
   - This means the truck is in the first position.

2. **The tractor is the newest.**
   - This means the tractor is in the seventh position.

3. **The sedan is older than the station wagon.**
   - This means the sedan comes before the station wagon in the order.

4. **The station wagon is the third-newest.**
   - This means the station wagon is in the fifth position.

5. **The bus is older than the convertible.**
   - This means the bus comes before the convertible in the order.

6. **The sedan is newer than the convertible.**
   - This means the convertible comes before the sedan in the order.

Now, let's arrange the vehicles based on these clues:

- We know the truck is the oldest, so it is in position 1.
- The tractor is the newest, so it is in position 7.
- The station wagon is the third-newest, so it is in position 5.

Given that the sedan is older than the station wagon, the sedan must be in position 4 or earlier.

The bus is older than the convertible, and the convertible is older than the sedan. Therefore, the order of these three must be: bus, convertible, sedan.

Let's place them:

- The bus must be in position 2 or 3.
- The convertible must be in position 3 or 4.
- The sedan must be in position 4.

Since the station wagon is in position 5, the sedan must be in position 4.

Now, let's fill in the positions:

1. Truck
2. Bus
3. Convertible
4. Sedan
5. Station Wagon
6. Limousine (by elimination, since it's the only one left)
7. Tractor

Thus, the fourth-newest vehicle is the sedan.

   - This means the crow must be to the left of the owl.

5. The falcon is the rightmost.
   - This places the falcon in position 7.

6. The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird.
   - Since the hummingbird is in position 2, the hawk must be in position 3.

4. **The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis.**
5. **The apples are more expensive than the loquats.**
6. **The loquats are the third-cheapest.**
7. **The plums are the cheapest.**

Let's start arranging the fruits based on these clues:

- **Plums** are the cheapest (7th position).
- **Loquats** are the third-cheapest (5th position).
- **Apples** are more expensive than loquats, so they cannot be in the 6th position. They must be in the 4th position.
- **Watermelons** are the second-most expensive (2nd position).
- **Cantaloupes** are less expensive than watermelons but more expensive than apples, so they must be in the 3rd position.
- **Kiwis** are more expensive than loquats, so they cannot be in the 6th position. They must be in the 1st position.
- **Pears** are the only fruit left, so they must be the most expensive (1st position).

Now, let's list the fruits in order from cheapest to most expensive:

1. Plums (7th)

Mel finished last. Amy finished third.
Options:
(A) Joe finished first
(B) Dan finished first
(C) Ana finished first
(D) Mel finished first
(E) Ada finished first
(F) Eve finished first
(G) Amy finished first","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. **Dan finished second.**
   - This means Dan is in position 2.

2. **Amy finished third.**
   - This means Amy is in position 3.

3. **Ana finished third-to-last.**
   - Since there are seven golfers, third-to-last is position 5. So, Ana is in position 5.

4. **Mel finished last.**
   - This means Mel is in position 7.

5. **Eve finished above Amy.**
   - Since Amy is in position 3, Eve must be in position 1 or 2. However, Dan is already in position 2, so Eve must be in position 1.

6. **Ada finished below Ana.**
   - Ana is in position 5, so Ada must be in position 6 or 7. Since Mel is in position 7, Ada must be in position 6.

Now, let's summarize the positions we have determined so far:
- Position 1: Eve
- Position 2: Dan
- Position 3: Amy
- Position 5: Ana
- Position 6: Ada
- Position 7: Mel

The only position left is position 4, which must be occupied by Joe.

Therefore, the final order is:
1. Eve

(G) The robin is the second from the right","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven birds on the branch based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The owl is the second from the right.**
   - This means the owl is in the 6th position from the left.

2. **The cardinal is the fourth from the left.**
   - This places the cardinal in the 4th position.

3. **The falcon is to the left of the blue jay.**
   - This means the falcon must be positioned somewhere to the left of the blue jay.

4. **The quail is to the left of the falcon.**
   - This means the quail must be positioned somewhere to the left of the falcon.

5. **The raven is the second from the left.**
   - This places the raven in the 2nd position.

6. **The robin is to the left of the quail.**
   - This means the robin must be positioned somewhere to the left of the quail.

Now, let's try to place the birds in order:

- We know the owl is in the 6th position.
- The cardinal is in the 4th position.
- The raven is in the 2nd position.

Let's denote the positions as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

- Position 2: Raven
- Position 4: Cardinal
- Position 6: Owl

Now, we need to place the remaining birds: falcon, blue jay, quail, and robin.

Since the falcon is to the left of the blue jay, and the quail is to the left of the falcon, and the robin is to the left of the quail, we can deduce the following order for these four birds:

- Robin, Quail, Falcon, Blue Jay

Let's try to fit them into the remaining positions:

- Position 1: Robin
- Position 3: Quail
- Position 5: Falcon
- Position 7: Blue Jay

Now, let's verify the order:

1. Robin
2. Raven
3. Quail
4. Cardinal
5. Falcon
6. Owl
7. Blue Jay

This order satisfies all the given conditions. Now, we need to determine which bird is the second from the right:

- The second from the right is the 6th position, which is the Owl.

3. **The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.**
   - This means the hummingbird is in a position less than the falcon.

4. **The robin is to the left of the hummingbird.**
   - This means the robin is in a position less than the hummingbird.

5. **The blue jay is the third from the right.**
   - Since there are seven birds, the blue jay is in position 5.

6. **The quail is to the right of the falcon.**

(A) Eve finished fourth
(B) Rob finished fourth
(C) Dan finished fourth
(D) Mel finished fourth
(E) Ana finished fourth
(F) Eli finished fourth
(G) Ada finished fourth","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Ana finished third.**
   - This is a fixed position: Ana is 3rd.

2. **Eli finished second.**
   - This is another fixed position: Eli is 2nd.

3. **Mel finished above Eli.**
   - Since Eli is 2nd, Mel must be 1st.

4. **Ada finished above Rob.**
   - Ada's position is higher than Rob's.

5. **Eve finished below Rob.**
   - Eve's position is lower than Rob's.

6. **Ada finished below Dan.**
   - Dan's position is higher than Ada's.

Now, let's place the golfers in order:

- **1st:** Mel (since Mel is above Eli and Eli is 2nd)
- **2nd:** Eli (given)
- **3rd:** Ana (given)
- **4th:** We need to determine who finishes 4th.
- **5th:** We need to determine who finishes 5th.
- **6th:** We need to determine who finishes 6th.
- **7th:** We need to determine who finishes 7th.

From the conditions:
- Ada is above Rob, and Eve is below Rob. This means Rob is above Eve.
- Ada is below Dan, so Dan is above Ada.

Given the positions of Mel, Eli, and Ana, the remaining golfers are Dan, Ada, Rob, and Eve. We need to place them in 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th positions.

- **Dan must be 4th** because he is above Ada, and the only available position above Ada (who cannot be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd) is 4th.
- **Ada must be 5th** because she is below Dan and above Rob.
- **Rob must be 6th** because he is below Ada and above Eve.

1. **The falcon is the second from the left.**
   - This means the falcon is in position 2.

2. **The crow is the rightmost.**
   - This means the crow is in position 7.

3. **The hummingbird is to the right of the blue jay.**
   - This means the blue jay is to the left of the hummingbird.

4. **The hawk is to the right of the hummingbird.**
   - This means the hummingbird is to the left of the hawk.

5. **The blue jay is to the right of the owl.**
   - This means the owl is to the left of the blue jay.

6. **The raven is to the left of the falcon.**
   - This means the raven is in position 1.

Now, let's place the birds based on these conditions:

- Position 1: Raven (from condition 6)
- Position 2: Falcon (from condition 1)
- Position 7: Crow (from condition 2)

Next, we need to place the remaining birds: blue jay, owl, hummingbird, and hawk.

- The owl must be to the left of the blue jay (condition 5).
- The blue jay must be to the left of the hummingbird (condition 3).
- The hummingbird must be to the left of the hawk (condition 4).

Given these conditions, let's try to place the remaining birds:

- Position 3: Owl (since it must be to the left of the blue jay)
- Position 4: Blue Jay (since it must be to the right of the owl and to the left of the hummingbird)
- Position 5: Hummingbird (since it must be to the right of the blue jay and to the left of the hawk)
- Position 6: Hawk (since it must be to the right of the hummingbird)

Now, the order of the birds from left to right is:
1. Raven
2. Falcon
3. Owl
4. Blue Jay
5. Hummingbird
6. Hawk
7. Crow

We need to determine which bird is the third from the right. Counting from the right, the third bird is the hummingbird.

(E) The quail is the fourth from the left
(F) The blue jay is the fourth from the left
(G) The cardinal is the fourth from the left","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in the correct order based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The cardinal is the leftmost.**
   - This means the cardinal is in position 1.

2. **The hummingbird is the fourth from the left.**
   - This places the hummingbird in position 4.

3. **The blue jay is the third from the right.**
   - Since there are seven birds, the blue jay is in position 5.

4. **The hummingbird is to the left of the crow.**
   - Since the hummingbird is in position 4, the crow must be in a position to the right of 4.

5. **The quail is to the right of the crow.**
   - This means the quail must be in a position to the right of the crow.

6. **The raven is to the left of the robin.**
   - The raven must be in a position to the left of the robin.

Now, let's try to place the remaining birds (raven, robin, crow, quail) in the available positions (2, 3, 6, 7) while satisfying all the conditions:

- The hummingbird is in position 4.
- The blue jay is in position 5.
- The cardinal is in position 1.

Since the hummingbird is in position 4 and the crow must be to its right, the crow can be in position 6 or 7. The quail must be to the right of the crow, so if the crow is in position 6, the quail must be in position 7.

This leaves positions 2 and 3 for the raven and robin. Since the raven is to the left of the robin, the raven must be in position 2 and the robin in position 3.

Thus, the order from left to right is:
1. Cardinal
2. Raven
3. Robin
4. Hummingbird
5. Blue Jay
6. Crow
7. Quail

The bird that is fourth from the left is the hummingbird.

(D) The cantaloupes are the cheapest
(E) The kiwis are the cheapest
(F) The pears are the cheapest
(G) The peaches are the cheapest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Pears are the second-cheapest.**
   - This means there is one fruit cheaper than pears.

2. **Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes.**
   - This means cantaloupes are cheaper than peaches.

3. **Peaches are less expensive than mangoes.**
   - This means mangoes are more expensive than peaches.

4. **Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis.**
   - This means kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes.

5. **Oranges are the fourth-most expensive.**
   - This means there are three fruits more expensive than oranges and three fruits cheaper than oranges.

6. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**
   - This means there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.

Now, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these clues:

- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, they are in position 2 from the top.
- Since oranges are the fourth-most expensive, they are in position 4 from the top.
- Since pears are the second-cheapest, they are in position 2 from the bottom (or position 6 from the top).
- Since peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes and less expensive than mangoes, and cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis, we can deduce the following order for these four fruits: kiwis < cantaloupes < peaches < mangoes.
- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, mangoes must be the most expensive (position 1 from the top).
- This places watermelons in position 2, and oranges in position 4.
- The only position left for peaches is position 3.
- Cantaloupes, being cheaper than peaches, must be in position 5.
- Kiwis, being cheaper than cantaloupes, must be in position 7.
- Pears, being the second-cheapest, are in position 6.

Thus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:
1. Kiwis
2. Pears

6. ""The station wagon is the oldest.""  
   - This means the station wagon is the first in the order.

Now, let's arrange the vehicles based on these clues:

- The station wagon is the oldest.
- The hatchback is older than the bus, and the bus is older than the motorcycle. Therefore, the hatchback comes after the station wagon.
- The sedan is the third-oldest, so it comes after the hatchback.
- The bus is older than the motorcycle and newer than the hatchback, so it comes after the sedan.
- The motorcycle is older than the tractor, so it comes after the bus.
- The tractor is newer than the motorcycle, so it comes after the motorcycle.
- The minivan is the newest, so it comes last.

Putting it all together, the order from oldest to newest is:

1. Station wagon
2. Hatchback

1. The convertible is the second-oldest.
2. The tractor is the fourth-newest.
3. The minivan is older than the truck.
4. The truck is older than the limousine.
5. The hatchback is the third-oldest.
6. The bus is newer than the limousine.

- The hatchback is the third-oldest.

This gives us the partial order:
1. ?
2. Convertible
3. Hatchback
4. ?
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?

Next, let's place the tractor, which is the fourth-newest. Since there are seven vehicles, the fourth-newest is the fourth position from the newest, which is the fourth position from the end. Therefore, the tractor is in position 4 from the end, which is position 4 from the start (since 7 - 4 + 1 = 4).

Now, we have:
1. ?
2. Convertible
3. Hatchback
4. Tractor
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?

Next, we know:
- The minivan is older than the truck.
- The truck is older than the limousine.
- The bus is newer than the limousine.

Let's consider the possible positions for the minivan, truck, limousine, and bus. Since the bus is newer than the limousine, the limousine must be older than the bus. Therefore, the bus cannot be in position 5, 6, or 7.

Since the minivan is older than the truck, and the truck is older than the limousine, the order among these three must be: minivan, truck, limousine.

Let's try placing them:
- The minivan could be in position 1, 5, 6, or 7.
- The truck could be in position 5, 6, or 7.
- The limousine could be in position 5, 6, or 7.

Since the bus is newer than the limousine, the bus must be in position 6 or 7.

Let's try placing the minivan in position 1 (oldest):
1. Minivan
2. Convertible
3. Hatchback
4. Tractor
5. Truck
6. Limousine
7. Bus

This order satisfies all the conditions:
- The convertible is the second-oldest.
- The hatchback is the third-oldest.
- The tractor is the fourth-newest.
- The minivan is older than the truck.
- The truck is older than the limousine.
- The bus is newer than the limousine.

(C) The bus is the oldest
(D) The motorcyle is the oldest
(E) The hatchback is the oldest
(F) The tractor is the oldest
(G) The minivan is the oldest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues. Let's analyze each statement:

1. ""The sedan is the third-oldest."" - This means there are two vehicles older than the sedan.

2. ""The tractor is newer than the motorcycle."" - This means the motorcycle is older than the tractor.

3. ""The bus is older than the motorcycle."" - This means the bus is older than both the motorcycle and the tractor.

4. ""The bus is newer than the hatchback."" - This means the hatchback is older than the bus.

5. ""The minivan is the newest."" - This means the minivan is the last in the order.

6. ""The station wagon is the oldest."" - This means the station wagon is the first in the order.

Now, let's arrange the vehicles based on these clues:

- The station wagon is the oldest, so it is first.
- The sedan is the third-oldest, so it is third.
- The hatchback is older than the bus, and the bus is older than the motorcycle, which is older than the tractor.
- The minivan is the newest, so it is last.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the vehicles:

1. Station wagon (oldest)
2. Hatchback (older than bus)
3. Sedan (third-oldest)
4. Bus (older than motorcycle)
5. Motorcycle (older than tractor)
6. Tractor
7. Minivan (newest)

This order satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the station wagon is indeed the oldest vehicle.

9,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: a brown book, a yellow book, a black book, a white book, a green book, an orange book, and a purple book. The purple book is the rightmost. The yellow book is the leftmost. The orange book is the second from the right. The brown book is to the left of the green book. The brown book is to the right of the black book. The white book is the fourth from the left.
Options:
(A) The brown book is the leftmost
(B) The yellow book is the leftmost
(C) The black book is the leftmost
(D) The white book is the leftmost
(E) The green book is the leftmost
(F) The orange book is the leftmost
(G) The purple book is the leftmost","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven books on the shelf according to the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. The purple book is the rightmost.
2. The yellow book is the leftmost.
3. The orange book is the second from the right.
4. The brown book is to the left of the green book.
5. The brown book is to the right of the black book.
6. The white book is the fourth from the left.

Let's start placing the books based on these conditions:

- From condition 2, we know the yellow book is the leftmost, so it is in position 1.
- From condition 1, the purple book is the rightmost, so it is in position 7.
- From condition 3, the orange book is second from the right, so it is in position 6.
- From condition 6, the white book is fourth from the left, so it is in position 4.

Now, we have the following positions filled:
1. Yellow
2. ?
3. ?
4. White
5. ?
6. Orange
7. Purple

Next, we use conditions 4 and 5 to place the remaining books (brown, black, and green):

- Condition 5 states that the brown book is to the right of the black book. This means the black book must be placed before the brown book.
- Condition 4 states that the brown book is to the left of the green book. This means the brown book must be placed before the green book.

Given the available positions (2, 3, and 5), we need to place black, brown, and green such that black is before brown, and brown is before green. The only way to satisfy these conditions is:

2. Black
3. Brown
5. Green

Now, the complete order of books is:
1. Yellow
2. Black
3. Brown
4. White
5. Green
6. Orange
7. Purple

The yellow book is indeed the leftmost book, which matches option (B).

1. O is before W.
2. W is before Y.
3. Y is before R.
4. R is before B.
5. B is before G.
6. G is before P.

Now, let's place them in order:

- Start with O (since O is before W).
- Then W (since W is before Y).
- Then Y (since Y is before R).
- Then R (since R is before B).
- Then B (since B is before G).
- Then G (since G is before P).
- Finally, P.

The order is: O, W, Y, R, B, G, P.

Now, let's determine which book is fourth from the left:

2. The tractor is the second-newest.
3. The truck is older than the sedan.
4. The minivan is older than the truck.
5. The hatchback is newer than the tractor.
6. The motorcycle is the fourth-newest.

Let's start by placing the vehicles based on the clues:

- **Clue 2**: The tractor is the second-newest. So, the order from the newest is: [?, Tractor, ?].
- **Clue 5**: The hatchback is newer than the tractor. Therefore, the hatchback must be the newest. So, the order is: [Hatchback, Tractor, ?].
- **Clue 6**: The motorcycle is the fourth-newest. So, the order is: [Hatchback, Tractor, ?, Motorcycle, ?].
- **Clue 1**: The minivan is newer than the limousine. This means the limousine cannot be the newest, second-newest, or third-newest. It must be older than the minivan.
- **Clue 4**: The minivan is older than the truck. This means the truck cannot be the third-newest. The minivan must be the third-newest. So, the order is: [Hatchback, Tractor, Minivan, Motorcycle, ?].
- **Clue 3**: The truck is older than the sedan. This means the truck must be the fifth-newest, and the sedan must be the sixth-newest. So, the order is: [Hatchback, Tractor, Minivan, Motorcycle, Truck, Sedan, ?].

(C) The hawk is the second from the left
(D) The falcon is the second from the left
(E) The hummingbird is the second from the left
(F) The robin is the second from the left
(G) The quail is the second from the left","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the seven birds in a specific order based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The owl is the second from the left.**
   - This means the owl is in position 2.

2. **The blue jay is the third from the right.**
   - Since there are seven birds, the blue jay is in position 5 (7 - 3 + 1 = 5).

3. **The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.**
   - This means the hummingbird is positioned somewhere before the falcon.

4. **The robin is to the left of the hummingbird.**
   - This means the robin is positioned somewhere before the hummingbird.

5. **The robin is to the right of the owl.**
   - Since the owl is in position 2, the robin must be in position 3 or 4.

6. **The quail is to the right of the falcon.**
   - This means the quail is positioned somewhere after the falcon.

Now, let's try to place the birds in order:

- Position 2: Owl (from clue 1)
- Position 5: Blue Jay (from clue 2)

Since the robin is to the right of the owl and to the left of the hummingbird, and the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon, we can deduce:

- Position 3: Robin (since it must be to the right of the owl and to the left of the hummingbird)
- Position 4: Hummingbird (since it must be to the left of the falcon)

Now, we have:

1. ___
2. Owl
3. Robin
4. Hummingbird
5. Blue Jay
6. ___
7. ___

The falcon must be to the right of the hummingbird and to the left of the quail. Therefore, the falcon can be in position 6, and the quail in position 7:

2. Eli
3. Ana
4. ?
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?

Now, let's use the other conditions to fill in the remaining positions:

- From condition 3, Mel finished above Eli. Since Eli is in 2nd place, Mel must be in 1st place. So now we have:

1. Mel
2. Eli
3. Ana
4. ?
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?

- From condition 4, Ada finished below Dan. This means Dan must be above Ada. We also know from condition 1 that Ada finished above Rob, and from condition 2 that Eve finished below Rob. 

- Since Mel, Eli, and Ana occupy the top three positions, Dan, Ada, Rob, and Eve must occupy the 4th to 7th positions. 

- Dan must be in 4th place because he is above Ada, and Ada cannot be in 3rd place or higher. So now we have:

1. Mel
2. Eli
3. Ana
4. Dan
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?

Now, let's place the birds based on these conditions:

- The falcon is in the 6th position.
- The crow is in the 7th position.
- The owl is in the 3rd position.

Since the falcon is in the 6th position and the crow is in the 7th position, the positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 are left for the cardinal, quail, hummingbird, and hawk.

- The quail must be to the right of the cardinal, so the cardinal cannot be in the 5th position.

5. Joe finished second-to-last.
6. Mya finished third.

Let's start by placing the golfers based on the information we have:

- Rob is 1st.
- Mya is 3rd.
- Eve is 7th (last).
- Joe is 6th (second-to-last).

Now, we need to place Dan, Ada, and Mel, keeping in mind the remaining conditions:

- Dan finished above Ada.
- Mel finished above Mya.

Since Mya is 3rd, Mel must be either 2nd or 4th. Let's consider both possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Mel is 2nd**

- Mel is 2nd.
- Mya is 3rd.
- Dan and Ada must be 4th and 5th, respectively, since Dan finished above Ada.

(D) The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive
(E) The kiwis are the second-most expensive
(F) The pears are the second-most expensive
(G) The peaches are the second-most expensive","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues.

1. **Pears are the second-cheapest.**
   - This means there is one fruit cheaper than pears, and five fruits more expensive.

2. **Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes.**
   - This means cantaloupes are cheaper than peaches.

3. **Peaches are less expensive than mangoes.**
   - This means mangoes are more expensive than peaches.

4. **Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis.**
   - This means kiwis are cheaper than cantaloupes.

5. **Oranges are the fourth-most expensive.**
   - This means there are three fruits more expensive than oranges and three fruits cheaper.

6. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**
   - This means there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.

Let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:

- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, we have:

  - Kiwis are the cheapest because they are less expensive than cantaloupes.
  - Cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis but less than peaches.
  - Peaches are less expensive than mangoes but more than cantaloupes.

Now, let's fill in the order:

1. Mangoes (most expensive, since they are more expensive than peaches and watermelons are second)
2. Watermelons
3. Peaches (since they are less expensive than mangoes and more than cantaloupes)
4. Oranges
5. Cantaloupes (since they are less expensive than peaches and more than kiwis)
6. Pears

211,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells seven fruits: oranges, plums, loquats, apples, kiwis, cantaloupes, and peaches. The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis. The plums are the cheapest. The loquats are the fourth-most expensive. The peaches are less expensive than the oranges. The peaches are more expensive than the kiwis. The apples are the second-cheapest.
Options:
(A) The oranges are the fourth-most expensive
(B) The plums are the fourth-most expensive
(C) The loquats are the fourth-most expensive
(D) The apples are the fourth-most expensive
(E) The kiwis are the fourth-most expensive
(F) The cantaloupes are the fourth-most expensive
(G) The peaches are the fourth-most expensive","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The plums are the cheapest.**
   - This means plums are in the 1st position.

2. **The apples are the second-cheapest.**
   - This means apples are in the 2nd position.

3. **The loquats are the fourth-most expensive.**
   - This means loquats are in the 4th position.

4. **The loquats are less expensive than the kiwis.**
   - Since loquats are 4th, kiwis must be more expensive than loquats, so kiwis cannot be in the 3rd position. They must be in the 5th, 6th, or 7th position.

5. **The peaches are less expensive than the oranges.**
   - This means peaches are cheaper than oranges.

6. **The peaches are more expensive than the kiwis.**
   - This means peaches are more expensive than kiwis.

Now, let's try to place the remaining fruits (kiwis, peaches, oranges, and cantaloupes) in the order:

- We know plums (1st) and apples (2nd) are the cheapest.
- Loquats are 4th.
- Kiwis must be cheaper than peaches, and peaches must be cheaper than oranges.
- Since loquats are 4th, the 3rd position must be filled by a fruit cheaper than loquats but more expensive than apples. The only fruit that can fit here is kiwis, as they are less expensive than peaches and more expensive than loquats.

So, the order so far is:
1. Plums
2. Apples
3. Kiwis
4. Loquats

Now, we need to place peaches, oranges, and cantaloupes in the 5th, 6th, and 7th positions:

- Peaches are less expensive than oranges, so peaches must be 5th.
- Oranges must be more expensive than peaches, so they must be 6th.
- Cantaloupes, being the only fruit left, must be the most expensive, in the 7th position.

The final order is:
1. Plums
2. Apples
3. Kiwis
4. Loquats
5. Peaches
6. Oranges
7. Cantaloupes

The loquats are indeed the fourth-most expensive, which matches option (C).

(E) The oranges are the second-cheapest
(F) The kiwis are the second-cheapest
(G) The loquats are the second-cheapest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. **Mangoes are the third-most expensive.**  
   This means there are two fruits more expensive than mangoes and four fruits less expensive.

2. **Plums are less expensive than mangoes.**  
   Since mangoes are third, plums must be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.

3. **Watermelons are less expensive than plums.**  
   This means watermelons must be placed after plums.

4. **Watermelons are more expensive than oranges.**  
   This means oranges must be placed before watermelons.

5. **Kiwis are less expensive than oranges.**  
   This means kiwis must be placed before oranges.

6. **Apples are more expensive than loquats.**  
   This means loquats must be placed before apples.

Now, let's try to place the fruits in order:

- Since mangoes are the third-most expensive, let's place them in the third position.
- Plums are less expensive than mangoes, so they cannot be first or second. They can be fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
- Watermelons are less expensive than plums, so they must be placed after plums.
- Watermelons are more expensive than oranges, so oranges must be placed before watermelons.
- Kiwis are less expensive than oranges, so kiwis must be placed before oranges.
- Apples are more expensive than loquats, so loquats must be placed before apples.

Let's try to fill in the positions:

1. **Kiwis** (since they are less expensive than oranges)
2. **Oranges** (since they are less expensive than watermelons)
3. **Mangoes** (given)
4. **Plums** (since they are less expensive than mangoes)
5. **Watermelons** (since they are more expensive than oranges and less expensive than plums)
6. **Loquats** (since they are less expensive than apples)
7. **Apples** (since they are more expensive than loquats)

Now, let's check the options for the second-cheapest fruit:

- (A) The apples are the second-cheapest: No, apples are the most expensive.
- (B) The plums are the second-cheapest: No, plums are fourth.
- (C) The mangoes are the second-cheapest: No, mangoes are third.
- (D) The watermelons are the second-cheapest: No, watermelons are fifth.
- (E) The oranges are the second-cheapest: Yes, oranges are second.
- (F) The kiwis are the second-cheapest: No, kiwis are first.
- (G) The loquats are the second-cheapest: No, loquats are sixth.

(F) The truck is the newest
(G) The hatchback is the newest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues.

1. **The truck is the oldest.**
   - This means the truck is in the first position.

2. **The bus is the second-oldest.**
   - This places the bus in the second position.

3. **The minivan is the third-newest.**
   - Since there are seven vehicles, the third-newest is the fifth position.

4. **The limousine is the fourth-newest.**
   - This places the limousine in the fourth position.

5. **The tractor is older than the minivan.**
   - The tractor must be in a position before the minivan, which is in the fifth position. So, the tractor can be in the third position.

6. **The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.**
   - This means the station wagon must be in a position after the hatchback.

Now, let's place the vehicles in order based on the above information:

- 1st: Truck (oldest)

6. **Watermelons are the second-most expensive.**
   - This means there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.

Let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:

- Since pears are the second-cheapest, the order starts with one fruit cheaper than pears. Let's denote this fruit as X.
- The order of the cheapest fruits is: X, Pears.

- Since oranges are the fourth-most expensive, there are three fruits cheaper than oranges. So, oranges are the fourth in the order.
- The order so far is: X, Pears, ?, Oranges.

- Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.
- The order of the most expensive fruits is: ?, Watermelons, ?.

- Peaches are more expensive than cantaloupes, and cantaloupes are more expensive than kiwis. This means the order of these three fruits is: Kiwis, Cantaloupes, Peaches.

- Peaches are less expensive than mangoes, so mangoes are more expensive than peaches.

Now, let's fill in the gaps:

1. **Cheapest:** Kiwis (since they are cheaper than cantaloupes)
2. **Second-cheapest:** Pears
3. **Third-cheapest:** Cantaloupes (since they are more expensive than kiwis but cheaper than peaches)
4. **Fourth-most expensive:** Oranges
5. **Third-most expensive:** Peaches (since they are more expensive than cantaloupes but less expensive than mangoes)
6. **Second-most expensive:** Watermelons

Now, let's place Amy and Eli based on the remaining information:

- Amy finished below Rob, so Amy cannot be in 1st place. The only remaining positions for Amy are 5th or 6th.
- Eli finished below Amy, so Eli must be in a position lower than Amy.

Since Dan is already in 7th place, the only positions left for Amy and Eli are 5th and 6th. Therefore, Amy must be in 5th place, and Eli must be in 6th place.

Now, the only position left is 1st place, which must be occupied by Joe.

The final order is:
1. Joe
2. Rob
3. Ada
4. Ana
5. Amy
6. Eli
7. Dan

Therefore, Ana finished fourth.

1. The cardinal is the second from the right.
   - This means the cardinal is in the 6th position.

2. The quail is the third from the right.
   - This means the quail is in the 5th position.

3. The crow is to the right of the cardinal.
   - Since the cardinal is in the 6th position, the crow must be in the 7th position.

4. The owl is the second from the left.
   - This means the owl is in the 2nd position.

5. The hummingbird is to the left of the falcon.
   - This means the hummingbird must be positioned somewhere to the left of the falcon.

6. The falcon is to the left of the robin.
   - This means the falcon must be positioned somewhere to the left of the robin.

Now, let's try to place the remaining birds (hummingbird, falcon, and robin) in the available positions (1st, 3rd, and 4th):

- The owl is already in the 2nd position.
- The cardinal is in the 6th position.
- The quail is in the 5th position.
- The crow is in the 7th position.

Given that the hummingbird is to the left of the falcon, and the falcon is to the left of the robin, the only way to arrange them in the remaining positions (1st, 3rd, and 4th) is:

42,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells seven fruits: mangoes, kiwis, oranges, watermelons, apples, pears, and loquats. The loquats are less expensive than the oranges. The oranges are the third-most expensive. The apples are the cheapest. The kiwis are more expensive than the pears. The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.

(B) The kiwis are the cheapest
(C) The oranges are the cheapest
(D) The watermelons are the cheapest
(E) The apples are the cheapest
(F) The pears are the cheapest
(G) The loquats are the cheapest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. ""The loquats are less expensive than the oranges.""  
   - This means loquats are cheaper than oranges.

2. ""The oranges are the third-most expensive.""  
   - This means there are two fruits more expensive than oranges, and four fruits less expensive.

3. ""The apples are the cheapest.""  
   - Apples are the least expensive of all the fruits.

4. ""The kiwis are more expensive than the pears.""  
   - Kiwis have a higher price than pears.

5. ""The mangoes are more expensive than the watermelons.""  
   - Mangoes cost more than watermelons.

6. ""The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis.""  
   - Loquats have a higher price than kiwis.

Now, let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:

- Since apples are the cheapest, they are in the 7th position.
- Oranges are the third-most expensive, so they are in the 3rd position.
- Loquats are less expensive than oranges but more expensive than kiwis, so loquats cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position. They must be in the 4th position.
- Kiwis are more expensive than pears, and loquats are more expensive than kiwis. Therefore, kiwis must be in the 5th position, and pears in the 6th position.
- Mangoes are more expensive than watermelons, and since oranges are in the 3rd position, mangoes must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Since loquats are in the 4th position, mangoes must be in the 1st position, and watermelons in the 2nd position.

The order from most expensive to least expensive is:
1. Mangoes
2. Watermelons
3. Oranges
4. Loquats
5. Kiwis

5. **The white book is the second from the right.**
6. **The gray book is the third from the left.**
7. **The brown book is to the right of the green book.**

Let's start by placing the books that have fixed positions:

- From condition 5, the white book is the second from the right.
- From condition 3, the black book is the third from the right.

This gives us the following partial order from the right:
\[ \_\_ \_\_ \text{Black} \text{White} \]

Now, let's use condition 6:
- The gray book is the third from the left.

This gives us:
\[ \_\_ \text{Gray} \_\_ \_\_ \text{Black} \text{White} \]

Next, let's use condition 1:
- The gray book is to the left of the purple book.

This means the purple book cannot be in the first position, so it must be in the fourth position:
\[ \_\_ \text{Gray} \_\_ \text{Purple} \text{Black} \text{White} \]

Now, let's use condition 4:
- The purple book is to the left of the white book.

This condition is already satisfied with the current arrangement.

Next, let's use condition 2:
- The white book is to the right of the brown book.

The brown book must be in one of the first three positions. Since the gray book is already in the second position, the brown book must be in the first position:
\[ \text{Brown} \text{Gray} \_\_ \text{Purple} \text{Black} \text{White} \]

Finally, let's use condition 7:
- The brown book is to the right of the green book.

The green book must be in the first position, so the brown book must be in the third position:
\[ \text{Green} \text{Gray} \text{Brown} \text{Purple} \text{Black} \text{White} \]

Now, we have one position left, which is the first position, and it must be occupied by the red book:
\[ \text{Red} \text{Green} \text{Gray} \text{Brown} \text{Purple} \text{Black} \text{White} \]

Now, let's verify the conditions:

Now, let's use these conditions to determine the order:

- Since the sedan is the oldest, it is in the first position.
- The convertible is the second-newest, so it is in the sixth position.
- The truck is the fourth-newest, so it is in the fourth position.
- The station wagon is newer than the truck, so it must be in the fifth position.
- The station wagon is older than the tractor, so the tractor must be in the seventh position.
- The bus is newer than the hatchback, so the bus must be in the third position, and the hatchback in the second position.

Putting this all together, the order from oldest to newest is:
1. Sedan
2. Hatchback
3. Bus
4. Truck
5. Station Wagon
6. Convertible
7. Tractor

Now, we need to determine which vehicle is the second-oldest. According to our order, the second-oldest vehicle is the hatchback.

28,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a limousine, a convertible, a station wagon, a minivan, a bus, a tractor, and a truck. The minivan is the oldest. The truck is older than the station wagon. The truck is newer than the limousine. The bus is newer than the convertible. The bus is older than the tractor. The limousine is newer than the tractor.
Options:
(A) The limousine is the second-oldest
(B) The convertible is the second-oldest
(C) The station wagon is the second-oldest
(D) The minivan is the second-oldest
(E) The bus is the second-oldest
(F) The tractor is the second-oldest
(G) The truck is the second-oldest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given statements. Let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. ""The minivan is the oldest.""  
   - This means the minivan is in the first position.

2. ""The truck is older than the station wagon.""  
   - This means the truck comes before the station wagon.

3. ""The truck is newer than the limousine.""  
   - This means the limousine comes before the truck.

4. ""The bus is newer than the convertible.""  
   - This means the convertible comes before the bus.

5. ""The bus is older than the tractor.""  
   - This means the bus comes before the tractor.

6. ""The limousine is newer than the tractor.""  
   - This means the tractor comes before the limousine.

Now, let's try to arrange these vehicles in order from oldest to newest:

- We know the minivan is the oldest, so it is first.
- The tractor must be older than the limousine (from statement 6), so the tractor comes before the limousine.
- The limousine is older than the truck (from statement 3), so the order is tractor, limousine, truck.
- The truck is older than the station wagon (from statement 2), so the order is tractor, limousine, truck, station wagon.
- The convertible is older than the bus (from statement 4), so the order is convertible, bus.
- The bus is older than the tractor (from statement 5), so the order is bus, tractor.

Combining all these, we get the order:
1. Minivan
2. Convertible
3. Bus
4. Tractor
5. Limousine
6. Truck
7. Station Wagon

From this order, the second-oldest vehicle is the convertible.

Mel finished third. Rob finished fourth.
Options:
(A) Eli finished last
(B) Eve finished last
(C) Mel finished last
(D) Joe finished last
(E) Mya finished last
(F) Rob finished last
(G) Ada finished last","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. Ada finished above Mya.
2. Eli finished below Joe.
3. Eli finished above Eve.
4. Ada finished second-to-last.
5. Mel finished third.
6. Rob finished fourth.

From condition 4, we know Ada finished second-to-last, which means she finished in 6th place. Since Ada is 6th, Mya must be 7th because Ada finished above Mya (condition 1).

Now, we have:
- Ada: 6th
- Mya: 7th

From condition 5, Mel finished 3rd.

From condition 6, Rob finished 4th.

Now, we have:
- Mel: 3rd
- Rob: 4th
- Ada: 6th
- Mya: 7th

We still need to place Eli, Joe, and Eve in the remaining positions: 1st, 2nd, and 5th.

From condition 2, Eli finished below Joe, so Joe cannot be 5th. Joe must be either 1st or 2nd.

From condition 3, Eli finished above Eve, so Eve cannot be 5th. Eve must be 5th.

Now, we have:
- Joe: 1st or 2nd
- Eli: 1st or 2nd
- Eve: 5th
- Mel: 3rd
- Rob: 4th
- Ada: 6th
- Mya: 7th

Since Joe must be above Eli (condition 2), Joe must be 1st and Eli must be 2nd.

The final order is:
1. Joe
2. Eli
3. Mel
4. Rob
5. Eve
6. Ada
7. Mya

Therefore, Mya finished last.

   - Since the gray book is in position 3, the orange book must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.

5. **The orange book is to the left of the green book.**
   - This means the green book is to the right of the orange book.

6. **The blue book is the third from the right.**
   - This means the blue book is in position 5.

Now, let's use these conditions to determine the positions of all the books:

- We know the brown book is in position 7.
- The gray book is in position 3.
- The blue book is in position 5.

Let's place the orange and green books:
- The orange book must be to the right of the gray book (position 3) and to the left of the green book.
- The blue book is in position 5, so the orange book cannot be in position 5.
- The orange book can be in position 4, and the green book can be in position 6.

Now, let's place the black and white books:

(D) The owl is the third from the right
(E) The crow is the third from the right
(F) The robin is the third from the right
(G) The cardinal is the third from the right","To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the seven birds on the branch based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The cardinal is the second from the right.**
   - This means the cardinal is in the 6th position.

2. **The hawk is the rightmost.**
   - This means the hawk is in the 7th position.

3. **The owl is to the left of the hummingbird.**
   - This means the owl is positioned somewhere to the left of the hummingbird.

4. **The robin is to the left of the quail.**
   - This means the robin is positioned somewhere to the left of the quail.

5. **The owl is to the right of the crow.**
   - This means the owl is positioned somewhere to the right of the crow.

6. **The robin is the fourth from the left.**
   - This means the robin is in the 4th position.

Now, let's use these clues to determine the positions of all the birds:

- We know the cardinal is in the 6th position and the hawk is in the 7th position.
- The robin is in the 4th position.

Let's place the known positions:
1. ___
2. ___
3. ___
4. Robin
5. ___
6. Cardinal
7. Hawk

Now, let's use the remaining clues:

- The owl is to the left of the hummingbird and to the right of the crow. This means the crow must be to the left of the owl, and the owl must be to the left of the hummingbird.
- The robin is to the left of the quail, so the quail must be in a position to the right of the robin.

Let's try to place the remaining birds:

- Since the robin is in the 4th position, the quail must be in the 5th position (as the 6th and 7th are already occupied by the cardinal and hawk, respectively).

1. ___
2. ___
3. ___
4. Robin
5. Quail
6. Cardinal
7. Hawk

- The owl must be to the right of the crow and to the left of the hummingbird. The only positions left are 1, 2, and 3. Since the owl must be to the right of the crow, let's place the crow in position 1 and the owl in position 3. This leaves position 2 for the hummingbird.

1. Crow
2. Hummingbird
3. Owl
4. Robin
5. Quail
6. Cardinal
7. Hawk

Now, let's verify the positions:
- The cardinal is second from the right (position 6).
- The hawk is the rightmost (position 7).
- The owl is to the left of the hummingbird (owl in position 3, hummingbird in position 2).
- The robin is to the left of the quail (robin in position 4, quail in position 5).
- The owl is to the right of the crow (owl in position 3, crow in position 1).
- The robin is the fourth from the left (position 4).

Everything checks out. Now, we need to determine which bird is the third from the right. The third from the right is position 5, which is occupied by the quail.

5,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eli, Eve, Mel, Joe, Mya, Rob, and Ada. Ada finished above Mya. Eli finished below Joe. Eli finished above Eve. Ada finished second-to-last. Mel finished third. Rob finished fourth.
Options:
(A) Eli finished third-to-last
(B) Eve finished third-to-last
(C) Mel finished third-to-last
(D) Joe finished third-to-last
(E) Mya finished third-to-last
(F) Rob finished third-to-last
(G) Ada finished third-to-last","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. Ada finished above Mya.
2. Eli finished below Joe.
3. Eli finished above Eve.
4. Ada finished second-to-last.
5. Mel finished third.
6. Rob finished fourth.

Let's start by placing the golfers based on the information we have:

- Ada finished second-to-last, so she is in 6th place.
- Mel finished third, so he is in 3rd place.
- Rob finished fourth, so he is in 4th place.

Now, let's consider the remaining golfers: Eli, Eve, Joe, and Mya.

Since Ada is in 6th place and finished above Mya, Mya must be in 7th place.

Now we have:
1. ?
2. ?
3. Mel
4. Rob
5. ?
6. Ada
7. Mya

Next, Eli finished below Joe, so Joe must be above Eli. Also, Eli finished above Eve, so Eve must be below Eli.

This means Joe must be in 1st or 2nd place, and Eli must be in 2nd or 5th place. Eve must be in 5th place if Eli is in 2nd place, or in 1st place if Eli is in 5th place.

Let's try placing Joe in 1st place:
1. Joe
2. Eli
3. Mel
4. Rob
5. Eve
6. Ada
7. Mya

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:
- Ada is above Mya.
- Eli is below Joe.
- Eli is above Eve.
- Ada is second-to-last.
- Mel is third.
- Rob is fourth.

Now, we need to determine who finished third-to-last, which is the 5th position. In this arrangement, Eve is in 5th place.

Therefore, the answer is that Eve finished third-to-last.

155,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a limousine, a minivan, a bus, a station wagon, a tractor, a truck, and a hatchback. The truck is the oldest. The tractor is older than the minivan. The minivan is the third-newest. The limousine is the fourth-newest. The station wagon is newer than the hatchback. The bus is the second-oldest.
Options:
(A) The limousine is the third-oldest
(B) The minivan is the third-oldest
(C) The bus is the third-oldest
(D) The station wagon is the third-oldest
(E) The tractor is the third-oldest
(F) The truck is the third-oldest
(G) The hatchback is the third-oldest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest based on the given clues.

1. **The truck is the oldest.**
   - This means the truck is in the first position.

2. **The bus is the second-oldest.**
   - This means the bus is in the second position.

3. **The minivan is the third-newest.**
   - Since there are seven vehicles, the third-newest is the fifth position.

4. **The limousine is the fourth-newest.**
   - The fourth-newest is the fourth position.

5. **The tractor is older than the minivan.**
   - Since the minivan is in the fifth position, the tractor must be in one of the first four positions.

6. **The station wagon is newer than the hatchback.**
   - This means the station wagon must be in a position after the hatchback.

Now, let's arrange the vehicles based on these clues:

- **1st position (oldest):** Truck
- **2nd position:** Bus
- **3rd position:** This is the position we need to determine.
- **4th position (fourth-newest):** Limousine
- **5th position (third-newest):** Minivan
- **6th position:** This position must be occupied by either the station wagon or the hatchback.
- **7th position (newest):** This position must be occupied by either the station wagon or the hatchback.

Since the tractor is older than the minivan and must be in one of the first four positions, and the limousine is already in the fourth position, the tractor must be in the third position.

- **3rd position:** Tractor

Now, we have:

1. Truck
2. Bus
3. Tractor
4. Limousine
5. Minivan
6. Hatchback
7. Station Wagon

The hatchback is in the sixth position, and the station wagon is in the seventh position, which satisfies the condition that the station wagon is newer than the hatchback.

Therefore, the vehicle in the third-oldest position is the tractor.

Mel finished above Ada.
Options:
(A) Mel finished second
(B) Rob finished second
(C) Eli finished second
(D) Dan finished second
(E) Ana finished second
(F) Ada finished second
(G) Mya finished second","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. Ana finished last.  
   - This means Ana is in 7th place.

2. Mya finished above Rob.  
   - Since Rob finished 4th, Mya must be in 3rd, 2nd, or 1st place.

3. Dan finished above Mya.  
   - This means Dan must be in a position higher than Mya.

4. Rob finished fourth.  
   - Rob is in 4th place.

5. Eli finished second.  
   - Eli is in 2nd place.

6. Mel finished above Ada.  
   - Mel must be in a position higher than Ada.

Now, let's use these clues to determine the order:

- We know Eli is 2nd and Rob is 4th.
- Ana is 7th.
- Mya must be above Rob, so Mya is either 1st or 3rd.
- Dan must be above Mya, so if Mya is 3rd, Dan must be 1st. If Mya is 1st, Dan could be 3rd.
- Mel must be above Ada, so Mel cannot be 6th if Ada is 5th.

Let's try to place them:

- Eli is 2nd.
- Rob is 4th.
- Ana is 7th.

If Mya is 3rd, then Dan must be 1st. This leaves 5th and 6th for Mel and Ada, with Mel above Ada. So, Mel is 5th and Ada is 6th.

Let's check this arrangement:

1. Dan
2. Eli
3. Mya
4. Rob
5. Mel
6. Ada
7. Ana

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:

- Ana is last.
- Mya is above Rob.
- Dan is above Mya.
- Rob is 4th.
- Eli is 2nd.
- Mel is above Ada.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Eli finished second.

(C) The mangoes are the cheapest
(D) The oranges are the cheapest
(E) The watermelons are the cheapest
(F) The peaches are the cheapest
(G) The cantaloupes are the cheapest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues.

1. **Identify the fixed positions:**
   - Apples are the third-cheapest.
   - Watermelons are the second-most expensive.
   - Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.

2. **Translate the clues into inequalities:**
   - Pears are more expensive than oranges: Pears > Oranges
   - Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes: Oranges > Cantaloupes
   - Peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes: Peaches < Cantaloupes

3. **Determine the order:**
   - Since apples are the third-cheapest, there are two fruits cheaper than apples.
   - Since watermelons are the second-most expensive, there is one fruit more expensive than watermelons.
   - Since mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, there are three fruits more expensive than mangoes.

4. **Arrange the fruits:**
   - The cheapest fruit must be one of the two fruits cheaper than apples.
   - The most expensive fruit must be more expensive than watermelons.
   - The order of the fruits from cheapest to most expensive must satisfy all the given conditions.

5. **Start placing the fruits:**
   - Since peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes, peaches cannot be the cheapest if cantaloupes are not the cheapest.
   - Since oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes, cantaloupes cannot be the most expensive.
   - The only fruit that can be the cheapest, given the constraints, is peaches.

6. **Verify the order:**
   - Peaches < Cantaloupes < Apples < Mangoes < Oranges < Watermelons < Pears

This order satisfies all the conditions:
- Apples are the third-cheapest.
- Watermelons are the second-most expensive.
- Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.
- Pears are more expensive than oranges.
- Oranges are more expensive than cantaloupes.

- 1st: ?
- 2nd: ?
- 3rd: Oranges
- 4th: ?
- 5th: ?
- 6th: ?
- 7th: Apples (cheapest)

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the gaps:

- From clue 1, loquats are less expensive than oranges, so they must be in positions 4, 5, or 6.
- From clue 6, loquats are more expensive than kiwis, so kiwis must be in positions 5 or 6.
- From clue 4, kiwis are more expensive than pears, so pears must be in position 6 or 7. Since apples are the cheapest, pears must be in position 6.
- This means kiwis are in position 5, and loquats are in position 4.

Now, the order looks like this:

- 1st: ?
- 2nd: ?
- 3rd: Oranges
- 4th: Loquats
- 5th: Kiwis
- 6th: Pears

A fruit stand sells seven fruits: apples, plums, mangoes, watermelons, oranges, kiwis, and loquats. The watermelons are less expensive than the plums. The watermelons are more expensive than the oranges. The kiwis are less expensive than the oranges. The apples are more expensive than the loquats. The plums are less expensive than the mangoes. The mangoes are the third-most expensive.
Options:
(A) The apples are the most expensive
(B) The plums are the most expensive
(C) The mangoes are the most expensive
(D) The watermelons are the most expensive
(E) The oranges are the most expensive
(F) The kiwis are the most expensive
(G) The loquats are the most expensive","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices using the given clues. Let's analyze each statement:

1. ""The watermelons are less expensive than the plums.""
   - This means: Watermelons < Plums

2. ""The watermelons are more expensive than the oranges.""
   - This means: Oranges < Watermelons

3. ""The kiwis are less expensive than the oranges.""
   - This means: Kiwis < Oranges

4. ""The apples are more expensive than the loquats.""
   - This means: Loquats < Apples

5. ""The plums are less expensive than the mangoes.""
   - This means: Plums < Mangoes

6. ""The mangoes are the third-most expensive.""
   - This means: Mangoes are in the third position when ordered from most to least expensive.

Now, let's use these clues to arrange the fruits:

- From clue 6, we know Mangoes are third.
- From clues 1 and 5, we know Watermelons < Plums < Mangoes.
- From clue 2, we know Oranges < Watermelons.
- From clue 3, we know Kiwis < Oranges.
- From clue 4, we know Loquats < Apples.

Let's start placing the fruits in order:

1. **Most Expensive**: We don't have direct information yet, but we know Apples are more expensive than Loquats.
2. **Second Most Expensive**: We don't have direct information yet.
3. **Mangoes**: As per clue 6.
4. **Plums**: Since Plums < Mangoes.
5. **Watermelons**: Since Watermelons < Plums.
6. **Oranges**: Since Oranges < Watermelons.
7. **Kiwis**: Since Kiwis < Oranges.

Now, we need to place Apples and Loquats. Since Apples are more expensive than Loquats, and we have two open spots (1st and 2nd), Apples must be the most expensive, and Loquats must be the second most expensive.

Thus, the order from most to least expensive is:
1. Apples
2. Loquats
3. Mangoes
4. Plums
5. Watermelons
6. Oranges
7. Kiwis

Therefore, the apples are the most expensive.

92,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: a brown book, a white book, a black book, a yellow book, an orange book, a blue book, and a green book. The yellow book is the rightmost. The blue book is to the left of the orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The blue book is to the right of the green book. The black book is the fourth from the left. The brown book is the third from the right.
Options:
(A) The brown book is the rightmost
(B) The white book is the rightmost
(C) The black book is the rightmost
(D) The yellow book is the rightmost
(E) The orange book is the rightmost
(F) The blue book is the rightmost
(G) The green book is the rightmost","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven books on the shelf based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. **The yellow book is the rightmost.**
   - This means the yellow book is in the 7th position.

2. **The blue book is to the left of the orange book.**
   - This means the blue book is somewhere to the left of the orange book.

3. **The green book is to the right of the white book.**
   - This means the green book is somewhere to the right of the white book.

4. **The blue book is to the right of the green book.**
   - This means the blue book is somewhere to the right of the green book.

5. **The black book is the fourth from the left.**
   - This means the black book is in the 4th position.

6. **The brown book is the third from the right.**
   - This means the brown book is in the 5th position.

Now, let's use these conditions to determine the order:

- Since the yellow book is the rightmost, it is in position 7.
- The black book is in position 4.
- The brown book is in position 5.
- The blue book must be to the left of the orange book, and the blue book is to the right of the green book. Therefore, the order of these three books must be: green, blue, orange.
- The green book is to the right of the white book.

Let's place the books in order:

1. The black book is in position 4.
2. The brown book is in position 5.
3. The yellow book is in position 7.

Now, we need to place the white, green, blue, and orange books in positions 1, 2, 3, and 6:

- The green book must be to the right of the white book, so white must be in position 1 or 2.
- The blue book is to the right of the green book, so the order must be white, green, blue, orange.
- The only way to fit this order is:
  - White in position 1
  - Green in position 2
  - Blue in position 3
  - Orange in position 6

Thus, the final order is:
1. White
2. Green
3. Blue
4. Black
5. Brown
6. Orange
7. Yellow

The yellow book is indeed the rightmost book.

161,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were seven golfers: Eve, Mya, Rob, Ana, Ada, Mel, and Joe. Eve finished third. Mya finished above Joe. Mel finished above Ada. Mya finished above Rob. Mel finished below Joe. Mya finished second. Ada finished second-to-last.
Options:
(A) Eve finished third
(B) Mya finished third
(C) Rob finished third
(D) Ana finished third
(E) Ada finished third
(F) Mel finished third
(G) Joe finished third","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. Eve finished third.
2. Mya finished above Joe.
3. Mel finished above Ada.
4. Mya finished above Rob.
5. Mel finished below Joe.
6. Mya finished second.
7. Ada finished second-to-last.

Let's start by placing the golfers based on the information we have:

- Mya finished second (Condition 6).
- Eve finished third (Condition 1).
- Ada finished second-to-last, which is sixth (Condition 7).

Now, let's use the remaining conditions to place the other golfers:

- Mya finished above Joe (Condition 2), so Joe cannot be second. Since Mya is second, Joe must be fourth or fifth.
- Mel finished above Ada (Condition 3), and Ada is sixth, so Mel must be fourth or fifth.
- Mya finished above Rob (Condition 4), so Rob cannot be second. Since Mya is second, Rob must be fourth, fifth, or seventh.
- Mel finished below Joe (Condition 5), so Joe must be above Mel. Therefore, Joe is fourth and Mel is fifth.

Now we have the following order:

1. Ana
2. Mya
3. Eve
4. Joe
5. Mel
6. Ada
7. Rob

Ana is the only golfer left who could be in first place, as all other positions are filled.

Therefore, the order is:
1. Ana
2. Mya
3. Eve
4. Joe
5. Mel
6. Ada
7. Rob

Eve finished third, which matches option (A).

(D) The plums are the third-cheapest
(E) The loquats are the third-cheapest
(F) The watermelons are the third-cheapest
(G) The peaches are the third-cheapest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues.

1. **Loquats are the second-cheapest.**  
   This means the order starts with one fruit cheaper than loquats, followed by loquats.

2. **Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive.**  
   This means there are three fruits cheaper than mangoes.

3. **Plums are more expensive than mangoes.**  
   This means plums are either the fifth, sixth, or seventh in terms of expense.

4. **Plums are less expensive than peaches.**  
   This means peaches are more expensive than plums.

5. **Peaches are less expensive than cantaloupes.**  
   This means cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches.

6. **Watermelons are more expensive than loquats.**  
   This means watermelons are not the cheapest and are more expensive than loquats.

Now, let's arrange the fruits based on these clues:

- Since loquats are the second-cheapest, the order starts with one fruit cheaper than loquats.
- Mangoes are the fourth-most expensive, so there are three fruits cheaper than mangoes.
- Watermelons are more expensive than loquats, so they cannot be the cheapest.
- Plums are more expensive than mangoes, so they are not among the three cheapest.
- Peaches are more expensive than plums, and cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches.

Let's try to fill in the order:

1. **Cheapest:** Apples (since they are not mentioned in any of the constraints, they can be the cheapest)
2. **Second-cheapest:** Loquats
3. **Third-cheapest:** Watermelons (since they are more expensive than loquats but cheaper than mangoes)
4. **Fourth-most expensive:** Mangoes
5. **Fifth-most expensive:** Plums (since they are more expensive than mangoes but less expensive than peaches)
6. **Sixth-most expensive:** Peaches (since they are more expensive than plums but less expensive than cantaloupes)
7. **Most expensive:** Cantaloupes

Thus, the third-cheapest fruit is watermelons.

Now, let's use these conditions to determine the positions of all the books:

- We know the yellow book is in position 7.
- The brown book is in position 5.
- The black book is in position 4.

This leaves positions 1, 2, 3, and 6 for the white, green, blue, and orange books.

- The blue book must be to the left of the orange book, so the blue book cannot be in position 6.
- The green book must be to the right of the white book, so the green book cannot be in position 1.
- The blue book must be to the right of the green book, so the blue book cannot be in position 1 or 2.

Let's try to place the remaining books:

- If the white book is in position 1, then the green book can be in position 2, the blue book in position 3, and the orange book in position 6. This satisfies all conditions:
  - White (1), Green (2), Blue (3), Black (4), Brown (5), Orange (6), Yellow (7).

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the book that is fourth from the left is the black book.

1. **Amy finished last.**
   - This means Amy is in the 7th position.

2. **Ana finished third-to-last.**
   - This means Ana is in the 5th position.

3. **Eve finished third.**
   - This means Eve is in the 3rd position.

4. **Ada finished above Mel.**
   - This means Ada's position is numerically less than Mel's position.

5. **Dan finished above Ada.**
   - This means Dan's position is numerically less than Ada's position.

6. **Dan finished below Eli.**
   - This means Dan's position is numerically greater than Eli's position.

Now, let's try to place the golfers in order:

- We know Amy is 7th and Ana is 5th.
- Eve is 3rd.
- Dan is above Ada, and Ada is above Mel.
- Dan is below Eli.

Let's start filling in the positions:

1. **Eli**: Since Dan is below Eli, Eli cannot be 3rd (Eve is there), 5th (Ana is there), or 7th (Amy is there). Eli could be 1st, 2nd, or 4th.

2. **Dan**: Dan is below Eli, so Dan cannot be 1st if Eli is 2nd. Dan could be 2nd, 4th, or 6th.

3. **Ada and Mel**: Ada is above Mel. They cannot be 3rd (Eve), 5th (Ana), or 7th (Amy). Possible positions for Ada and Mel are 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th.

Let's try to place Eli, Dan, Ada, and Mel:

- If Eli is 1st, Dan can be 2nd or 4th.
- If Eli is 2nd, Dan can be 4th or 6th.
- If Eli is 4th, Dan can only be 6th.

Let's try Eli as 1st:

- Eli = 1st
- Dan = 2nd (since Dan is above Ada and below Eli)
- Eve = 3rd
- Ana = 5th
- Amy = 7th

Now, Ada and Mel:

- Ada must be above Mel, so Ada = 4th, Mel = 6th.

This gives us the order:

1. Eli
2. Dan
3. Eve
4. Ada
5. Ana
6. Mel
7. Amy

Now, we need to find who finished second-to-last, which is the 6th position. In this order, Mel is in the 6th position.

(G) Joe finished last","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions step by step:

1. Ana finished first.
2. Eli finished third.
3. Mya finished fourth.
4. Amy finished second-to-last, which means she finished sixth.
5. Amy finished below Joe, so Joe must be above sixth place.
6. Dan finished above Mya, so Dan must be in one of the top three positions.
7. We need to determine who finished last.

Let's start placing the golfers based on the information:

- Ana is 1st.
- Eli is 3rd.
- Mya is 4th.
- Amy is 6th.

Now, we need to place Dan, Joe, and Mel in the remaining positions: 2nd, 5th, and 7th.

Since Dan finished above Mya, Dan must be 2nd.

This leaves positions 5th and 7th for Joe and Mel. Since Amy finished below Joe, Joe cannot be 7th. Therefore, Joe must be 5th.

This leaves Mel as the only golfer who can be 7th.

The final order is:
1. Ana
2. Dan
3. Eli
4. Mya
5. Joe
6. Amy
7. Mel

Therefore, Mel finished last.

(D) The kiwis are the most expensive
(E) The oranges are the most expensive
(F) The cantaloupes are the most expensive
(G) The plums are the most expensive","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits based on their prices, using the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The watermelons are the cheapest.**
   - This means watermelons are in position 1.

2. **The kiwis are the third-cheapest.**
   - This means kiwis are in position 3.

3. **The cantaloupes are the second-most expensive.**
   - This means cantaloupes are in position 6.

4. **The oranges are more expensive than the cantaloupes.**
   - Since cantaloupes are in position 6, oranges must be in position 7.

5. **The peaches are more expensive than the mangoes.**
   - This means peaches are in a higher position than mangoes.

6. **The peaches are less expensive than the plums.**
   - This means peaches are in a lower position than plums.

Now, let's arrange the fruits based on the information we have:

- Position 1: Watermelons
- Position 2: (unknown)
- Position 3: Kiwis
- Position 4: (unknown)
- Position 5: (unknown)
- Position 6: Cantaloupes
- Position 7: Oranges

From clues 5 and 6, we know that mangoes, peaches, and plums must occupy positions 2, 4, and 5. Since peaches are more expensive than mangoes and less expensive than plums, the order must be:

- Position 2: Mangoes
- Position 4: Peaches
- Position 5: Plums

Now, the complete order is:

1. Watermelons
2. Mangoes
3. Kiwis
4. Peaches

- Second-newest: Minivan
- Third-newest: Sedan

Since the hatchback is newer than the truck, and the hatchback is older than the limousine, we can infer:
- The limousine is newer than the hatchback.
- The hatchback is newer than the truck.

Given that the motorcycle is older than the tractor and the truck is newer than the tractor, we can infer:
- The motorcycle is older than the truck.
- The truck is newer than the tractor.

Now, let's try to arrange the vehicles from oldest to newest:

1. **Oldest: Tractor** (since the motorcycle and truck are both newer than the tractor)
2. **Second-oldest: Motorcycle** (since it is older than the truck)
3. **Third-oldest: Truck** (since it is newer than the tractor and older than the hatchback)

- The gray book is the third from the right, which means it is in position 5.
- The orange book is the second from the left, so it is in position 2.
- The black book is the third from the left, so it is in position 3.

Now, let's place the remaining books:

- The green book must be to the left of the gray book. The available positions to the left of the gray book (position 5) are positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since positions 2 and 3 are already occupied by the orange and black books, the green book must be in position 1 or 4. However, since the black book is in position 3, the green book must be in position 1 to satisfy the condition of being to the left of the gray book.
- The yellow book must be to the left of the black book, so it must be in position 2 or 1. Since the orange book is in position 2, the yellow book must be in position 4.
- The only remaining position is 6, which must be occupied by the purple book.

Now, let's verify the arrangement:

1. Green book
2. Orange book
3. Black book
4. Yellow book
5. Gray book
6. Purple book
7. White book

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the black book is indeed the third from the left.

174,"The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells seven fruits: kiwis, cantaloupes, oranges, loquats, pears, watermelons, and peaches. The loquats are less expensive than the peaches. The pears are the third-cheapest. The oranges are less expensive than the cantaloupes. The loquats are more expensive than the watermelons. The peaches are less expensive than the oranges. The kiwis are the second-most expensive.
Options:
(A) The kiwis are the cheapest
(B) The cantaloupes are the cheapest
(C) The oranges are the cheapest
(D) The loquats are the cheapest
(E) The pears are the cheapest
(F) The watermelons are the cheapest
(G) The peaches are the cheapest","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the fruits from cheapest to most expensive based on the given conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:

1. **The loquats are less expensive than the peaches.**
   - This means loquats < peaches.

2. **The pears are the third-cheapest.**
   - This means there are two fruits cheaper than pears.

3. **The oranges are less expensive than the cantaloupes.**
   - This means oranges < cantaloupes.

4. **The loquats are more expensive than the watermelons.**
   - This means watermelons < loquats.

5. **The peaches are less expensive than the oranges.**
   - This means peaches < oranges.

6. **The kiwis are the second-most expensive.**
   - This means kiwis are the sixth in order of expense.

Now, let's try to arrange the fruits based on these conditions:

- Since the kiwis are the second-most expensive, they are in the sixth position.
- The pears are the third-cheapest, so they are in the third position.
- The loquats are less expensive than the peaches, and the peaches are less expensive than the oranges. Therefore, the order among these three is: loquats < peaches < oranges.
- The loquats are more expensive than the watermelons, so watermelons are cheaper than loquats.
- The oranges are less expensive than the cantaloupes, so oranges < cantaloupes.

Given these conditions, let's try to fill in the positions:

1. **Cheapest:** Watermelons (since they are cheaper than loquats and we need a fruit cheaper than pears)
2. **Second cheapest:** Loquats (since they are cheaper than peaches and more expensive than watermelons)
3. **Third cheapest:** Pears (as given)
4. **Fourth cheapest:** Peaches (since they are cheaper than oranges)
5. **Fifth cheapest:** Oranges (since they are cheaper than cantaloupes)
6. **Sixth cheapest:** Kiwis (as given, second-most expensive)
7. **Most expensive:** Cantaloupes (since they are more expensive than oranges)

Thus, the order from cheapest to most expensive is:
1. Watermelons
2. Loquats
3. Pears
4. Peaches
5. Oranges
6. Kiwis
7. Cantaloupes

From this order, the cheapest fruit is the watermelons.

(D) Amy finished second-to-last
(E) Dan finished second-to-last
(F) Joe finished second-to-last
(G) Eli finished second-to-last","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order in which the golfers finished based on the given conditions. Let's go through the conditions one by one:

1. Eli finished below Amy.
2. Ada finished third.
3. Amy finished below Rob.
4. Dan finished last.
5. Rob finished second.
6. Ana finished fourth.

Let's start by placing the golfers based on the information we have:

- Dan finished last, so Dan is in 7th place.
- Rob finished second, so Rob is in 2nd place.
- Ada finished third, so Ada is in 3rd place.
- Ana finished fourth, so Ana is in 4th place.

Now, we have the following positions filled:
1. ?
2. Rob
3. Ada
4. Ana
5. ?
6. ?
7. Dan

Next, we know that Eli finished below Amy. This means Amy must be in a higher position than Eli. Also, Amy finished below Rob, so Amy cannot be in 1st place. Therefore, Amy must be in 5th place, and Eli must be in 6th place.

Now, the positions look like this:
1. ?
2. Rob
3. Ada
4. Ana
5. Amy
6. Eli
7. Dan

The only position left is 1st place, which must be occupied by Joe.

The final order is:
1. Joe
2. Rob
3. Ada
4. Ana

(E) The falcon is the fourth from the left
(F) The hawk is the fourth from the left
(G) The raven is the fourth from the left","To solve this problem, we need to determine the order of the seven birds on the branch based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The hawk is the second from the right.**
   - This means the hawk is in the 6th position.

2. **The raven is the fourth from the left.**
   - This places the raven in the 4th position.

3. **The robin is the second from the left.**
   - This places the robin in the 2nd position.

4. **The cardinal is to the left of the raven.**
   - Since the raven is in the 4th position, the cardinal must be in one of the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd positions. However, the robin is already in the 2nd position, so the cardinal must be in the 1st or 3rd position.

5. **The falcon is to the left of the robin.**
   - The robin is in the 2nd position, so the falcon must be in the 1st position.

6. **The crow is to the right of the blue jay.**
   - This means the blue jay must be to the left of the crow.

Now, let's try to place the remaining birds:

- We have the falcon in the 1st position, the robin in the 2nd position, and the raven in the 4th position. The hawk is in the 6th position.
- The cardinal must be in the 3rd position because it is to the left of the raven and the 1st position is occupied by the falcon.
- This leaves the 5th and 7th positions for the blue jay and the crow. Since the crow is to the right of the blue jay, the blue jay must be in the 5th position and the crow in the 7th position.

The final order is:
1. Falcon
2. Robin
3. Cardinal
4. Raven
5. Blue Jay
6. Hawk
7. Crow

Now, let's check the options to see which bird is the fourth from the left:

1. **Ana finished first.**  
   This directly tells us that Ana is in the 1st position.

2. **Eli finished third.**  
   This tells us that Eli is in the 3rd position.

3. **Mya finished fourth.**  
   This tells us that Mya is in the 4th position.

4. **Amy finished second-to-last.**  
   Since there are seven golfers, the second-to-last position is the 6th position. Therefore, Amy is in the 6th position.

5. **Amy finished below Joe.**  
   Since Amy is in the 6th position, Joe must be in a position higher than 6th. The possible positions for Joe are 2nd, 5th, or 7th.

6. **Dan finished above Mya.**  
   Mya is in the 4th position, so Dan must be in a position higher than 4th. The possible positions for Dan are 2nd or 5th.

Now, let's use the remaining positions (2nd, 5th, and 7th) to place Joe, Dan, and Mel:

- Since Dan must be above Mya (4th), Dan cannot be 5th or 7th. Therefore, Dan must be 2nd.
- Joe must be above Amy (6th), so Joe cannot be 7th. Therefore, Joe must be 5th.
