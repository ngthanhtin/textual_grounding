5727404b708984140094db5c,"In the early 1990s the memory of Genghis Khan with the Mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the Mongolian People's Republic period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is looked upon positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as ""Genghis Khan's Mongolia"", to themselves as ""Genghis Khan's children"", and to Genghis Khan as the ""father of the Mongols"" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated. What do some Mongolians feel non-Mongolian historians exaggerate about Genghis Khan?","The passage is as follows:

In the early 1990s the memory of Genghis Khan with the Mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the Mongolian People's Republic period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is looked upon positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as ""Genghis Khan's Mongolia"", to themselves as ""Genghis Khan's children"", and to Genghis Khan as the ""father of the Mongols"" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that Mongolians have a positive perception of Genghis Khan, particularly for his role in uniting warring tribes.
2. However, it also mentions that there is a difference in opinion regarding his brutality.
3. Specifically, the passage states that Mongolians believe that non-Mongolian historians have unfairly biased records against Genghis Khan.
4. It further states that Mongolians think that Genghis Khan's butchery is exaggerated in these records.

Therefore, the answer to the question is that some Mongolians feel that non-Mongolian historians exaggerate Genghis Khan's brutality, specifically his butchery.

5728f50baf94a219006a9e57,"Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution. In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U.S. Navy property argued to the court in allocution that ""the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy"". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions. Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials. Why is giving a defiant speech sometimes more harmful for the individual?","The passage is as follows:

Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage describes a situation where a defendant gives a defiant speech in allocution.
2. The speech is seen as suggesting a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility, and a likelihood of repeating the actions.
3. As a result, the judge increases the defendant's sentence.

From this, we can conclude that giving a defiant speech can be more harmful for the individual because it may be perceived by the judge as a sign of lack of remorse or responsibility, leading to a harsher sentence.

{Giving a defiant speech can lead to a harsher sentence due to perceived lack of remorse or responsibility.}"

The United Methodist Church is the largest denomination within the wider Methodist movement, which has approximately 80 million adherents across the world. In the United States, the UMC ranks as the largest mainline Protestant denomination, the largest Protestant church after the Southern Baptist Convention, and the third largest Christian denomination. As of 2014, worldwide membership was about 12 million: 7.2 million in the United States, and 4.4 million in Africa, Asia and Europe. It is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and other religious associations. In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 3.6% of the U.S population, or 9 million adult adherents, self-identify with the United Methodist Church revealing a much larger number of adherents than registered membership. In the United States the UMC ranks as the largest what?

To answer this question, we need to look at the relevant sentence in the passage: ""In the United States, the UMC ranks as the largest mainline Protestant denomination, the largest Protestant church after the Southern Baptist Convention, and the third largest Christian denomination.""

From this sentence, we can see that the UMC ranks as the largest in three different categories, but the question is asking for a single answer. However, the passage does not ask for the UMC's ranking in a specific category, so we can infer that the question is asking for the UMC's ranking in the most general category, which is ""mainline Protestant denomination"".

Therefore, the answer is {mainline Protestant denomination}."

In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as ""gravitational force"".

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage states that objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time.
2. It also states that from the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever.
3. However, the passage notes that it is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed.

Therefore, the curvature of space-time must be observed in a global sense, meaning that one must be looking at the motion of the object from a broader perspective, rather than from the object's own perspective.

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection.

The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.

To answer the question, we need to identify an example of a mechanical barrier on leaves. 

Step 1: Identify the relevant sentence in the passage that mentions leaves. 
The sentence is: ""The waxy cuticle of many leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection.""

Step 2: Identify the specific example of a mechanical barrier on leaves mentioned in the sentence. 
The example is: ""The waxy cuticle of many leaves"".

Therefore, the answer is {The waxy cuticle}."

Conflicts between the colonies, accomplished through raiding parties that included Indian allies, had taken place for decades, leading to a brisk trade in European colonial captives from either side.

To determine how William Shirley felt about French advancement, let's analyze the passage step by step:

1. William Shirley is described as an ""expansionist governor,"" which implies that he is in favor of expanding British territory and influence.
2. The passage states that Shirley was ""particularly forceful"" in his statements, indicating that he felt strongly about the issue.
3. Shirley's statement that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present suggests that he viewed French advancement as a threat to British interests.

Based on this analysis, it appears that William Shirley was opposed to French advancement and viewed it as a threat to British colonists. Therefore, the concise form of the answer is:

A 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers.

To find out how much higher the 42% occupational stress figure is compared to other jobs, we need to determine what the average profession's stress figure is. Since the passage states that the 42% figure is ""twice the figure for the average profession"", we can set up an equation:

42% = 2x

where x is the average profession's stress figure.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 42% / 2
x = 21%

So, the average profession's stress figure is 21%. To find out how much higher the 42% figure is, we can subtract the average profession's stress figure from the 42% figure:

42% - 21% = 21%

Therefore, the 42% occupational stress figure is 21 percentage points higher than the average profession's stress figure.

Another major division within Islamism is between what Graham E. Fuller has described as the fundamentalist ""guardians of the tradition"" (Salafis, such as those in the Wahhabi movement) and the ""vanguard of change and Islamic reform"" centered around the Muslim Brotherhood. Olivier Roy argues that ""Sunni pan-Islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century"" when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of pan-Arabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on ""sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions,"" and rejection of Shia Islam.

While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic, Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy. At the same time, their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage discusses the evolution of Islamism and its various divisions.
2. It mentions the shift in Sunni pan-Islamism in the second half of the 20th century, but this is not directly relevant to the question.
3. The key sentence for answering the question is: ""Following the Arab Spring, Roy has described Islamism as 'increasingly interdependent' with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world...""
4. This sentence indicates that Islamism has become more closely tied to democracy in the Arab Muslim world after the Arab Spring.

Therefore, the answer is: {democracy}."

In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all ""trading rules"" that are ""enacted by Member States"" which could hinder trade ""directly or indirectly, actually or potentially"" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This ""wide test"", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former ""Buy Irish"" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ‘manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, ""protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants"", ""national treasures"" of ""artistic, historic or archaeological value"" and ""industrial and commercial property."" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11.

Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely.

To answer the question, we need to identify what helps the process of free movement of goods. According to the passage, the process of free movement of goods is achieved by two main factors:

1. A customs union: This implies that there are no duties or tariffs on goods moving between member states.
2. The principle of non-discrimination: This means that member states cannot discriminate against imports from other member states.

Therefore, the concise answer is:

{A customs union and the principle of non-discrimination}"

5728ebcb3acd2414000e01db,"An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty. There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, ""Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,"" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, ""Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty."" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, ""I plead for the beauty that surrounds us""; this is known as a ""creative plea,"" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.

It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, ""Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,"" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, ""Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty."" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, ""I plead for the beauty that surrounds us""; this is known as a ""creative plea,"" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage discusses the debate among civil disobedients about whether to plead guilty or not guilty.
2. It mentions that some believe pleading guilty is a duty, while others think defending oneself in court can lead to changing the unjust law.
3. The ACT-UP handbook states that pleading guilty means taking responsibility for the act and being proud of it.
4. The handbook also implies that pleading guilty is a way of acknowledging that the law was broken, but also asserting that the action was morally justifiable.

Based on this analysis, the reason to plead guilty to a crime involving civil disobedience is to take responsibility for the act and assert that it was morally justifiable, even if it broke the law.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records.

This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest. What path does a ball thrown up and down in a moving vehicle take when seen by an outside observer? ","For instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity, the laws of physics do not change from being at rest.

Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage describes a scenario where a person is inside a moving vehicle at a constant velocity.
2. The person throws a ball straight up in the air and catches it as it falls down.
3. From the perspective of the person inside the vehicle, the ball follows a straight up and down path.
4. However, from the perspective of an outside observer, the ball follows a different path.
5. The passage states that the outside observer sees the ball follow a ""curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle.""

Therefore, the path of the ball thrown up and down in a moving vehicle, as seen by an outside observer, is a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. 

{A curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle.}"

They are bounded by four membranes, but the membranes are not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum. The fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis. Plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar, and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize fatty acids, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, iron-sulfur clusters, and carry out part of the heme pathway. This makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases. The most important apicoplast function is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis—in fact, apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function, and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium, they dump the organelle.

A second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks (which included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney and Jetix; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000). In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries.

However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced that it would discontinue ABC1 citing to the channel's inability to attain sustainable viewership. With ABC1's shutdown that October, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.

To answer the question, we need to identify the developmental network that was discontinued after the shutdown of ABC1. 

Step 1: Identify the network that was discontinued. According to the passage, ABC1 was discontinued.

Step 2: Identify the developmental network that was affected by the shutdown of ABC1. The passage states that ""With ABC1's shutdown that October, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.""

Therefore, the developmental network that was discontinued after the shutdown of ABC1 is ABC International.

In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, ‘Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States’. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all ""trading rules"" that are ""enacted by Member States"" which could hinder trade ""directly or indirectly, actually or potentially"" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This ""wide test"", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former ""Buy Irish"" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ‘manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, ""protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants"", ""national treasures"" of ""artistic, historic or archaeological value"" and ""industrial and commercial property.""
