But the Court of Justice held health was a ""service"" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed ""international medical science"" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary.

Why was the Dutch lawyer who moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social society case told he couldn't continue?","Question: Why was the Dutch lawyer who moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social society case told he couldn't continue?

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

1. The Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case.
2. He was told he couldn't continue because of a rule in Dutch law.
3. The rule stated that only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the Dutch lawyer was told he couldn't continue because he was no longer established in the Netherlands, as required by Dutch law.

So, the answer is: {he was no longer established in the Netherlands}."

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage. 

1. The case Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds involved a woman named Mrs. Geraets-Smits who claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany.
2. The Dutch health authorities made a judgment about the treatment Mrs. Geraets-Smits received in Germany.

Now, let's look at the specific text that mentions what the Dutch health authorities regarded as unnecessary: ""The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services.""

Based on this information, we can determine that the Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment Mrs. Geraets-Smits received in Germany as unnecessary.

The freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56 applies to who?","The freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56 applies to who?

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

1. The passage states that the ""freedom to provide services"" under TFEU article 56 applies to people who give services ""for remuneration"", especially commercial or professional activity.

2. This implies that the freedom to provide services applies to individuals or entities that offer services in exchange for payment or compensation.

3. The passage provides examples of such individuals or entities, including a Dutch lawyer, a German health clinic, and businesses that sell commodities futures or internet gambling services.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56 applies to individuals or entities that offer services for remuneration, including commercial or professional activities.

So, the answer is: {people who give services for remuneration}."

By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was ""likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement"", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding ""social advantages"", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was ""closely linked to the socio-economic situation"" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are ""public policy, public security or public health"", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for ""employment in the public service"". In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?","Question: In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?

To answer this question, we need to look at the cases mentioned in the passage where a Dutch national's benefits were affected by their movement to another country.

1. The passage mentions the case of Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute. In this case, the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium.

2. There is another case, Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, which also involves a Dutch national, but this case is about a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands and working in Germany, and her right to receive German child benefits.

Based on the information provided, the case where a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium is Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute.

So the answer is {Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute}."

Parliament elections, take place every five years, and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote. There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are ""degressively proportional"" according to member state size. This means - although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states. MEPs divide, as they do in national Parliaments, along political party lines: the conservative European People's Party is currently the largest, and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. Parties do not receive public funds from the EU, as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste ""Les Verts"" v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states. The Parliament's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings. It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole Commission (as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999). In some cases, the Parliament has explicit consultation rights, which the Commission must genuinely follow. However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (""kratia"") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (""demos""): in the EU it is not yet true that ""the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.""

This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection.

57263b1638643c19005ad333,"Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995> WHat do x.25 and Frame Relay both require","Question: What do X.25 and Frame Relay both require?

To answer this question, let's analyze the passage step by step:

1. X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted.
2. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes.

From these two points, it's clear that X.25 and Frame Relay do not both require a handshake.

However, let's continue analyzing the passage:

4. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end.
5. Both X.25 and Frame Relay do not define internal network routing operations.

From these points, it's clear that both X.25 and Frame Relay require some form of external routing or correlation to network addresses.

Specifically, for X.25, its packet IDs (the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers) have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relay's DLCI.

Therefore, the answer to the question is that both X.25 and Frame Relay require {correlation to network addresses} or {external routing}."

Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks.

To answer this question, let's analyze the passage step by step:

1. The passage mentions that X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations, but it does not explicitly state their primary use.
2. However, it does mention that ""For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks.""
3. Additionally, the passage states that ""X.25 was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks.""

Based on this information, we can infer that X.25 and Frame Relay were used for:

* Interconnecting LANs across wide area networks (Frame Relay)
* Providing a standardized interface into and out of packet networks (X.25)

So, the concise answer is: {interconnecting LANs and packet switching networks}."

Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient.

To answer this question, let's analyze the given text step by step:

1. The text compares and contrasts X.25 and Frame Relay, discussing their differences in terms of connection-oriented operations, handshake requirements, and layer operations.
2. Towards the end of the text, it mentions that both X.25 and Frame Relay have been supplanted by newer technologies.
3. Specifically, the text states that X.25 and Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer.
4. Additionally, it mentions that Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and/or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) have supplanted X.25 and Frame Relay at layer two.

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses the differences between X.25 and Frame Relay, two protocols used for connection-oriented operations. It also mentions that both X.25 and Frame Relay have been supplanted by newer technologies, specifically the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and/or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two.

The passage then mentions a typical configuration, which is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS.

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection.

In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as ""chocolate"". It had to be ""chocolate substitute"". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34.

So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers.

The passage states that Simmenthal SpA claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968.

So, the years the two Regulations originated in are 1964 and 1968.

Answer: {1964 and 1968}."
5726c5a9f1498d1400e8eac8,"In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an ""outright negation"" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why. In which case did the Court of Justice hold that a German court couldn't deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract based in Germany?","Question: In which case did the Court of Justice hold that a German court couldn't deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract based in Germany?

To answer this question, we need to look at the cases mentioned in the passage and find the one that matches the description.

1. The case R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury is about a UK company trying to evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands, but it's not about a German court denying a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract.

2. The case Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen is about a UK company operating in Denmark and the Danish minimum share capital rules, but it's not about a German court or a Dutch building company.

3. The case Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH is about a German court and a Dutch building company. According to the passage, the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany.

4. The case Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt is about a Hungarian company trying to shift its central administration to Italy, but it's not about a German court or a Dutch building company.

Therefore, the answer is {Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH}."

In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa.

The Court of Justice held, as ""in law and in fact"" it was an equally applicable ""selling arrangement"" (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified.

In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' ""traditional social practices and to local habits and customs"" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health.

5726b58f5951b619008f7b59,"While the concept of a ""social market economy"" was only introduced into EU law in 2007, free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957. According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the ""endgame"" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called ""four freedoms"" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.  What entity has taken the view that the goals of free trade are underpinned by the aims to improve people's well being?","Question: What entity has taken the view that the goals of free trade are underpinned by the aims to improve people's well being?

Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. ""Regulations,"" held the Court of Justice, ""come into force solely by virtue of their publication"" and implementation could have the effect of ""jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union."" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed. In which case was it held that the provisions of the treaties are directly effective if they are clear, unconditional, and don't require further action by EU or national authorities?

To answer this question, we need to identify the specific case mentioned in the passage where the provisions of the treaties were held to be directly effective if they meet certain conditions.

Step 1: Read the passage carefully to identify the relevant information.
Step 2: Identify the specific case mentioned in the passage where the provisions of the treaties were held to be directly effective.
Step 3: Verify that the case identified in Step 2 is indeed the correct answer.

After following these steps, we can conclude that the case where it was held that the provisions of the treaties are directly effective if they are clear, unconditional, and don't require further action by EU or national authorities is Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen.

So, the answer is {Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen}."

2. It states that this is meant to achieve a specific goal.

To answer this question, we need to look at the information provided in the passage. The passage mentions that ""free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957."" This indicates that free movement and trade have been central to European development since 1957.

Now, let's calculate how long that is. Since the passage does not provide a specific end date, we can assume that it is referring to the time period from 1957 to the present. However, the question is asking for a duration, not a specific date.

The passage was likely written in or after 2007, as it mentions the concept of a ""social market economy"" being introduced into EU law in 2007. However, the exact date is not provided.

Assuming the passage is referring to the time period from 1957 to the time it was written ( likely 2007 or later), we can calculate the duration as follows:

2007 - 1957 = 50 years

However, since the passage does not provide a specific end date, we can only say that free movement and trade have been central to European development for at least 50 years.

Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. ""Regulations,"" held the Court of Justice, ""come into force solely by virtue of their publication"" and implementation could have the effect of ""jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union."" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed. What are EU Regulations essentially the same as in the case mentioned?

To answer this question, we need to identify what EU Regulations are being compared to in the passage. 

Step 1:  The passage discusses the concept of direct effect in EU law, which allows citizens to bring claims based on EU laws that meet certain criteria.
Step 2:  It mentions that EU Regulations are directly effective, just like Treaty provisions, if they are clear, unconditional, and do not require further action to implement them.
Step 3:  The passage specifically states that EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, citing TFEU article 288, which says that Regulations are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’.
Step 4:  Therefore, we can conclude that EU Regulations are essentially the same as Treaty provisions in terms of their direct effect and applicability.

The final answer is: {Treaty provisions}."
5726c002708984140094d073,"As well as creating rights for ""workers"" who generally lack bargaining power in the market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the ""freedom of establishment"" in article 49, and ""freedom to provide services"" in article 56. In Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be ""established"" means to participate in economic life ""on a stable and continuous basis"", while providing ""services"" meant pursuing activity more ""on a temporary basis"". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, ""justified by imperative requirements in the general interest"" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or ""undertakings"" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both ""vertical"" and ""horizontal"" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise ""official authority"", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified. Which Treaty protects the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services?","Question: Which Treaty protects the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services?

To answer this question, we need to identify the treaty mentioned in the passage that protects the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.

Step 1:  Identify the relevant information in the passage.
The passage mentions the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as the treaty that protects the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.

Step 2:  Determine the specific articles of the TFEU that protect these freedoms.
According to the passage, article 49 of the TFEU protects the freedom of establishment, and article 56 protects the freedom to provide services.

Step 3:  Confirm that the TFEU is the correct answer.
Based on the information in the passage, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is the treaty that protects the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.

Answer: {Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union}"
57269bb8708984140094cb97,"Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have ""direct effect"". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not ""expressly"" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed ""the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law"". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’.

On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed. What type of company is Van Gend en Loos?","Question: What type of company is Van Gend en Loos?

To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The passage mentions Van Gend en Loos as the plaintiff in a court case against the Dutch Customs Authorities.
2. It states that Van Gend en Loos claimed that the Dutch Customs Authorities should not have charged tariffs on the import of urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands.
3. The passage also mentions that Van Gend en Loos is ""a postal company"".

Based on this information, we can conclude that Van Gend en Loos is a postal company. However, it seems to be involved in importing goods (urea-formaldehyde plastics) as well, which might indicate that it has a broader range of activities beyond postal services.

So the answer is {postal company}."

5726baf2dd62a815002e8e77,"Since its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a ""factor of production"". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more ""social"" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on ""citizenship"", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic ""worker"" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a ""worker"" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, ""under the direction of another person"" for ""remuneration"". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an ""indirect quid pro quo"" for the work he did. Having ""worker"" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is ""any person having the nationality of a Member State"" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically ""all available research finds little impact"" of ""labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers"". In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?","Question: In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?

56e77a8700c9c71400d7718a,"In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries. However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school. Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com. In general, what were teachers paid in the past?","Question: In general, what were teachers paid in the past?

To answer this question, let's analyze the given passage step by step:

1. The passage mentions that ""In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries.""
   
This statement directly answers the question about the general pay of teachers in the past.

2. Therefore, the answer to the question is that teachers were paid relatively low salaries in the past.

* Youth pastors who mentor children
* Spiritual guides in the Orthodox Catholic and Protestant traditions who are not necessarily formal positions

However, these variations can be grouped under the three main categories mentioned above.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.

More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a ""silly argument"" and ""a non-issue . . . a diversion."" In order to be considered in the top percentile, a person would need to amass how much money each year?","Question: In order to be considered in the top percentile, a person would need to amass how much money each year?

To answer this question, we need to look at the information provided in the passage. The relevant sentence is: ""In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900.""

From this sentence, we can see that to be considered in the top percentile, a person's assets need to exceed $759,900. However, the question asks about the amount of money a person needs to amass each year, not the total amount of assets they need to have.

Unfortunately, the passage does not provide information on the annual income or wealth growth required to be in the top percentile. It only provides information on the total amount of assets required.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, we cannot determine the exact amount of money a person needs to amass each year to be considered in the top percentile.

However, if we were to interpret the question as asking about the total amount of assets required to be in the top percentile, the answer would be:

{ $759,900 }"

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

1. The passage states that the three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined.

2. The key phrase here is ""financial assets."" This indicates that the comparison is being made in terms of the total financial assets owned by the three richest people versus the total financial assets owned by the lowest 48 nations.

3. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations together.

So the answer is {financial assets}."

56e77b8c00c9c71400d77197,"There are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in Christianity, across all three major traditions - (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational, with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical Christian traditions with a long tradition of ""discernment of spirits"", of vocations, and other aspects of spiritual life, especially the Roman and Orthodox Catholic Churches. These positions include: the honoured but informal position of starets or elder - a man (or, less often, woman), often a monastic, considered to be graced by God with certain gifts for the guidance of souls and the detection and correction of prelest (spiritual pride or deception) - who acts as a spiritual guide or father in the Orthodox Catholic tradition, especially Russian Orthodoxy (see Optina Monastery, which had a long line of said starets); the Priest or Confessor in Roman Catholicism, who is often a man in Holy Orders but may be a monastic or other person respected for his spiritual accomplishments or acumen (even the Pope of Rome has a Confessor, who is not always a bishop, and, due to the hierarchical structure of the Roman Church, can not be his equal in authority), which is often a semi-official to official position, as opposed to the unofficial positions of spiritual guides in the Orthodox Catholic and Protestant traditions; and the almost-exclusively informal arrangements (generally formal only in members who are under some form of church discipline) of mentorship (both of adults and children, in the latter case often a youth pastor) in the Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions, which boundaries can be blurred with the more typically Roman ""confessor"" position in some of the more historic and conservative Reformation Churches, such as some of the Lutheran and Anglican.

2. The passage provides the exact information we need, which is that the richest 1% of adults owned 40% of global assets in 2000.

Therefore, the answer to the question is {40%}."
5729d36b1d0469140077960b,"A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the ""10 million dollar millionaires"" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a ""silly argument"" and ""a non-issue . . . a diversion."" Why are there more poor people in the United States and Europe than China?","Question: Why are there more poor people in the United States and Europe than China?

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

1. The passage mentions that Oxfam's claims about wealth inequality have been questioned due to the methodology used.
2. Specifically, it notes that by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China.
3. The reason for this is attributed to a greater tendency to take on debts in the United States and Western Europe.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the reason there are more poor people in the United States and Europe than China is due to the greater tendency to take on debts in these regions, which affects the calculation of net wealth.

Answer: {greater tendency to take on debts}."

Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season.

The combined wealth of the ""10 million dollar millionaires"" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016.

In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that ""whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary"" and so ""it has always been clear"" that UK courts have a duty ""to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law."" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be ""fundamental principles"" of common law, and Parliament ""did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation"" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law.

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

1. The passage mentions that the second Doctor Who serial, ""The Daleks"" (also known as ""The Mutants""), introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters.

It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any ""bug-eyed monsters"". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; ""We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that."" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom. Who wrote The Mutants?","Question: Who wrote The Mutants?

57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e9,"In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term ""Imperialism"" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of ""imperialism"" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of ""imperialism"". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power. According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries have an imperialistic policy?","Question: According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries have an imperialistic policy?

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

1. Lenin's work ""Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism"" is mentioned as having a significant influence on later Marxist conceptions of imperialism.
2. The passage states that Lenin portrayed imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism.
3. According to Lenin, imperialism arises from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower.

Based on this information, we can conclude that Lenin believed capitalistic countries must have an imperialistic policy because of their need to constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower.

So, the answer is: {to constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower}."

They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area.

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the Kievan Rus' troops.
2. It specifically states that the Kievan Rus' troops were led by two individuals: Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev.
3. Therefore, the leaders of the Kievan Rus' troops against Subutai's Mongol army were Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev.

So, the answer is: {Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev}."

The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type.

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage about the tentilla of Euplokamis and compare it to other cydippids.

1. **Striated muscle**: The passage states that the tentilla of Euplokamis contain striated muscle, which is a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora. This indicates that the presence of striated muscle in the tentilla is unique to Euplokamis among cydippids.

2. **Coiled when relaxed**: Unlike other cydippids, whose tentilla elongate when relaxed, the tentilla of Euplokamis are coiled when relaxed. This difference in the relaxed state of the tentilla is another distinguishing feature.

3. **Types of movement**: The tentilla of Euplokamis exhibit three types of movement used in capturing prey: a quick flicking motion, a wriggling motion, and coiling around prey. While the passage does not explicitly state that these movements are unique to Euplokamis among all cydippids, it does highlight the specialized nature of these movements, particularly the quick flicking motion powered by striated muscle contraction.

Considering these points, the features that make the tentilla of Euplokamis different from other cydippids are the presence of striated muscle and the fact that they are coiled when relaxed.

Answer: {Presence of striated muscle and coiled when relaxed}."

572658daf1498d1400e8dcb0,"The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (""little tentacles""), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle. What does the euplokamis use the three types of movement for?","Question: What does the euplokamis use the three types of movement for?

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage about the movements of Euplokamis' tentilla and their functions.

1. The passage mentions that Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement: flicking out quickly, wriggling, and coiling around prey.
2. It explains that the flicking movement is used to capture prey quickly, taking only 40 to 60 milliseconds.
3. The wriggling motion is described as possibly luring prey by mimicking the behavior of small planktonic worms.
4. The coiling movement is used to wrap around prey, which is accomplished by the tentilla returning to their inactive state, but can be tightened by smooth muscle.

Considering these points, it's clear that all three types of movement are used for capturing prey, either by quickly snatching it, luring it, or wrapping around it.

So, the answer is: {capturing prey}."

To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The passage states that ""there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy.""

This indicates that each member state has one Commissioner.

2. There is no mention of any member state having more than one Commissioner.

Based on this information, we can conclude that each of the 28 member states has one Commissioner.

572658daf1498d1400e8dcad,"The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (""little tentacles""), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle. What are colloblasts?","Question: What are colloblasts?

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage.

1. Colloblasts are mentioned as being densely covered on the tentacles and tentilla of cydippid ctenophores.
2. They are described as specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis.
3. The passage explains that colloblasts have three main components: a domed head with vesicles containing adhesive, a stalk that anchors the cell, and a spiral thread that coils around the stalk.

Based on this information, we can conclude that colloblasts are specialized cells used for capturing prey by sticking to it.

56f895339e9bad19000a0177,"Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason. He wrote, ""All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false."" and ""[That] Reason in no way contributes to faith. [...] For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things."" However, though seemingly contradictorily, he also wrote in the latter work that human reason ""strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it"", bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship, however, has found a different reality in Luther. Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to. Bernhard Lohse, for example, has demonstrated in his classic work ""Fides und Ratio"" that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together. More recently, Hans-Peter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method. This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself, that it has internal coherence. The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation. Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason, and held them in dialectical partnership. Luther's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres. What do scholars sometimes assert that Luther believed about what faith and reason were to each other?","Question: What do scholars sometimes assert that Luther believed about what faith and reason were to each other?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The question asks what scholars sometimes assert that Luther believed about the relationship between faith and reason.
2. According to the passage, some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical.
3. ""Antithetical"" means being in direct opposition to each other.
4. Therefore, some scholars assert that Luther believed that faith and reason were in direct opposition to each other.

So, the answer is: {antithetical}."
5725ca4389a1e219009abeb8,"The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties, the ""core"" treaties being the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions, which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states. The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states, as well as certain islands and overseas territories, including Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments. European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law.

573081c2069b531400832136,"""The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’, or simply ‘rule’"". The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is ""that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea"". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa ""have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires"". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that ""imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism"". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era.

This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China. At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs (Shangshu Sheng) that mainly dealt with finance was established (such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong), but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards. What were the three parts of Kublai's government?","Question: What were the three parts of Kublai's government?

To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the passage. The passage states that Kublai's government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices. 

1. The first part of the government is the civil office, which is managed by the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng). 
2. The second part is the military office, which is managed by the Privy Council. 
3. The third part is the censorial office, which is managed by the Censorate and conducts internal surveillance and inspection.

Therefore, the three parts of Kublai's government are the Central Secretariat, the Privy Council, and the Censorate.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is ""that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea"". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa ""have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires"". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that ""imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism"". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations. Who suggested that imperialism was the ""highest"" form of capitalism?","Question: Who suggested that imperialism was the ""highest"" form of capitalism?

572691545951b619008f76e2,"The European Commission is the main executive body of the European Union. Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should ""promote the general interest of the Union"" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be ""completely independent"" and not ""take instructions from any Government"". Under article 17(2), ""Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise."" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the ""de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives"". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a ""written procedure"" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini). The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states. The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament. The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon. This means Commissioners are, through the appointment process, the unelected subordinates of member state governments.
