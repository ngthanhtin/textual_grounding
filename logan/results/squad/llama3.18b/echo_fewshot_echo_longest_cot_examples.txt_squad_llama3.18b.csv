To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The freedom to provide services is mentioned in TFEU article 56.
2. According to the passage, this freedom applies to provide services applies to people who give services ""for remuneration"", especially commercial or professional activity.
3. This means that the freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56 applies to individuals or businesses that provide services for payment, such as lawyers, doctors, or companies offering services like consulting or IT services.

To answer this question, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the key information in the passage about the Belgian footballer.
2. Determine the specific claim made by the footballer.
3. Verify that the claim is related to transferring from one football club to another when the contract is fulfilled.

From the passage, I can see that the key information is related to a case involving a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman. The passage states that Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished.

Now, I will analyze the specific claim made by Bosman:

* The claim is related to transferring from one football club to another.
* The claim is specifically about transferring when the contract is fulfilled (i.e., when the contract has finished).

In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was ""likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement"", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding ""social advantages"", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was ""closely linked to the socio-economic situation"" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are ""public policy, public security or public health"", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for ""employment in the public service"". In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?","Question: In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?

To answer this question, let's analyze the passage step by step:

1. The passage mentions several cases related to the Free Movement of Workers Regulation, but we need to find the one that specifically deals with a Dutch national moving to Belgium and losing benefits.
2. The passage mentions the case of Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute, which is mentioned in the context of ""social advantages"".
3. In this case, the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was ""closely linked to the socio-economic situation"" of the Netherlands.
4. This matches the scenario we are looking for, so we can conclude that the correct answer is Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute.

Step 1: The passage mentions that the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes. This means that the Parliament does not have the power to propose laws without the Commission's approval.

Step 2: The passage also states that citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries. This means that the voting system in the Parliament is not proportional to the population of the member states, which can lead to unequal representation.

Step 3: The passage mentions that ""qualified majorities"" or consensus of the Council are required to legislate. This means that the Parliament cannot pass laws without the agreement of the Council, which can limit its power.

Step 4: The passage states that the Parliament cannot pass legislation without the Commission and Council, meaning power (""kratia"") is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people (""demos"").

Based on these steps, the answer is that Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes, and it requires the agreement of the Council to pass laws, which causes equality and democracy to be deficient.

To pass legislation, the Parliament needs to work with the Commission and the Council. However, the question asks what two bodies the Parliament must go through first. 

Step 1: The Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, so the Parliament cannot initiate legislation on its own. 

Step 2: The Commission and the Council are the two bodies that the Parliament needs to work with to pass legislation. 

However, the question asks which two bodies the Parliament must go through first. The correct order is that the Parliament needs to work with the Commission, and then the Council. But the question does not specify that the Parliament needs to go through the Commission first. 

Therefore, the two bodies that the Parliament must go through first to pass legislation are the Commission and the Council. 

But, since the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation, it is likely that the Parliament needs to work with the Commission first to amend or veto the legislation, rather than the other way around. 

So, the two bodies that the Parliament must go through first to pass legislation are the Commission and the Council. But the correct order is that the Parliament needs to work with the Commission first, and then the Council.

Step 2: Identify the key aspect of Article 34. The provision is focused on ensuring the free movement of goods within the European Union.

Step 3: Consider the implications of Article 34. It means that states can be held responsible for any measures that restrict trade, whether directly or indirectly, actually or potentially.

Step 4: Analyze the examples provided in the passage.

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination.
2. The customs union is mentioned as one of the factors that help the process of free movement of goods.
3. The principle of non-discrimination is also mentioned as a factor that helps the process of free movement of goods.

Considering these points, the answer is that both the customs union and the principle of non-discrimination help the process of free movement of goods.

However, since the question asks for a single answer, we can consider the customs union as the primary factor that helps the process of free movement of goods. 

So, the concise form of the final answer is: {Customs union}."
5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec,"Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such ""indirect"" discriminatory (or ""indistinctly applicable"") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional ""mandatory"" or ""overriding"" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would ""considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view"" and labelling would protect consumers ""just as effectively"". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as ""chocolate"". It had to be ""chocolate substitute"". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a ""chocolate substitute"" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have ""a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers"" that ""affects the access of that product to the market"". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.  In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?","Question: In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?

Step 1: The passage describes several cases where the Court of Justice found that certain laws or regulations infringed article 34 of the TFEU. These cases include requirements about a product's content or packaging, and laws that place obstacles on the use of a product.

Step 2: The passage mentions several specific cases, including Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA, and Commission v Italy (2003). However, it does not mention a case from 2009.

Step 3: The passage does mention a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, but it does not provide any details about the specific law or regulation that was found to infringe article 34.

Step 4: However, the passage does provide some information about the 2009 case: it states that the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.

For such ""indirect"" discriminatory (or ""indistinctly applicable"") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional ""mandatory"" or ""overriding"" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would ""considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view"" and labelling would protect consumers ""just as effectively"". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as ""chocolate"". It had to be ""chocolate substitute"". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a ""chocolate substitute"" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have ""a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers"" that ""affects the access of that product to the market"". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement. What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?","Question: What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?

Step 1:  The passage mentions a case called Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, in which the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs to have a minimum alcohol content was contrary to TFEU article 34.
Step 2:  The passage specifically states that the German law in question required all spirits and liqueurs to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent.
Step 3:  Therefore, the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have is 25 per cent.

57263b1638643c19005ad333,"Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two.

Step 1: The passage states that both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations.

Step 2: The passage also mentions that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted, but it does not explicitly state that Frame Relay requires a handshake.

Step 3: However, the passage does not mention any specific requirements that are common to both X.25 and Frame Relay.

Step 4: Upon re-reading the passage, I noticed that both X.25 and Frame Relay do not define internal network routing operations.

Step  Step 5: Another commonality is that both X.25 and Frame Relay do not define any operations inside the packet network, with X.25 only operating at the user-network-interface (UNI) and Frame Relay's integrity operations pertaining only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end.

Step 6: Based on these points, I can conclude that both X.25 and Frame Relay do not require internal network routing operations and do not define any operations inside the packet network.

Step 7: However, the passage also mentions that both X.25 and Frame Relay are connection-oriented at the specified layers of the OSI Model, but they do so at different layers.

Step 8: X.25 is connection-oriented at the network layer, while Frame Relay is connection-oriented at the data link layer.

Step 9: The passage does not mention any other specific requirements that are common to both X.25 and Frame Relay.

Step 10: Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question is that both X.25 and Frame Relay do not define internal network routing operations and do not define any operations inside the packet network.

However, the question can be interpreted as asking for the most specific requirement that is common to both X.25 and Frame Relay. In that case, the answer would be that both X.25 and Frame Relay do not define internal network routing operations.

57265e455951b619008f70bc,"Since its founding, the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states ""albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves"" on the ""basis of reciprocity"".

Step 1: The passage mentions that Mr. Costa claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice.
Step 2: The passage states that the Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Mr. Costa had no claim.
Step 3: This suggests that the Italian Constitutional Court's reason for rejecting Mr. Costa's claim was that the nationalisation law predated the Treaty of Rome.

The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result.

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. According to the passage, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has stated that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy.
2. The passage cites the case of Costa v ENEL, where the ECJ held that EU law has primacy over national law.
3. The passage also cites the case of Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, where the ECJ stated that directly applicable measures of the institutions (such as Regulations) render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law.

What could justify restrictions on freedom of establishment?","Question: What could justify restrictions on freedom of establishment?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by certain factors. To find these factors, we need to look for phrases that start with ""because"" or ""as"" and are followed by a reason for justifying restrictions.

2. The passage states that restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by ""creditor protection"". This means that if a country wants to restrict the freedom of establishment, it can do so to protect the interests of creditors.

3. The passage also mentions that restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by ""labour rights to participate in work"". This means that a country can restrict the freedom of establishment if it wants to protect the rights of workers to participate in work.

4. Finally, the passage states that restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by ""the public interest in collecting taxes"". This means that a country can restrict the freedom of establishment if it wants to ensure that it can collect taxes from companies operating within its territory.

Therefore, the factors that could justify restrictions on freedom of establishment are:

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could ""not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails."" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a ""general principle"" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive.

This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision. How long did Ms Kucukdeveci work for Swedex Gmbh & Co KG before she was dismissed?","Question: How long did Ms Kücükdeveci work for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before she was dismissed?

To find the answer, let's break down the information provided in the passage:

1. Ms Kücükdeveci worked from age 18 to 28.
2. The years she worked under the age of 25 were not counted towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal.
3. She worked for 10 years in total.

Since she worked for 10 years in total, and the years under 25 were not counted, we can assume that the years from 25 to 28 were counted. 

So, let's calculate the number of years from 25 to 28:
28 - 25 = 3 years

Now, let's add the years from 25 to 28 to the years under 25:
3 years + 7 years (18-25) = 10 years

This means that the information provided in the passage is consistent with Ms Kücükdeveci working for 10 years before she was dismissed.

However, we are asked to find how long she worked before she was dismissed, not the total number of years she worked. The passage does not provide the exact date of her dismissal, but it does mention that she worked from age 18 to 28. Therefore, we can conclude that she worked for 10 years before she was dismissed.

So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a ""general principle"" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law.

In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not ""expressly"" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed ""the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law"". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. ""Regulations,"" held the Court of Justice, ""come into force solely by virtue of their publication"" and implementation could have the effect of ""jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.""

Which TFEU article states that states are exempt from infringing on rights of establishment when they exercise official authority?","Question: Which TFEU article states that states are exempt from infringing on rights of establishment when they exercise official authority?

To answer this question, we need to look for the specific article mentioned in the passage that deals with the exemption of states from infringing on rights of establishment when they exercise official authority.

Step 1: Identify the relevant article mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions article 49 as the one that deals with the freedom of establishment.

Step 2: Read the relevant part of the passage that mentions article 49. The passage states: ""TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise 'official authority'...""

Step 3: Based on the information in step 2, we can conclude that article 49 is the one that states that states are exempt from infringing on rights of establishment when they exercise official authority.

5726baf2dd62a815002e8e77,"Since its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a ""factor of production"". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more ""social"" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on ""citizenship"", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic ""worker"" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a ""worker"" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, ""under the direction of another person"" for ""remuneration"". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an ""indirect quid pro quo"" for the work he did. Having ""worker"" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is ""any person having the nationality of a Member State"" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time). Nevertheless, practically ""all available research finds little impact"" of ""labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers"". In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?","Question: In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?

2. Identify the details of the case: According to the passage, the German man volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions.

56e77a8700c9c71400d7718d,"In the past, teachers have been paid relatively low salaries. However, average teacher salaries have improved rapidly in recent years. US teachers are generally paid on graduated scales, with income depending on experience. Teachers with more experience and higher education earn more than those with a standard bachelor's degree and certificate. Salaries vary greatly depending on state, relative cost of living, and grade taught. Salaries also vary within states where wealthy suburban school districts generally have higher salary schedules than other districts. The median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000 in 2004, with the average entry salary for a teacher with a bachelor's degree being an estimated $32,000. Median salaries for preschool teachers, however, were less than half the national median for secondary teachers, clock in at an estimated $21,000 in 2004. For high school teachers, median salaries in 2007 ranged from $35,000 in South Dakota to $71,000 in New York, with a national median of $52,000. Some contracts may include long-term disability insurance, life insurance, emergency/personal leave and investment options. The American Federation of Teachers' teacher salary survey for the 2006-07 school year found that the average teacher salary was $51,009. In a salary survey report for K-12 teachers, elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary earning $39,259. High school teachers had the highest median salary earning $41,855. Many teachers take advantage of the opportunity to increase their income by supervising after-school programs and other extracurricular activities. In addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers may also enjoy greater benefits (like health insurance) compared to other occupations. Merit pay systems are on the rise for teachers, paying teachers extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores and for high success at their overall school. Also, with the advent of the internet, many teachers are now selling their lesson plans to other teachers through the web in order to earn supplemental income, most notably on TeachersPayTeachers.com. In a report on K-12 teachers, which teachers had the lowest median salary?","Question: In a report on K-12 teachers, which teachers had the lowest median salary?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions a report on K-12 teachers, which provides information on the median salaries of different types of teachers.
2. We are asked to identify the type of teacher with the lowest median salary.
3. According to the passage, the median salaries for different types of teachers are as follows:
   - Elementary school teachers: $39,259
   - High school teachers: $41,855
   - Preschool teachers: Not mentioned (but mentioned earlier as $21,000 in 2004)
4. Since preschool teachers are not mentioned in the report on K-12 teachers, we cannot consider them as the type of teacher with the lowest median salary.
5. Between elementary school teachers and high school teachers, the passage states that elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary, which is $39,259.

5726baf2dd62a815002e8e74,"Since its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a ""factor of production"". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more ""social"" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on ""citizenship"", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic ""worker"" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a ""worker"" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, ""under the direction of another person"" for ""remuneration"". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an ""indirect quid pro quo"" for the work he did. Having ""worker"" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is ""any person having the nationality of a Member State"" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security.

56e77b8c00c9c71400d77194,"There are many forms of spiritual or religious teachers in Christianity, across all three major traditions - (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational, with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical Christian traditions with a long tradition of ""discernment of spirits"", of vocations, and other aspects of spiritual life, especially the Roman and Orthodox Catholic Churches. These positions include: the honoured but informal position of starets or elder - a man (or, less often, woman), often a monastic, considered to be graced by God with certain gifts for the guidance of souls and the detection and correction of prelest (spiritual pride or deception) - who acts as a spiritual guide or father in the Orthodox Catholic tradition, especially Russian Orthodoxy (see Optina Monastery, which had a long line of said starets); the Priest or Confessor in Roman Catholicism, who is often a man in Holy Orders but may be a monastic or other person respected for his spiritual accomplishments or acumen (even the Pope of Rome has a Confessor, who is not always a bishop, and, due to the hierarchical structure of the Roman Church, can not be his equal in authority), which is often a semi-official to official position, as opposed to the unofficial positions of spiritual guides in the Orthodox Catholic and Protestant traditions; and the almost-exclusively informal arrangements (generally formal only in members who are under some form of church discipline) of mentorship (both of adults and children, in the latter case often a youth pastor) in the Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions, which boundaries can be blurred with the more typically Roman ""confessor"" position in some of the more historic and conservative Reformation Churches, such as some of the Lutheran and Anglican. In keeping with the individualistic nature of most Protestant denominations, the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is small, with a heavy emphasis placed on heavy reading and personal, Spirit-enlightened interpretation of the Holy Bible. How many types of religious or spiritual teachers are there in Christianity?","Question: How many types of religious or spiritual teachers are there in Christianity?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions three major traditions in Christianity: Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational.
2. Within these traditions, the passage mentions several types of spiritual teachers:
   - Starets or elder in the Orthodox Catholic tradition
   - Priest or Confessor in Roman Catholicism
   - Mentorship in the Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions
3. However, the passage also mentions that the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is small in Protestant denominations, and instead, there is a heavy emphasis on personal, Spirit-enlightened interpretation of the Holy Bible.
4. This suggests that the concept of spiritual teachers may be less formalized in Protestant denominations, and may be more informal or individualized.

Considering these points, it seems that the passage is describing a range of spiritual guidance roles across different Christian traditions, rather than a fixed number of types. However, if we were to count the specific roles mentioned, we would have:

- Starets or elder (1)
- Priest or Confessor (1)
- Mentorship (1)

But the passage also implies that there may be other, less formalized roles or arrangements for spiritual guidance in Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions.

Therefore, a more accurate answer might be that there are at least 3 specific roles mentioned, but the actual number of types of spiritual teachers in Christianity may be more complex and nuanced."

What are the three major traditions present in Christianity?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions three major traditions in Christianity: 
   - (Roman) Catholic
   - (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic
   - Protestant/Non-Denominational

2. These three traditions are mentioned as the main ones, with a stronger tradition of spiritual formation in the more historic and authoritarian/hierarchical Christian traditions, specifically the Roman and Orthodox Catholic Churches.

3. The other traditions, such as Lutheran and Anglican, are mentioned as being part of the Protestant tradition, but they are not the main three traditions.

4. Therefore, the three major traditions present in Christianity are (Roman) Catholic, (Eastern) Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational.

The answer is: {Catholic, Orthodox Catholic, Protestant/Non-Denominational}."

Which denomination has more of an individualistic streak?","Question: Which denomination has more of an individualistic streak?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions three major Christian traditions: Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Catholic, and Protestant/Non-Denominational.
2. It states that the Protestant/Non-Denominational tradition has a ""stronger tradition of individualism"" and that the emphasis on being guided in spiritual development is ""small"" in this tradition.
3. It also mentions that the Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions have ""almost-exclusively informal arrangements"" of mentorship, which can be blurred with the more typically Roman ""confessor"" position in some of the more historic and conservative Reformation Churches.
4. However, the passage does not suggest that the other two traditions (Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Catholic) are more individualistic than the Protestant/Non-Denominational tradition.

Based on this analysis, the answer is:

56d99b7bdc89441400fdb5c9,"Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. According to game stats, which Super Bowl 50 quarterback had his worst year since his first season as a player in the NFL?","Question: According to game stats, which Super Bowl 50 quarterback had his worst year since his first season as a player in the NFL?

To answer this question, we need to analyze the passage and identify the quarterback who had his worst year since his first season as a player in the NFL. 

Step 1: Identify the quarterback who had his worst year since his first season as a player in the NFL. 
The passage mentions that Peyton Manning had his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998.

Step 2: Determine the reason for Manning's worst year.
The passage states that Manning's worst year was due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.

Step 3: Confirm that Manning played in Super Bowl 50.
The passage does not explicitly state that Manning played in Super Bowl 50, but it mentions that he re-claimed the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. This implies that the Broncos made it to the playoffs, which includes Super Bowl 50.

Step 4: Conclude that Manning had his worst year since his first season as a player in the NFL.
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that Peyton Manning had his worst year since his first season as a player in the NFL.

Answer: {Peyton Manning}"

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the ""10 million dollar millionaires"" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900.

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that in 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900.
2. Since half of the world's wealth is in the hands of the top percentile, we can infer that the top percentile is the top 1% of the population.
3. To be considered in the top 1%, a person would need to have an asset value that is at least as high as the median asset value of the top 1%.
4. Since the median asset value of the top 1% is $759,900, we can assume that this is the minimum amount of money a person would need to amass each year to be considered in the top percentile.

Therefore, the answer is: {759,900}."

5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee04,"The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed] Developments in which scientists influenced the creation of pharmacology in medieval Islam?","Question: Developments in which scientists influenced the creation of pharmacology in medieval Islam?

According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. However, we are interested in the claim made by Oxfam. So we will use the claim made by Oxfam. According to Oxfam, the 85 richest people have wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. 

So, to answer the question, we need to find out how many people are in the bottom 50% of the world's population. According to Oxfam, this number is 3.5 billion people. However, we are interested in the number of people that the 85 richest people's wealth is equal to. According to Oxfam, this number is also 3.5 billion people. 

But the question asks for the number of people that the 85 richest people's wealth is equal to. We are given the number of people in the bottom 50% of the world's population. This number is 3.5 billion people. However, the question asks for the number of people that the 85 richest people's wealth is equal to. According to Oxfam, this number is 3.5 billion people. However, we are interested in the number of people that the 85 richest people's wealth is equal to the nearest whole number. So we round 3.5 billion people to the nearest whole number. The nearest whole number to 3.5 billion people is 3.5 billion people."

5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee05,"The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed] Who was influential in promoting the use of chemical compounds as medicines?","Question: Who was influential in promoting the use of chemical compounds as medicines?

Step 1: The passage mentions several individuals who made significant contributions to the development of pharmacology in medieval Islam.

This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people. What do all member states agree takes precedence over national law?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage states that EU law takes primacy over national law where this is agreed in the Treaties.
2. However, it also mentions that member states do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights.
3. This suggests that while EU law may take precedence over national law in certain cases, it is not absolute and can be overridden by member states in cases where it conflicts with their fundamental constitutional principles.
4. The passage also mentions that the UK Supreme Court has noted that Parliament did not contemplate or authorise the abrogation of fundamental principles of common law when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972.
5. Similarly, the German Constitutional Court has stated that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles, it cannot override German law.
6. Therefore, while EU law may take precedence over national law in certain cases, it is not absolute and can be overridden by member states in cases where it conflicts with their fundamental constitutional principles.

So, the answer to the question is that all member states agree that EU law takes precedence over national law where this is agreed in the Treaties, but it is not absolute and can be overridden by member states in cases where it conflicts with their fundamental constitutional principles.

Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (A) What percentage of global assets does the richest 1% of people have?
 
 Step 1: The passage mentions that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000.
 Step 2: However, it also mentions that according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth.
 Step 3: Since there are two different percentages mentioned, we need to determine which one is correct.
 Step 4: Unfortunately, the passage does not provide a clear explanation for the discrepancy between the two percentages.
 Step 5: However, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the richest 1% of people own at least 40% of global assets, but may own as much as 46% of the world's wealth.

Therefore, the answer is {40%} or {46%}. However, the question asks for a single answer, so I will choose the lower percentage.

The final answer is: {40%}."

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that the German Constitutional Court has expressed reservations about the EU overriding German law in certain cases.
2. It specifically mentions the Solange I and Solange II decisions, which state that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law, and the social state principles), then it cannot override German law.
3. However, the passage also notes that if the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, then the German Constitutional Court would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.
4. This suggests that the EU can override German law only if it complies with its basic constitutional rights and principles, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights.

Therefore, the EU cannot override German law if:

* The EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law, and the social state principles).
* The EU does not have a framework that protects fundamental human rights.

So, the concise form of the answer is:

5727e6cbff5b5019007d97f1,"A study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the ""10 million dollar millionaires"" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession.

4. As a result, the criticism argues that Oxfam's report finds more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China, which is not necessarily the case.
5. The criticism suggests that this discrepancy is due to a greater tendency to take on debts in Western countries.

Based on this analysis, the reason for Oxfam's findings being questioned is the criticism about the methodology used, specifically the use of net wealth and the resulting discrepancy in the number of poor people in different countries.

Therefore, the answer is: {the criticism about the methodology used}."

572699db5951b619008f779d,"Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that ""whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary"" and so ""it has always been clear"" that UK courts have a duty ""to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law."" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be ""fundamental principles"" of common law, and Parliament ""did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation"" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, ""so long as"" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people. What does the EU's legitimacy rest on?","Question: What does the EU's legitimacy rest on?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that generally speaking, member states do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. This suggests that the EU's legitimacy does not solely rest on the authority of the Court of Justice.

2. The passage states that in the United Kingdom, Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This implies that the UK's acceptance of EU law is conditional on the will of the people, which further suggests that the EU's legitimacy rests on the democratic will of the people.

3. The passage also mentions that the German Constitutional Court has expressed similar reservations about the EU's authority, stating that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles, it cannot override German law. However, the Court has also stated that it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles ""so long as"" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights. This suggests that the EU's legitimacy also rests on its factual commitment to human rights.

4. Finally, the passage states that most other member states have expressed similar reservations, which further reinforces the idea that the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.

Based on this analysis, the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.

Answer: {The ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people}."

5726ddf6f1498d1400e8ee06,"The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865–915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250–1316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid.

As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any ""bug-eyed monsters"". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; ""We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that."" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

Who was the Denver head coach for Super Bowl 50?","Question: Who was the Denver head coach for Super Bowl 50?

To answer this question, we need to determine who the head coach of the Denver Broncos was during the 2015-2016 season, which is when Super Bowl 50 took place.

According to the passage, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox. However, this change occurred before the 2015 season, and the passage does not mention John Fox being the head coach during the 2015-2016 season.

The passage then mentions the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach, but it does not mention Kubiak being the head coach for Super Bowl 50. In fact, the passage does not mention Kubiak at all after the hiring.

However, the passage does mention that Gary Kubiak was the head coach of the Denver Broncos during the 2015 season, and that the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12-4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. This suggests that Kubiak was the head coach during the regular season, but it does not confirm that he was the head coach for Super Bowl 50.

To determine who the head coach was for Super Bowl 50, we need to look at external information. According to external sources, Gary Kubiak was indeed the head coach of the Denver Broncos during Super Bowl 50.

Therefore, the answer is: {Gary Kubiak}."

Under the suggestion of Subutai, the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two tumen) contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai. They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area.

It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama, Canadian Sydney Newman, was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.[note 1] The programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience, as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963 Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants. As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any ""bug-eyed monsters"". The first serial had been completed and the BBC believed it was crucial that the next one be a success, but The Mutants was the only script ready to go, so the show had little choice but to use it. According to producer Verity Lambert; ""We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that."" Nation's script became the second Doctor Who serial – The Daleks (a.k.a. The Mutants). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom. Who wrote The Mutants?","Question: Who wrote The Mutants?

To find the answer, let's break down the information given in the passage:

1. The passage mentions that discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year, but it doesn't specify who wrote The Mutants during that time.
2. It mentions that writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker, and initial producer Verity Lambert contributed to the development of the series, but it doesn't mention them writing The Mutants specifically.
3. The passage states that on 31 July 1963, David Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title The Mutants.
4. It also mentions that when the script was presented to Newman and Wilson, it was rejected because it contained ""bug-eyed monsters"", but the script was later used as the second Doctor Who serial.

57309bfb8ab72b1400f9c5e9,"In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term ""Imperialism"" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of ""imperialism"" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of ""imperialism"". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power. According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries have an imperialistic policy?","Question: According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries have an imperialistic policy?

To answer this question, let's analyze the passage step by step:

1. The passage mentions that Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism in his work ""Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism"".
2. It explains that Lenin believed that capitalist economies need to constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower.
3. According to Lenin, this need for expansion necessitates colonial expansion, which is a key characteristic of imperialism.

Therefore, based on Lenin's views, capitalistic countries must have an imperialistic policy because they need to constantly expand their investment, material resources, and manpower, which can only be achieved through colonial expansion.

Answer: {Constant expansion of investment, material resources, and manpower necessitates colonial expansion}"

They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia, sacked the Genoese trade-fortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 Kievan Rus' troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area.

This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the ""de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives"". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a ""written procedure"" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini).

The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.

With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity, it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum (4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be ""fundamental interactions"".:199–128 When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex. What diagrams are used to simplify particle interactions on a fundamental level?","Question: What diagrams are used to simplify particle interactions on a fundamental level?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict the accurate result of particle interactions.
2. However, it also mentions that there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions.
3. The passage then introduces Feynman diagrams as a way to describe particle interactions in a simple manner.
4. Feynman diagrams are described as a graphical representation of particle interactions, where matter particles are represented as straight lines, and gauge bosons are represented as wavy lines.
5. The diagrams show the interaction vertices, where the direction of the particle world lines changes, and the gauge bosons are emitted or absorbed.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer is:

The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense.

572658daf1498d1400e8dcad,"The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla (""little tentacles""), although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle. What are colloblasts?","Question: What are colloblasts?

To answer this question, we need to carefully read the passage and identify the assertion made by some scholars about Luther's beliefs on faith and reason.

1. The passage mentions that some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical, meaning they were in opposition to each other.
2. It quotes Luther as saying that reason is the greatest enemy that faith has, and that reason in no way contributes to faith.
3. However, the passage also notes that Luther wrote that human reason ""strives not against faith, when enlightened, but rather furthers and advances it"", which seems to contradict the initial assertion.
4. Contemporary Lutheran scholarship has found a different reality in Luther, suggesting that he sought to separate faith and reason to honor their separate spheres of knowledge.
5. The passage also mentions that Luther's work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence, which suggests that he valued reason as a tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that some scholars have asserted that Luther believed that faith and reason were antithetical, but this assertion is disputed by contemporary Lutheran scholarship, which suggests that Luther valued both faith and reason and held them in dialectical partnership.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is ""that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea"". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa ""have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires"". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world.

This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era.

To answer this question, we need to look at the passage and identify the key information related to the division of power in Kublai's government.

Step 1: The passage mentions that the Yuan bureaucracy consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures, including Chinese, Khitan, Jurchen, Mongol, and Tibetan Buddhist cultures.

Step 2: It is mentioned that the Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, Khitan Liao, and Jurchen Jin dynasties.

Step 3: The passage states that the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign, and it adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices.

Step 4: The passage specifically mentions the following institutions that were part of this tripartite division:
- The Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs
- The Privy Council (Chinese: 樞密院) to manage military affairs
- The Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection

Step 5: However, the passage also notes that there was a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance.

Based on these steps, we can conclude that Kublai's government had a tripartite division of power, with civil, military, and censorial offices, but with a significant overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions.

So, the answer is {tripartite division of power with overlap}."

How are decisions made on behave of the EU made?","Question: How are decisions made on behalf of the EU made?

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The European Commission, led by the President, sets the agenda for the EU's work.
2. The Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, meaning they propose new laws.
3. The Parliament can request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal, but the Commission can reject this suggestion.
4. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a ""written procedure"" where proposals are circulated and adopted if there are no objections.
5. The Commissioners, as a block, are subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.
6. The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon, meaning Commissioners are appointed through the appointment process, which makes them the unelected subordinates of member state governments.

Considering these steps, the final answer is: {Decisions are made through a combination of the Commission's proposal, Parliament's approval, and Council's qualified majority vote, with the President setting the agenda and Commissioners being the unelected subordinates of member state governments}."

573081c2069b531400832135,"""The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’, or simply ‘rule’"". The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is ""that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea"". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa ""have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires"". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that ""imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism"". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.
