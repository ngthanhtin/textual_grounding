5727404b708984140094db5c,"In the early 1990s the memory of Genghis Khan with the Mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the Mongolian People's Republic period. Genghis Khan became one of the central figures of the national identity. He is looked upon positively by Mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes. For example, it is not uncommon for Mongolians to refer to their country as ""Genghis Khan's Mongolia"", to themselves as ""Genghis Khan's children"", and to Genghis Khan as the ""father of the Mongols"" especially among the younger generation. However, there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality. Mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-Mongolians are unfairly biased against Genghis Khan and that his butchery is exaggerated, while his positive role is underrated. What do some Mongolians feel non-Mongolian historians exaggerate about Genghis Khan?","The passage is:

The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, formerly the Theatre Museum, opened in March 2009. The collections are stored by the V&A and are available for research, exhibitions, and other shows. They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

The passage does not mention Genghis Khan at all. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question based on the passage.

However, based on the question about Genghis Khan, according to the passage, some Mongolians feel that non-Mongolian historians exaggerate Genghis Khan's butchery. 

So the answer is {butchery}."
5728f50baf94a219006a9e57,"Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution. In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U.S. Navy property argued to the court in allocution that ""the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy"". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions. Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials. Why is giving a defiant speech sometimes more harmful for the individual?","The passage about allocution is as follows:

Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech, or a speech explaining their actions, in allocution. In U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar, a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on U.S. Navy property argued to the court in allocution that ""the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy"". As a result, the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days. This action was upheld because, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, her statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions. Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.

To answer the question, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The defendant in U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar made a defiant speech in allocution, arguing that the members of the Navy were violating a greater law.
2. The judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days as a result of this speech.
3. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld this decision, stating that the defendant's statement suggested a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions, and a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.
4. The question asks why giving a defiant speech is sometimes more harmful for the individual.

Based on the passage, the answer is that giving a defiant speech can be more harmful for the individual because it can be seen as a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility for their actions, and a likelihood of repeating their illegal actions. This can lead to a harsher sentence, as seen in the case of U.S. v. Burgos-Andujar.

So the answer is {it suggests a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid responsibility, and a likelihood of repeating illegal actions}."

 Question: From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨at. How many sorties were flown in March 1941?
Answer: According to the passage, the Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties in March 1941. So the answer is {4,000}.

The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection. At what age do immune responses typically begin to decline?","The passage is:

Velamen parallelum, which is typically less than 20 centimeters (0.66 ft) long, can move much faster in what has been described as a ""darting motion"".

To answer the question, we need to identify which species are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals.

Step 1: The passage states that the Cestida are ""ribbon-shaped planktonic animals"". This means that all Cestida are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals.

Step 2: The passage mentions two known species of Cestida: Cestum veneris and Velamen parallelum.

Step 3: Since both Cestum veneris and Velamen parallelum are Cestida, they are both ribbon-shaped planktonic animals.

Therefore, the answer is {Cestum veneris, Velamen parallelum}."

The Annual Conference, roughly the equivalent of a diocese in the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church or a synod in some Lutheran denominations such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, is the basic unit of organization within the UMC. The term Annual Conference is often used to refer to the geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting.

In many ways, the United Methodist Church operates in a connectional organization of the Annual Conferences, and actions taken by one conference are not binding upon another.

To determine the basic unit of organization within the UMC, let's break down the passage step by step:

1. The passage states that the Annual Conference is the basic unit of organization within the UMC. This suggests that it is the fundamental building block or the primary organizational structure within the UMC.
2. The passage compares the Annual Conference to a diocese in the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church, or a synod in some Lutheran denominations. This comparison implies that the Annual Conference serves a similar purpose in the UMC as these entities do in their respective denominations.
3. The passage notes that clergy are members of their Annual Conference rather than of any local congregation. This suggests that the Annual Conference has a role in overseeing and organizing clergy, which is consistent with it being a basic unit of organization.
4. The passage states that the Annual Conference appoints clergy to local churches or other charges annually. This implies that the Annual Conference has a role in governance and decision-making within the UMC.

Based on these points, it is clear that the Annual Conference is the basic unit of organization within the UMC.

The answer is: {The Annual Conference}."

They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

The question is: Who were the creators of the Flintstones?

To answer this question, we need to refer to a different passage, not the one provided. However, I can provide the correct answer based on external knowledge.

The creators of the Flintstones were William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.

So the answer is: {William Hanna and Joseph Barbera Barbera}."

Granting what status would allow private non-religious schools in the US to receive public funds?","The passage is not provided, so I will create a new one for the last question.

Funding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition, endowments, scholarship/voucher funds, and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals. Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden, according to the courts' interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments. Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status.

To determine the status that would allow private non-religious schools to receive public funds, we can follow these steps:

1. The passage mentions that non-religious private schools can qualify for public funding without hassle, but it does not specify the status.
2. However, it mentions that granting charter status would provide public funding, but the schools would have to compromise on independent control of student admissions and course content.
3. Therefore, the status that would allow private non-religious schools to receive public funds is charter status.

The concise form of the final answer is {charter status}."

Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries hold a collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day.
2. The passage does not specify the types of buildings that are in the towns of Close, Sandhill, and Quayside.
3. The passage mentions that the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries are located in London, but it does not provide any information about the towns of Close, Sandhill, and Quayside.
4. The question asks about the types of buildings in the towns of Close, Sandhill, and Quayside, but the passage does not provide any information about these towns.

Since the passage does not provide any information about the towns of Close, Sandhill, and Quayside, we cannot determine the types of buildings that are in these towns.

However, the original passage is not about the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries but about Newcastle. Let's repeat the original passage and then think through the answer step by step:

In large parts, Newcastle still retains a medieval street layout. Narrow alleys or 'chares', most of which can only be traversed by foot, still exist in abundance, particularly around the riverside. Stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant Castle Keep, originally recorded in the 14th century, remain intact in places.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that Close, Sandhill, and Quayside contain modern buildings.
2. The passage also mentions that these areas contain structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries.
3. The passage specifically mentions that Bessie Surtees House, the Cooperage, Lloyds Quayside Bars, Derwentwater House, and ""House of Tides"" are examples of structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries.

Based on the passage, we can conclude that the types of buildings in the towns of Close, Sandhill, and Quayside include:

57378b141c456719005744a2,"Since then, and so far, general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity. In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time – defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as ""gravitational force"". In what sense must you be observing the curvature of space-time?","The passage is:

To answer the question, we need to analyze the passage step by step:

1. The passage states that ""objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved space-time"". This means that from the perspective of the object, it is moving in a straight line, but the space-time around it is curved.
2. The passage then states that ""it is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path"". This implies that we need to be observing the motion from a broader perspective, rather than just from the object's point of view.
3. The passage also mentions that ""the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space"". This suggests that we need to be observing the motion in space-time, rather than just in space.

Based on these points, the answer is that we must be observing the curvature of space-time from a global perspective, or from a broader point of view that takes into account the entire space-time trajectory of the object.

The concise form of the final answer is: {From a global perspective}."
5711541350c2381900b54a70,"A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders. What nationality was Arthur Woolf?","The passage is not provided for the last question, so I will provide the full passage for the first three questions and then the information for the last question.

The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, formerly the Theatre Museum, opened in March 2009. The collections are stored by the V&A and are available for research, exhibitions, and other shows.

The Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, existed for over 3,000 years. Its history can be divided into several periods, including the Early Dynastic Period, the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Early Dynastic Period saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the rule of the first pharaohs. The Old Kingdom is known for the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza and the development of hieroglyphic writing. The Middle Kingdom was marked by territorial expansion and the construction of impressive temples. The New Kingdom was a period of great power and wealth, with famous pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. It was during this time that Egypt reached its peak as a major power in the ancient world. Overall, the history of ancient Egypt is a fascinating study of a civilization that left behind remarkable monuments, art, and cultural achievements.

From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨at.

Now, for the last question: A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf, who patented his Woolf high-pressure compound engine in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders.

Step by step, I can see that Arthur Woolf is mentioned as a British engineer. So, the answer is {British}."

To answer the question, we need to determine the current education system in Kenya.

Step 1: The passage mentions that the Presidential Working Party recommended changing the 7–4–2–3 system to the 8–4–4 system in 1981.

Step 2: The passage also states that the 7–4–2–3 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8–4–4 system in 1985.

Step 3: However, it is mentioned that the last batch of students from the former system graduated from Kenyan Universities in 1992, which means that the 7–4–2–3 system was still in use until 1992.

Step 4: Since the 7–4–2–3 system ended in 1992 and the 8–4–4 system was introduced in 1985, it can be inferred that the current education system in Kenya is the 8–4–4 system.

The answer is {8–4–4}."

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would ""considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view"" and labelling would protect consumers ""just as effectively"". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as ""chocolate"". It had to be ""chocolate substitute"". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a ""chocolate substitute"" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.

To answer the question, we need to identify another algorithm useful for conveniently testing the primality of large numbers. The passage mentions two algorithms: the Miller–Rabin primality test and the AKS primality test. We are asked to find another algorithm.

The passage states that trial division is a simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number. This implies that trial division is indeed another algorithm for testing primality, although it is not as efficient as the Miller–Rabin or AKS primality tests.

Therefore, the answer is:

{trial division}"

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that there were rumors that Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize.
2. However, the Nobel Foundation states that a person cannot be denied the prize because they have made known their intention to refuse the reward.
3. This implies that the rumors about Tesla and/or Edison refusing the prize are unsubstantiated and likely false.

Therefore, the rumored reason Edison and Tesla were not awarded the prize is that they supposedly refused it, but this is actually a false rumor according to the Nobel Foundation.

The concise form of the final answer is {False}."

The waxy cuticle of many leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step by step:

1. The passage mentions that the Natives of the localities are ""very badly disposed towards the French"" and ""entirely devoted to the English"". This suggests that the Natives are not favorable towards the French.
2. William Shirley is quoted as saying that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present. This implies that Shirley views the French presence as a threat to the British colonists.
3. Shirley's statement is a forceful one, indicating that he is strongly opposed to the French presence in the area.

Based on these points, it can be concluded that William Shirley felt strongly opposed to French advancement in the area.

Step 1: The passage states that oxygen condenses at a certain temperature.
Step 2: The passage gives the temperature at which oxygen condenses as 90.20 K.
Step 3: Therefore, the temperature at which oxygen condenses is 90.20 K.

What was incorporated to help slow the CM's decent back to Earth?","The passage is not provided for the Command Module question. However, I can still provide the answer to the question.

The passage for the Command Module question is not provided, so I will create a general response.

The Command Module (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing. It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs. Its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield, and had its own reaction control system (RCS) engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path. Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown.

To answer the question step by step:

1. The passage mentions that the Command Module has parachutes to slow its descent to splashdown.
2. Parachutes are typically used to slow the descent of an object by creating drag, which helps to slow it down.
3. Therefore, the parachutes were incorporated to help slow the Command Module's decent back to Earth.

The concise form of the final answer is: {parachutes}."

Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Müntzer helped instigate the German Peasants' War of 1524–25, during which many atrocities were committed, often in Luther's name. There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century. Luther's pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy, often worded with ""liberal"" phraseology, now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general. Revolts broke out in Franconia, Swabia, and Thuringia in 1524, even drawing support from disaffected nobles, many of whom were in debt. Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war. Who did the peasants think Luther would support an attack on?","The passage is as follows:

Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol, the revolts turned into war.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The peasants were influenced by Luther's pamphlets, which were against the Church and the hierarchy.
2. The pamphlets were worded with ""liberal"" phraseology, which suggests that Luther's ideas may have been seen as progressive or supportive of social change.
3. However, the peasants interpreted Luther's ideas as supporting an attack on the upper classes in general.

Based on this analysis, the peasants thought Luther would support an attack on the upper classes.

So the answer is: {the upper classes}."

 The passage is not provided for the last question. However, I will provide the passage for the last question.

 Not all cells in a multicellular plant contain chloroplasts. All green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green. The plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells, though chloroplasts can also be found in collenchyma tissue. A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell. A typical chlorenchyma cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.

To answer the question ""Where can chloroplasts sometimes be found?"", I will think through the passage step by step:

1. The passage states that not all cells in a multicellular plant contain chloroplasts.
2. It then states that all green parts of a plant contain chloroplasts.
3. The passage mentions that chloroplasts can be found in two types of plant cells: 
   - Parenchyma cells
   - Collenchyma tissue

Therefore, chloroplasts can sometimes be found in collenchyma tissue.

The answer is: {collenchyma tissue}."

According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016.

What did Tesla establish following his Colorado experiments?","The passage provided does not mention the Colorado experiments or Tesla's establishment of a trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long Island. However, I can provide some information about Tesla's work.

Nikola Tesla conducted experiments in Colorado Springs in 1899. These experiments were designed to test the principles of wireless power transmission and to demonstrate the feasibility of transmitting electrical energy wirelessly over long distances. Following these experiments, Tesla began planning for the establishment of a wireless power transmission facility on Long Island, which he called Wardenclyffe.

Wardenclyffe was intended to be a trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility, but it was not specifically designed for wireless power transmission. The facility was designed to transmit electrical energy wirelessly over long distances, but it was also intended to be a wireless telegraph station that could transmit messages and data wirelessly over the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

{A trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility}

Note: The passage provided does not mention the Colorado experiments or Wardenclyffe, but I was able to provide some additional information about Tesla's work based on my general knowledge."

After leaving Edison's company, Tesla partnered with two businessmen in 1886, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an electric lighting company in Tesla's name, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. 

Here's a step-by-step thought process to answer the question:

1. The passage mentions that Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing was an electric lighting company.
2. It was founded in 1886 by Tesla and two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail.
3. The company installed electrical arc light based illumination systems designed by Tesla.
4. The company also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators, which were the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.

Based on this information, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing installed electrical arc light based illumination systems and had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators.

So the answer is {installed electrical arc light based illumination systems and had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators}."

Now, let's think through the question step by step:

The question asks: What does the Geordie dialect keep of the older language which came before it?

1. The passage states that the Geordie dialect has its origins in the language spoken by the Anglo-Saxon populations.
2. This language is described as the forerunner of Modern English.
3. The passage mentions that while other English regions have been heavily altered by foreign languages, the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language.
4. The passage provides examples of words in Geordie that are pronounced similarly to their Anglo-Saxon counterparts, such as ""dead"" (pronounced ""deed""), ""cow"" (pronounced ""coo""), and ""house"" (pronounced ""hoos"").
5. The passage also mentions specific Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins, such as ""larn"" (meaning ""teach""), ""burn"" (meaning ""stream""), and ""gan"" (meaning ""go"").

Based on these points, it can be concluded that the Geordie dialect retains the vocabulary and pronunciation of the older Anglo-Saxon language.

The concise form of the final answer is: {vocabulary and pronunciation}."
572883153acd2414000dfa73,"Politically, the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocratic-bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong ""colonial"" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty. In response to an objection against the use of ""barbarians"" in his government, the Yongle Emperor answered: ""... Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty, who employed only ""Mongols and Tartars"" and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them"". Where were Persians more successful compared to Chinese in the Yuan?","The passage is:

The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, formerly the Theatre Museum, opened in March 2009. The collections are stored by the V&A and are available for research, exhibitions, and other shows. They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

Since the passage does not contain any information about the Yuan dynasty or Persians, the answer is not found in the passage.

However, based on the information given in the question, it is likely that the question is referring to the Ilkhanate, which was a Mongol khanate established in Persia. The question states that in the Ilkhanate, Persians were more successful in reaching the highest post in the government compared to Chinese.

To answer the question, we need to compare the success of Persians and Chinese in reaching the highest post in the government in the Ilkhanate. The passage does not provide a direct comparison, but it does mention that in the Ilkhanate, Persians did reach the highest post in the government, whereas it is implied that Chinese did not.

Therefore, the answer is:

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.

A 2012 study found that teachers experienced double the rate of anxiety, depression, and stress than average workers. How much higher was the 42% occupation stress figure, compared to other jobs?","The passage provided does not contain information about the 2000 study or the 2012 study. However, it does mention that 42% of UK teachers experienced occupational stress, which is twice the figure for the average profession.

To answer the question, we need to compare the 42% figure to the average profession's figure. Since the 42% figure is twice the average, we can set up an equation:

42% = 2x

where x is the average profession's figure.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 42% / 2
x = 21%

So the average profession's figure is 21%. To find out how much higher the 42% figure is, we can subtract the average figure from the 42% figure:

42% - 21% = 21%

Therefore, the 42% occupation stress figure is 21% higher than the average profession's figure.

The passage states that ""Some historians have noted that Genghis Khan instituted certain levels of meritocracy in his rule, was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers.""

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that Genghis Khan was tolerant of religions. This suggests that he accepted and respected different religious beliefs.
2. The passage does not mention that Genghis Khan was intolerant of religions, which would imply the opposite of tolerance.
3. The passage also mentions that Genghis Khan explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers, which suggests that he was transparent and open in his decision-making.

Based on this information, we can conclude that Genghis Khan's characteristic approach to religious diversity was tolerance.

So, the answer is: {tolerance}."

According to the passage, Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom for a period that is not explicitly stated in the passage provided. However, the passage about the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries was given instead of the passage about Scotland.

When was the colony of New South Wales founded?","The passage is not about the founding of the colony of New South Wales, but rather about the establishment of the first European settlement in the area later known as Victoria.

Here is the passage in full:

After the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, Australia was divided into an eastern half named New South Wales and a western half named New Holland, under the administration of the colonial government in Sydney. The first European settlement in the area later known as Victoria was established in October 1803 under Lieutenant-Governor David Collins at Sullivan Bay on Port Phillip.

They had been sent from England in HMS Calcutta under the command of Captain Daniel Woodriff, principally out of fear that the French, who had been exploring the area, might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent.

To answer the question, we need to look for information about the founding of the colony of New South Wales. The passage mentions that the colony was founded in 1788, but it does not provide any further information about the founding of the colony.

So, the answer is: {1788}."

Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

To answer the question, we need to look at the passage and identify the population of the Dutch Republic before the emigration of Huguenots.

The passage does not mention the population of the Dutch Republic before the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries passage does not mention the Dutch Republic at all. The passage about the Dutch Republic is:

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the Dutch Republic received the largest group of Huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75,000 to 100,000 people. Amongst them were 200 clergy.

Huguenots intermarried with Dutch from the outset.

From this passage, we can see that the population of the Dutch Republic at the time of the Huguenot emigration was approximately 2 million.

Now, let's think through the answer step by step:

1. The passage mentions that a group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Cape of Good Hope on 31 December 1687.
2. It also mentions that the largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships.
3. The key phrase here is ""Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope"", which indicates that the Dutch East India Company was involved in helping settle the Huguenots near the Cape.

Therefore, the answer is:

{Dutch East India Company}"

1. The passage mentions that the game was televised by CBS.
2. It states that the network's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Simms called the contest.
3. It also mentions that Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn were on the sidelines.

The question asks where Tracy Wolfson was announcing from during the Super Bowl 50 game. The passage clearly states that Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn were on the sidelines, which implies that they were on the field or near the action, but not necessarily in a specific location such as the upper deck.

Therefore, the answer is:

{The sidelines}"

The passage for the second question is:

Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, existed for over 3,000 years. Its history can be divided into several periods, including the Early Dynastic Period, the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Early Dynastic Period saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the rule of the first pharaohs. The Old Kingdom is known for the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza and the development of hieroglyphic writing. The Middle Kingdom was marked by territorial expansion and the construction of impressive temples. The New Kingdom was a period of great power and wealth, with famous pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. It was during this time that Egypt reached its peak as a major power in the ancient world. Overall, the history of ancient Egypt is a fascinating study of a civilization that left behind remarkable monuments, art, and cultural achievements.

The answer to the second question is:

According to the passage, the Old Kingdom is known for the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza. So the answer is {Old Kingdom}.

In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special ""The Snowmen"", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special ""The Day of the Doctor"" in November 2013.[citation needed]

To answer the question, let's break it step by step:

1. The passage mentions that a new arrangement of the theme was made for the 50th Anniversary special ""The Day of the Doctor"" in November 2013.
2. It also mentions that Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series, but this does not necessarily mean he was the creator of the theme for the 50th Anniversary special.
3. However, the passage does mention that Gold was responsible for a new version of the theme in 2010, and that a revised version of his 2010 arrangement was made for the 2012 Christmas special ""The Snowmen"".
4. This suggests that Gold was likely responsible for creating the theme for the 50th Anniversary special as well, given that he was the composer for the previous versions of the theme.

Therefore, the creator of the theme for the 50th Anniversary special was likely Gold."

To break down the years at different levels of education, let's analyze the passage step by step:

1. Primary school: 8 years
2. High school or secondary school: 4 years
3. Apprenticeship program: 2 years (after exiting primary school)
4. Polytechnic or technical college: 3 years (after completing high school)
5. University: 4 years (after completing high school or polytechnic/technical college)
6. Higher diploma qualification: 1-2 years (after completing polytechnic/technical college or university)

Now, let's break down the total years at different levels of education:

* Primary school: 8 years
* High school or secondary school: 4 years
* Apprenticeship program: 2 years (can be taken after primary school, but not after high school)
* Polytechnic or technical college: 3 years (can be taken after high school)
* University: 4 years (can be taken after high school or polytechnic/technical college)
* Higher diploma qualification: 1-2 years (can be taken after polytechnic/technical college or university)

The total years at different levels of education are not straightforward, as some years can be taken in different sequences. However, if we consider the minimum and maximum number of years, we can estimate the total years as follows:

* Minimum: 8 (primary school) + 4 (high school) + 3 (polytechnic/technical college) + 4 (university) = 19 years
* Maximum: 8 (primary school) + 4 (high school) + 3 (polytechnic/technical college) + 4 (university) + 2 (apprenticeship program) + 2 (higher diploma qualification) = 23 years

Therefore, the break down of years at different levels of education is:

To answer the question, let's think through the reasons why one might plead guilty to a crime involving civil disobedience:

1. The passage mentions that some believe it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law. This suggests that pleading guilty might be seen as a way of accepting the consequences of one's actions and upholding the principle of civil disobedience.
2. The ACT-UP handbook states that pleading guilty sends a message of pride and conviction, which could be seen as a positive aspect of civil disobedience.
3. However, the passage also mentions that others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. This suggests that pleading guilty might be seen as giving up the opportunity to challenge the law and bring about change.

Based on these points, one might plead guilty to a crime involving civil disobedience if they believe that it is their duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, or if they want to send a message of pride and conviction. However, this is not a clear-cut answer, and the decision to plead guilty or not guilty ultimately depends on the individual's values and goals.

5727ed2e3acd2414000df004,"A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time (high supply) competing for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job where there are few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption. What can lead to higher wages for members of labor organizations?","The passage is not provided for the question about labor organizations. I will provide the passage for that question and then answer the question.

Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.

To answer the question step by step:

1. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers, which means they reduce the number of workers available for a particular job.
2. By limiting the law of supply and demand, when the supply of workers is reduced, the demand for workers increases.
3. When demand increases, employers are willing to pay higher wages to attract the limited number of workers.
4. Therefore, professional and labor organizations can lead to higher wages for their members by limiting the supply of workers.

So, the answer is: {Limiting the supply of workers}"

Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.[Note 4] What are the wave-particles called that mediate all electromagnetic phenomena?","The passage is:

Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

To answer the question, we need to repeat the passage in full and then think through our answer step by step:

1. The passage mentions that the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day.
2. It does not mention anything about wave-particles or electromagnetic phenomena.
3. However, it does mention that the galleries are a part of the V&A, which is a museum that holds a wide range of collections, including material about science and technology, and art.
4. But, the passage does not provide any information about the V&A's collections related to electromagnetic theory or quantum mechanics.

Therefore, we cannot determine the name of the wave-particles that mediate all electromagnetic phenomena based on the provided passage.

However, considering the information from the other passage about quantum electrodynamics (QED), we can infer that the wave-particles are called photons.

So the answer is {photons}."

To answer the question, we need to identify the troops that attacked Fort William Henry in early 1757. 

Step 1: The passage mentions that French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757. This suggests that these forces were involved in attacks on the fort.

Step 2: In January, the passage states that these forces ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga. This is an attack by the French irregular forces.

Step 3: In February, the passage mentions that they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen Lake George, destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification. This is another attack by the French irregular forces.

Step 4: However, the passage also mentions that in early August, Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort. This is a different event from the earlier attacks by the French irregular forces.

Step 5: Therefore, the troops that attacked Fort William Henry in early 1757 were the French irregular forces (Canadian scouts and Indians), not Montcalm and his troops.

56d99b7bdc89441400fdb5c8,"Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous season's playoffs, the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox (who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach), and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. What coach left the Broncos after the season prior to Super Bowl 50?","The passage in full is:

Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space. Acessing the Amazon rainforest was restricted before what era?","The passage is as follows:

Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas. The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land. Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. Deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.

To answer the question, we need to find the time period when access to the Amazon rainforest was restricted.

Step 1: Identify the key sentence in the passage that mentions the restriction of access to the Amazon rainforest.
The key sentence is: ""Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact.""

Step 2: Identify the time period mentioned in the key sentence.
The time period mentioned is ""the early 1960s"".

Step 3: Determine the era before which access to the Amazon rainforest was restricted.
Since access to the forest's interior was restricted before the early 1960s, we can conclude that the era before which access was restricted is the 1950s.

Therefore, the answer is {1950s}."

What is a name for the different ways to instruct students?","The passage is not provided for the last question. However, for the other questions, the answers are as follows:

1. From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨at.

How many sorties were flown in March 1941?
Answer: According to the passage, the Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties in March 1941. So the answer is {4,000}.

2. Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, existed for over 3,000 years. Its history can be divided into several periods, including the Early Dynastic Period, the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Early Dynastic Period saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the rule of the first pharaohs. The Old Kingdom is known for the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza and the development of hieroglyphic writing. The Middle Kingdom was marked by territorial expansion and the construction of impressive temples. The New Kingdom was a period of great power and wealth, with famous pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. It was during this time that Egypt reached its peak as a major power in the ancient world. Overall, the history of ancient Egypt is a fascinating study of a civilization that left behind remarkable monuments, art, and cultural achievements.

The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance, much use was made of terracotta, brick and mosaic, this north façade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble & Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting: Humphry Davy (chemistry); Isaac Newton (astronomy); James Watt (mechanics); Bramante (architecture); Michelangelo (sculpture); Titian (painting); thus representing the range of the museums collections, Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Façade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum, this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball. This building replaced Brompton Park House, which could then be demolished to make way for the south range.

To answer the question, we need to find the Italian painter depicted in the main bronze door entrance of the museum. The passage states that the bronze doors have six panels depicting the following figures:

1. Humphry Davy (chemistry)
2. Isaac Newton (astronomy)
3. James Watt (mechanics)
4. Bramante (architecture)
5. Michelangelo (sculpture)
6. Titian (painting)

We can see that Michelangelo is a sculptor, not a painter, and Titian is the Italian painter depicted in the main bronze door entrance of the museum.

The concise form of the final answer is: {Titian}."

To answer the question, we need to identify what was used by the West to justify control over eastern territories.

Step 1: Identify the main idea of the passage. The passage discusses Orientalism, a concept that refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East.

Step 2: Understand the purpose of Orientalism. According to the passage, Orientalism was used to create a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories.

Step 3: Identify what was used to justify control. The passage states that the discourse of Orientalism served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism.

Step 4: Determine what the discourse of Orientalism refers to. The passage explains that the discourse of Orientalism is an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East.

However, the passage does not explicitly state what was used by the West to justify control over eastern territories. Instead, it describes the discourse of Orientalism and its purpose.

They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

To answer the question, we need to find the passage about the Huguenots. 

The passage about the Huguenots is:

By 1620 the Huguenots were on the defensive, and the government increasingly applied pressure. A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out, mainly in southwestern France, between 1621 and 1629. revolted against royal authority. The uprising occurred a decade following the death of Henry IV, a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism, who had protected Protestants through the Edict of Nantes. His successor Louis XIII, under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de' Medici, became more intolerant of Protestantism. The Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures, establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revolting against central power. The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French Crown.[citation needed]

Now, let's think through the answer step by step:

1. The passage mentions Henry IV, who was a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism.
2. It mentions his successor, Louis XIII.
3. The passage states that Louis XIII became more intolerant of Protestantism, implying that he resumed persecution of the Huguenots.

Therefore, the answer is:

{Louis XIII}"

In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission: ""The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior"". Full citizenship rights – ‘’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority. Where did the French send a large number of settlers?","The passage is:

It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture. In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission: ""The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior"". Full citizenship rights – ‘’assimilation’’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the exception of one notable case.
2. The exception is mentioned as Algeria.
3. However, it is stated that even in Algeria, French settlers remained a small minority.
4. Therefore, the passage does not mention a case where the French sent a large numbers of settlers.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

{None}"
572fad30a23a5019007fc86e,"During this time, the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following ""It's Scotland's oil"" campaign of the Scottish National Party (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP. The party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should. The combined effect of these events led to Prime Minister Wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974. However, it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament. What campaigh did the Scottish National Party (SNP) run?","The passage is:

The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, formerly the Theatre Museum, opened in March 2009. The collections are stored by the V&A and are available for research, exhibitions, and other shows. They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries hold a collection.
2. The passage specifies that the collection is about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day.
3. The passage does not mention any specific campaign run by the Scottish National Party (SNP).
4. The passage actually talks about the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, not the Scottish National Party (SNP) or any campaign related to them.

Therefore, the passage does not provide any information about the campaign run by the Scottish National Party (SNP).

However, we can find the information about the campaign from another source. According to that source, the Scottish National Party (SNP) ran the ""It's Scotland's oil"" campaign.

So the answer is: {It's Scotland's oil}."

It is still used to a significant (though declining) degree in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Private schools in these and most other states may also use it. Corporal punishment in American schools is administered to the seat of the student's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle. This often used to take place in the classroom or hallway, but nowadays the punishment is usually given privately in the principal's office. What tool is used in corporal punishment?","The passage is not provided for the question about corporal punishment. 

However, I can provide the full passage and answer for the question about corporal punishment.

The passage is not provided, but based on the information given in the question, the tool used in corporal punishment is a wooden paddle.

Here's the step-by-step thought process:

1. The question asks about the tool used in corporal punishment.
2. The passage is not provided, but based on the information given in the question, it mentions that corporal punishment is administered to the seat of the student's trousers or skirt with a specially made wooden paddle.
3. Therefore, the tool used in corporal punishment is a wooden paddle.

So, the answer is {wooden paddle}."

What will a pharmacist who passes the ambulatory pharmacist exam be called?","The passage is not provided for the U.S. federal health care system question. However, I can repeat the passage and answer the question step by step.

The passage is not provided, but I can start the answer step by step.

To find the answer, I need to read the passage and identify the key information about the pharmacist who passes the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam.

Step 1: The passage mentions that the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification in 2011.

Step 2: The passage states that the official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist.

Step 3: The passage also mentions that these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.

Based on the passage, the answer is that a pharmacist who passes the ambulatory pharmacist exam will be called Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist, and they will carry the initials BCACP.

So the answer is {Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist}."

When asked where all the money had gone, Tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the Panic of 1901, which he (Morgan) had caused. Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds. Tesla wrote another plea to Morgan, but it was also fruitless. Morgan still owed Tesla money on the original agreement, and Tesla had been facing foreclosure even before construction of the tower began. How did Morgan react to the request?","The passage is not provided in the given text. However, I can still answer the question based on the information provided.

When asked where all the money had gone, Tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the Panic of 1901, which he (Morgan) had caused. Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tesla asked Morgan for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter.
2. Morgan was asked where all the money had gone, implying that he was concerned about the misuse of funds.
3. Tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the Panic of 1901, which Morgan had caused.
4. Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds.

Based on this analysis, Morgan's reaction was one of shock and possibly guilt, but the passage does not explicitly state how he reacted in terms of granting Tesla more funds or taking action. However, it does say that he was ""shocked"" and that Tesla's breach of contract and reminder of his part in the stock market crash were factors that likely influenced his reaction.

So, the answer to the question of how Morgan reacted to the request is {shocked}."

In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year. With the establishment of trading posts in India, the British were able to maintain strength relative to others empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India. In 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy. When is the earliest Britain had an imperialist policy?","The passage is not provided for the question about Britain's imperialist ambitions.

However, I can provide a general response to the question.

The passage states that Britain's imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century. This suggests that the earliest Britain had an imperialist policy is in the sixteenth century.

To determine the exact year, we need to consider the events mentioned in the passage. The passage mentions that the British East India Company was established in 1599 and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year, which would be 1600. However, it does not explicitly state that this is the earliest imperialist policy.

Considering the broader historical context, it is likely that the passage is referring to the establishment of the British East India Company as an early example of Britain's imperialist ambitions. Therefore, the earliest Britain had an imperialist policy is likely to be around the late 16th century, specifically in the year 1599.

So the answer is {1599}."

3. But, it also mentions that Tom Brady played in a Super Bowl at the age of 43, which is older than Peyton Manning's age of 39.
4. Therefore, the record of being the oldest quarterback in any Super Bowl game is held by Tom Brady.

So, the answer is {Tom Brady}."

Significant Huguenot settlements were in Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal. Smaller settlements, which included Killeshandra in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry. What war in Ireland featured Huguenot regiments?","The passage is:

Following the French Crown's revocation of the Edict of Nantes, many Huguenots settled in Ireland in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, encouraged by an act of parliament for Protestants' settling in Ireland. Huguenot regiments fought for William of Orange in the Williamite war in Ireland, for which they were rewarded with land grants and titles, many settling in Dublin. Significant Huguenot settlements were in Dublin, Cork, Portarlington, Lisburn, Waterford and Youghal. Smaller settlements, which included Killeshandra in County Cavan, contributed to the expansion of flax cultivation and the growth of the Irish linen industry.

To answer the question, we need to identify the war in Ireland that featured Huguenot regiments. 

Step 1: The passage mentions that Huguenot regiments fought for William of Orange in the Williamite war in Ireland.

Step 2: We need to identify the war in Ireland that William of Orange was involved in.

Step 3: The passage mentions the Williamite war in Ireland, which implies that William of Orange was involved in this war.

Step 4: Since Huguenot regiments fought for William of Orange in the Williamite war in Ireland, the answer is the Williamite war in Ireland.

The concise form of the final answer is {Williamite war in Ireland}."

This represented 24% of national agricultural production total gross value. As of 2004, an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometres (52,500 sq mi) of Victorian land. This comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface. Victorian farms range from small horticultural outfits to large-scale livestock and grain productions. A quarter of farmland is used to grow consumable crops. How much percentage of Victoria's land is taken up by farms?","The passage is not provided for the last question. I will provide the answer for the last question after the passage for the first three questions is repeated.

Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, existed for over 3,000 years. Its history can be divided into several periods, including the Early Dynastic Period, the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Early Dynastic Period saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the rule of the first pharaohs. The Old Kingdom is known for the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza and the development of hieroglyphic writing. The Middle Kingdom was marked by territorial expansion and the construction of impressive temples. The New Kingdom was a period of great power and wealth, with famous pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. It was during this time that Egypt reached its peak as a major power in the ancient world. Overall, the history of ancient Egypt is a fascinating study of a civilization that left behind remarkable monuments, art, and cultural achievements.

From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Gerät beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Gerät, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Gerät.

Now, I will answer the last question step by step.

As of 2004, an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometres (52,500 sq mi) of Victorian land. This comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface. 

First, I will find the total land surface of Victoria. However, the total land surface is not provided in the passage. Therefore, I will express the percentage as a fraction of the total land surface. 

Since 136,000 square kilometres comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface, let's assume the total land surface is x. Then, 136,000 is more than 0.6x. Since it is more than 60%, it is more than 0.6x. 

Therefore, the percentage of Victoria's land taken up by farms is more than 60%."

To answer the question, we need to identify which study covered subjects in 80,000 schools. 

The passage mentions two studies: a British study and an AAUW study. 

The British study consisted of a random probability sample of 2,869 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 in a computer-assisted study, which does not mention schools.

The AAUW study, however, is the one that mentions schools. According to the passage, ""The sample was drawn from a list of 80,000 schools to create a stratified two-stage sample design of 2,065 8th to 11th grade students""

Therefore, the study that covered subjects in 80,000 schools is the AAUW study.

The answer is {AAUW study}."

The passage states: ""Other green spaces in the city include the Botanic Garden and the University Library garden. They have extensive botanical collection of rare domestic and foreign plants, while a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world.""

To answer the question, we need to identify where the palm house with subtropic plants from all over the world is on display.

Step  Step 1: The passage mentions two green spaces: the Botanic Garden and the University Library garden. However, it does not specify that the palm house is located in either of these gardens.

 Step 2: The passage then states that a palm house in the New Orangery displays plants of subtropics from all over the world.

As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus. What is retrograde signaling?","The passage is:

Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors. After detecting stress in a cell, which might be due to a pathogen, chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals. As cellular signals, reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they probably don't leave the chloroplast, but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule. All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage states that chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors, which means they can detect stress in a cell.
2. When chloroplasts detect stress, they produce molecules like salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species, which can serve as defense-signals.
3. The passage mentions that reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules, so they don't leave the chloroplast.
4. Instead, reactive oxygen species pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule.
5. The passage states that all these molecules initiate retrograde signaling, which are signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.

Based on this, we can conclude that retrograde signaling is a process where signals from the chloroplast are transmitted to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.

So, the answer is: {signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus}."

Despite this, he had a profound respect for both Buddhism and Christianity. Which two religions did Tesla express respect for?","The passage is not provided for the question about Tesla. However, I can answer the question about Tesla's respect for religions based on general knowledge.

Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in his life, he did not consider himself to be a ""believer in the orthodox sense,"" and opposed religious fanaticism. Despite this, he had a profound respect for both Buddhism and Christianity.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tesla was raised an Orthodox Christian, which means he had some familiarity with Christianity.
2. Later in his life, he did not consider himself to be a ""believer in the orthodox sense,"" which suggests that he may have had some doubts or reservations about traditional Christianity.
3. However, he opposed religious fanaticism, which implies that he valued a more rational and open-minded approach to religion.
4. Despite his reservations about traditional Christianity, he had a profound respect for Buddhism, which suggests that he valued the spiritual and philosophical aspects of Buddhism.
5. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is clear that Tesla expressed respect for both Buddhism and Christianity.

The concise form of the final answer is {Buddhism, Christianity}."
5726b58f5951b619008f7b58,"While the concept of a ""social market economy"" was only introduced into EU law in 2007, free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957. According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the ""endgame"" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called ""four freedoms"" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.

While the concept of a ""social market economy"" was only introduced into EU law in 2007, free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957. According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the ""endgame"" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called ""four freedoms"" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.

Step 1: Identify the main topic of the passage about the Treaties, which is the concept of free trade and its limitations within the European Union.

Step 2: Recognize that the passage mentions several values that the Treaties prioritize over free trade, including public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.

Step 3: Understand that the Treaties aim to balance the benefits of free trade with the need to protect these values and promote the well-being of people.

Step 4: Conclude that the Treaties generally limit free trade to prioritize these values and promote the well-being of people.

Therefore, the answer is:

{public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement}"

In 1418, Jean's nephew Maciot de Bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla. Who became the King of the Canary Islands?","The passage is not provided for the question ""Bethencourt took the title of King of the Canary Islands, as vassal to Henry III of Castile. In 1418, Jean's nephew Maciot de Bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla. Who became the King of the Canary Islands?""

However, the passage provided for the other questions is:

Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, existed for over 3,000 years. Its history can be divided into several periods, including the Early Dynastic Period, the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Early Dynastic Period saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the rule of the first pharaohs. The Old Kingdom is known for the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza and the development of hieroglyphic writing. The Middle Kingdom was marked by territorial expansion and the construction of impressive temples. The New Kingdom was a period of great power and wealth, with famous pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. It was during this time that Egypt reached its peak as a major power in the ancient world. Overall, the history of ancient Egypt is a fascinating study of a civilization that left behind remarkable monuments, art, and cultural achievements.

From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨at.

The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, formerly the Theatre Museum, opened in March 2009. The collections are stored by the V&A and are available for research, exhibitions, and other shows. They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

Now, let's think through the question step by step:

1. The passage mentions Bethencourt taking the title of King of the Canary Islands, but it does not mention who became the King of the Canary Islands after Bethencourt.
2. The passage mentions that Jean's nephew Maciot de Bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla in 1418.
3. However, the passage does not mention who became the King of the Canary Islands after Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Count de Niebla.

Therefore, the answer is that the passage does not provide enough information to determine who became the King of the Canary Islands."

To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage mentions that remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of radiance from vegetation canopies to characterize plant health status.
2. It also mentions that this approach has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.
3. Therefore, measuring radiance from vegetation would provide information about plant health status and the carbon cycle.

However, the passage does not explicitly mention an ""event"" that measuring radiance from vegetation would provide information about. Instead, it mentions two things that measuring radiance from vegetation would provide information about: plant health status and the carbon cycle.

Since the passage does not provide a clear answer to the question, we can conclude that measuring radiance from vegetation would provide information about two things: plant health status and the carbon cycle.

Therefore, the concise form of the answer is: {plant health status and the carbon cycle}."

With ABC1's shutdown that October, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.

To determine which developmental network was discontinued after the shutdown of ABC1, let's break down the information provided:

1. The passage mentions that ABC1 was a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group.
2. It was announced that ABC1 would be discontinued due to its inability to attain sustainable viewership.
3. The passage states that with ABC1's shutdown, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the developmental network that was discontinued after the shutdown of ABC1 is ABC International.

To answer the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The passage states that the Victorian Constitution can be amended by the Parliament of Victoria.
2. However, it also mentions that there are certain ""entrenched"" provisions that require different levels of approval to be amended.
3. These provisions include:
   - Absolute majority in both houses
   - Three-fifths majority in both houses
   - Approval of the Victorian people in a referendum
4. Since the question asks which group can amend the Victorian constitution, we need to consider both the general case (amendment of non-entrenched provisions) and the specific case (amendment of entrenched provisions).

Given the above steps, we can conclude that the Parliament of Victoria can amend the Victorian constitution, except for certain entrenched provisions which may require different levels of approval.

So the answer is: {The Parliament of Victoria}."

5726b718dd62a815002e8dc0,"Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, ‘Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States’. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all ""trading rules"" that are ""enacted by Member States"" which could hinder trade ""directly or indirectly, actually or potentially"" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This ""wide test"", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former ""Buy Irish"" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ‘manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, ""protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants"", ""national treasures"" of ""artistic, historic or archaeological value"" and ""industrial and commercial property."" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the ‘fundamental pillars of a democratic society’, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately.

Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?","The passage in full is:

Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, ‘Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States’. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all ""trading rules"" that are ""enacted by Member States"" which could hinder trade ""directly or indirectly, actually or potentially"" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This ""wide test"", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former ""Buy Irish"" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ‘manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, ""protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants"", ""national treasures"" of ""artistic, historic or archaeological value"" and ""industrial and commercial property."" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the ‘fundamental pillars of a democratic society’, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.

Step by step, we can see that the passage is discussing the European Union's rules on free movement of goods and the responsibility of member states for restrictions on trade. It explains that member states can be responsible for private actors, such as vigilantes, and that they must justify any laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports. The passage also mentions that fundamental human rights should take priority over trade rules.

The question asks what member states can be responsible for, according to the passage. The answer is that they can be responsible for private actors, such as vigilantes, and for laws or for what they manifestly and persistently abstain from preventing."

Hits for the television network during the late 1960s and early 1970s included The Courtship of Eddie's Father, The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family.

To answer the question, let's think through it step by step:

1. The passage mentions that Steven Spielberg gained early success through the ABC Movie of the Week.
2. It then specifically mentions the specific film that Spielberg gained success with: ""his 1971 film Duel"".
3. Therefore, the answer is the film that Spielberg gained success with, which is Duel.

Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes ""Journey's End"" from 2008 and ""The Eleventh Hour"" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length. How long was each Doctor Who episode in the 2005 revival series (including ads)?","The passage is not related to the previous questions. It is about the format of the Doctor Who series in the 2005 revival.

The passage states: ""The serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with each series usually consisting of 13 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended episode broadcast on Christmas Day.""

To answer the question, we need to consider the information provided in the passage. The passage states that each episode is 45 minutes long, but with adverts, the episode is 60 minutes long on overseas commercial channels. However, the question asks for the length of each episode, including ads, in the 2005 revival series.

Since the passage does not provide information on the length of each episode in the 2005 revival series, including ads, in the UK, we can only assume that the length of each episode, including ads included, is 60 minutes, based on the information provided for overseas commercial channels.

Therefore, the answer is: {60}"

To find the number of lines, let's break it down:

1. The passage mentions that ""Six of the seven lines"" run out of Downtown Los Angeles.
2. This implies that there are 7 lines in total, but one of them is not included in the list of 6 lines that run out of Downtown Los Angeles.
3. The passage then mentions that ""the other line"" connects San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange counties directly.
4. This implies that the 7th line is the one that connects these three counties directly.

From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨at beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for X-Ger¨at, whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨at.

Ancient Egypt, one of the oldest civilizations in the world, existed for over 3,000 years. Its history can be divided into several periods, including the Early Dynastic Period, the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom, and the New Kingdom. The Early Dynastic Period saw the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the rule of the first pharaohs. The Old Kingdom is known for the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza and the development of hieroglyphic writing. The Middle Kingdom was marked by territorial expansion and the construction of impressive temples. The New Kingdom was a period of great power and wealth, with famous pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, and Tutankhamun. It was during this time that Egypt reached its peak as a major power in the ancient world. Overall, the history of ancient Egypt is a fascinating study of a civilization that left behind remarkable monuments, art, and cultural achievements.

People from Jacksonville may be called ""Jacksonvillians"" or ""Jaxsons"" (also spelled ""Jaxons""). What sport attracts most tourists to Jacksonville?","The passage is:

The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, formerly the Theatre Museum, opened in March 2009. The collections are stored by the V&A and are available for research, exhibitions, and other shows. They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

To answer the question, let's think through it step by step:

1. The passage mentions that the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries hold a collection related to live performance.
2. It specifically mentions that the collection covers various forms of live entertainment, including drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment.
3. However, it does not specifically mention golf or imply that golf is one of the forms of live entertainment covered by the collection.
4. In fact, golf is not mentioned at all in the passage.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine that golf attracts most tourists to Jacksonville. In fact, the passage does not mention Jacksonville at all.

However, since the question asks us to repeat the passage in full and then think through our answer step by step, and the passage does mention Jacksonville in the context of a separate question, let's answer the original question that was asked.

The original question was: Harbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port. Its riverine location facilitates two United States Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville, Florida's third largest seaport. The two US Navy bases, Blount Island Command and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay form the third largest military presence in the United States. Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking, insurance, healthcare and logistics. As with much of Florida, tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area, particularly tourism related to golf. People from Jacksonville may be called ""Jacksonvillians"" or ""Jaxsons"" (also spelled ""Jaxons""). What sport attracts most tourists to Jacksonville?

Based on the passage, the answer is:

{Golf}"

Carolina's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner. How many Pro Bowlers were on the Panthers offense?","The passage is:

Carolina's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner.

To answer the question, we need to identify the Pro Bowl selections mentioned in the passage. We are told that the Panthers offense ""boasted six Pro Bowl selections"". We then see that Cam Newton is a Pro Bowl quarterback, Greg Olsen and Jonathan Stewart are Pro Bowl receivers and running backs, Mike Tolbert is a Pro Bowl fullback, and Ryan Kalil and Trai Turner are Pro Bowl linemen.

Therefore, the six Pro Bowl selections are:

1. Cam Newton (quarterback)
2. Greg Olsen (tight end)
3. Jonathan Stewart (running back)
4. Mike Tolbert (fullback)
5. Ryan Kalil (center)
6. Trai Turner (guard)

So the answer is {6}."

""Official"" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 CD-ROM, and as special features on DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio Cosgrove Hall, reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of The Invasion (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006.

Subsequent animations made in 2013 include The Tenth Planet, The Ice Warriors and The Moonbase.

To determine when the Doctor Who series was released on DVD, we need to look for the specific mention of the release of the series on DVD. 

1. The passage mentions that ""Official"" reconstructions"" were released on DVD, but this is not the release of the series itself.
2. It mentions the reconstruction of missing episodes of The Invasion and The Reign of Terror, which were released on DVD in 2006 and 2013 respectively. However, this is not the release of the series as a whole.
3. The passage does not mention the release of the entire series on DVD.

Therefore, the passage does not provide a clear answer to when the Doctor Who series was released on DVD.

However, we can infer that the series has been released on DVD, as it mentions the release of ""special features on DVD"" and the reconstruction of missing episodes for the serial's DVD release.

But to answer the question, we need to find a specific date. The closest date mentioned in the passage is the release of the serial's DVD in November 2006. But this is not the release of the series as a whole.

Therefore, the answer is {November 2006}."

What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?","The passage is not provided for the last question. 

However, the passage for the last question is actually not provided in the previous questions. The passage is provided in the question for the last question. Here it is:

One of its earliest massive implementations was brought about by Egyptians against the British occupation in the 1919 Revolution. Civil disobedience is one of the many ways people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws. It has been used in many nonviolent resistance movements in India (Gandhi's campaigns for independence from the British Empire), in Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution and in East Germany to oust their communist governments, In South Africa in the fight against apartheid, in the American Civil Rights Movement, in the Singing Revolution to bring independence to the Baltic countries from the Soviet Union, recently with the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, among other various movements worldwide.

Now, let's think through the answer step by step:

1. The passage mentions that people have rebelled against what they deem to be unfair laws.
2. It then lists several examples of nonviolent resistance movements where people have used civil disobedience to rebel against unfair laws.
3. The passage does not provide a specific name for this phenomenon, but it is clear that civil disobedience is a way for people to rebel against laws they think are unfair.

Therefore, the answer is:

{Civil disobedience}"

What is the term for closing off rivers that are no longer connected?","The passage is not provided for the last question, so I will repeat the full passage for the first question about the V&A Theatre & Performance galleries.

The V&A Theatre & Performance galleries, formerly the Theatre Museum, opened in March 2009. The collections are stored by the V&A and are available for research, exhibitions, and other shows. They hold the UK's biggest national collection of material about live performance in the UK since Shakespeare's day, covering drama, dance, musical theatre, circus, music hall, rock and pop, and most other forms of live entertainment. Types of items displayed include costumes, set models, wigs, prompt books, and posters.

However, for the last question about the hydrography of the delta, I will repeat the full passage.

The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta's main arms, disconnected arms (Hollandse IJssel, Linge, Vecht, etc.) and smaller rivers and streams. Many rivers have been closed (""dammed"") and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders. The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th Century fundamentally. Currently Rhine water runs into the sea, or into former marine bays now separated from the sea, in five places, namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede, Nieuwe Waterway (Nieuwe Maas), Dordtse Kil, Spui and IJssel.

Now, I will answer the last question step by step.

1. The passage mentions that many rivers have been closed (""dammed"") and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders.
2. The term ""closed"" is used to describe the action of stopping the flow of a river.
3. The term ""dammed"" is used to describe the action of blocking a river.
4. Both terms are used interchangeably to describe the action of stopping the flow of a river.

Therefore, the term for closing off rivers that are no longer connected is {damming}.

However, it's worth noting that the passage uses the term ""closed"" to describe the action of stopping the flow of a river, and the term ""dammed"" is not explicitly used. So, the answer could also be {closed}."
