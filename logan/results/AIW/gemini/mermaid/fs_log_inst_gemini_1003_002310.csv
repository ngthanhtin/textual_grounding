86,"Build SQLite queries for creation and population of the table that represents: ""Alice has 4 sisters and she also has a brother. How many sisters in total does Alice's brother have?","Reformatted_Question: ""<fact1>Alice has 4 sisters</fact1> and <fact2>she also has a brother</fact2>. How many sisters in total does Alice's brother have?""
Answer_Reasoning: Including Alice, her <fact1>4 sisters</fact1> and <fact2>brother</fact2> means there are 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 siblings in the family. Since they are all siblings, Alice's brother will also have the same number of sisters as Alice, which is <fact1>4</fact1>.
Final_Answer: {4} 

Here's how you can represent this information in a SQLite database:

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE siblings (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  gender TEXT NOT NULL,
  CHECK (gender IN ('male', 'female'))
);
```

**Data Population:**

```sql
-- We don't know all the sibling names, so we'll use placeholders 
-- where needed.
INSERT INTO siblings (name, gender) VALUES 
  ('Alice', 'female'),
  ('Sister 1', 'female'),
  ('Sister 2', 'female'),
  ('Sister 3', 'female'),
  ('Sister 4', 'female'),
  ('Brother', 'male'); 
```

**Query to get the number of Alice's brother's sisters:**

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT s2.id) - 1  -- Subtract 1 to exclude Alice herself
FROM siblings s1
JOIN siblings s2 ON s1.gender = 'male' AND s2.gender = 'female' 
WHERE 
  s1.name = 'Brother';
```

**Explanation of the Query:**

1. **`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s2.id) - 1`**: This selects the count of distinct sister IDs minus 1 (to exclude Alice).
2. **`FROM siblings s1 JOIN siblings s2`**: This joins the `siblings` table with itself to find relationships between siblings.
3. **`ON s1.gender = 'male' AND s2.gender = 'female'`**: This condition ensures we are counting sisters (female) of the brother (male).
4. **`WHERE s1.name = 'Brother'`**: This specifies that we are looking for the sisters of the sibling named ""Brother"".
