How much money is John missing if <data3>he has $50</data3> and the <data1>trip costs $300</data1>?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to raise after the school's contribution and subtract the amount he already has.

1. **Calculate the school's contribution:**
   - The school covers half the cost of the trip. 
   - The total cost of the trip is <data1>$300</data1>.
   - Therefore, the school's contribution is \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).

2. **Calculate the remaining amount John needs to cover:**
   - After the school's contribution, John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost.
   - So, John needs to cover \( 300 - 150 = 150 \).

3. **Determine how much money John is missing:**
   - John currently has <data3>$50</data3>.
   - The amount he still needs is \( 150 - 50 = 100 \).

Therefore, John is missing {100} dollars."
861,<data1>Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</data1>. <data2>It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</data2>. <data3>Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</data3>. How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?,"<data1>Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</data1>. <data2>It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</data2>. <data3>Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</data3>. How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we need to analyze the information provided:

1. <data1>Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</data1>. This means Claire earns 12 badges in a year (1 badge per month x 12 months).

2. <data2>It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</data2>. Since Claire earns 1 badge per month, Amber takes 2 months to earn 1 badge. Therefore, Amber earns 6 badges in a year (12 months / 2 months per badge).

3. <data3>Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</data3>. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 36 badges in a year (3 times 12).

Now, we calculate the difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber in a year:

Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. Therefore, Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

The final answer is {30}."
82,<data1>Grace weighs 125 pounds</data1>. <data2>Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs</data2>. What are their combined weights in pounds?,"<data1>Grace weighs 125 pounds</data1>. <data2>Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs</data2>. What are their combined weights in pounds?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate Alex's weight first and then add it to Grace's weight.

1. We know from <data1> that Grace weighs 125 pounds.

2. According to <data2>, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, we calculate Alex's weight as follows:
   - First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight: 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.
   - Then, subtract 2 pounds from this amount: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

3. Now, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight to find their combined weight:
   - Grace's weight: 125 pounds
   - Alex's weight: 498 pounds
   - Combined weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

Therefore, their combined weights in pounds are {623}."

At one point, he spent <data2>5 hours each for two consecutive weeks</data2>. Another time, he spent <data3>6 hours in one week</data3>. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to consider the information given in the data tags.

1. According to <data1>, Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. This means that for the weeks not specified by <data2> and <data3>, he worked out for 4 hours.

2. <data2> states that Josh spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. Therefore, for these two weeks, he worked out a total of 5 + 5 = 10 hours.

3. <data3> indicates that Josh spent 6 hours in one week. Therefore, for this week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours:

- Total weeks = 8
- Weeks with 5 hours = 2
- Week with 6 hours = 1
- Remaining weeks with 4 hours = 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks

Calculating the total hours:

- Hours for the 5 weeks with 4 hours each: 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours
- Hours for the 2 weeks with 5 hours each: 10 hours
- Hours for the 1 week with 6 hours: 6 hours

Adding these together gives us the total number of hours:

20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is {36}."
1047,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. <data1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</data1>. <data2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</data2>. <data3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</data3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. <data1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</data1>. <data2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</data2>. <data3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</data3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the data tags.

1. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

2. According to <data1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).

3. According to <data2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

4. According to <data3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   \[
   2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
   \]

6. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   4x + x + 8 = 38
   \]
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

7. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

8. Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

9. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \).

Thus, Rory retrieved {10} tennis balls in the first set."

If there are <data3>10 total classes</data3>, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to calculate the cost per class and compare it to the $10 threshold.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: Manny signed up for <data1>Karate classes for $60</data1>.

2. **Total Number of Classes**: There are <data3>10 total classes</data3>.

3. **Cost Per Class**: If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6 per class.

4. **Threshold for Cost Per Class**: His parents will not sign him up again if the cost per class is <data2>more than $10 per class</data2>.

5. **Determine Maximum Cost Per Class**: To find out how many classes he can miss, we need to find the maximum number of classes he can attend such that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

   - Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny attends.
   - The cost per class if he attends \( x \) classes is $60 / x.
   - We need $60 / x \leq 10.

6. **Solve the Inequality**: 
   - $60 / x \leq 10
   - 60 \leq 10x
   - x \geq 6

This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at $10 or less.

7. **Calculate Classes He Can Miss**: 
   - Total classes = 10
   - Classes he must attend = 6
   - Classes he can miss = 10 - 6 = 4

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The answer is {4}."

How many slices of pizza were left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the number of slices eaten and subtract that from the total number of slices.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
There are 5 people, and <data1>each pizza had 12 slices</data1>. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
5 * 12 = 60 slices.

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends.
<data2>Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas</data2>. Since there are 3 people in this group, they each ate:
(2/3) * 12 = 8 slices per person.
So, the total number of slices eaten by this group is:
3 * 8 = 24 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends.
<data3>The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas</data3>. Since there are 2 people in this group, they each ate:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the original length of the dress, we need to consider the modifications Shania made to the dress.

1. **Understanding the final length**: The final design of the dress is <data3>140cm long</data3>.

2. **Lace trim addition**: Shania added <data2>20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim</data2>. This means that without the lace trim, the dress would be 140cm - 20cm = 120cm.

3. **Extension of the original length**: Shania extended the dress by <data1>50% of its original length</data1>. Let the original length be \( x \). The extension is \( 0.5x \).

   - We need to find the number of guests \( x \) for which the costs are equal:
     \[
     200 + 5x = 25x
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     200 = 25x - 5x
     \]
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20}

If the <data2>total number of popsicles they have together is 165</data2>, how many more popsicles does Sam have more than Betty?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty using the given ratio and total number of popsicles.

Step 1: Understand the ratio
The <data1>ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6</data1>. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.

Step 2: Set up the equation
Let the number of popsicles Betty has be 5x and the number Sam has be 6x. According to the problem, the <data2>total number of popsicles they have together is 165</data2>. Therefore, we can write the equation:
5x + 6x = 165

Step 3: Solve for x
Combine the terms:
11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11 to solve for x:
x = 165 / 11
x = 15

Step 4: Calculate the number of popsicles each has
Betty has 5x popsicles, so:
5x = 5 * 15 = 75

Sam has 6x popsicles, so:
6x = 6 * 15 = 90

Step 5: Determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty
Sam has 90 popsicles and Betty has 75 popsicles. The difference is:
90 - 75 = 15

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is {15}."

416,A herd consists of camels and dromedaries. There are <data1>180 heads</data1> and <data2>304 bumps</data2>. How many dromedaries are there if <data3>camels have two humps each</data3> and <data4>dromedaries have one hump each</data4>?,"A herd consists of camels and dromedaries. There are <data1>180 heads</data1> and <data2>304 bumps</data2>. How many dromedaries are there if <data3>camels have two humps each</data3> and <data4>dromedaries have one hump each</data4>?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dromedaries in the herd using the given information about the number of heads and bumps.

Step 1: Understand the problem
- We have a total of <data1>180 heads</data1>. This means there are 180 animals in total, as each animal has one head.
- There are <data2>304 bumps</data2> in total.
- <data3>Camels have two humps each</data3>.
- <data4>Dromedaries have one hump each</data4>.

Step 2: Set up equations
Let \( C \) be the number of camels and \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the information given:
1. The total number of animals (heads) is 180: 
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The total number of bumps is 304:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

Step 3: Solve the equations
We have two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2C + D - C - D = 124
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[
C + D = 180
\]
\[
124 + D = 180
\]
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is {56}."

532,<data1>Jame will turn 27 in 5 years</data1>. <data2>In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age</data2>. How many years separate the age of the two now?,"<data1>Jame will turn 27 in 5 years</data1>. <data2>In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age</data2>. How many years separate the age of the two now?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin and then find the difference between their ages.

Step 1: Determine Jame's current age.
<data1>Jame will turn 27 in 5 years</data1>. This means that Jame's current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Step 2: Determine the cousin's age in 8 years.
Let Jame's current age be J = 22. In 8 years, Jame will be J + 8 = 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Step 3: Use the information about the cousin's age.
<data2>In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age</data2>. This means that in 8 years, the cousin's age will be 2 * (J + 8) - 5.

Step 4: Set up the equation for the cousin's age in 8 years.
Let C be the cousin's current age. In 8 years, the cousin will be C + 8 years old. According to the problem, C + 8 = 2 * (J + 8) - 5.

Step 5: Solve for the cousin's current age.
C + 8 = 2 * (30) - 5
C + 8 = 60 - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

Step 6: Calculate the difference in their current ages.
Jame's current age is 22, and his cousin's current age is 47. The difference in their ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

Therefore, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is {25}."

141,"<data1>There are 700 bees in a hive</data1>. There are <data2>twice as many worker bees as baby bees</data2>, and there are <data3>twice as many babies as queens</data3>. How many worker bees are there?","<data1>There are 700 bees in a hive</data1>. There are <data2>twice as many worker bees as baby bees</data2>, and there are <data3>twice as many babies as queens</data3>. How many worker bees are there?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of worker bees in the hive using the given relationships between the different types of bees.

1. **Understanding the Relationships:**
   - We have three types of bees: worker bees, baby bees, and queens.
   - According to <data3>twice as many babies as queens</data3>, if we let the number of queens be Q, then the number of baby bees is 2Q.
   - According to <data2>twice as many worker bees as baby bees</data2>, the number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, which is 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

2. **Total Number of Bees:**
   - The total number of bees in the hive is given as <data1>700 bees</data1>.
   - Therefore, the sum of all types of bees is Q (queens) + 2Q (baby bees) + 4Q (worker bees) = 700.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Combine the terms: Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700.
   - This simplifies to 7Q = 700.

4. **Solving for Q:**
   - Divide both sides by 7 to find Q: Q = 700 / 7 = 100.

5. **Finding the Number of Worker Bees:**
   - Since the number of worker bees is 4Q, we calculate 4 * 100 = 400.

Therefore, the number of worker bees is {400}."

Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the relay.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.**

The well-rounded team has each of their members running their 400-meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for this team is:

4 members × <data1>55 seconds</data1> per member = 220 seconds.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.**

The less well-rounded team's first runner will run their 400-meter leg in <data2>60 seconds</data2>. Each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner, as stated in <data3>.

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Adding these times together gives the total time for the less well-rounded team:

60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

**Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two teams.**

The well-rounded team takes 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team takes 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team (the well-rounded team) wins by:

222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

The faster team will win by {2} seconds."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fish in each aquarium given the information about the snails and the relationship between the snails and fish.

1. First, identify the number of snails in each aquarium:
   - There are <data1>4 snails in one aquarium</data1>.
   - There are <data2>32 snails in another aquarium</data2>.

2. Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:
   - The difference is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

3. According to the problem, <data3>the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums</data3>.

4. Let the number of fish in each aquarium be x. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

5. Set up the equation based on the given relationship:

What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?","A car is on a road trip and <data1>drives 60 mph for 2 hours</data1>, and then <data2>30 mph for 1 hour</data2>. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled.
- For the first part of the trip, the car drives at <data1>60 mph for 2 hours</data1>. The distance covered in this part is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car drives at <data2>30 mph for 1 hour</data2>. The distance covered in this part is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- The total distance traveled is:
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken.
- The total time taken is the sum of the time for each part of the trip:
  \[
  \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
  \]

Step 3: Calculate the average speed.
- The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
  \[
  \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
  \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is {50} mph."

How many Pokemon has Stan caught?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon Stan has caught using the information provided in the data tags.

1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \( A \).

2. According to <data3>, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

3. According to <data2>, Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Alex has caught can be expressed as:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]

4. According to <data1>, together they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]

5. Substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) into the equation:
   \[
   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339
   \]

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339
   \]
   \[
   9A - 21 = 339
   \]

7. Solve for \( A \):
   \[
   9A = 360
   \]
   \[
   A = 40
   \]

8. Now that we know \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the expression for Stan:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
   \]

Therefore, Stan has caught {147} Pokemon."

How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B and then compare them.

**Step 1: Calculate Net Income for Job A**

- **Gross Income for Job A**: 
  - Job A pays <data1>$15 an hour for 2000 hours a year</data1>.
  - Gross income = 15 * 2000 = $30,000.

- **Net Income for Job A**:
  - The state has a <data2>20% total tax rate</data2>.
  - Taxes = 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * 30,000 = $6,000.
  - Net income = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Step 2: Calculate Net Income for Job B**

- **Gross Income for Job B**:
  - Job B pays <data3>$42,000 a year</data3>.

- **Net Income for Job B**:
  - The state charges <data4>$6,000 in property tax</data4>.
  - Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
  - The state has a <data5>10% tax rate on net income after property tax</data5>.
  - Taxes = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * 36,000 = $3,600.
  - Net income = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

**Step 3: Compare Net Incomes**

- Net income for Job A = $24,000.
- Net income for Job B = $32,400.

**Difference in Net Income**:
- Job B pays more than Job A.
- Difference = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A. The answer is {8400}."

There are <data2>twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense</data2>. There is <data3>half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense</data3>. How many players are on the defense?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of players on the defense using the information provided.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( x \).

According to the information given:
1. There are <data2>twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense</data2>. This means the number of players on the offense is \( 2x \).

2. There is <data3>half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense</data3>. This means the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is <data1>105 members</data1>. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ 3x + \frac{x}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

\[ 2(3x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(105) \]

\[ 6x + x = 210 \]

\[ 7x = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{210}{7} \]

\[ x = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is {30}."

If their <data2>combined ages are 44</data2>, how old is one of the twins?","There is one set of twins and one set of triplets. <data1>One twin is 7 years older than one triplet</data1>. If their <data2>combined ages are 44</data2>, how old is one of the twins?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of one of the twins given the information about their ages and the total combined age.

Let's denote the age of one of the triplets as \( t \). Since there are three triplets, their combined age is \( 3t \).

According to <data1>one twin is 7 years older than one triplet</data1>, we can express the age of one twin as \( t + 7 \).

Since there are two twins, their combined age is \( 2(t + 7) \).

The total combined age of the twins and triplets is given as <data2>44</data2>.

We can set up the equation for the total combined age:

\[ 3t + 2(t + 7) = 44 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3t + 2t + 14 = 44 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5t + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 5t = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ t = 6 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 6 years.

Now, we find the age of one twin:

\[ t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is {13} years old."

If she <data4>dances a total of 5 minutes</data4>, with her <data5>arms raised during only 2 of those minutes</data5>, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to consider her tap rates with and without her arms raised, and the duration for each scenario.

1. **Without Arms Raised:**
   - Helga taps her right foot at a rate of <data1>300 taps per minute</data1>.
   - Helga taps her left foot at a rate of <data2>250 taps per minute</data2>.
   - She dances for a total of <data4>5 minutes</data4>, but her <data5>arms are raised during only 2 of those minutes</data5>. Therefore, she dances without her arms raised for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes.

   For 3 minutes without arms raised:
   - Right foot taps: 300 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 900 taps.
   - Left foot taps: 250 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 750 taps.

2. **With Arms Raised:**
   - When her arms are raised, her tap rate slows down to <data3>200 taps per minute with each foot</data3>.
   - She dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

   For 2 minutes with arms raised:
   - Right foot taps: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps.
   - Left foot taps: 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps.

3. **Total Taps:**
   - Total right foot taps = 900 (without arms raised) + 400 (with arms raised) = 1300 taps.
   - Total left foot taps = 750 (without arms raised) + 400 (with arms raised) = 1150 taps.

4. **Combined Total Taps:**
   - Combined total taps = 1300 (right foot) + 1150 (left foot) = 2450 taps.

Therefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is {2450}."
