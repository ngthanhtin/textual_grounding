He has applied for help from the <important_quote2>school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip</important_quote2>. How much money is John missing if <important_quote3>he has $50</important_quote3> and the <important_quote1>trip costs $300</important_quote1>?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to cover the cost of the trip after the school's contribution and subtract the amount he already has.

1. First, identify the total cost of the trip: <important_quote1>the trip costs $300</important_quote1>.

2. The school has decided to cover half of the cost: <important_quote2>school, which has decided to cover half the cost of the trip</important_quote2>. Therefore, the school will contribute $300 / 2 = $150.

3. Subtract the school's contribution from the total cost to find out how much John needs to cover himself: $300 - $150 = $150.

4. John already has $50: <important_quote3>he has $50</important_quote3>.

5. Subtract the amount John already has from the amount he needs to cover: $150 - $50 = $100.

Therefore, John is missing {100} dollars."

How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame, we need to analyze the information given in the important quotes.

1. According to <important_quote1>Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</important_quote1>. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Claire earns 12 badges.

2. <important_quote2>It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</important_quote2>. This means Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. Therefore, in a year (12 months), Amber earns 12 / 2 = 6 badges.

3. <important_quote3>Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</important_quote3>. Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Now, we calculate how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:

Wendy's badges - Amber's badges = 36 - 6 = 30

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame. The answer is {30}."
82,<important_quote1>Grace weighs 125 pounds</important_quote1>. <important_quote2>Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs</important_quote2>. What are their combined weights in pounds?,"<important_quote1>Grace weighs 125 pounds</important_quote1>. <important_quote2>Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs</important_quote2>. What are their combined weights in pounds?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we need to calculate each of their weights and then add them together.

1. We know from <important_quote1> that Grace weighs 125 pounds.

2. According to <important_quote2>, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
   \[
   4 \times 125 = 500
   \]
   Then, we subtract 2 pounds from this result to find Alex's weight:
   \[
   500 - 2 = 498
   \]

3. Now, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight to find their combined weight:
   \[
   125 + 498 = 623
   \]

Therefore, their combined weights in pounds are {623}."
530,"After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent <important_quote1>4 hours working out every week</important_quote1> except on some occasions. At one point, he spent <important_quote2>5 hours each for two consecutive weeks</important_quote2>. Another time, he spent <important_quote3>6 hours in one week</important_quote3>. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?","After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent <important_quote1>4 hours working out every week</important_quote1> except on some occasions. At one point, he spent <important_quote2>5 hours each for two consecutive weeks</important_quote2>. Another time, he spent <important_quote3>6 hours in one week</important_quote3>. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to consider the information provided in the <important_quote> tags.

1. According to <important_quote1>, Josh spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. This means that for the weeks not specified in the exceptions, he worked out for 4 hours.

2. <important_quote2> states that Josh spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. This means there are two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each.

3. <important_quote3> indicates that Josh spent 6 hours in one week. This is another exception to the 4-hour weeks.

Now, let's calculate the total hours:

- For the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each, the total is 5 + 5 = 10 hours.
- For the one week where he worked out 6 hours, the total is 6 hours.
- The remaining weeks (8 weeks total - 3 weeks of exceptions = 5 weeks) are 4 hours each, so 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.

Adding these together gives us the total workout hours:
10 hours (from the two 5-hour weeks) + 6 hours (from the one 6-hour week) + 20 hours (from the five 4-hour weeks) = 36 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is {36}."
1047,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. <important_quote1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</important_quote1>. <important_quote2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</important_quote2>. <important_quote3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</important_quote3>.

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the important quotes.

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to <important_quote1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).

According to <important_quote2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

According to <important_quote3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

\[
2(2x + 4) + x = 38
\]

\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The answer is {10}."

His <important_quote2>mother gave him $6</important_quote2> for this purpose, and his <important_quote3>father gave him twice as much</important_quote3>. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to calculate the total amount of money he received from his parents and subtract it from the cost of the trousers.

1. The cost of the trousers is <important_quote1>$30</important_quote1>.
2. Adam's mother gave him <important_quote2>$6</important_quote2>.
3. Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is 2 * <important_quote2>$6</important_quote2> = <important_quote3>$12</important_quote3>.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents:
- Total from parents = <important_quote2>$6</important_quote2> + <important_quote3>$12</important_quote3> = $18.

Finally, we subtract the total amount received from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:
- Contribution from savings = <important_quote1>$30</important_quote1> - $18 = $12.

Therefore, Adam had to contribute {12} from his savings."

   - First week: 8,000 bars
   - Second week: 4,000 bars
   - Third week: 24,000 bars
   - Total for the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

5. **Monthly Production:**
   - Boris produces <important_quote1>50,000 bars of chocolate each month</important_quote1>.

6. **Fourth Week Production:**
   - Total monthly production is 50,000 bars.
   - Subtract the production of the first three weeks from the monthly total: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The answer is {14,000}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much Sunny earned for two days, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling gingerbread and apple pie on both Saturday and Sunday.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes sold on each day.**

- **Saturday:**
  - Sunny sold <important_quote1>10 boxes of gingerbread</important_quote1>.
  - According to <important_quote2>, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. Since he sold <important_quote4>15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday</important_quote4>, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

  - He sold <important_quote4>15 boxes of apple pie</important_quote4>.

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings for each day.**

- **Saturday Earnings:**
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes × <important_quote5>$6</important_quote5> = $60
  - Apple pie: 11 boxes × <important_quote6>$15</important_quote6> = $165
  - Total for Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225

- **Sunday Earnings:**
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes × <important_quote5>$6</important_quote5> = $90
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes × <important_quote6>$15</important_quote6> = $225
  - Total for Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for both days.**

- Total earnings = $225 (Saturday) + $315 (Sunday) = $540

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of {540} for the two days."

On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to calculate the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week.

- From <important_quote1>, Mack saw a total of 50 birds on days one and two.
- From <important_quote2>, Mack saw none on day three.
- From <important_quote3>, Mack saw 120 birds on days four and five.

If she buys a <important_quote3>can of pop for 55 cents</important_quote3>, how many cents will she have left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has and then subtract the cost of the pop.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has.
- Kelly has <important_quote1>5 quarters</important_quote1>. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 5 quarters are worth 5 x 25 = 125 cents.
- Kelly also has <important_quote2>2 dimes</important_quote2>. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, 2 dimes are worth 2 x 10 = 20 cents.

Step 2: Add the value of the quarters and dimes to find the total amount of money.
- Total money = 125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents.

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money.
- The cost of the can of pop is <important_quote3>55 cents</important_quote3>.
- Money left = 145 cents (total money) - 55 cents (cost of pop) = 90 cents.

Therefore, after buying the can of pop, Kelly will have {90} cents left."

If there are <important_quote3>10 total classes</important_quote3>, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his classes cost more than $10 per class, we need to calculate the cost per class and compare it to the $10 threshold.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: Manny signed up for <important_quote1>Karate classes for $60</important_quote1>.

2. **Total Number of Classes**: There are <important_quote3>10 total classes</important_quote3>.

3. **Cost Per Class**: To find the cost per class, we divide the total cost by the number of classes he attends. The cost per class should not exceed <important_quote2>$10 per class</important_quote2>.

4. **Calculate Maximum Number of Classes He Can Attend**:
   - If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 10 = $6, which is less than $10.
   - If he attends 9 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 9 ≈ $6.67, which is still less than $10.
   - If he attends 8 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 8 = $7.50, which is still less than $10.
   - If he attends 7 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 7 ≈ $8.57, which is still less than $10.
   - If he attends 6 classes, the cost per class is $60 / 6 = $10, which is exactly $10.

5. **Conclusion**: Manny can miss up to 4 classes (attending 6 classes) before the cost per class exceeds $10. If he misses 5 classes (attending only 5 classes), the cost per class would be $60 / 5 = $12, which is more than $10.

Therefore, Manny can miss {4} classes before his classes cost more than $10 each."

During the party, <important_quote4>1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten</important_quote4>. How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: <important_quote1>one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies</important_quote1>. Since one dozen equals 12, she made 12 brownies.

2. At her office, they sent her home with <important_quote2>1/2 a dozen brownies</important_quote2>. Half a dozen equals 6, so she received 6 brownies from her office.

3. Her friends had <important_quote3>4 dozen brownies</important_quote3> waiting for her. Four dozen equals 48, so she received 48 brownies from her friends.

4. During the party, <important_quote4>1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten</important_quote4>. One and a half dozen equals 18, so 18 brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had initially:

- Total brownies = 12 (from herself) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

Next, we subtract the number of brownies that were eaten:

- Brownies left = 66 (total) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day. The answer is {48}."

How many slices of pizza were left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices consumed and subtract that from the total number of slices available.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
Each pizza had <important_quote1>12 slices</important_quote1>, and there were 5 pizzas (one for Bryce and each of his four friends). Therefore, the total number of slices is:
5 pizzas * 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and two friends.
Bryce and two friends ate <important_quote2>2/3 of their pizzas</important_quote2>. Since there are 3 people in this group, they each ate:
2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices per person.
Total slices eaten by this group = 3 people * 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the two remaining friends.
The two remaining friends ate <important_quote3>¾ of their pizzas</important_quote3>. Since there are 2 people in this group, they each ate:
3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices per person.
Total slices eaten by this group = 2 people * 9 slices/person = 18 slices.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of slices eaten.
Total slices eaten = 24 slices (Bryce and two friends) + 18 slices (two remaining friends) = 42 slices.

Step 5: Calculate the number of slices left.
Total slices left = Total slices - Total slices eaten = 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is {18}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required to dig through both the soil and the clay separately, and then sum these times.

1. **Digging through soil:**
   - Bill can dig <important_quote1>4 feet/hour through soil</important_quote1>.
   - He needs to dig through <important_quote3>24 feet of soil</important_quote3>.
   - Time to dig through soil = Total feet of soil / Digging rate through soil = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

2. **Digging through clay:**
   - Bill can dig <important_quote2>half that fast through clay</important_quote2>, which means he digs at 2 feet/hour through clay (since half of 4 feet/hour is 2 feet/hour).
   - He needs to dig through <important_quote4>8 feet of clay</important_quote4>.
   - Time to dig through clay = Total feet of clay / Digging rate through clay = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

3. **Total time to dig the well:**
   - Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, it will take Bill a total of {10} hours to dig the well."

If the <important_quote3>final design is 140cm long</important_quote3> then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final design length using the information provided.

1. We know that the <important_quote3>final design is 140cm long</important_quote3>.

2. Shania <important_quote2>adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim</important_quote2>. This means that without the lace trim, the dress would be 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long.

3. The dress was made <important_quote1>longer by extending the dress by 50% of its original length</important_quote1>. Let the original length of the dress be \( x \).

4. The extension added to the original length is 50% of \( x \), which is \( 0.5x \).

5. Therefore, the length of the dress after the extension but before adding the lace trim is \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).

6. We know from step 2 that this length is 120cm, so we set up the equation: \( 1.5x = 120 \).

7. Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.5: \( x = 120 / 1.5 = 80 \).

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80cm. The answer is {80}."

     \text{Total Cost for Second Venue} = \text{Cost per Person} \times \text{Number of Guests}
     \]
   - Substituting the values from the tags:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost for Second Venue} = 25 \times \text{Number of Guests}
     \]

3. **Setting the Costs Equal:**
   - To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, set the total costs of both venues equal to each other:
     \[
     200 + 5 \times \text{Number of Guests} = 25 \times \text{Number of Guests}
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     200 + 5x = 25x
     \]
   - Rearrange to solve for the number of guests (x):
     \[
     200 = 25x - 5x
     \]
     \[
     200 = 20x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is {10}."

The <important_quote3>accountant charges $90</important_quote3>. How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to compare the costs associated with each option.

1. **Doing Taxes Herself:**
   - Jackie will lose <important_quote1>3 fewer hours of freelance work</important_quote1>.
   - This results in a loss of income of 3 hours * <important_quote2>$35/hour in missed income</important_quote2> = $105.

2. **Hiring an Accountant:**
   - The <important_quote3>accountant charges $90</important_quote3>.

Now, we compare the two scenarios:
- If Jackie does the taxes herself, she effectively loses $105 in income.
- If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

The difference in cost between doing the taxes herself and hiring the accountant is $105 (lost income) - $90 (accountant fee) = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's Delivery:**
   According to <important_quote1>, the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Delivery:**
   From <important_quote2>, we know that on Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 
   - One-fifth of Monday's delivery is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
   - Therefore, Tuesday's delivery is \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

3. **Wednesday's Delivery:**
   According to <important_quote3>, on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday.
   - Twice Tuesday's delivery is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
   - Therefore, Wednesday's delivery is \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

4. **Total Delivery from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - Monday: 425 letters
   - Tuesday: 102 letters

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then determine how much more he needs to earn after considering his deposit.

1. Calculate the total cost of the implants:
   - George needs <important_quote1>2 implants</important_quote1>.
   - <important_quote2>Each implant has a base price of $2000</important_quote2>.
   - Therefore, the cost for the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000.

2. Add the cost of the porcelain crown:
   - For one of the implants, he wants a <important_quote3>crown made of porcelain. That feature costs an extra $500</important_quote3>.
   - So, the total cost including the crown is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

3. Subtract the deposit he has already paid:
   - He’s already put down a <important_quote4>deposit of $600</important_quote4>.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900.

4. Calculate how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining amount:
   - He <important_quote5>makes $15 per hour</important_quote5> at work.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to work, divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Therefore, George needs to work {260} hours to have enough to pay for the dental work."

How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cows are in 8 of the stalls after Mr. Sylas buys and distributes the new cows.

1. **Initial Number of Cows in Ten Stalls:**
   According to <important_quote1>Ten stalls have 20 cows each</important_quote1>, there are initially 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows in these ten stalls is:
   \[
   10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
   \]

2. **Total Number of Stalls:**
   Mr. Sylas divides the new cows into <important_quote3>twenty stalls</important_quote3>. This means there are a total of 20 stalls.

3. **New Cows Bought by Mr. Sylas:**
   Mr. Sylas buys <important_quote2>40 cows</important_quote2>.

4. **Distribution of New Cows:**
   The 40 new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls. Therefore, each stall receives:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall}
   \]

5. **Total Cows per Stall:**
   Each of the original 10 stalls had 20 cows, and now each stall receives 2 additional cows. Therefore, each of these stalls now has:
   \[
   20 \text{ original cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall}
   \]

6. **Cows in 8 Stalls:**
   We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of these stalls. Since each stall has 22 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:
   \[
   8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows per stall} = 176 \text{ cows}
   \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is {176}."

If <important_quote2>Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day</important_quote2>, how many miles will Brian walk in seven days?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to use the information provided in the important quotes.

First, let's calculate how far Sofie will walk in seven days. According to <important_quote2>Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day</important_quote2>. Therefore, in seven days, Sofie will walk:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Next, we use the information from <important_quote1>In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian</important_quote1>. This means that the distance Sofie walks in seven days is twice the distance Brian walks in the same period.

Let the distance Brian walks in seven days be represented by B. According to the quote, Sofie's distance (70 miles) is twice Brian's distance:

70 miles = 2 * B

To find B, we solve the equation:

B = 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days. The final answer is {35}."

How long will each final cut be?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the length of each final cut, we need to follow the steps outlined in the problem using the provided data.

Step 1: Initial Cut
Marty has <important_quote1>100 centimeters of ribbon</important_quote1>. He needs to <important_quote2>cut it into 4 equal parts</important_quote2>. 

To find the length of each of these 4 parts, we divide the total length of the ribbon by 4:

How many dromedaries are there if <important_quote3>camels have two humps each</important_quote3> and <important_quote4>dromedaries have one hump each</important_quote4>?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of camels and dromedaries in the herd based on the given information about heads and humps.

Step 1: Understand the given information.
- There are <important_quote1>180 heads</important_quote1> in total. This means the total number of camels and dromedaries combined is 180.
- There are <important_quote2>304 bumps</important_quote2> in total.
- <important_quote3>Camels have two humps each</important_quote3>.
- <important_quote4>Dromedaries have one hump each</important_quote4>.

Step 2: Set up equations based on the information.
Let C be the number of camels and D be the number of dromedaries.

From the heads information:
C + D = 180  (Equation 1)

From the humps information:
2C + D = 304  (Equation 2)

Step 3: Solve the system of equations.
Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate D:

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
2C + D - C - D = 124
C = 124

Now that we know C = 124, substitute this value back into Equation 1 to find D:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 180 - 124
D = 56

Therefore, there are {56} dromedaries in the herd."

How many years separate the age of the two now?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin and then find the difference between their ages.

Step 1: Determine Jame's current age.
According to <important_quote1>Jame will turn 27 in 5 years</important_quote1>, we can calculate Jame's current age by subtracting 5 from 27:
27 - 5 = 22.
So, Jame is currently 22 years old.

Step 2: Determine the cousin's current age.
According to <important_quote2>In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age</important_quote2>, we can set up an equation to find the cousin's current age. Let C be the cousin's current age.

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. The cousin's age in 8 years will be C + 8.

According to the quote, C + 8 = 2(30) - 5.
C + 8 = 60 - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

So, the cousin is currently 47 years old.

How many worker bees are there?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of worker bees in the hive using the information provided.

1. Let's define the number of queens as \( q \).
2. According to <important_quote3>, there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of baby bees is \( 2q \).
3. According to <important_quote2>, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2q = 4q \).
4. The total number of bees in the hive is given by <important_quote1> as 700. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   q + 2q + 4q = 700

Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.**

According to <important_quote1>, each member of the well-rounded team runs their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for this team is:

\[ 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.**

The first runner of the less well-rounded team runs their leg in 60 seconds, as stated in <important_quote2>. According to <important_quote3>, each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for the four runners are:

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team is:

\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two teams.**

The well-rounded team completes the relay in 220 seconds, while the less well-rounded team completes it in 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team (the well-rounded team) wins by:

\[ 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by {2} seconds."

If the <important_quote2>length of his room is 3 yards</important_quote2>, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we need to determine both the length and the width of the room in feet.

1. **Convert the Length to Feet:**
   - The length of the room is given as <important_quote2>3 yards</important_quote2>.
   - Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

2. **Calculate the Width:**
   - The area of the room is given as <important_quote1>360 square feet</important_quote1>.
   - The formula for the area of a rectangle is \( \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \).
   - We have the area as 360 square feet and the length as 9 feet.
   - So, \( 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \).
   - Solving for the width, we get \(\text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40\) feet.

3. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
   - Substituting the known values, we get \( \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98\) feet.

Therefore, the perimeter of the room in feet is {98}."

How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Building Rate**: Jay can build <important_quote1>20 snowballs in an hour</important_quote1>. This means he builds 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (since 20 snowballs/hour divided by 4 quarters of an hour equals 5 snowballs per 15 minutes).

2. **Melting Rate**: <important_quote2>2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes</important_quote2>.

3. **Net Gain**: Every 15 minutes, Jay builds 5 snowballs but loses 2 to melting, resulting in a net gain of 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.

4. **Time Calculation**: To find out how long it will take to reach 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net gain per 15 minutes:
   - 60 snowballs / 3 snowballs per 15 minutes = 20 intervals of 15 minutes.

   - Amy had <important_quote1>two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each</important_quote1>. This means she initially had 2 palettes * 4 colors = 8 colors from the palettes.
   - She also had <important_quote2>three makeup sets that came with six eyeshadow colors each</important_quote2>. This means she had 3 sets * 6 colors = 18 colors from the makeup sets.

2. **Total Initial Colors:**
   - Total initial colors = 8 (from palettes) + 18 (from makeup sets) = 26 colors.

3. **Colors Lost or Used:**
   - Her <important_quote3>sister steals one of the palettes</important_quote3>. Since each palette has 4 colors, she loses 4 colors.
   - <important_quote4>Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set</important_quote4>. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of one set is 6 / 2 = 3 colors used up.

4. **Remaining Colors:**
   - After the sister steals one palette, Amy has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.
   - After using up half of the colors from one makeup set, she has 22 - 3 = 19 colors left.

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is {19}."

How many gold coins does Gretchen have?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many gold coins Gretchen has, we can use the information provided in the tags.

1. According to <important_quote1>, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. This includes both gold and silver coins.

2. From <important_quote2>, we know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From <important_quote2>, we have:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

From <important_quote1>, we have the total number of coins:
\[ G + S = 110 \]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( G \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the equation \( G = S + 30 \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

What is the total dollar amount in the jar?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

1. **Quarters**: 
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Justin has <important_quote1>32 quarters</important_quote1>.
   - Total value from quarters = 32 * $0.25 = $8.00.

2. **Dimes**: 
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Justin has <important_quote2>95 dimes</important_quote2>.
   - Total value from dimes = 95 * $0.10 = $9.50.

3. **Nickels**: 
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Justin has <important_quote3>120 nickels</important_quote3>.
   - Total value from nickels = 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.

4. **Pennies**: 
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Justin has <important_quote4>750 pennies</important_quote4>.
   - Total value from pennies = 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Now, we sum up the total values from each type of coin:

- Total dollar amount = $8.00 (quarters) + $9.50 (dimes) + $6.00 (nickels) + $7.50 (pennies) = $31.00.

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is {31.00}."

   \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \text{ millipedes}
   \]

3. **Stink Bugs**: The number of stink bugs is described as <important_quote3>twice the number of millipedes minus 12</important_quote3>. With 30 millipedes, the number of stink bugs is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \text{ stink bugs}
   \]

4. **Total Bugs**: To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:
   \[
   90 \text{ (spiders)} + 30 \text{ (millipedes)} + 48 \text{ (stink bugs)} = 168 \text{ bugs}
   \]

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of {168} bugs."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. Julia initially bought a package of spoons, but we don't know how many were in it yet.

2. <important_quote1>Her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons</important_quote1> and gave them to Julia. This means Julia received an additional 5 spoons from her husband.

3. <important_quote2>She used three of the spoons to sample her stew</important_quote2>. This implies that 3 spoons were temporarily unavailable for setting the table.

4. <important_quote3>She had a total of 12 spoons</important_quote3> when she went to set the table. This is the total number of spoons available after accounting for the 3 spoons used for sampling.

Now, let's calculate the number of spoons in the package Julia bought:

- Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package Julia bought.
- The total number of spoons she had after receiving the 5 spoons from her husband is \( x + 5 \).
- She used 3 spoons, so the number of spoons available for setting the table is \( x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 \).
- According to <important_quote3>, she had 12 spoons available for setting the table, so \( x + 2 = 12 \).

Solving for \( x \):

How much is the boat worth after the three years?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially to the initial purchase price.

1. **Initial Purchase Price**: 
   - The boat was bought for <important_quote1>$9000</important_quote1>.

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by <important_quote2>30%</important_quote2> in the first year.
   - Depreciation amount for the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700.
   - Value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by another <important_quote3>30%</important_quote3> in the second year.
   - Depreciation amount for the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890.
   - Value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciated by <important_quote4>20%</important_quote4> in the third year.
   - Depreciation amount for the third year = 20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882.
   - Value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth {3528} after three years."

What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled.
- From <important_quote1>drives 60 mph for 2 hours</important_quote1>, the distance covered is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.
- From <important_quote2>30 mph for 1 hour</important_quote2>, the distance covered is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.

Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken.
- The time taken for the first part of the trip is 2 hours.
- The time taken for the second part of the trip is 1 hour.

Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

How many Pokemon has Stan caught?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon Stan has caught using the information provided in the quotes.

1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

2. From <important_quote3>Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught</important_quote3>, we can express Stan's count in terms of Adelwolfe's count:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

3. From <important_quote2>Alex has caught 5 more than Stan</important_quote2>, we can express Alex's count in terms of Stan's count:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]

4. From <important_quote1>Together they have caught 339 Pokemon</important_quote1>, we have the equation:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]

5. Substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 4:
   \[
   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339
   \]

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339
   \]
   \[
   9A - 21 = 339
   \]

7. Solve for \( A \):
   \[
   9A = 360
   \]
   \[
   A = 40
   \]

8. Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the expression from step 2:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
   \]

Therefore, Stan has caught {147} Pokemon."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we will calculate the number of fruits produced each year based on the given information and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: According to <important_quote1>, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree**: As per <important_quote2>, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits. The initial amount is 50 fruits, so a 6-year-old tree produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree**: From <important_quote3>, a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount. Therefore, it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree**: According to <important_quote4>, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We need to first determine the production of a 10-year-old tree.

5. **10-year-old tree**: As per <important_quote6>, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. Thus, it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

6. **8-year-old tree (continued)**: Now that we know a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits, an 8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree**: According to <important_quote5>, during the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced from the 5th to the 10th year:

- 5th year: 50 fruits
- 6th year: 150 fruits
- 7th year: 350 fruits
- 8th year: 800 fruits
- 9th year: 0 fruits
- 10th year: 1000 fruits

Total fruits = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350 fruits.

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is {2350}."

Calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many containers were imported on the second day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles from the first day's containers.
According to <important_quote1>, there were 2 containers, each having 5 vehicles inside. Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day's containers is:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Step 2: Determine the total number of vehicles after the second day.
According to <important_quote2>, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30.

Step 3: Calculate the number of vehicles imported on the second day.
The number of vehicles imported on the second day is the total number of vehicles after the second day minus the number of vehicles from the first day:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles (total)} - 10 \text{ vehicles (first day)} = 20 \text{ vehicles (second day)} \]

Step 4: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.
Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

  <important_quote3>Job B pays $42,000 a year</important_quote3>.  
  Gross Income = $42,000.

- **Property Tax for Job B**:  
  <important_quote4>$6,000 in property tax</important_quote4>.  
  Net Income after Property Tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.

- **Net Income for Job B**:  
  <important_quote5>10% tax rate on net income after property tax</important_quote5>.  
  Tax = 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600.  
  Net Income = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

**Step 3: Compare Net Incomes**

- Net Income for Job A = $24,000.
- Net Income for Job B = $32,400.

**Difference in Net Income**:  
$32,400 (Job B) - $24,000 (Job A) = $8,400.

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, which is Job B.

The answer is {8400}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam gets when the total fence is split between Sam and Harry, with Harry receiving 60 feet more than Sam.

1. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.
3. The total amount of fence is given as <important_quote1>100 feet</important_quote1>.
4. Therefore, the equation representing the total fence is:
   \[
   S + (S + 60) = 100
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2S + 60 = 100
   \]
6. Subtract 60 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 40
   \]

   \[
   S = 20
   \]

Thus, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is {20}."

What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   The bird flies <important_quote1>southerly for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour</important_quote1>.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles south.

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   The bird then flies <important_quote2>north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour</important_quote2>.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles north.

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   Finally, the bird flies <important_quote3>south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour</important_quote3>.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles south.

Now, we calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction:

- Total distance south = 300 miles (first leg) + 110 miles (third leg) = 410 miles.
- Total distance north = 36 miles (second leg).

Net distance south = Total distance south - Total distance north = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is {374} miles."

Since <important_quote2>he has 3 cows</important_quote2>, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many more cows the farmer needs, we can break down the problem using the provided data:

1. According to <important_quote1>, the farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow.
2. According to <important_quote2>, he has 3 cows.

First, calculate the total amount of milk currently produced by the 3 cows:
- Each cow produces 5 liters, so 3 cows produce \(3 \times 5 = 15\) liters of milk per day.

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Therefore, he needs:
- \(25 - 15 = 10\) more liters of milk per day.

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the number of additional cows needed to produce 10 more liters is:
- \(10 \div 5 = 2\) cows.

Thus, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The answer is {2}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and then apply the payment rate.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.
According to <important_quote1>, the first two complexes have 200 apartments each. Therefore, the total number of apartments in these two complexes is:
200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

Step 2: Calculate the number of apartments in the last complex.
According to <important_quote2>, the last complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined. The combined number of apartments in the first two complexes is 400. Therefore, the number of apartments in the last complex is:
400 + (0.60 * 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
The total number of apartments across all three complexes is:
400 (from the first two complexes) + 640 (from the last complex) = 1040 apartments.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of collections per week.
According to <important_quote3>, John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
1040 apartments * 3 collections per week = 3120 collections per week.

Step 5: Calculate the total payment per week.
According to <important_quote4>, John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, the total payment per week is:
3120 collections * $0.40 per collection = $1248.

How many fish were they able to catch?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of fish Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish they caught and then sum them up.

1. **Starfish:**
   - Anakin caught <important_quote1>10 starfish</important_quote1>.
   - Locsin caught <important_quote4>5 fewer starfish than Anakin</important_quote4>, which means Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

2. **Sea Horses:**
   - Anakin caught <important_quote2>6 sea horses</important_quote2>.
   - Locsin caught <important_quote5>3 fewer sea horses than Anakin</important_quote5>, which means Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

3. **Clownfish:**
   - Anakin caught <important_quote3>3 clownfish</important_quote3>.
   - Locsin caught <important_quote6>2 more clownfish than Anakin</important_quote6>, which means Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, we sum up the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15
- Total sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9
- Total clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8

Adding these together gives us the total number of fish:

15 (starfish) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is {32}."

If their <important_quote2>combined ages are 44</important_quote2>, how old is one of the twins?","There is one set of twins and one set of triplets. <important_quote1>One twin is 7 years older than one triplet</important_quote1>. If their <important_quote2>combined ages are 44</important_quote2>, how old is one of the twins?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of one of the twins given the information about their ages and the total combined age.

Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define the age of one triplet as \( t \). Since there are three triplets, their combined age is \( 3t \).

Step 2: Use the Information About the Twin
According to <important_quote1>one twin is 7 years older than one triplet</important_quote1>, the age of one twin is \( t + 7 \). Since there are two twins, their combined age is \( 2(t + 7) \).

Step 3: Set Up the Equation for Combined Ages
The combined ages of the twins and triplets is given as 44 in <important_quote2>combined ages are 44</important_quote2>. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3t + 2(t + 7) = 44 \]

Step 4: Simplify and Solve the Equation
First, expand the equation:

\[ 3t + 2t + 14 = 44 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5t + 14 = 44 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:

\[ 5t = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ t = 6 \]

Step 5: Find the Age of One Twin
Since one twin is \( t + 7 \) years old, substitute \( t = 6 \):

\[ t + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old.

The final answer is {13}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Gerald's Original Time:**
   - According to <important_quote1>, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.
   - From <important_quote2>, we know Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Therefore, Gerald's original time was 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

2. **Calculate Gerald's Improved Time:**
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10% as per <important_quote3>.
   - A 10% improvement in speed means his time decreases by 10%.
   - 10% of Gerald's original time (40 seconds) is 4 seconds.
   - Therefore, Gerald's improved time is 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in {36} seconds."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to consider her tap rates with and without her arms raised, and the duration for each scenario.

1. **With arms at her sides:**
   - Right foot: <important_quote1>300 taps per minute</important_quote1>
   - Left foot: <important_quote2>250 taps per minute</important_quote2>
   - Total taps per minute with both feet: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute

2. **With arms raised:**
   - Both feet: <important_quote3>200 taps per minute with each foot</important_quote3>
   - Total taps per minute with both feet: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute

3. **Duration:**
   - Total dance time: <important_quote4>5 minutes</important_quote4>
   - Time with arms raised: <important_quote5>2 of those minutes</important_quote5>
   - Time with arms at her sides: 5 - 2 = 3 minutes

4. **Calculate total taps:**
   - Taps with arms at her sides for 3 minutes: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps
   - Taps with arms raised for 2 minutes: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps

5. **Combined total taps:**
   - Total taps = 1650 (arms at sides) + 800 (arms raised) = 2450 taps

Therefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is {2450}."
