How much money is John missing if <important3>he has $50</important3> and the <important1>trip costs $300</important1>?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much money John is missing, we need to calculate the total amount he needs to raise after the school's contribution and subtract the amount he already has.

1. First, we identify the total cost of the trip: <important1>the trip costs $300</important1>.

2. The school has decided to cover half of the cost: <important2>the school covers half the cost of the trip</important2>. Therefore, the school's contribution is $300 / 2 = $150.

3. John needs to cover the remaining half of the trip cost. So, he needs to raise $300 - $150 = $150.

4. John already has $50: <important3>he has $50</important3>.

5. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he already has from the amount he needs to raise: $150 - $50 = $100.

Therefore, John is missing {100} dollars."

What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?","After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent <important1>4 hours working out every week</important1> except on some occasions. At one point, he spent <important2>5 hours each for two consecutive weeks</important2>. Another time, he spent <important3>6 hours in one week</important3>. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to consider the information provided in the tags:

1. Josh spent <important1>4 hours working out every week</important1> except on some occasions. This means that for the weeks not specified as exceptions, he worked out for 4 hours each.

2. There were <important2>two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each</important2>. This accounts for 2 weeks where he worked out for 5 hours instead of 4.

3. There was <important3>one week where he spent 6 hours</important3> working out.

Let's calculate the total hours:

- For the weeks where he worked out 4 hours: Since there are 8 weeks in total and 3 weeks are specified as exceptions (2 weeks at 5 hours and 1 week at 6 hours), there are 8 - 3 = 5 weeks where he worked out 4 hours each. So, 5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours.

- For the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours each: 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.

- For the one week where he worked out 6 hours: 1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours.

Adding these together gives the total number of hours:

20 hours (from the 4-hour weeks) + 10 hours (from the 5-hour weeks) + 6 hours (from the 6-hour week) = 36 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is {36}."
1047,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. <important1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</important1>. <important2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</important2>. <important3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</important3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. <important1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</important1>. <important2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</important2>. <important3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</important3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set, we need to use the information provided in the tags.

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to <important1>, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).

According to <important2>, in the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

According to <important3>, the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The answer is {10}."

If the <important5>gingerbread cost $6</important5> and the <important6>apple pie cost $15</important6>, how much did Sunny earn for two days?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much Sunny earned over the two days, we need to calculate the total sales for both gingerbread and apple pie on Saturday and Sunday.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes sold on each day.**

- **Saturday:**
  - Sunny sold <important1>10 boxes of gingerbread</important1>.
  - For apple pie, he sold <important2>4 fewer boxes than on Sunday</important2>. We need to find out how many boxes of apple pie were sold on Sunday first.

- **Sunday:**
  - Sunny sold <important3>5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday</important3>. Therefore, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
  - He sold <important4>15 boxes of apple pie</important4>.

Now, we can determine the number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday:
- Since he sold <important2>4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday</important2>, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings for each day.**

- **Saturday:**
  - Earnings from gingerbread: 10 boxes × <important5>$6</important5> = $60
  - Earnings from apple pie: 11 boxes × <important6>$15</important6> = $165
  - Total earnings on Saturday = $60 + $165 = $225

- **Sunday:**
  - Earnings from gingerbread: 15 boxes × <important5>$6</important5> = $90
  - Earnings from apple pie: 15 boxes × <important6>$15</important6> = $225
  - Total earnings on Sunday = $90 + $225 = $315

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for both days.**

Total earnings for two days = $225 (Saturday) + $315 (Sunday) = $540

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of {540} dollars over the two days."

How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cows are in 8 of the stalls after Mr. Sylas buys and distributes the new cows.

Step 1: Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls.
According to <important1>, there are ten stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows initially is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of new cows Mr. Sylas buys.
<important2> states that Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows.

Step 3: Distribute the new cows equally among the stalls.
<important3> indicates that the 40 new cows are divided equally among the twenty stalls. Therefore, each stall receives:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cows in each stall after the distribution.
Each stall initially had 20 cows, and now each receives 2 additional cows, so each stall now has:
\[ 20 \text{ initial cows} + 2 \text{ new cows} = 22 \text{ cows per stall} \]

Step 5: Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls.
Since each stall has 22 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows per stall} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is {176}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to use the information provided in the tags.

First, let's calculate how far Sofie will walk in seven days. According to <important2>Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day</important2>. Therefore, in seven days, Sofie will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we use the information from <important1>In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian</important1>. This means that the distance Sofie walks in seven days is twice the distance Brian walks in the same period. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

Substituting the distance Sofie walks:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks} \]

Solving for the distance Brian walks:

\[ \text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Brian will walk {35} miles in seven days."

How many dromedaries are there if <important3>camels have two humps each</important3> and <important4>dromedaries have one hump each</important4>?,"A herd consists of camels and dromedaries. There are <important1>180 heads</important1> and <important2>304 bumps</important2>. How many dromedaries are there if <important3>camels have two humps each</important3> and <important4>dromedaries have one hump each</important4>?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of camels and dromedaries in the herd based on the given information about heads and humps.

Step 1: Understand the given information.
- There are <important1>180 heads</important1> in total. This means the total number of camels and dromedaries combined is 180.
- There are <important2>304 bumps</important2> in total.
- <important3>Camels have two humps each</important3>.
- <important4>Dromedaries have one hump each</important4>.

Step 2: Set up equations based on the information.
Let \( C \) be the number of camels and \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the heads information:
\[ C + D = 180 \]

From the humps information:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \]

Step 3: Solve the system of equations.
We have:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we know \( C = 124 \), substitute back into equation 1 to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is {56}."

How many years separate the age of the two now?,"<important1>Jame will turn 27 in 5 years</important1>. <important2>In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age</important2>. How many years separate the age of the two now?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the current age difference between Jame and his cousin, we need to first find their current ages using the information provided.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - According to <important1>Jame will turn 27 in 5 years</important1>, we can calculate Jame's current age by subtracting 5 from 27.
   - Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22 years.

Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team.**

Each member of the well-rounded team runs their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for this team is:

\[
4 \times \text{<important1>55 seconds</important1>} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team.**

The first runner of the less well-rounded team runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:

- First runner: \text{<important2>60 seconds</important2>}
- Second runner: \text{60 - 3 = 57 seconds}
- Third runner: \text{57 - 3 = 54 seconds}
- Fourth runner: \text{54 - 3 = 51 seconds}

Adding these times together gives the total time for the less well-rounded team:

\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two teams.**

The well-rounded team completes the relay in 220 seconds, while the less well-rounded team completes it in 222 seconds. Therefore, the faster team (the well-rounded team) wins by:

\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

The faster team will win by {2} seconds."

If he also <important4>paid $250 000 for the remaining loan amount</important4> of the house, how much is Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house, we need to calculate the total expenses he incurred and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Selling Price**: Mr. Tan sold his house for <important1>$400,000</important1>.

2. **Transfer Fees**: He paid transfer fees that amount to <important2>3% of the selling price</important2>. 
   - Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.

3. **Brokerage Fee**: He also paid a brokerage fee that is <important3>5% of the selling price</important3>.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.

4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: He paid <important4>$250,000 for the remaining loan amount</important4> of the house.

Now, let's calculate the total expenses:
- Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fee + Remaining loan amount
- Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Finally, we calculate the net proceeds by subtracting the total expenses from the selling price:
- Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses
- Net proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are {118,000}."

What is the likelihood, expressed as a percentage, that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, let's analyze the situation step by step using the key facts provided:

1. Ellen started with a <important1>case of 12 sodas</important1>.
2. She <important2>shook 3 of them up</important2>, meaning there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas initially.
3. Ellen <important3>took 1 unshaken soda for herself</important3>, leaving 8 unshaken sodas.
4. Ellen's <important4>brother stopped by and took 1 of the shaken sodas and 2 of the unshaken sodas</important4>. This means:
   - Shaken sodas left: 3 - 1 = 2
   - Unshaken sodas left: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. The total number of sodas left is 2 shaken + 6 unshaken = 8 sodas.

The probability that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas:

Probability = (Number of shaken sodas) / (Total number of sodas) = 2 / 8 = 1/4.

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

1/4 * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is {25%}."

If there is a <important6>10% tax on all nonfood items</important6>, how much did everything cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total cost of John's purchases, including tax, we need to identify which items are subject to the 10% tax and calculate the total cost accordingly.

1. **Identify food and nonfood items:**
   - Food items: <important1>milk for 2 dollars</important1> and <important2>eggs for 3 dollars</important2>.
   - Nonfood items: <important3>light bulbs for 3 dollars</important3>, <important4>cups for 3 dollars</important4>, and <important5>roach traps for 4 dollars</important5>.

2. **Calculate the cost of food items:**
   - Milk: <important1>2 dollars</important1>
   - Eggs: <important2>3 dollars</important2>
   - Total cost of food items = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of nonfood items before tax:**
   - Light bulbs: <important3>3 dollars</important3>
   - Cups: <important4>3 dollars</important4>
   - Roach traps: <important5>4 dollars</important5>
   - Total cost of nonfood items before tax = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.

4. **Apply the 10% tax to nonfood items:**
   - Tax on nonfood items = <important6>10% of 10 dollars</important6> = 0.10 * 10 = 1 dollar.

5. **Calculate the total cost including tax:**
   - Total cost = Cost of food items + Cost of nonfood items + Tax on nonfood items
   - Total cost = 5 + 10 + 1 = 16 dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of everything, including tax, is {16}."
452,"A car is on a road trip and <important1>drives 60 mph for 2 hours</important1>, and then <important2>30 mph for 1 hour</important2>. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?","A car is on a road trip and <important1>drives 60 mph for 2 hours</important1>, and then <important2>30 mph for 1 hour</important2>. What is the car's average speed in mph during this trip?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled.
- For the first part of the trip, the car drives at <important1>60 mph for 2 hours</important1>. The distance covered in this part is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- For the second part of the trip, the car drives at <important2>30 mph for 1 hour</important2>. The distance covered in this part is:
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- The total distance traveled is:
  \[
  \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken.
- The total time taken for the trip is:
  \[
  \text{Total Time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
  \]

Step 3: Calculate the average speed.
- The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
  \[
  \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
  \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is {50} mph."

How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - <important1>30 bees leave the hive</important1>.

2. **Next 6 hours:**
   - <important2>1/2 that many bees return</important2>, which means 15 bees return.

3. **Following 6 hours:**
   - <important3>Two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave</important3>. This means 2 * 30 = 60 bees leave.

4. **Last 6 hours:**
   - <important4>Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive</important4>.

Now, let's calculate how many bees return in the last 6 hours:

- Initially, 30 bees left, and 15 returned, so 15 bees are still out.
- Then, 60 more bees left, making a total of 15 (still out) + 60 = 75 bees out.

How many Pokemon has Stan caught?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon Stan has caught using the information provided in the tags.

1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \( A \).

2. According to <important3>, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = 4A - 13
   \]

3. According to <important2>, Alex has caught 5 more than Stan. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Alex has caught can be expressed as:
   \[
   X = S + 5
   \]

4. According to <important1>, together they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + S + X = 339
   \]

5. Substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) into the equation:
   \[
   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339
   \]

6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339
   \]
   \[
   9A - 21 = 339
   \]

7. Solve for \( A \):
   \[
   9A = 339 + 21
   \]
   \[
   9A = 360
   \]
   \[
   A = 40
   \]

8. Now, substitute \( A = 40 \) back into the expression for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 4(40) - 13
   \]
   \[
   S = 160 - 13
   \]
   \[
   S = 147
   \]

Therefore, Stan has caught {147} Pokemon."

How many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree**: According to <important1>, a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree**: As per <important2>, a 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits. The initial amount is 50 fruits, so a 6-year-old tree produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree**: From <important3>, a 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount. Therefore, it produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree**: According to <important4>, an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We need to first determine the production of a 10-year-old tree.

5. **10-year-old tree**: As per <important6>, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount. Thus, it produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

6. **8-year-old tree (continued)**: Since an 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree, it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

7. **9-year-old tree**: According to <important5>, during the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, we sum up the fruits produced from the 5th to the 10th year:

- 5th year: 50 fruits
- 6th year: 150 fruits
- 7th year: 350 fruits
- 8th year: 800 fruits
- 9th year: 0 fruits
- 10th year: 1000 fruits

How much more money will Nick make at the job with a higher net pay rate, compared to the other job?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B.

**Step 1: Calculate Net Income for Job A**

- **Gross Income for Job A**: 
  - <important1>Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year</important1>.
  - Gross Income = $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000.

- **Net Income for Job A**:
  - <important2>20% total tax rate</important2> on $30,000.
  - Tax = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000.
  - Net Income = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Step 2: Calculate Net Income for Job B**

- **Gross Income for Job B**:
  - <important3>Job B pays $42,000 a year</important3>.

- **Net Income for Job B**:
  - First, subtract the <important4>$6,000 in property tax</important4> from the gross income.
  - Income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
  - <important5>10% tax rate on net income after property tax</important5>.
  - Tax = 10% of $36,000 = $3,600.
  - Net Income = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

**Step 3: Compare Net Incomes**

- Net Income for Job A = $24,000.
- Net Income for Job B = $32,400.

**Difference in Net Income**:
- Job B pays $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more than Job A.

Therefore, Nick will make {8,400} more at Job B compared to Job A."

What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southerly direction.

1. **Initial Southerly Flight:**
   - The bird flies <important1>southerly for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour</important1>.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Northerly Flight:**

There is <important3>half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense</important3>. How many players are on the defense?,"A football team has <important1>105 members</important1>. There are <important2>twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense</important2>. There is <important3>half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense</important3>. How many players are on the defense?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of players on the defense using the information provided.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( x \).

According to the information given:
1. <important2>There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense</important2>. This means the number of players on the offense is \( 2x \).

2. <important3>There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense</important3>. This means the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is given as <important1>105 members</important1>.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 2x + \frac{x}{2} = 105 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 3x + \frac{x}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
\[ 2(3x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(105) \]
\[ 6x + x = 210 \]
\[ 7x = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is {30}."

If their <important2>combined ages are 44</important2>, how old is one of the twins?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of one of the twins given the information about their ages and the total combined age.

Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define the age of one triplet as \( t \).
Since there are three triplets, their combined age is \( 3t \).

Step 2: Use the Information About the Twin
According to <important1>one twin is 7 years older than one triplet</important1>, the age of one twin is \( t + 7 \).
Since there are two twins, their combined age is \( 2(t + 7) \).

Step 3: Use the Total Combined Age
The total combined age of the twins and triplets is given as <important2>44</important2>.
So, we can write the equation:
\[ 3t + 2(t + 7) = 44 \]

Step 4: Simplify and Solve the Equation
\[ 3t + 2t + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5t + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5t = 44 - 14 \]
\[ 5t = 30 \]
\[ t = 6 \]

Step 5: Find the Age of One Twin
Since one twin is \( t + 7 \) years old, and we found \( t = 6 \), the age of one twin is:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is {13}."

If she <important4>dances a total of 5 minutes</important4>, with her <important5>arms raised during only 2 of those minutes</important5>, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to consider her tap rates with and without her arms raised, and the duration for each scenario.

1. **Without Arms Raised:**
   - Helga taps her right foot at a rate of <important1>300 taps per minute</important1>.
   - Helga taps her left foot at a rate of <important2>250 taps per minute</important2>.
   - She dances for a total of <important4>5 minutes</important4>, but her arms are raised for only <important5>2 of those minutes</important5>. Therefore, she dances without her arms raised for \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes.

   For the 3 minutes without her arms raised:
   - Right foot taps: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
   - Left foot taps: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

2. **With Arms Raised:**
   - When her arms are raised, her tap rate slows down to <important3>200 taps per minute with each foot</important3>.
   - She dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

   For the 2 minutes with her arms raised:
   - Right foot taps: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
   - Left foot taps: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

3. **Total Taps:**
   - Total right foot taps: \(900 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1300 \text{ taps}\)
   - Total left foot taps: \(750 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1150 \text{ taps}\)

4. **Combined Total Taps:**
   - Combined total taps for both feet: \(1300 \text{ taps} + 1150 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}\)

Therefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is {2450}."
