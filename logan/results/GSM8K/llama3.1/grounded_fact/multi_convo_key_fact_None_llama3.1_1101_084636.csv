How much money is John missing if <key_fact3>he has $50</key_fact3> and the <key_fact1>trip costs $300</key_fact1>?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much money John is missing, we need to determine how much of the trip cost he still needs to cover.

The school will cover half the cost of the trip. Since the trip costs $300, half of that would be:

$300 / 2 = $150

This means the school will contribute $150 towards the trip.

John has already saved $50, so we need to find out how much more he needs to raise to cover his share of the remaining cost.

The total cost of the trip is $300, and the school is covering $150. This leaves:

$300 - $150 = $150

as the amount John still needs to cover.

Since John has already saved $50, we subtract this from the remaining amount he needs to cover:

$150 - $50 = $100

Therefore, John is missing $100.

The answer is {100}."

How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?,"<key_fact1>Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month</key_fact1>. <key_fact2>It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire</key_fact2>. <key_fact3>Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</key_fact3>. How many more badges does Wendy earn compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

<key_fact1>Claire earns 12 girl scout badges every year</key_fact1>.

<key_fact2>It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge than Claire, so it takes Amber 2 months to earn one badge</key_fact2>. Therefore, <key_fact3>Amber earns 6 girl scout badges in a year</key_fact3>.

<key_fact3>Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame</key_fact3>, so Wendy earns 36 girl scout badges every year.

The difference between the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber is 36 - 6 = 30.

The answer is {30}."
82,<key_fact1>Grace weighs 125 pounds</key_fact1>. <key_fact2>Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs</key_fact2>. What are their combined weights in pounds?,"<key_fact1>Grace weighs 125 pounds</key_fact1>. <key_fact2>Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs</key_fact2>. What are their combined weights in pounds?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find Alex's weight, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight and then subtract 2 pounds.

Grace's weight: 125 pounds
4 times Grace's weight: 4 x 125 = 500 pounds
Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Combined weights of Grace and Alex: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds

The answer is {623}."
530,"After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent <key_fact1>4 hours working out every week</key_fact1> except on some occasions.

What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to calculate the total time spent at each intensity level and then add them up.

1. The regular workout routine: <key_fact1>4 hours per week</key_fact1> for 6 weeks (since there are two exceptions). Total time = 4 * 6 = 24 hours.
2. The first exception: <key_fact2>5 hours each for two consecutive weeks</key_fact2>. Total time = 5 * 2 = 10 hours.
3. The second exception: <key_fact3>6 hours in one week</key_fact3>. Total time = 6 * 1 = 6 hours.

Now, let's add up the total time spent working out:

24 (regular routine) + 10 (first exception) + 6 (second exception) = 40 hours

So, Josh has spent a total of {40} hours working out across the 8 weeks."
1047,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. <key_fact1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</key_fact1>. <key_fact2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</key_fact2>. <key_fact3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</key_fact3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. <key_fact1>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</key_fact1>. <key_fact2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</key_fact2>. <key_fact3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</key_fact3>. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x. Then, according to the given information:

* In the first set, Rory retrieved x + 4 balls.
* In the third set, he retrieved x/2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

To solve for x, let's first get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Combine like terms:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Simplify:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set (x = 6), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, which is x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10.

The answer is {10}."
995,"Adam bought himself some new <key_fact1>trousers for $30</key_fact1>.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

* Adam's mother gave him $6.
* His father gave him twice as much, which is 2 x $6 = $12.

So, in total, Adam received $6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18 from his parents.

Since he bought the trousers for $30 and received $18 from his parents, he must have contributed the remaining amount from his savings. Therefore:

$30 (total cost of trousers) - $18 (amount received from parents) = $12

The answer is {12}."
829,"Boris owns a chocolate factory. He <key_fact1>produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month</key_fact1>. Boris <key_fact2>produces 8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</key_fact2>.

But, the <key_fact4>third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week</key_fact4>. How much does he produce the fourth week?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to calculate his production for each week and then determine what happens in the fourth week.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate. 

The second week, he produces half as much as the first week, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.

The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 3 x 8,000 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's calculate his total production for the first three weeks:

Week 1: 8,000
Week 2: 4,000
Week 3: 24,000

Total production in the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

Since Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month and he has already produced 36,000 bars in the first three weeks, we can find out how many bars he needs to produce in the fourth week by subtracting his total production so far from the monthly target:

50,000 (monthly target) - 36,000 (total production so far) = 14,000

Therefore, Boris produces {14,000} bars of chocolate in the fourth week."

If the sessions cost <key_fact4>$125 per hour</key_fact4> how much did the physical therapy cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours John attended physical therapy and then multiply that by the hourly cost.

John went for 6 weeks, twice a week, for 2 hours at a time. So, he attended physical therapy for:

6 weeks x 2 sessions/week = 12 sessions
12 sessions x 2 hours/session = 24 hours

The total number of hours is 24. The hourly cost is $125.

Total cost = Total hours x Hourly cost
= 24 hours x $125/hour
= $3000

So, the physical therapy cost John $3000.

If the <key_fact5>gingerbread cost $6</key_fact5> and the <key_fact6>apple pie cost $15</key_fact6>, how much did Sunny earn for two days?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

## Step 1: Determine the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
Since <key_fact3>On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday</key_fact3>, and <key_fact1>On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread</key_fact1>, we can calculate that Sunny sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

## Step 2: Determine the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
Since <key_fact2>4 fewer boxes of apple pie were sold than on Sunday</key_fact2>, and <key_fact4>15 boxes of apple pie were sold on Sunday</key_fact4>, we can calculate that Sunny sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

## Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from gingerbread sales.
Sunny sold a total of 10 + 15 = 25 boxes of gingerbread over the two days. Since each box costs $6, we can calculate that Sunny earned 25 * $6 = $150 from gingerbread sales.

## Step 4: Calculate the total earnings from apple pie sales.
Sunny sold a total of 11 + 15 = 26 boxes of apple pie over the two days. Since each box costs $15, we can calculate that Sunny earned 26 * $15 = $390 from apple pie sales.

## Step 5: Add the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie to find the total amount earned.
To find the total amount earned by Sunny for the two days, we add the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie. So, $150 + $390 = $540.

The final answer is: $\boxed{540}$"

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total amount of blood for 10 sharks, we need to first determine how much blood one shark has and then multiply it by 10.

Since each whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, a shark has:

3 x 40 = 120 gallons of blood

Now, let's calculate the total amount of blood for 10 sharks:

10 x 120 = 1200 gallons of blood

So, the answer is {1200}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total earnings and then subtract the cost of parking.

Melissa is paid $15 per day. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case. So, she works for a total of 18 hours (6 hours/day × 3 days).

Her total earnings are: $15/day × 3 days = $45

She has to pay $3 for parking each day, so the total cost of parking is: $3/day × 3 days = $9

Now, let's subtract the cost of parking from her total earnings: $45 - $9 = $36

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we'll divide her net earnings by the number of hours she worked:

$36 ÷ 18 hours = $2 per hour

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.

The answer is {2}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much money Julie had left, we need to calculate the amount she spent on clothes and CDs.

First, let's calculate 20% of $500:

$500 x 0.2 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. This means she has $500 - $100 = $400 remaining.

Next, let's calculate 25% of the remaining money ($400):

$400 x 0.25 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. This means she has $400 - $100 = $300 remaining.

Therefore, Julie had {300} dollars left."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of all four children step by step.

The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child's height is:
6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so their height is:
72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so their height is:
74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so their height is:
69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches

Therefore, the fourth child's height is 72 inches."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

{50}

Step by step:
- On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
- On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
- The total time Peter exercised on Sunday and Monday is 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.
- To exercise twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined, Peter needs to exercise 2 x 39 = 78 minutes.

Since we are looking for how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal, we need to find out how much more time he needs to exercise.

To exercise twice that amount, Peter needs to exercise for 2 x 39 = 78 minutes.

Since we are looking for how many minutes Peter has to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal, we need to find out how much more time he needs to exercise. 

The total time Peter exercised on Sunday and Monday is 39 minutes.
Peter needs to exercise twice that amount, which is 2 x 39 = 78 minutes.

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 - 39 = 39 minutes more on Tuesday to reach his goal.

However, the question asks how many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal. Therefore, we need to add the time he already exercised on Sunday and Monday (39 minutes) to the additional time he needs to exercise on Tuesday (39 minutes).

The total amount of time Peter has to exercise on Tuesday is 39 + 39 = 78 minutes.

However, this is not among the answer choices. Let's re-evaluate our calculation once again.

However, the question asks how many minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal. Therefore, we need to add the time he already exercised on Sunday and Monday (39 minutes) to the additional time he needs to exercise on Tuesday (39 minutes).

The total amount of time Peter has to exercise on Tuesday is 39 + 39 = 78 minutes.

However, this is not among the answer choices. Let's re-evaluate our calculation once again.

If there are <key_fact3>10 total classes</key_fact3>, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the answer, let's calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can afford to miss.

The total cost of 10 classes is $60. If each class costs $10 or less, then the maximum number of classes Manny can miss without exceeding the average cost per class is:

$60 / $10 = 6

So, Manny can miss up to 6 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.

The answer is {6}."

Finally, <key_fact4>one person actually came by on a unicycle</key_fact4>. How many dollars did she make that day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total amount Shawnda made, we need to calculate the cost of inflating each type of vehicle and add them together.

For bicycles, there are 2 tires per bike. Since <key_fact2>5 people on bicycles came by</key_fact2>, that's a total of 10 tires (2 x 5). Each tire costs <key_fact1>25 cents to inflate</key_fact1>, so the cost for all bicycle tires is 10 x $0.25 = $2.50.

For tricycles, there are also 3 tires per bike. Since <key_fact3>3 people came by on tricycles</key_fact3>, that's a total of 9 tires (3 x 3). Each tire costs <key_fact1>25 cents to inflate</key_fact1>, so the cost for all tricycle tires is 9 x $0.25 = $2.25.

For the unicycle, there is only 1 tire. Since <key_fact4>one person came by on a unicycle</key_fact4>, that's a total of 1 tire. Each tire costs <key_fact1>25 cents to inflate</key_fact1>, so the cost for all unicycle tires is 1 x $0.25 = $0.25.

Now, let's add up the costs: $2.50 (bicycles) + $2.25 (tricycles) + $0.25 (unicycle) = $5.00.

To convert this to dollars, we can simply keep it as is since there are no cents left over.

The final answer is {5}."

How much money was Skyler's investment?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The initial investment is $1200.
2. Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount, which is:
$1200 × (2/5) = $480
So, after Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
$1200 - $480 = $720
3. Frances then invests 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is:
$720 × (2/3) = $480
So, after Frances' investment, the remaining amount is:
$720 - $480 = $240
4. Skyler's investment accounts for the rest, which is $240.

The final answer is {4}."

During the party, <key_fact4>1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten</key_fact4>. How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the ones that were eaten.

First, let's convert all the dozen measurements into a common unit. Since 1 dozen = 12, we can convert as follows:

* <key_fact1>one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies</key_fact1> = 12 brownies
* <key_fact2>1/2 a dozen brownies</key_fact2> = (1/2) × 12 = 6 brownies
* <key_fact3>4 dozen brownies</key_fact3> = 4 × 12 = 48 brownies

Now, let's add up the total number of brownies Greta received:

12 (from her batch) + 6 (from the office party) + 48 (from her friends' surprise party) = 66 brownies

Next, we need to convert <key_fact4>1 1/2 dozen brownies</key_fact4> into a common unit. Since 1 dozen = 12, we can convert as follows:

* <key_fact4>1 1/2 dozen brownies</key_fact4> = (1 + 1/2) × 12 = (3/2) × 12 = 18 brownies

Now, let's subtract the number of brownies that were eaten from the total number of brownies Greta received:

66 - 18 = 48

Therefore, Greta had {48} individual brownies left over from the entire day."

How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike, we need to calculate the distance he covered during both periods.

**First period:**
Michael rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Each time, he rode 25 kilometers.
So, the total distance in this period is:
5 rides/week × 25 km/ride = 125 km/week
For 4 weeks:
125 km/week × 4 weeks = 500 km

**Second period:**
Michael rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks. Each time, he rode 60 kilometers.
So, the total distance in this period is:
2 rides/week × 60 km/ride = 120 km/week
For 3 weeks:
120 km/week × 3 weeks = 360 km

**Total distance:**
Add the distances from both periods to find the total number of kilometers Michael rode his bike.
500 km + 360 km = 860 km

Therefore, the answer is:

How many slices of pizza were left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total number of slices eaten, we need to calculate how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate, and then add that to the number of slices the other two friends ate.

Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate a total of (2/3) * 4 pizzas = (2/3) * 48 slices = 32 slices.

The other 2 friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. They also had 4 pizzas, so they ate a total of (3/4) * 4 pizzas = (3/4) * 48 slices = 36 slices.

In total, Bryce and his friends ate 32 + 36 = 68 slices.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of pizzas eaten is 68 / 12 = 5.67 pizzas. Since you can't eat a fraction of a pizza, this means that 6 pizzas were completely eaten (because 6 * 12 = 72, which is more than 68).

This leaves 4 - 6 = -2 pizzas uneaten. However, since we can't have a negative number of pizzas, this means that there are actually 2 pizzas left over.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices left is 2 * 12 = 24.

The answer is {24}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each and then subtract the number of orchid petals from the number of daisy petals.

The 5 orchids have a total of 5 * 5 = 25 petals.
The 4 African daisies have a total of 4 * 10 = 40 petals.

Now, let's find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids:
40 (daisy petals) - 25 (orchid petals) = 15

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids."

How long does the Rubik's cube take?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total time it takes to solve the Rubik's Cube, we need to add up the times for each side.

The first side takes <key_fact1>5 minutes</key_fact1>.

The second and third sides each take twice that long, so they take 2 x 5 = 10 minutes each. Since there are two of them, we multiply by 2: 10 x 2 = 20 minutes.

The last two sides each take half as long as the first side, which is <key_fact3>2.5 minutes</key_fact3>. Again, since there are two of them, we multiply by 2: 2.5 x 2 = 5 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the times:

<key_fact1>5 minutes</key_fact1> (first side) + <key_fact2>20 minutes</key_fact2> (second and third sides) + <key_fact3>5 minutes</key_fact3> (last two sides) = 30 minutes

So, it takes a total of {30} minutes to solve the Rubik's Cube."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total amount of line needed, we first calculate how much line is required for each foot of dock. Since the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, we multiply 200 by 3.

200 * 3 = 600

This means that a total of 600 feet of line is needed to cover all the docks. However, the caretaker already has 6 feet of new line, so we need to subtract this from the total amount required.

600 - 6 = 594

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy {594} feet of line in total."

How big is Timothy's locker in cubic inches?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

* Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. So, Zack's locker must be 4 times bigger than Peter's locker: 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.
* Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. This means that Timothy's locker is twice as big as Zack's locker: 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

From each of those logs, he cuts <key_fact4>5 planks</key_fact4>. He then sells each plank for <key_fact5>$1.2</key_fact5>. How much does he make?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much John makes, we need to calculate the total number of planks and multiply it by the price per plank.

First, let's find out how many feet of the tree John can use:
<key_fact1>80-foot tree</key_fact1> * <key_fact2>80% of it</key_fact2> = 0.8 * 80 = 64 feet

Since he cuts the logs into <key_fact3>4-foot logs</key_fact3>, we need to divide the total usable length by the log length:
64 / 4 = 16 logs

From each log, he cuts <key_fact4>5 planks</key_fact4>, so the total number of planks is:
16 * 5 = 80 planks

He sells each plank for <key_fact5>$1.2</key_fact5>, so the total amount he makes is:
80 * $1.2 = $96

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box, we need to calculate the number of red shoe boxes he used for fishing.

Tim has <key_fact2>9 red shoeboxes</key_fact2>, and he uses <key_fact4>1/3 red of his shoeboxes</key_fact4> to go fishing. To find out how many red shoe boxes he used, we multiply the total number of red shoe boxes by 1/3:

<key_fact2>9 red shoeboxes</key_fact2> × <key_fact4>1/3</key_fact4> = <key_fact5>3 red shoeboxes</key_fact5>

So, Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes and 3 red shoe boxes to go fishing.

Now, let's calculate the number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box:

Blue shoe boxes: <key_fact1>7 blue shoe boxes</key_fact1> - <key_fact3>3 blue shoeboxes</key_fact3> = <key_fact6>4 blue shoe boxes</key_fact6>
Red shoe boxes: <key_fact2>9 red shoe boxes</key_fact2> - <key_fact5>3 red shoeboxes</key_fact5> = <key_fact7>6 red shoe boxes</key_fact7>

Therefore, there are 4 blue and 6 red shoe boxes left in Tim's box.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total cost of postage, we need to calculate the cost for both small and big coupons.

For small coupons: 
<key_fact1>700 small coupons</key_fact1>
Cost per coupon: <key_fact3>5 cents</key_fact3>
Total cost for small coupons = 700 * 0.05 = $35

For big coupons:

Cost per coupon: <key_fact4>15 cents</key_fact4>
Total cost for big coupons = 1400 * 0.15 = $210

If <key_fact3>the computer cost $1,100</key_fact3>, how much did one monitor cost, in dollars?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break down the information step by step:

<key_fact1>Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400</key_fact1>

This means that the total cost of all three items is $2,400.

<key_fact2>He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer</key_fact2>

Since the computer costs $1,100 (as stated in <key_fact3>the computer cost $1,100</key_fact3>), this means that the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now we know the cost of the computer and the printer. Let's subtract these from the total to find out how much was spent on monitors:

$2,400 (total) - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600

This means that together, both monitors cost $600.

Since Errol bought 2 monitors, we can divide this amount by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:

$600 ÷ 2 = $300

So, one monitor costs $300.

If <key_fact1>Kory’s dog is 60 pounds</key_fact1>, how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total weight of Elijah's dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each of his dogs.

Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, this means Elijah's first dog weighs:

60 / 4 = 15 pounds

He also has another dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog, which means it weighs:

60 / 2 = 30 pounds

So, the total weight of Elijah's dogs is:

15 + 30 = 45 pounds

Since we are asked to find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether, we need to add Kory's dog (which weighs 60 pounds) to the total weight of Elijah's dogs.

Total weight = 45 (Elijah's dogs) + 60 (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we first need to calculate their total weekly insect consumption. Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week and there are 10 ducks in the flock, the total weekly consumption is:

10 ducks * 3.5 pounds/duck = 35 pounds

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can divide the total weekly consumption by 7 to find out how many pounds they need per day:

35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs {5} pounds of insects per day."

How much profit did he make?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find Josh's profit, we need to calculate the total value of the house after the repairs and then subtract the original cost.

The original cost is $80,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the new value is 2.5 times the original cost (100% + 150% = 250%, or 2.5 times).

So, the total value after repairs is:
$80,000 x 2.5 = $200,000

Now, we subtract the original cost from this amount to find Josh's profit:
$200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $120,000.

Let's break down the information step by step:

* Bethany can run 10 laps.
* Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.
* Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.
* Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.

To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

10 (Bethany's laps) - 5 (Quinn's laps) = 5

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

If the <key_fact3>final design is 140cm long</key_fact3> then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's denote the original length of the dress as x.

Since Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, the new length after extension is x + 0.5x = 1.5x.

She also added 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the final design is 1.5x + 20 = 140cm.

Now we can solve for x:

1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

1.5x = 120

Divide by 1.5:

x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

The answer is {80}."

The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, and food costs an additional $5 per person.

The second venue charges $25 per person, but this includes food.

To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation. Let x be the number of guests.

For the first venue, the total cost is $200 (flat fee) + $5x (food).

For the second venue, the total cost is $25x (since food is included).

We want to find out when these two costs are equal:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides gives us:

$200 = $20x

Dividing both sides by $20 gives us:

10 = x

So, Mark needs 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the answer, we need to follow the steps:

1. Find out how much Kassidy has:
<key_fact2>Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia</key_fact2>, so Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

2. Find out how much Rayna has:
<key_fact1>Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy</key_fact1>, so Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.

3. Add together the money of all three:
Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has $90, and Rayna has $150, so in total they have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

4. Divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much each would get if they shared equally:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them up.

First, let's determine the cost of a watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, a watermelon costs 3 x $15 = $45.

Next, let's find the cost of an orange. An orange costs 5 dollars less than what a watermelon costs, so an orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.

Now we can calculate the total amount Dillon will spend:

4 watermelons at $45 each: 4 x $45 = $180
20 peppers at $15 each: 20 x $15 = $300
10 oranges at $40 each: 10 x $40 = $400

Adding these amounts together, we get:
$180 + $300 + $400 = $880

So the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880.

Betty has 5 parts which is 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts which is 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

## Step 4: Find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty
To find this, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has. So, 90 - 75 = 15.

The final answer is: {15}"

{120}

Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples per day, together they eat 8 apples per day. In 30 days, they will have eaten 8 * 30 = 240 apples. However, the question asks for the total number of apples they eat in 30 days, not the combined amount they eat per day. Since Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples per day, the correct calculation is (Marin + Nancy) * 30 = 2 * 30 = 60 people eating 4 apples/day, so 60*4=240 apples for one person, but since there are two people, it's 240*2=480."

How many girl Pomeranians does Jana have?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

{9}

Step 1: Determine how many puppies are Pomeranians. Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of puppies (27) by 2/3.

Step 2: Calculate the number of Pomeranians. 
27 * 2/3 = 18

Step 3: Determine how many of the Pomeranians are girls. Since one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of Pomeranians (18) by 1/3.

Step 4: Calculate the number of girl Pomeranians.

If <key_fact5>each adult gets 6 chocolate bars</key_fact5> and the rest are to be shared equally among the children, how many will each child get?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
2. There are 8 packets in total, so the total number of chocolate bars is: 8 packets x 5 chocolate bars/packet = 40 chocolate bars
3. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults, so the total number of chocolate bars given to adults is: 4 adults x 6 chocolate bars/adult = 24 chocolate bars
4. The remaining chocolate bars for the children are: 40 total chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars given to adults = 16 chocolate bars
5. There are 8 children, and they will share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among themselves.
6. To find out how many chocolate bars each child will get, divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children: 16 chocolate bars ÷ 8 children = 2 chocolate bars per child

How many kilograms will James have left?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much James has left, we need to first calculate how much Peter and Paul want.

Peter wants a quarter (1/4) of the apples. Since they bought 12 kg of apples, Peter wants:

12 kg * 1/4 = 3 kg

Paul wants 1/3 of the apples. So, he wants:

12 kg * 1/3 = 4 kg

Now, let's add up how much Peter and Paul want in total:

3 kg (Peter) + 4 kg (Paul) = 7 kg

This means that together, Peter and Paul want 7 kg of apples.

Since they started with 12 kg of apples, we subtract the amount they want from the total to find out how much James has left:

12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg

So, James will have {5} kg of apples left."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

## Step 1: Determine the total amount of straw given to hamsters and rabbits.
The total amount of straw given to hamsters is 10 cages * 5 pieces per cage = 50. The total amount of straw given to rabbits is 20.

## Step 2: Calculate the total amount of straw given to small rodents excluding rats.
Total straw for hamsters and rabbits = 50 + 20 = 70

## Step 3: Subtract the straw given to hamsters and rabbits from the total straw distributed among small rodents to find out how much was given to rats.
Straw given to rats = Total straw - Straw given to hamsters and rabbits = 160 - 70 = 90

## Step 4: Determine the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total amount of straw given to rats by the amount each rat is given.
Number of rats per cage = Straw given to rats / Straw per rat = 90 / 6 = 15

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the amount of money she would lose by doing her taxes herself and then subtract the cost of hiring the accountant.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work. This means she'll miss out on earning $35/hour for those 3 hours. So, the total amount she'll lose is:

$35/hour * 3 hours = $105

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many letters were delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then add them together.

On Monday, 425 letters were delivered.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 425/5 = 85. So, on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday (102) is 2 x 102 = 204. So, on Wednesday, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Now, let's add up the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:

425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736

So, the post office delivered a total of {736} letters on Monday - Wednesday."

How many hours does he need to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work.

George needs 2 implants, each with a base price of $2000. So, the total cost for both implants is:
$2000 x 2 = $4000

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. This means the total cost for that implant is:
$2000 + $500 = $2500

Since George only needs to pay for one implant with a crown, we subtract this amount from the total cost of both implants:
$4000 - $2500 = $1500

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs to pay:
$1500 - $600 = $900

He makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work before he has enough money to pay for the dental work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
$900 ÷ $15 = 60

How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break down the information step by step:

1. There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each.
2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally among the 10 stalls.

Since there were originally 200 cows (10 stalls x 20 cows each) and Mr. Sylas bought 40 more, the total number of cows is now 240.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we need to know how many cows each stall has after the new cows are added. Since there are 10 stalls and a total of 240 cows, we can divide 240 by 10 to get the number of cows per stall:

240 ÷ 10 = 24

So each stall now has 24 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall (24) by the number of stalls (8):

24 x 8 = 192

Therefore, there are 192 cows in 8 of the stalls.

How many cookies do they have in total?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has: Katarina = Max - 5
2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: Max = Cookie Monster + 12
3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: Summer = Max + 23

We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies, so we can set up an equation:

Katarina = Max - 5
68 = Max - 5
Max = 73

Now that we know Max has 73 cookies, we can find the Cookie Monster's cookie count:

Max = Cookie Monster + 12
73 = Cookie Monster + 12
Cookie Monster = 61

And finally, we can calculate Summer's cookie count:

Summer = Max + 23
Summer = 73 + 23
Summer = 96

Now that we have all the individual counts, let's add them up to find the total number of cookies:

Katarina: 68
Max: 73
Cookie Monster: 61
Summer: 96
Total: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

So, they have a total of {298} cookies."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D.

We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write an equation:

C + D = 180 ... (1)

We also know that the total number of bumps is 304. Since each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump, we can write another equation:

2C + D = 304 ... (2)

Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve it by subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
C = 124

Now that we know the number of camels, we can substitute this value into equation (1) to find the number of dromedaries:

C + D = 180
124 + D = 180
D = 56

So, there are {56} dromedaries in the herd."

= 50 km/hr × 72 hr
= 3600 km

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) he has covered.
Percentage = (Distance covered / Total Distance) × 100
= (3600 / 6000) × 100
= 60%

So, Michael covers 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas in 3 days.

The answer is {60}."

Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many miles John drives in a month, we need to calculate the distance for one round trip and then multiply it by 2 (since he visits twice a month).

The time taken for one way is 2 hours. The speed is 70 mph.

Distance = Speed × Time
= 70 mph × 2 hours
= 140 miles

Since this is for one way, the total distance for a round trip would be:
140 miles (one way) + 140 miles (returning) = 280 miles

John visits his parents twice a month. So, we multiply the round-trip distance by 2:

280 miles × 2 = 560 miles

Therefore, John drives 560 miles in a month when visiting his parents.

The answer is {560}."

The <key_fact3>floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is</key_fact3>. How high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. The house is 7 times as high as Mattison.
   Since <key_fact1>Mattison is 60 inches tall</key_fact1>, his house is 7 * 60 = 420 inches tall in total.

2. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.
   This means the height of the first floor (from floor to ceiling) is 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

3. To find the height from the second floor's floor to the roof, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.
   So, the height from the second floor's floor to the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.

The answer is {240}."

What will be the difference in his weight at the end of <key_fact3>5 weeks</key_fact3> between the two breakfast options?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks, we need to calculate how much he would weigh if he ate Cheerios every day for breakfast and how much he would weigh if he ate donuts every day for breakfast.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will have lost:
1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. After 5 weeks, he will have gained:
1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is:
8.75 pounds (donuts) - 6.25 pounds (Cheerios) = 2.50 pounds

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

<key_fact2>He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour</key_fact2>

This means Colby completes 40 packages per hour (since 50 - 10 = 40).

Now, let's calculate how many packages he completes in an 8-hour workday:
40 packages/hour × 8 hours = 320 packages

Since <key_fact1>he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes</key_fact1>, we can multiply the number of packages by his hourly wage to find out how much money he earns in a typical eight-hour workday:
320 packages × $0.20/package = $64

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.

The answer is {64}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total amount Mandy owes, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the original $100.

The monthly interest rate is 2%, so the total interest for 3 months would be:

$100 x (1 + 0.02) = $100 x 1.06 = $106

Now, let's add this interest to the original amount:

$106 (interest) + $100 (original amount) = $206

So, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $206.

The answer is {206}."

If he wants to make <key_fact3>80 meatballs for the cookout</key_fact3>, how much of his secret seasoning will he need?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To determine how much seasoning Aiden needs, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required based on the number of meatballs he wants to make.

Since Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat and he wants to make 80 meatballs, we can divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can multiply this amount by the seasoning required per pound to find out how much seasoning he'll need:

5 pounds × 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons

So, Aiden will need {10} tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many face masks Johnny bought, we need to follow the information given in the key facts.

First, we know that Mike bought 5 face masks. Then, we are told that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

Thrice as many as Mike means 3 times the number of face masks Mike bought. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, thrice as many would be:

5 x 3 = 15

Now, we need to add 2 more to this total to find out how many face masks Johnny bought:

15 + 2 = 17

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The answer is {17}."

To find out how many minutes Charisma has walked, we need to calculate the total number of hours she worked and then multiply that by 5 (since she walks for 5 minutes every hour).

Charisma works 8 hours a day. She worked for 5 days.

Total hours worked = 8 hours/day * 5 days = 40 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total hours to minutes by multiplying:

Total minutes walked = 40 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 2400 minutes

The answer is {2400}."

If <key_fact3>John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day</key_fact3>, how many grams of protein does he get per week?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the amount of protein in the mushrooms he eats daily and then multiply it by 7.

Since <key_fact1>a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams</key_fact1> and has <key_fact2>3 grams of protein</key_fact2>, this means that for every 100 grams, there are 3 grams of protein. 

John eats <key_fact3>200 grams of mushrooms every day</key_fact3>. To find out how many grams of protein he gets daily, we can set up a proportion:

(3 grams of protein / 100 grams) = x grams of protein / 200 grams

Cross-multiplying gives us:
3 * 200 = 100x
600 = 100x
Dividing both sides by 100 gives us:
x = 6 grams of protein per day

Since John eats this amount every day, we can multiply the daily amount by 7 to get his weekly intake:

6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams/week

There are 40 pupils in total.

Half of the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils who like blue.

The remaining number of pupils is 40 - 20 = 20.

One-fourth of the remaining (which is 20) likes green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 pupils who like green.

The rest of the remaining (which is 20 - 5 = 15) likes yellow.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we need to add their silver and gold pesos.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. 

Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is 2 * 50 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

The total number of silver pesos they have together is 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150.

The total number of gold pesos they have together is 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200.

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 150 silver pesos + 200 gold pesos = 350 pesos.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the total number of gems, we need to add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.

First, let's find the number of rubies:
<key_fact2>35 fewer rubies than diamonds</key_fact2>
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35

How many years separate the age of the two now?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

In 5 years, Jame will turn 27. This means that currently, Jame is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. Let's call the cousin's current age ""x"". In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

The statement says that in 8 years, the cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So we can set up an equation:

Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 x Jame's age in 8 years - 5
x + 8 = 2(30) - 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x + 8 = 60 - 5
x + 8 = 55
x = 47

So currently, the cousin is 47 years old.

Now, let's find out how many years separate their ages. Jame is 22 years old and his cousin is 47 years old. The difference in their ages is:
47 - 22 = 25

Therefore, there are {25} years separating their current ages."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

Since Robert has 30 cherries, and he has 10 more than Richard, we can say that Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

We know that the total number of cherries is 60. Since Robert has 30 cherries, and Richard has 20 cherries, the remaining cherries are shared between Jerry and Robert. Let's call the number of cherries Jerry has ""x"". Then, the number of cherries Robert has (in addition to his initial 30) is also ""x"".

The total number of cherries is 60, so we can set up an equation:

30 + x = 60 - 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 + x = 40

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:

x = 10

So Jerry has 10 cherries.

Now, let's find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We know that Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. Therefore, the difference is:

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

There are 700 bees in total.

Let the number of baby bees be x. Then, the number of worker bees is 2x (since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).

The number of queens is x/2 (since there are twice as many babies as queens).

We know that the sum of all these bees equals 700:

x + 2x + x/2 = 700

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x + 4x + x = 1400

Combine like terms:

7x = 1400

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 200

Now that we know there are 200 baby bees, we can find the number of worker bees:

Number of worker bees = 2x
= 2(200)
= 400

So, there are {400} worker bees."

Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

## Step 1: Calculate the total time for the well-rounded team
The well-rounded team has four members who each run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. To find the total time for this team, we multiply the time per runner by the number of runners: 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

## Step 2: Calculate the time for the less well-rounded team's first runner
The less well-rounded team's first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds.

## Step 3: Calculate the time for the less well-rounded team's second runner
Each subsequent runner on the less well-rounded team is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the second runner will be 3 seconds faster than the first runner, so they will run their 400 meter leg in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.

## Step 4: Calculate the time for the less well-rounded team's third runner
Following the same logic as step 3, the third runner will be 3 seconds faster than the second runner. Therefore, they will run their 400 meter leg in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.

## Step 5: Calculate the time for the less well-rounded team's fourth runner
The fourth runner on the less well-rounded team will be 3 seconds faster than the third runner. So, they will run their 400 meter leg in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

## Step 6: Calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team
To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we add up the times for each of their runners: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

## Step 7: Find the difference in total times between the two teams
The faster team's total time is 220 seconds. The less well-rounded team's total time is 222 seconds. To find out how many seconds the faster team will win by, we subtract their total time from that of the less well-rounded team: 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.

How many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow the steps described:

1. Calculate two-thirds of 60 (the total number of loaves) which is sold in the morning:
   <key_fact2>Two-thirds of the loaves</key_fact2> = (2/3) * 60
   = 40

2. Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total to find out how many are left for the afternoon and evening:
   Total - Morning sales = Left for afternoon and evening
   60 - 40 = 20

3. Since half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we need to divide the remaining loaves by 2:
   Half of the remaining loaves = 20 / 2
   = 10

Therefore, {10} loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon."

The groomer offers him a <key_fact2>30% discount</key_fact2> for being a new customer. How much does the grooming cost?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 30% of the original price and subtract it from the original price.

The original price is $100.
The discount is 30%, which means 0.3 x $100 = $30.

So, the discounted price is:
$100 - $30 = $70

Therefore, the grooming cost is {70}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

## Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
First, we need to find out what 100% of the school population is. Since 40% equals 240 boys, we can set up an equation where x represents the total number of students.

## Step 2: Set up the equation for finding the total number of students.
0.4x = 240

## Step 3: Solve for x to find the total number of students in the school.
Divide both sides by 0.4 to isolate x:
x = 240 / 0.4
x = 600

## Step 4: Calculate the number of girls in the school.
Now that we know there are a total of 600 students, and 40% of them are boys (which is 240), we can find out how many girls there are by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students.

## Step 5: Subtract the number of boys from the total to find the number of girls.
Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The final answer is: {360}"

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many trees will be planted, we need to calculate the total number of children and teachers, then multiply that by the number of trees each one plants.

First, let's find the total number of students:
<key_fact2>average of 25 students</key_fact2> per class * <key_fact1>40 classes</key_fact1> = 1000 students

Since each teacher has 3 classes, we can multiply the number of teachers by 3 to get the total number of teachers in the school:
<key_fact3>3 teachers per class</key_fact3> * <key_fact1>40 classes</key_fact1> = 120 teachers

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by students and teachers:
1000 students * <key_fact4>each child plants a tree</key_fact4> = 1000 trees
120 teachers * <key_fact5>each teacher plants 2 trees</key_fact5> = 240 trees

Adding these together, we get the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign:
1000 + 240 = 1240

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many pages Judy read in the first week, we need to calculate how many minutes she spent reading.

Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 nights in a week, she spent a total of:

15 minutes/night × 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now that we know she spent 105 minutes reading in the first week, we can find out how many pages she read. We're told that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.

First, let's calculate how many sets of 1.5 minutes are there in 105 minutes:

105 minutes ÷ 1.5 minutes = 70

Since each set of 1.5 minutes contains 2 pages, we multiply the number of sets by 2 to find out how many pages she read in the first week:

70 × 2 = 140 pages

Now that we know Judy read 140 pages in the first week and 100 pages in the second week, we can add these numbers together to get the total number of pages she read in two weeks.

Total pages = 140 + 100 = 240 pages

How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break down the information step by step:

1. <key_fact1>One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs</key_fact1>.
2. <key_fact2>Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches</key_fact2>, which means Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
3. Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, the total number of meatballs in the 7 sub sandwiches is 7 x 4 = 28 meatballs.
4. <key_fact3>Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches</key_fact3>, which means Mark ate 4 x 4 = 16 meatballs.
5. So, after Mark ate his share, the number of meatballs remaining is 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs.

However, it's stated that <key_fact4>Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches</key_fact4>, which means Sidney actually ordered a total of 7 + 3 = 10 meatball sub sandwiches. This changes the calculation:

1. The original 7 sub sandwiches had 28 meatballs.
2. The additional 3 sub sandwiches also have 3 x 4 = 12 meatballs.

So, the total number of meatballs in all the sub sandwiches is 28 + 12 = 40 meatballs.

Since Mark ate 16 meatballs, the number of meatballs remaining is 40 - 16 = 24 meatballs.

The answer is {24}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's calculate the total amount Keegan and Tashay have already earned:

$83 (Keegan) + $91 (Tashay) = $174

To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract this amount from their goal of $200:

$200 - $174 = $26

So, they still need to earn $26 to reach their goal.

If the <key_fact2>length of his room is 3 yards</key_fact2>, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the perimeter, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, the length is:

3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet

We know that the area (length x width) is 360 square feet. Let's use this information to find the width.

Area = Length x Width
360 = 9 x Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40 feet

Now, we can find the perimeter using the formula:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
= 2(9 + 40)
= 2 x 49
= 98 feet

The answer is {98}."

How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jay makes 20 snowballs per hour.
2. However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, which means that for every 30 minutes (or half an hour), 4 snowballs are made but 2 melt.

So, in a half-hour period, Jay effectively gains 2 snowballs (20 - 18 = 2).

To find out how many half-hour periods it will take to reach 60 snowballs, we can divide the target number of snowballs by the effective gain per half hour:

60 / 2 = 30

Since each half-hour period is equivalent to 0.5 hours, we multiply the number of half-hour periods by 0.5 to get the total time in hours:

30 * 0.5 = 15

Therefore, it will take Jay 15 hours before he has 60 snowballs.

The answer is {15}."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much James spends on candles, we need to determine the total number of candles he buys and then multiply that by the cost per pack.

Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the younger son is 8 years old (12 - 4 = 8).

James needs birthday candles for both sons. Therefore, he needs a total of 2 packs of candles (1 pack for each son).

Each pack contains 5 candles, so James buys 10 candles in total.

The cost per pack is $3, and since James buys 2 packs, the total cost will be:

2 packs x $3/pack = $6

So, James spends {6} dollars on candles."

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the total distance each of them traveled.

Matteo's distance = speed × time
= 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
= 220 miles

Shandy's distance = speed × time
= 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
= 450 miles

Now, let's find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo:
Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
= 450 miles - 220 miles
= 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to calculate the total amount the vendor made from selling the watermelons and then divide that by the number of watermelons.

The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold them at a profit of 25%, which means he made a 25% profit on the cost price.

First, let's find the total amount he made:

Cost price = $80
Profit percentage = 25%
Profit amount = Cost price * (Profit percentage / 100)
= $80 * (25/100)
= $20

Total selling price = Cost price + Profit amount
= $80 + $20
= $100

Now, let's find the selling price of each watermelon:

Number of watermelons sold = 50
Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons sold
= $100 / 50
= $2

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The answer is {2}."

To determine the number of boxes needed, we first calculate the total number of smores required.

9 kids want 2 smores each, so that's 9 x 2 = 18 smores.
6 adults will eat 1 smore each, adding another 6 smores to the total.
In total, they need 18 + 6 = 24 smores.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we divide the total number of smores needed by 8:
24 ÷ 8 = 3

Now, since there are 3 sleeves in a box, and they need 3 sleeves to make 24 smores, they will need:

3 ÷ 3 = 1

So, they will need {1} box of graham crackers."

If he <key_fact2>buys 25 pens</key_fact2> and then uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, how many total pens does he get to have?
--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

Let's break it down step by step:

Ram buys 25 pens initially.

He can mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new full pen.

To find out how many total pens he gets, we need to know how many sets of 5 empty pens he has. Since he buys 25 pens initially and uses them to make new pens when the ink runs low, it implies that all 25 pens are used up in making new pens.

So, for every 5 empty pens, he gets 1 full pen. To find out how many sets of 5 empty pens he has, we divide the total number of pens (25) by 5:

25 ÷ 5 = 5

This means that Ram has 5 sets of 5 empty pens each.

For each set of 5 empty pens, he gets 1 new full pen. Therefore, he gets 5 new full pens from these 5 sets.

Initially, he had 25 pens. After using them to make new pens, he gets an additional 5 new full pens. So, the total number of pens he has now is:

25 (initial pens) + 5 (new pens) = 30

Therefore, Ram gets a total of {30} pens."
