--------------- Extracted Question ---------------

To find out how much money John is missing, we need to determine how much of the trip cost he still needs to cover.

The school will cover half the cost of the trip. Since the trip costs $300, half of that would be:

$300 / 2 = $150

This means the school will contribute $150 towards the trip.

John has already saved $50, so we need to find out how much more he needs to raise to cover his share of the remaining cost.

The total cost of the trip is $300, and the school is covering $150. This leaves:

$300 - $150 = $150

as the amount John still needs to cover.

Since John has already saved $50, we subtract this from the remaining amount he needs to cover:

$150 - $50 = $100

Therefore, John is missing $100.

The answer is {100}."
