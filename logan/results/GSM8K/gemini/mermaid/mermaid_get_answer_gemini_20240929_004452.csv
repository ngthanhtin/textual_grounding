    A --> C[Egg Usage]
    C --> D[Personal Consumption]
    C --> E[Baking]

    B --> B1[16 eggs/day]
    D --> D1[3 eggs/day]
    E --> E1[4 eggs/day]
    F --> F1[$2/egg]
Answer_Reasoning: Janet's ducks lay <B1>16 eggs per day</B1>. She uses <D1>3 eggs/day</D1> for breakfast and another <E1>4 eggs/day</E1> baking. This leaves 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs for sale.  She sells the remaining eggs for <F1>$2/egg</F1>, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day.
