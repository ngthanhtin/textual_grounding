<question>A custodian has to clean a school with 80 classrooms. They have 5 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per classroom. If they work an 8 hour day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms?</question><key_facts>
<fact_1>a school with 80 classrooms</fact_1>
<fact_2>5 days to get it done</fact_2>
<fact_3>It takes them 15 minutes per classroom</fact_3>
<fact_4>They work an 8 hour day</fact_4>
</key_facts>

<answer_reasoning>
The custodian has <fact_1>80 classrooms</fact_1> to clean and it takes them <fact_3>15 minutes</fact_3> per classroom. Therefore, they have to spend a total of 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes cleaning the school. Since they are given <fact_2>5 days</fact_2>, they will be working for a total of 5 * 8 hours = 40 hours in those five days. The time spent cleaning classrooms is therefore 1200 minutes / (5*8) = 24 minutes per day. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the custodian spends 24/60 = 0.4 hours per day on this task. The percentage of their working day spent on cleaning is therefore 0.4 * 100% = 40%.
