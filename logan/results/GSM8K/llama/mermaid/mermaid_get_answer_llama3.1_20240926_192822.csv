0,Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Here is a mermaid diagram representing the key facts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Janet's Ducks]
    B[Egg Laying]
    C[Breakfast Consumption]
    D[Muffin Baking]
    E[Farmers Market Sales]

    A --> B1[16 eggs per day]
    
    B1 --> C1[3 eaten for breakfast]
    B1 --> D1[4 baked into muffins]
    
    A --> E1[Remaining eggs sold at market]
```

Now, let's use these nodes to reason out the final answer:

Since Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day (B1), and she eats 3 of them for breakfast (C1) and bakes 4 into muffins (D1), that means she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left over. 

She sells these leftover eggs at the farmers' market daily for $2 per egg (E). So, to find out how much money Janet makes every day from selling these eggs, we multiply the number of leftover eggs by the price per egg: 9 x $2 = $18.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final_Answer: {18}"
1,A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,"Here is the mermaid diagram representing the key facts:
```

    A[Robe Production]
    B[Bolts of Blue Fiber]
    C[Bolts of White Fiber]
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    
    B --> D[2 bolts blue fiber]
    C --> E[Half that much white fiber = 1 bolt white fiber]
```
Key Facts:

* 2 bolts of blue fiber are required.
* Half that much white fiber is required, which is equivalent to 1 bolt of white fiber.

Answer Reasoning:
For the production of a robe, it requires <D>2</D> bolts of blue fiber. It also requires <E>1</E> bolt of white fiber. Therefore, in total, it takes <D+E>2+1=3</D+E> bolts to produce a robe."
