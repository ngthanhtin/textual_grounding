0,Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Here is the mermaid diagram representing the key facts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Janet's Duck Egg Sales]
    B[Ducks Lay Eggs]
    C[Eggs Consumed]
    D[Muffins Sold]
    E[Farmers Market Sale]
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    A --> D
    A --> E
    
    B --> B1[16 eggs per day]
    C --> C1[3 eggs for breakfast]
    C --> C2[4 eggs for muffins]
    E --> E1[$2 per egg]
```

Using the nodes from this graph, here is my answer reasoning:

There are <B>16</B>/<C1>3 + 4</C1> = 9 eggs remaining that Janet sells at the farmers' market daily. Janet makes $2 * 9 = $18 every day selling duck eggs at the farmers' market.

1,A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,"Here is the mermaid diagram representing the key facts:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Robe Requirements]
    B[Blue Fiber]
    C[White Fiber]
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    
    B --> D[2 bolts]
    C --> E[1/2 of blue fiber]
```

Answer Reasoning:

We know that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber (D) and half that much white fiber, which is equivalent to 1/2 * 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. To find the total number of bolts required, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together.

2,"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","Here are the key facts extracted from the question in a hierarchical format through a mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Josh's House Flipping]
    B[Bought House]
    C[Put in Repairs]
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    
    B --> D[Houses price was $80,000]
    C --> E[$50,000 repairs]
```

The key facts are:

* The house was bought for $80,000 (D)
* Josh put in $50,000 worth of repairs (E)

Since the value of the house increased by 150% after the repairs, we can calculate the new value as follows:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Value]
    B[Houses original price]
    
    A --> C[1.5*B]
```

We can use the key facts to cite specific values in our answer reasoning.

Answer Reasoning:
The house was bought for <D>$80,000</D>. After the repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%, which means it became 1.5 times its original price (C). Therefore, the new value is $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000.

To find Josh's profit, we subtract the total amount he spent ($80,000 + $50,000) from the new value:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Total Cost]
    B[New Value]
    
    A --> C[$80,000 + $50,000]
```

The total cost is <C>$130,000</C>. Therefore, Josh's profit is $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.

However, since a negative profit doesn't make sense in this context, there must be some mistake in the given information. Perhaps we should re-evaluate the problem statement to see if we can find any alternative solution.

3,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?,"Here are the key facts represented in a hierarchical format through a mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[James' Running Schedule]
    B[Sprints per Week]
    C[Meters per Sprint]
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    
    B --> B1[3 times a week]
    B --> B2[3 sprints]
    
    C --> C1[60 meters each sprint]
```

Here are the key facts extracted from the diagram:

* James runs 3 times a week (B1)
* Each time he runs, he does 3 sprints (B2)
* He runs 60 meters per sprint (C1)

Using these nodes to cite specific facts in my answer reasoning:

Answer Reasoning:
Since James runs 3 times a week (B1), and each time he runs, he does 3 sprints (B2), we can calculate the total number of sprints per week by multiplying 3 times (the number of times he runs) by 3 (the number of sprints per run). This gives us 9 sprints per week.

Now, to find out how many meters James runs in a week, we multiply the number of meters he runs per sprint (C1) by the total number of sprints per week. Since he runs 60 meters each sprint (C1), and there are 9 sprints per week, we can calculate that James runs 540 meters per week.

4,"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","Here are the key facts from the question represented in a hierarchal format through a mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Wendi Feeds Chickens]
    A --> B[Morning Meal]
    A --> C[Afternoon Meal]
    A --> D[Total Feed Needed]
    
    B --> E[15 cups of feed]
    C --> F[25 cups of feed]
    
    D --> G[Size of Wendi's flock]
```

Here are the specific facts from this graph:

* Each chicken needs 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per meal.
* The morning meal is 15 cups of feed.
* The afternoon meal is 25 cups of feed.
* The size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens.

Using these nodes, I will now answer the question. 

Answer Reasoning: 
The total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is <E>15</E> + <F>25</F> = 40 cups of feed. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per meal, the chickens have been fed a total of <G>20 * 3 * 2</G> = 120 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon meals combined (there are 2 meals). Since we want to find out how many cups Wendi needs for the final meal of the day, we should subtract from this amount. The number of cups Wendi needs for the final meal is <D>120 - 40</D> = 80 cups of feed.

Final_Answer: {80}"
