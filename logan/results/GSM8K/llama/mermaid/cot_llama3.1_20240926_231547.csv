0,Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.

Now, let's calculate how much money she makes from selling the remaining eggs:

Number of eggs sold: 9
Price per egg: $2

Daily earnings: 9 x $2 = $18

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

1,A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,"The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. This means that the amount of white fiber is equal to half of the amount of blue fiber.

Since there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, half of that would be:

2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt

So, in total, it takes 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts of fiber.

2,"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","To determine how much profit Josh made from flipping the house, let's break down the steps:

1. Josh buys a house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs.

2. This increased the value of the house by 150%. Let's find out what the new value is. We can do this by calculating 150% of the original cost, which is ($80,000 x 1.5) = $120,000. The total amount Josh invested in the house, including repairs, is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

3. Now, let's calculate how much profit Josh made by selling the house for its new value minus the cost of investing in it: Profit = New Value - Cost = $120,000 - $130,000.

Since we cannot make a negative amount, there seems to be an issue with the calculation provided above, indicating that Josh actually incurred a loss rather than making a profit.

However, let's correct this and properly calculate the profit:

Firstly, calculating 150% of the original cost of $80,000:
$80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000

To find the value added by the repairs, we subtract the initial purchase price from this amount:
$120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000

This means that Josh added $40,000 in value to the house through his repairs.

Finally, calculating the profit by subtracting the total cost (purchase price + repairs) from the new value:
Profit = New Value - Total Cost
= $120,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000)
= $120,000 - $130,000

This shows a loss of $10,000."
3,James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.  He runs 60 meters each sprint.  How many total meters does he run a week?,"Let's break down James' running routine:

* He decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week, which means he runs a total of 3 x 3 = 9 sets of 3 sprints.
* Each sprint is 60 meters long, so the total distance he runs in one set of 3 sprints is 60 x 3 = 180 meters.
* Since James runs 9 sets of 3 sprints, the total distance he runs a week is 9 x 180 = 1620 meters.

Answer: {1620}"
4,"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to determine how much feed she has given them so far and subtract that from the total amount of feed they will consume in a day.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi gives her chickens in a day. She gives them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of:

15 + 25 = 40 cups

Next, we need to find out how many cups each chicken needs per day. Since she has 20 chickens and each gets 3 cups of feed per meal (three meals a day), the total number of cups each chicken needs is:

3 * 3 = 9 cups per chicken per day

Now, let's calculate the total amount of feed her entire flock needs in a day:

20 chickens * 9 cups/chicken = 180 cups

Finally, to determine how many cups Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day (which we're assuming is evening), we subtract the amount she has already given them from the total they need for the day:

180 - 40 = 140 cups

So, in the final meal of the day, Wendi needs to give her 20 chickens a total of 140 cups of chicken feed.

Answer: {140}"
