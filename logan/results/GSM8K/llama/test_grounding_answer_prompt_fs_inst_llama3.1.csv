For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?

every 12 cans you recycle [1]
you receive $0.50 [2]
every 5 kilograms of newspapers [3]
you receive $1.50 [4]
144 cans [5]
20 kilograms of newspapers [6]

Answer:

To find out how much money the family received, we first need to calculate how many sets of 12 cans and 5 kilograms of newspapers they collected.

There are <s>[5] 144</s>/<s>[1] 12</s> = 12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected. So, the family would receive <s>[2] $0.50</s> x 12 = $6 for the cans.

There are <s>[6] 20</s>/5 = 4 sets of <s>[3] 5 kilograms of newspapers</s> that the family collected. So, the family would receive <s>[4] $1.50</s> x 4 = $6 for the newspapers.

Therefore, the total amount of money the family received is $6 (from cans) + $6 (from newspapers) = $12.

The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.

a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20 [1]
the cost of buying a hat is $10 [2]
went to the shop with a $100 bill [3]
two wooden toys [4]
three hats [5]

Answer:

When Kendra bought <s>[4] two toys</s>, she paid 2*<s>[1] $20</s> = $40. Since the price of a hat is <s>[2] $10</s>, when Kendra bought <s>[5] three hats</s>, she paid 3*<s>[2] $10</s> = $30.

The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is $40+$30 = $70. From the <s>[3] $100 bill</s>, Kendra received change worth $100-$70 = $30.

Reformatted Question:

Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?

Each tire costs <s>[1] $0.25</s> to inflate.

Five people on bicycles had two tires inflated each, so the total cost for bike tires is 5*2*<s>[1] $0.25</s> = $2.50.

Three people with tricycles had three tires inflated each, so the total cost for tricycle tires is 3*3*<s>[1] $0.25</s> = $2.25.

One person on a unicycle only had one tire inflated, which costs <s>[1] $0.25</s>.

The total amount of money Shawnda made that day is $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.
