509,"A 21-year-old old college student is brought to the emergency department by his roommates because he has been ""acting strangely."" Over the last 7 months, he has claimed to hear voices telling him that he must prepare for the end of the world. He used to be a straight A student but started failing exams recently due to his erratic behavior. Furthermore, there are periods of time where he does not sleep for several days and redecorates the entire apartment. During those times he spends huge amounts of money on online shopping. These periods usually last for about 2 weeks and happen every other month. On physical exam, he appears unkept and irritated. He seems to respond to invisible stimuli, and he jumps from topic to topic without clear focus. Which of the following is most consistent with this patient's presentation?
A) Bipolar with psychotic features
B) Brief psychotic disorder
C) Schizoaffective disorder
D) Schizophreniform disorder
E) Schizotypal personality disorder","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation:

1. **Age and Duration of Symptoms**: The patient is 21 years old, and his symptoms have been ongoing for 7 months. This duration is significant for differentiating between various psychiatric conditions.

2. **Nature of Symptoms**:
   - **Hearing Voices**: This is a classic symptom of psychosis, indicating a break from reality.
   - **Preparing for the End of the World**: This could be a delusional belief, further supporting the presence of psychotic symptoms.
   - **Erratic Behavior, Lack of Sleep, Excessive Spending**: These symptoms suggest periods of mania or hypomania, which are characteristic of mood disorders.
   - **Decline in Functioning**: The patient's academic decline and erratic behavior indicate a significant impairment in social and occupational functioning.

3. **Pattern of Symptoms**: The symptoms seem to occur in episodes, with periods of relative normalcy in between. This episodic nature, combined with the presence of both psychotic and manic/hypomanic symptoms, is crucial for diagnosis.

Given these observations, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Bipolar with Psychotic Features**: This diagnosis would be appropriate if the patient's primary symptoms were manic or depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms occurring only during these episodes. However, the presence of psychotic symptoms outside of clear manic or depressive episodes makes this less likely.

- **B) Brief Psychotic Disorder**: This condition involves a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for at least a day but less than a month, followed by a full recovery. The duration of this patient's symptoms exceeds this timeframe.

- **C) Schizoaffective Disorder**: This diagnosis is given when there are psychotic symptoms (like those seen in schizophrenia) concurrent with significant mood episodes (manic or depressive), and at least two weeks where delusions or hallucinations occurred in the absence of a major depressive or manic episode during the lifetime duration of the disorder. The patient's presentation of hearing voices, erratic behavior, and periods of mania/hypomania, along with significant impairment in social and occupational functioning, makes this diagnosis the most likely.

- **D) Schizophreniform Disorder**: This condition presents with symptoms similar to schizophrenia but lasts for less than six months. While the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for 7 months, this option does not account for the significant mood episodes.

- **E) Schizotypal Personality Disorder**: This is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior. While some symptoms might overlap, this diagnosis does not capture the full scope of the patient's psychotic and mood symptoms.

362,"A 6-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because he has become increasingly irritable and restless over the past 2 days. During this period, he has had 12 bowel movements. He feeds 10 to 12 times a day. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and weighed 1800 g (3 lb 15 oz); he currently weighs 1700 g (3 lb 12 oz). His mother has Graves' disease and received propylthiouracil during the last trimester of pregnancy. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 180/min, and respirations are 50/min. Examination shows mild diaphoresis and a firm 2-cm midline neck swelling. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Methimazole and propranolol therapy
B) Digoxin and furesomide therapy
C) Potassium iodide therapy
D) Naloxone therapy
E) Calcium gluconate therapy","The 6-day-old male newborn presents with increasing irritability and restlessness over the past 2 days, along with a high frequency of bowel movements and feeding sessions. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation with a low birth weight and has lost weight since birth. His mother has Graves' disease and was treated with propylthiouracil during the last trimester of pregnancy, which can sometimes cause neonatal hyperthyroidism due to transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins. The baby's symptoms, such as tachycardia (pulse of 180/min), mild diaphoresis, and a firm midline neck swelling suggestive of a goiter, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate treatment for neonatal hyperthyroidism. Methimazole is an antithyroid medication that can help reduce thyroid hormone production, and propranolol is a beta-blocker that can help control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia.

612,"A 52-year-old man presents to the physician because of ongoing shortness of breath, which is more prominent when he lies down. Occasionally, he experiences palpitations, especially during strenuous activities. In addition to this, he has been experiencing difficulty in digestion and often experiences regurgitation and dysphagia. He reports that he emigrated from Mexico 20 years ago and visits his hometown twice a year. The vital signs include: blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg, respiratory rate 19/min, and pulse 100/min. The physical examination shows jugular vein distention along with pitting edema in the ankles. Bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop are heard on auscultation of the chest. A chest X-ray is taken. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no significant findings. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s physical and diagnostic findings?
A) Alcohol abuse
B) Hypertensive changes
C) Parasitic infection
D) Myocardial infarction
E) Bacterial infection","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Shortness of breath that worsens when lying down**: This symptom is suggestive of orthopnea, which is commonly associated with heart failure. The worsening of symptoms when lying down indicates fluid redistribution and accumulation in the lungs, exacerbating respiratory distress.

2. **Palpitations during strenuous activities**: Palpitations can be a sign of various cardiac issues, including arrhythmias or increased ventricular volume, which might be secondary to heart failure.

3. **Difficulty in digestion, regurgitation, and dysphagia**: These gastrointestinal symptoms could be indicative of fluid overload or increased pressure within the abdominal cavity, which might be secondary to right-sided heart failure causing fluid accumulation in the liver and intestines.

4. **Jugular vein distention and pitting edema in the ankles**: These physical examination findings are classic signs of right-sided heart failure. Jugular vein distention indicates increased venous pressure, and pitting edema is a sign of fluid accumulation in the peripheral tissues.

5. **Bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop**: Bilateral basilar crackles heard on auscultation are indicative of pulmonary edema, a sign of left-sided heart failure. An S3 gallop is a sign of increased fluid volume within the ventricle, often associated with heart failure.

6. **Normal ECG**: The absence of significant findings on the ECG does not rule out heart failure, as ECG changes may not always be present in heart failure patients.

Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and physical examination results strongly suggest heart failure. Considering the patient's history of emigration from Mexico and regular visits back to his hometown, a parasitic infection could be a potential underlying cause of his heart failure, particularly Chagas disease, which is prevalent in certain regions of Mexico and can lead to cardiomyopathy.

449,"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 
A) Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound
B) Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months
C) Elective endovascular repair
D) Elective open surgical repair
E) Emergency open surgical repair","To determine the best course of treatment for this patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), we need to consider several factors, including the size of the aneurysm, the patient's symptoms, and his overall health status.

The patient presents with a small, unruptured AAA with a diameter of 4.1 cm. Generally, aneurysms less than 4 cm in diameter are considered small and are monitored with regular ultrasound checks, while those between 4 and 5.5 cm may be considered for repair, especially if the patient is symptomatic or has a high risk of rupture.

Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass, along with the aneurysm size being just above the threshold for small aneurysms, intervention is likely warranted. However, the fact that the aneurysm is unruptured means that emergency surgery is not immediately required.

The patient's history of hypertension, high cholesterol, transient ischemic attacks, smoking, and heavy alcohol use increases his risk for complications and may influence the choice between endovascular and open surgical repair. Endovascular repair is generally considered less invasive and may be preferred for patients with significant comorbidities, while open surgical repair is often recommended for patients who are younger and have fewer health issues.

Considering these factors, the best course of treatment for this patient would likely involve elective repair of the aneurysm to prevent future complications, such as rupture. Given the patient's age and comorbidities, an endovascular approach might be more suitable.

1145,"A 58-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician with concerns about several recent health changes. The patient has recently gained weight and can't seem to exercise like she used to. She also notes that her thinking seems slow. Physical examination shows thickened, dry skin. Serum analysis confirms the physician's suspicions. Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?
A) High T4 and T3
B) Low T4 and T3
C) High TSH
D) Hypercholesterolemia
E) Low TSH","The patient presents with several symptoms that suggest hypothyroidism, including weight gain, decreased ability to exercise, slow thinking, and thickened, dry skin. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which are essential for various bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, and development.

To diagnose hypothyroidism, serum analysis is typically performed to measure the levels of thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), as well as the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones.

In hypothyroidism, the levels of T4 and T3 are typically low, while the level of TSH is high. This is because the pituitary gland produces more TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones.

Among the options provided, the finding that is most helpful in diagnosing hypothyroidism is a high TSH level. This is because a high TSH level indicates that the pituitary gland is producing more TSH to try to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones, which is a characteristic feature of hypothyroidism.

While low T4 and T3 levels can also be indicative of hypothyroidism, they can also be low in other conditions, such as euthyroid sick syndrome. Hypercholesterolemia can be a consequence of hypothyroidism, but it is not a specific diagnostic finding. Low TSH levels are typically seen in hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism.

196,"A group of researchers conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01). Which of the following type of bias is most likely to have influenced these results?
A) Interviewer bias
B) Latency period
C) Recall bias
D) Survival bias
E) Length-time bias","To evaluate the potential biases in the study, let's consider the design and methodology. The researchers retrospectively surveyed mothers with children diagnosed with ASD and mothers with healthy children about their prenatal consumption of folic acid. Given this approach, the most significant concern would be the accuracy of the mothers' recollections regarding their folic acid supplementation before pregnancy.

Recall bias occurs when participants in a study inaccurately remember past events or experiences, which can lead to biased results. In this case, mothers with children diagnosed with ASD might recall their prenatal habits differently than mothers with healthy children, either due to the emotional impact of having a child with ASD or because they have thought more about potential causes for their child's condition. Conversely, mothers with healthy children might not remember their prenatal habits as clearly or might be less inclined to report omissions in folic acid supplementation.

Given the reliance on retrospective self-reporting and the potential for differential recall among the groups, recall bias is the most likely type of bias to have influenced the results of this study.

390,"A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?
A) Anterior cord lesion
B) Posterior cord lesion
C) Right cord hemisection
D) Left cord hemisection
E) Complete cord transection","To solve this question, let's analyze the symptoms presented by the 27-year-old gentleman who was stabbed in the back and now complains of weakness in his left leg, along with specific neurological deficits.

1. **Weakness in the left leg (2/5 strength)**: This indicates a motor deficit, which can be caused by damage to the motor pathways in the spinal cord.

2. **Deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity**: These sensations are typically carried by the posterior (dorsal) columns of the spinal cord. A deficit here suggests damage to these columns on the left side.

3. **Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity**: Pain and temperature sensations are carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract, which crosses over shortly after entering the spinal cord, meaning the damage must be on the opposite side of the spinal cord from the sensory deficit, which is consistent with a lesion on the left side of the spinal cord.

Given these symptoms, we can rule out certain options:

- **A) Anterior cord lesion**: This would affect the anterior (ventral) parts of the spinal cord, including the motor tracts and the lateral spinothalamic tracts. However, it wouldn't explain the deficit in vibration sense and light touch, which are carried in the posterior columns.

- **B) Posterior cord lesion**: This would affect vibration sense and light touch but wouldn't explain the motor weakness or the loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side.

- **C) Right cord hemisection**: This would involve damage to the right half of the spinal cord, which doesn't match the pattern of deficits described (weakness and loss of vibration/light touch on the left, loss of pain/temperature on the right).

- **E) Complete cord transection**: This would result in a loss of all functions below the level of the lesion, which is not described here.

- **D) Left cord hemisection**: This is the only option that matches all the described deficits. A hemisection of the spinal cord on the left side would damage the motor tracts and posterior columns on the left (explaining the weakness and loss of vibration/light touch on the left) and the lateral spinothalamic tract carrying pain and temperature sensations from the right side of the body (explaining the loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right).

480,"A 63-year-old patient presents to the emergency department because of severe left leg pain and tingling. His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?
A) Vasculitis
B) Hyperhomocysteinemia
C) Arterial thrombosis
D) Arterial emboli
E) Arterial trauma","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Sudden onset of severe left leg pain and tingling**: This suggests an acute vascular event rather than a chronic or inflammatory process.
2. **History of hypertension**: While hypertension is a risk factor for many vascular conditions, it does not directly point to the cause of the acute symptoms.
3. **Physical examination findings**: The left leg is pale and cool, and the popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right. These findings are indicative of reduced blood flow to the left leg.
4. **Irregular pulse**: This is a crucial finding. An irregular pulse is often associated with atrial fibrillation, a condition known to significantly increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is an **arterial embolism**. Arterial emboli are known to cause sudden onset of limb ischemia, characterized by pain, pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia (cold to the touch), paresthesia, and paralysis (the six Ps). The irregular pulse, suggestive of atrial fibrillation, increases the risk of clot formation within the heart, which can then embolize to peripheral arteries, leading to acute limb ischemia.

While other options like arterial thrombosis, vasculitis, hyperhomocysteinemia, and arterial trauma can also cause limb ischemia, the combination of sudden onset, irregular pulse, and the absence of other suggestive findings (e.g., systemic symptoms for vasculitis, history of trauma) makes arterial emboli the most likely cause.

917,"A 52-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia comes to the emergency department 30 minutes after the sudden onset of substernal chest pain while sitting in a chair at home. He reports drinking 2 glasses of whiskey earlier that day, after a stressful day at work. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. His pulse is 102/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds. An ECG obtained on arrival at the emergency department shows ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. 15 minutes later, the patient's chest pain has resolved and a repeat ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s chest pain?
A) Coronary artery vasospasm
B) Coronary artery vasodilation
C) Atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing
D) Atherosclerotic plaque rupture
E) Pericardial inflammation","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Sudden onset of substernal chest pain**: This is a classic symptom of myocardial ischemia or infarction, but given the sudden onset and resolution, other causes such as coronary artery vasospasm should also be considered.

2. **Recent alcohol consumption and stress**: Both alcohol and stress can be triggers for coronary artery vasospasm.

3. **History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia**: These are risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, but the patient's symptoms and ECG changes do not follow the typical pattern for atherosclerotic plaque rupture or coronary artery narrowing due to atherosclerosis.

4. **ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads that resolve within 15 minutes**: This rapid resolution is more consistent with coronary artery vasospasm than with an acute coronary syndrome due to plaque rupture or atherosclerotic narrowing.

5. **Normal heart sounds and no abnormalities on repeat ECG**: This further supports a transient cause of myocardial ischemia, such as vasospasm.

Given these points, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's chest pain is coronary artery vasospasm. This condition, also known as variant angina or Prinzmetal's angina, is characterized by transient, sudden narrowing of a coronary artery, which can be triggered by various factors including stress, alcohol, and smoking. The transient nature of the ST-segment elevations and the rapid resolution of symptoms are key indicators of this diagnosis.

852,"A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient has presented three times this past month with similar complaints. The patient sees no primary care physician and is currently not taking any medications. The patient states his shortness of breath started when he was walking from his car to a local restaurant. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 100/min, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On physical exam you note a fatigued appearing gentleman. Cardiovascular exam reveals an additional heart sound after S2. Pulmonary exam is notable for bilateral crackles. Abdominal exam reveals an obese abdomen without pain in any of the quadrants. Lower extremity pitting edema is noted bilaterally. Which of the following sets of lab values most likely corresponds to this patient's presentation?
A) High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, high potassium
B) High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, low potassium
C) High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium
D) Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium
E) Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, normal potassium","To approach this question, let's break down the patient's presentation and the lab values provided in the options.

The patient is a 69-year-old male presenting with shortness of breath, which has recurred three times in the past month. He has no primary care physician and is not taking any medications. The onset of shortness of breath occurred during minimal exertion (walking from his car to a restaurant), indicating possible decreased exercise tolerance. His vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, tachycardia (100/min), normal blood pressure, slightly elevated respirations (18/min), and normal oxygen saturation (96% on room air). The physical exam reveals a fatigued appearance, an additional heart sound after S2 (suggestive of a third heart sound, S3, which is often associated with heart failure), bilateral crackles on pulmonary exam (indicative of pulmonary congestion), and lower extremity pitting edema (indicative of fluid overload).

Given this clinical presentation, the patient likely has heart failure, which could be due to various causes such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy. Heart failure is characterized by the heart's inability to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention.

Now, let's analyze the lab values provided in the options in the context of heart failure:

- BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide): Elevated in heart failure as it is secreted by the ventricles in response to excessive stretching of myocytes.
- ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): Often elevated in heart failure due to decreased effective circulating volume, leading to water retention.
- Sodium: Can be low (hyponatremia) in heart failure due to excessive ADH secretion and subsequent water retention.
- Potassium: Can be low (hypokalemia) due to increased aldosterone levels secondary to heart failure, leading to increased potassium excretion.

Considering these points, the lab values that most likely correspond to this patient's presentation are:

High BNP (indicative of heart failure), high ADH (due to decreased effective circulating volume and subsequent water retention), low sodium (due to hyponatremia from excessive ADH secretion), and low potassium (due to increased aldosterone levels).

240,"A 48-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. She has had progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. In addition, she complains of difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. Her temperature is 99.6°F (37.6°C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
A) Muscle biopsy
B) CT scan
C) Pulmonary function tests
D) Serum ANA titer
E) Skin biopsy","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation:

1. **Progressive weakness and shortness of breath**: These symptoms can point towards a variety of conditions, but when combined, they often suggest a systemic or autoimmune process affecting multiple systems.

2. **Difficulty raising arms to brush hair**: This specific complaint indicates proximal muscle weakness, a hallmark of myopathic conditions, including those caused by autoimmune diseases.

3. **Non-productive cough and diffuse dry crackles on lung auscultation**: These findings are indicative of interstitial lung disease (ILD), which can be associated with autoimmune diseases.

4. **Faint erythematous rash on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and elbows**: This description is classic for a ""butterfly"" rash, which is most commonly associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, and musculoskeletal system.

Given these findings, the diagnosis that best explains all the symptoms is Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The test most likely to confirm this diagnosis is the **Serum ANA (Antinuclear Antibody) titer**. ANA is a sensitive marker for SLE, and a high titer is often the first step in diagnosing this condition, although it's worth noting that further, more specific autoantibody testing (such as anti-dsDNA or anti-Sm antibodies) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis due to the high sensitivity but lower specificity of ANA for SLE.

16,"A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?
A) Acute cholecystitis
B) Gallbladder cancer
C) Choledocholithiasis
D) Pancreatitis
E) Duodenal peptic ulcer","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Severe abdominal pain** for the past 2 hours, accompanied by dull back pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is not related to food intake.
2. **Past medical history** of recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis (gallstones).
3. **Family history** of abdominal cancer (her father died at age 60).
4. **Physical exam** is unremarkable, but a **CT scan of the abdomen** shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder.

Given these points, the differential diagnosis can include conditions related to the gallbladder and nearby structures. However, the presence of a calcified mass near the gallbladder on the CT scan is particularly concerning for a specific diagnosis.

**Acute cholecystitis (A)** is an inflammation of the gallbladder, often due to gallstones blocking the cystic duct. While it's a possibility given her history of cholelithiasis, the CT scan finding of a calcified mass isn't the most typical presentation.

**Gallbladder cancer (B)** is a rare but serious condition. The presence of a calcified mass near the gallbladder on the CT scan, combined with her family history of abdominal cancer, makes this a significant concern. Gallbladder cancer can present with abdominal pain, weight loss, and sometimes jaundice.

**Choledocholithiasis (C)** refers to the presence of a gallstone in the common bile duct. While this could cause abdominal pain and potentially lead to pancreatitis or cholangitis, the CT scan finding of a calcified mass isn't directly indicative of this condition.

**Pancreatitis (D)** is inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause severe abdominal pain, often radiating to the back, along with nausea and vomiting. However, the CT scan finding of a calcified mass near the gallbladder doesn't directly point to pancreatitis.

**Duodenal peptic ulcer (E)** is a type of stomach ulcer that can cause abdominal pain, but it's less likely given the location of the pain and the CT scan findings.

Given the patient's presentation, history, and especially the CT scan findings, the most critical diagnosis to exclude first is gallbladder cancer, due to its potential severity and the need for prompt treatment.

1045,"A 4-year-old boy presents to the pediatrician’s office. His mother complains that he has been sleeping poorly, and she has noticed that he often scratches his perianal area. A scotch tape test is found to be positive and mebendazole is prescribed. Into which of the following subsets have the naïve T cells (TH0) developed due to the infection in this patient?
A) TH1 cells
B) TH2 cells
C) TH17
D) T0 cells
E) TREGS","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **Symptoms and Diagnosis**: The 4-year-old boy is experiencing poor sleep and perianal itching, which, combined with a positive scotch tape test, strongly suggests an infection with Enterobius vermicularis, commonly known as pinworms. This parasitic infection is a type of helminthic infection.

2. **Treatment**: The prescription of mebendazole, an antiparasitic drug, further supports the diagnosis of a helminthic infection.

3. **Immunological Response**: The question asks about the subset of naïve T cells (TH0) that would develop in response to this infection. The differentiation of naïve T helper cells (TH0) into various subsets depends on the nature of the immune response required to combat the infecting organism.

   - **TH1 cells** are typically involved in cell-mediated immunity and are crucial for fighting intracellular pathogens such as viruses and certain bacteria.
   - **TH2 cells** are more involved in humoral immunity and are essential for combating extracellular parasites, including helminths. They promote the production of IgE antibodies and eosinophils, which are key components in the fight against parasitic infections.
   - **TH17 cells** are a subset of T helper cells that produce interleukin 17 (IL-17) and are involved in autoimmunity and inflammation, particularly against fungal infections and some bacterial infections.
   - **TREGS (T regulatory cells)** are involved in immune suppression and tolerance, preventing autoimmune disease and managing the extent of immune responses.
   - **T0 cells** are naïve T cells that have not yet differentiated into any specific subset.

Given that the patient is infected with a helminthic parasite (pinworms), the immune response would predominantly involve the differentiation of naïve T cells into **TH2 cells**. This subset is crucial for orchestrating the appropriate immune response to eliminate helminthic infections through mechanisms such as the activation of eosinophils and the production of IgE antibodies.

D) 75%
E) 100%","To solve this problem, we need to understand the genetics of hemophilia A, which is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means the gene responsible for hemophilia A is located on the X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY), while females have two X chromosomes (XX).

Since the father has hemophilia A, he must have the mutated gene on his X chromosome. Each of his daughters will inherit one of his X chromosomes (the one with the mutated gene) because they get his X chromosome (and a Y chromosome is not passed to daughters). However, to express the disease, a female would need to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent), which is not the case here since the mother is not mentioned to be a carrier or have the disease. Therefore, all daughters will be carriers as they inherit the mutated gene from their father.

Given this information, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease is the same as for any of the daughters since they all inherit the X chromosome with the mutated gene from their father.

350,"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?
A) Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle
B) This patient has insulin resistance
C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient
D) The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
E) The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction","To address this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Absence of menstruation (amenorrhea)**: The patient has not had her period for 6 months, which indicates a disruption in her menstrual cycle.
2. **Significant weight loss**: She lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb) through dietary restriction and intense exercise.
3. **Physical examination findings**: She has well-developed muscles and decreased adiposity (body fat).
4. **Bone scan results**: Decreased calcium mineral deposits, which can indicate a risk for osteoporosis or weakened bones.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A) **Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle**: While muscle hypertrophy can be associated with hormonal changes, there's no direct indication in the scenario that increased androgen production by muscles is the primary cause of her amenorrhea.

B) **This patient has insulin resistance**: Insulin resistance is more commonly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, not with significant weight loss and decreased adiposity as seen in this patient.

C) **Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient**: This option is plausible because body fat (adiposity) plays a role in the production and regulation of estrogen. Significant weight loss and decreased body fat can lead to lower estrogen levels (hypoestrogenemia), which can disrupt menstrual cycles and lead to amenorrhea.

D) **The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism**: While liver metabolism does affect hormone levels, the scenario does not provide specific information suggesting increased liver metabolism as the cause of decreased estrogen levels.

E) **The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction**: Although hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and menstrual irregularities, the scenario does not provide specific signs or symptoms that would make hyperthyroidism the most likely diagnosis (e.g., no mention of tremors, heat intolerance, etc.).

Considering the information provided, the most accurate statement about this patient's condition is related to the impact of decreased body fat on hormone levels, specifically estrogen.

200,"A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?
A) Diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes
B) Glomerular crescents with macrophages
C) Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation
D) Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy
E) Thickened glomerular capillary loops","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a 2-year-old girl**: This suggests an underlying anatomical or functional issue that predisposes her to infections.
2. **Bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis on renal ultrasound**: This finding indicates an obstruction or reflux issue affecting the kidneys, leading to the accumulation of urine and subsequent dilation.
3. **Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) showing retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition**: This is diagnostic of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters and sometimes towards the kidneys, which can lead to recurrent UTIs and kidney damage.

Given these points, the most likely histologic finding in a kidney biopsy specimen would be changes associated with chronic kidney damage due to the reflux and recurrent infections. The options provided can be analyzed as follows:

- **A) Diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes**: This could be seen in various forms of interstitial nephritis, which might be a secondary effect but doesn't directly relate to the primary issue of VUR.
- **B) Glomerular crescents with macrophages**: This finding is more typical of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is not directly related to the scenario described.
- **C) Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation**: This is seen in conditions like IgA nephropathy or diabetic nephropathy, not directly related to VUR.
- **D) Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy**: This option best matches the expected histologic changes due to chronic kidney damage from VUR and recurrent UTIs. The backflow of urine can cause scarring and atrophy in the kidney, leading to a thinning of the renal cortex and tubular atrophy.
- **E) Thickened glomerular capillary loops**: This is more characteristic of conditions like membranous nephropathy or diabetic nephropathy, not directly related to the scenario.

378,"A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. This morning she became drowsy. She returned from a business trip to Sudan 3 weeks ago. She denies eating any seafood while traveling. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her immunizations are up-to-date and she has never received blood products. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. She is oriented to person and place. Examination shows jaundice and mild asterixis. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 22-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:

An ELISA for HIV is negative. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
A) HBsAg
B) Anti-HAV IgG
C) HCV RNA
D) Anti-HCV IgG
E) Anti-HEV IgM","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation presenting with lethargy, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and mild asterixis after returning from a business trip to Sudan. These symptoms suggest a liver condition, given the jaundice and asterixis, which are indicative of hepatic encephalopathy.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT in the thousands), an elevated total bilirubin, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), all of which point towards severe liver injury. The prothrombin time is also prolonged, indicating a coagulopathy likely secondary to liver dysfunction.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the acute presentation of severe liver injury, the differential diagnosis includes acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and other less common causes. The patient's recent travel history to Sudan, a region where hepatitis E is endemic, is particularly relevant.

4. **Serological Tests**: The patient's negative tests for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-CMV antibody, anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody, and an ELISA for HIV help rule out autoimmune and other infectious causes of liver injury.

Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is acute hepatitis E infection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is known to cause more severe disease in pregnant women, particularly in the third trimester, but severe cases can occur in the second trimester as well.

795,"A 75-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month. He reports that he cannot climb more than one flight of stairs without experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He does not drink alcohol. His medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, and low-dose aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows weak peripheral pulses. Cardiac examination is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Aortic valve regurgitation
B) Tricuspid valve stenosis
C) Mitral valve prolapse
D) Mitral valve stenosis
E) Aortic valve stenosis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the physical examination findings.

1. **Progressive shortness of breath and fatigue**: These symptoms can be indicative of a variety of cardiac conditions, including valve disorders, heart failure, or coronary artery disease.

2. **Inability to climb more than one flight of stairs without experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness**: This suggests a significant limitation in the patient's functional capacity, likely due to a cardiac cause.

3. **History of hypertension and hyperlipidemia**: Both are risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic heart disease and valve disorders.

4. **50-year smoking history**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and atherosclerosis affecting the aortic valve.

5. **Physical examination findings of weak peripheral pulses**: This can be indicative of reduced cardiac output or obstructive lesions affecting blood flow.

6. **Cardiac examination findings are not explicitly described**, but given the context, we would expect findings that could include a harsh systolic ejection murmur if there is significant aortic stenosis.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that would explain the progressive nature of the symptoms, the significant impact on functional capacity, and the physical examination findings. Aortic valve stenosis is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve opening, which can lead to reduced cardiac output, symptoms of heart failure (such as shortness of breath and fatigue), and can be associated with a harsh systolic ejection murmur on cardiac examination. The patient's long history of smoking and presence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase the risk of developing aortic stenosis due to atherosclerotic changes.

1125,"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination for the past 6 days. Three weeks ago, she had an episode of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis that was treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with multiple male partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently; she has been taking an oral contraceptive for the past 2 years. She has no previous history of serious illness or sexually transmitted diseases. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 5.8. Bimanual examination is unremarkable. Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings?
A) Obligate intracellular organisms
B) Gram-negative diplococci
C) Positive whiff test
D) Pseudohyphae
E) Flagellated protozoa","The patient presents with symptoms of yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination, which are indicative of a vaginal infection. The recent episode of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis treated with amoxicillin may have contributed to the development of this infection by disrupting the normal vaginal flora. The patient's history of being sexually active with multiple male partners and using condoms inconsistently increases her risk for sexually transmitted infections. However, the symptoms and physical examination findings, including the presence of erythema of the vulva and vagina, foul-smelling frothy yellow-green vaginal discharge, and a pH of 5.8, are more suggestive of a specific type of vaginal infection.

The positive whiff test, which involves adding potassium hydroxide (KOH) to the vaginal discharge and observing for a strong fishy odor, is commonly used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. However, the presence of frothy discharge and the pH of 5.8 are not typical of bacterial vaginosis. The symptoms and findings are more consistent with an infection caused by a protozoan organism.

Among the options provided, the flagellated protozoa are characteristic of Trichomonas vaginalis, a common cause of vaginal infections that presents with symptoms of frothy yellow-green discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination.

Temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids is begun. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?
A) Pulmonary hypertension
B) Lower extremity gangrene
C) Palpable purpura
D) Posterior uveitis
E) Thoracic aortic aneurysm","The patient is a 72-year-old woman presenting with symptoms of frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias. The physical examination findings of pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye, along with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 65 mm/h, are highly suggestive of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). The diagnosis is further confirmed by the temporal artery biopsy showing transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, which are characteristic histopathological features of GCA.

GCA is a large vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the branches of the external carotid artery, including the temporal artery, but it can also involve other large vessels such as the aorta and its branches. One of the significant complications of GCA is the development of thoracic aortic aneurysm due to the inflammation of the aortic wall, which can lead to aortic dilation and potentially life-threatening rupture.

Considering the options provided, the patient's condition puts her at the greatest risk of developing a thoracic aortic aneurysm.

404,"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The episodes occur every 1–2 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?
A) Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
B) Biliary cyst
C) Tracheoesophageal fistula
D) Intestinal malrotation
E) Pancreas divisum","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the provided options.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient experiences mild episodic abdominal pain every 1–2 months, lasting a few hours, located in the epigastrium, radiating to the back, and occasionally associated with mild nausea. These symptoms are suggestive of pancreatic pathology, given the location and radiation of the pain.

2. **Family History**: The mention of an older sister with congenital heart disease hints at a possible genetic or congenital component to the patient's condition. However, this does not directly point to a specific gastrointestinal congenital anomaly but rather suggests a possible predisposition to congenital defects.

3. **Physical Examination**: The lack of abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness suggests that the condition is not causing significant inflammation or obstruction at the time of examination.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis**: Typically presents in infants with projectile vomiting and is less likely to cause episodic abdominal pain radiating to the back in a 6-year-old.

- **B) Biliary Cyst**: Could potentially cause episodic pain, but the location and radiation of the pain might not as typically match the description provided.

- **C) Tracheoesophageal Fistula**: Usually presents with respiratory symptoms and difficulty feeding in infants, not matching the patient's presentation.

- **D) Intestinal Malrotation**: Can cause episodic abdominal pain, but the pain pattern described (epigastric pain radiating to the back) and the lack of other symptoms such as diarrhea or constipation make this less likely.

- **E) Pancreas Divisum**: This congenital anomaly of the pancreas can lead to episodic abdominal pain due to inadequate drainage of pancreatic secretions, potentially causing pancreatitis. The pain's location and radiation to the back support this diagnosis, given the pancreatic involvement.

Considering the episodic nature of the pain, its location, and the congenital aspect hinted at by the family history, pancreas divisum is the most fitting explanation for the patient's symptoms.

901,"A 38-year-old man presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Past medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2 years ago for which he is not compliant with his medications. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history and occasionally alcohol use. His vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, pulse 98/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL
Hematocrit 29.1%
Red cell count 3.7 million/mm3
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 71 μm3

A) Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration
B) ↑ megakaryocytes
C) ↓ hemosiderin stores
D) Ringed sideroblasts
E) Myeloblasts with immature precursors","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's presentation and laboratory findings. The patient is a 38-year-old man with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion, which are common symptoms of anemia. His past medical history includes peptic ulcer disease, for which he is not compliant with his medications, and a 10-pack-year smoking history.

The laboratory findings are significant for a microcytic anemia (low MCV, MCH, and MCHC) with a low hemoglobin and hematocrit. The reticulocyte count is low, indicating a decreased production of red blood cells. The red cell distribution width (RDW) is elevated, suggesting a variation in red blood cell size. The iron studies show a low transferrin saturation and a high total iron binding capacity (TIBC), which are indicative of iron deficiency anemia.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. On a bone marrow biopsy, the expected finding would be a decrease in hemosiderin stores, which are the iron-containing granules in the bone marrow. This decrease is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia.

979,"A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?
A) Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
B) Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
C) Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
D) Increased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
E) Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume","Analyzing the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is evident that he is suffering from a respiratory condition that has significantly impacted his quality of life. The patient's history of smoking 1 pack per day for 55 years is a significant risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter (barrel chest), and hyperresonance to percussion are classic signs of COPD, particularly of the emphysema subtype.

The breathing pattern with pursed lips is also indicative of COPD, as it is a compensatory mechanism to increase intrathoracic pressure and prevent bronchiole collapse, thereby improving lung volumes and gas exchange.

In COPD, particularly in emphysema, there is destruction of alveolar walls and enlargement of airspaces, leading to air trapping. This results in an increase in residual volume (RV) because the lungs are unable to fully deflate. Additionally, the destruction of lung tissue and airway obstruction lead to a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is a measure of the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled in the first second of a forced exhalation.

Therefore, the expected findings in this patient would be an increased residual volume (RV) due to air trapping and a decreased FEV1 due to airway obstruction and destruction of lung tissue.

She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?
A) Quetiapine
B) Lamotrigine
C) Valproate
D) Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)
E) Paroxetine","To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and was initially treated with lithium but showed no improvement.
2. The patient was then switched to a different medication.
3. After the medication change, the patient developed an acute onset rash on her torso characterized by targetoid lesions with a vesicular center.
4. The rash developed 2 days ago and has progressively worsened.
5. Prior to the rash, the patient experienced fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days.

The symptoms described, particularly the rash with targetoid lesions and a vesicular center, along with the preceding systemic symptoms (fever, lethargy, myalgia, chills), are indicative of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, possibly Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). These conditions are rare but serious side effects associated with certain medications.

Among the options provided, the medications that are known to cause such severe cutaneous reactions include:

- Lamotrigine: Known for its risk of causing SJS/TEN, especially in the first 8 weeks of treatment.
- Valproate: Also associated with a risk of SJS/TEN, though less commonly discussed than lamotrigine.
- Quetiapine, Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC), and Paroxetine: While these medications can cause various side effects, they are less commonly associated with SJS/TEN compared to lamotrigine.

Given the timing of the symptoms (starting within two weeks of the medication change) and the specific description of the rash, the most likely culprit medication is one that is well-documented to cause such reactions, particularly in the context of recent initiation.

477,"A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone. These tests reveal a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis as well as an increased RDW. In addition there is an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and the Coombs test results are negative. To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?
A) Hypersegmented neutrophils
B) Schistocytes
C) Sideroblasts
D) Spherocytes
E) Dacrocytes","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and how they relate to the potential diagnosis and the expected findings on a blood smear.

1. **Clinical Presentation and Initial Findings**: The patient is a 14-year-old boy with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and a gallstone. The presence of a gallstone at such a young age suggests an underlying hemolytic disorder, as gallstones are relatively rare in adolescents and are often associated with hemolysis.

2. **Laboratory Results**:
   - **Mild Normocytic Anemia with Reticulocytosis**: Indicates an increased turnover of red blood cells, suggesting a hemolytic anemia.
   - **Increased RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width)**: Suggests a variation in red blood cell size, which can be seen in various anemias, including hemolytic anemias.
   - **Indirect Hyperbilirubinemia**: Elevated levels of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin are consistent with hemolysis, as the liver is unable to conjugate the bilirubin as quickly as it is being produced from the breakdown of red blood cells.
   - **Negative Coombs Test**: Rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia, where the immune system produces antibodies against the red blood cells.

3. **Osmotic Fragility Test Showing Increased Fragility in Hypotonic Solution**: This is a key diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis, a condition where red blood cells are more fragile and prone to lysis due to a deficiency in proteins that make up the red blood cell membrane.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is hereditary spherocytosis. On a blood smear, the characteristic finding in hereditary spherocytosis is the presence of spherocytes, which are small, round, and densely stained red blood cells without the central pallor typically seen in normal red blood cells.

136,"A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?
A) Binds complement proteins on the cell surface
B) Binds endogenous peptides that are present in the endosome
C) Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel
D) Binds exogenous peptides that are present in the endosome
E) Binds exogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel","To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Cells Positive for CD8**: The researcher isolates cells that are positive for the cell surface marker CD8. CD8 is a marker typically found on cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), which are a subset of T lymphocytes. CTLs play a crucial role in the immune system by recognizing and killing infected cells or tumor cells.

2. **Mixing with Infected Cells and Immunoprecipitation**: The CD8-positive cells are then mixed with a group of infected cells, and the interactions between these cells are crosslinked. After that, the CD8 protein is immunoprecipitated, which means it is isolated from the rest of the cellular components using antibodies specific to CD8. This process also pulls down any proteins that are bound to CD8.

3. **Identification of a Bound Protein**: The researcher identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. This description is key to understanding the nature of the protein.

Given the context of CD8-positive cells (cytotoxic T cells) interacting with infected cells, and the description of the protein being composed of two chains from an adjacent cell, we can infer that the protein in question is likely the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) molecule.

MHC I molecules are composed of two chains (a heavy chain and a light chain, β2-microglobulin) and are expressed on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells. They play a critical role in the immune system by presenting endogenously synthesized peptides (including those from pathogens) to CD8-positive T cells. This presentation is crucial for the recognition and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells.

The primary function of MHC I molecules is to bind endogenous peptides that have been transported by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) channel. These peptides are then presented on the cell surface to CD8-positive T cells.

The physician notes that he is also being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. Which drug is being referred to in this case?
A) Furosemide
B) Hydrochlorothiazide
C) Triamterene
D) Acetazolamide
E) Eplerenone","To solve this question, let's break down the key points provided:

1. The patient is a 70-year-old man with chronic heart failure.
2. He is experiencing difficulty breathing, which is a common symptom of fluid overload in heart failure.
3. He is a known hypertensive and is on amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker) and telmisartan (an angiotensin II receptor antagonist).
4. The question mentions a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule.

Given this information, we need to identify a diuretic that acts by blocking sodium channels in the cortical collecting tubule. This mechanism of action is characteristic of potassium-sparing diuretics. Among the options provided:

- Furosemide (A) is a loop diuretic that acts by inhibiting the Na-K-Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.
- Hydrochlorothiazide (B) is a thiazide diuretic that acts by inhibiting the Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule.
- Triamterene (C) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts by blocking sodium channels in the cortical collecting tubule, which matches the description given in the question.
- Acetazolamide (D) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts primarily in the proximal convoluted tubule.
- Eplerenone (E) is also a potassium-sparing diuretic but is more specifically an aldosterone antagonist.

Therefore, the drug being referred to in this case, based on the mechanism of action described, is Triamterene.

275,"A 67-year-old white man presents to his primary care provider for an annual examination. He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Keratoacanthoma
B) Basal cell carcinoma
C) Seborrheic keratosis
D) Molluscum contagiosum
E) Kaposi's sarcoma","To approach this question, let's analyze the key details provided:

1. **Patient's History and Presentation**: The patient is a 67-year-old white man with a history of significant sun exposure and multiple blistering sunburns. This history increases his risk for skin cancers, particularly those related to sun exposure such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. However, the rapid development of a pink bump on his forehead over the last month, described as a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug, suggests a specific type of skin lesion.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The description of the lesion as a dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug is crucial. This type of appearance is characteristic of a keratoacanthoma, a type of skin tumor that grows quickly and can resemble a small volcano due to its central crater-like appearance filled with keratin.

3. **Biopsy Results**: The excisional biopsy findings of an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin, and minimal keratinocyte atypia further support the diagnosis of keratoacanthoma. Keratoacanthomas are known for their rapid growth, central keratin plug, and minimal cellular atypia, distinguishing them from more aggressive skin cancers.

Given these details, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Keratoacanthoma**: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the rapid growth of the lesion, its characteristic appearance with a central keratin plug, and the biopsy findings.
- **B) Basal cell carcinoma**: While basal cell carcinoma is a common skin cancer, especially in individuals with significant sun exposure, it typically presents differently, often as a pearly nodule or ulcer.
- **C) Seborrheic keratosis**: These are benign growths that can appear as brown, black, or tan spots, and they do not typically have the rapid growth pattern or central keratin plug described.
- **D) Molluscum contagiosum**: This is a viral skin infection that causes small, pearly, or flesh-colored bumps, which does not match the description provided.
- **E) Kaposi's sarcoma**: This is a type of cancer that forms in the lining of blood and lymph vessels, often presenting as lesions on the skin, but it does not match the clinical or biopsy findings described.

115,"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. He says that these symptoms came on rapidly but does not recall anything that may have triggered the episode. He has never experienced these symptoms before. His past medical history is significant for obesity, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes that is well controlled on metformin. He also has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he occasionally takes antacids. On presentation he is found to have fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain that is poorly localized. Basic labs as well as an arterial blood gas are obtained and the results are shown below:

Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 106 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
pH: 7.25
pCO2: 22 mmHg

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs?
A) Antacids
B) Anxiety
C) Diarrhea
D) Metformin
E) Sleep apnea","To determine the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with muscle cramping, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fast and shallow breathing, and abdominal pain. These symptoms suggest a metabolic disturbance.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **Sodium (Na+)** is within the normal range.
   - **Chloride (Cl-)** is slightly elevated.
   - **Bicarbonate (HCO3-)** is significantly decreased.
   - **pH** is low, indicating acidosis.
   - **pCO2** is low, indicating a respiratory alkalosis or compensation for metabolic acidosis.

Given these findings, the patient has a metabolic acidosis (low pH and low bicarbonate) with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis (low pCO2).

3. **Causes of Metabolic Acidosis**:
   - **Diarrhea (C)**: It can cause a loss of bicarbonate ions, leading to metabolic acidosis. Given the patient's symptoms, diarrhea is a plausible cause.
   - **Metformin (D)**: Although metformin can cause lactic acidosis, a rare but serious side effect, the lab findings do not specifically indicate lactic acidosis (no lactate levels are provided).
   - **Antacids (A)** and **Anxiety (B)** are less likely to cause the observed metabolic disturbances.
   - **Sleep Apnea (E)**: While sleep apnea can lead to respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation, the patient's presentation and lab findings suggest metabolic acidosis rather than respiratory acidosis.

Considering the above analysis, the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs is the diarrhea, which would lead to a loss of bicarbonate and result in metabolic acidosis.

870,"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?
A) 45/195
B) 39/400
C) 30/400
D) (30/200) / (30/400)
E) 30/200","To determine the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed, we need to calculate the attributable risk fraction (also known as the attributable proportion) of GERD due to alcohol use in the population.

First, let's calculate the incidence of GERD among alcoholics and non-alcoholics:

- Incidence among alcoholics = 30/200 = 0.15 (or 15%)
- Incidence among non-alcoholics = 30/400 = 0.075 (or 7.5%)

The attributable risk (AR) of GERD due to alcohol use is the difference in incidence between alcoholics and non-alcoholics:

AR = Incidence among alcoholics - Incidence among non-alcoholics
   = 0.15 - 0.075
   = 0.075

However, to find the attributable risk fraction (ARF) or the proportion of GERD cases that can be attributed to alcohol use, we use the formula:

ARF = (Incidence among exposed - Incidence among unexposed) / Incidence among exposed
    = (0.15 - 0.075) / 0.15
    = 0.075 / 0.15
    = 0.5

But this is the ARF among the exposed (alcoholics). To find the population attributable risk fraction (PARF), which tells us the proportion of GERD cases in the entire population that can be attributed to alcohol use, we need to consider the prevalence of alcohol use in the population:

Prevalence of alcohol use = 30% = 0.3

PARF = (Prevalence of exposure) * (ARF among exposed)
    = 0.3 * (0.075 / 0.15)
    However, the correct way to calculate PARF when considering the impact on the entire population, especially for prevention, involves understanding how much of the disease incidence in the total population is due to the exposure.

Given the data:
- Total cases of GERD = 30 (from alcoholics) + 30 (from non-alcoholics) = 60
- Cases attributable to alcohol use = 30 (from alcoholics) - 15 (expected if alcoholics had the same rate as non-alcoholics, since 200 alcoholics * 0.075 = 15) = 15

However, the question seems to aim towards understanding the fraction of GERD that can be prevented by removing alcohol consumption, which would essentially be the proportion of GERD cases currently occurring in alcoholics that could be prevented:

Since we know 30 cases occurred in both groups, and assuming the rate in non-alcoholics stays constant, the calculation provided in the options seems to aim towards a direct comparison rather than the detailed PARF calculation.

Given the options and focusing on the direct impact of removing alcohol consumption on GERD incidence, the closest match to a correct approach based on the provided data and usual epidemiological calculations would be to understand the proportion of cases in the exposed group that could be prevented, but none of the options directly calculate PARF or provide the exact fraction of GERD that could be prevented in the general population based on standard epidemiological formulas.

However, considering the aim is to find the fraction of GERD that can be prevented by stopping alcohol consumption, and looking at the provided options, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the framing of the question regarding standard epidemiological measures.

Given the standard approach to such questions, let's correct the approach for calculating the impact of removing alcohol on GERD incidence:

To find the fraction of GERD cases in the population that could be prevented by removing alcohol consumption, we should consider how many cases are attributable to alcohol use and calculate the proportion of those cases out of the total number of cases.

However, the provided options and explanation pathway don't align perfectly with standard epidemiological calculations for attributable risk or population attributable risk fraction, which would give us the exact fraction of disease in the population that can be attributed to the exposure (alcohol use).

564,"A 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?
A) Clear cell adenocarcinoma
B) Melanoma
C) Botryoid sarcoma
D) Verrucous carcinoma
E) Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)","The patient presents with postcoital vaginal bleeding and intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge, which are symptoms concerning for a vaginal malignancy. The presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina further supports this suspicion. Given the patient's history of being the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol (DES), this exposure is a significant risk factor for a specific type of vaginal cancer. DES exposure in utero is strongly associated with the development of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. This rare type of cancer is more common in women exposed to DES in utero, particularly those whose mothers took DES during the first trimester of pregnancy.

598,"A study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents. One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread. Which of the following disinfectants is most likely to inactivate this virus?
A) Benzalkonium chloride
B) Chlorhexidine
C) Sodium hypochlorite
D) Sulfuric acid
E) Ethyl alcohol","To determine the most effective disinfectant for inactivating the picornavirus, which preferentially infects hepatocytes, we need to consider the properties of the virus and the disinfectants listed.

Picornaviruses are non-enveloped viruses, which makes them more resistant to disinfection than enveloped viruses. Effective disinfection against non-enveloped viruses typically requires the use of disinfectants that can denature proteins, disrupt the viral capsid, or interfere with the viral genome.

Among the options provided:

A) Benzalkonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound effective against a wide range of bacteria and some viruses but may not be as effective against non-enveloped viruses like picornaviruses.

B) Chlorhexidine is an antiseptic effective against bacteria and fungi but has limited activity against viruses.

C) Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is a strong disinfectant known for its broad-spectrum activity, including effectiveness against non-enveloped viruses. It works by denaturing proteins, disrupting the viral capsid, and interfering with the viral genome, making it a likely candidate for inactivating the picornavirus.

D) Sulfuric acid is a strong acid but is not typically used as a disinfectant for viruses.

E) Ethyl alcohol is effective against many bacteria and viruses, particularly enveloped viruses, but may not be as effective against non-enveloped viruses like picornaviruses.

Given the properties of the disinfectants and the nature of the picornavirus, sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is the most likely to inactivate this virus due to its broad-spectrum activity and effectiveness against non-enveloped viruses.

1080,"A 65-year-old man presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision. The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. He denies having fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, changes in color vision, or limb weakness. He has a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, he had an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, from which he recovered completely with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He has a history of a 56-pack-year cigarette smoking habit. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, glimepiride, metformin, metoprolol, and ramipril. The mental status examination is unremarkable. His muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs. His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image. A lesion in which of the following locations explains the findings during eye examination?
A) Cavernous sinus
B) Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation
C) Dorsal column-medial lemniscus
D) Frontal eye field
E) Medial longitudinal fasciculus","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings from the patient's presentation and the eye examination.

1. **Left-sided numbness**: This suggests a lesion affecting the sensory pathways, possibly in the brainstem, spinal cord, or higher up in the sensory cortex, but given the lack of other symptoms like limb weakness, it's less likely to be a high-level lesion.

2. **Diplopia more prominent on left-sided lateral gaze**: This indicates an issue with the extraocular muscles or their innervation, particularly those involved in lateral gaze. The cranial nerves responsible for eye movements include the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), and abducens (VI) nerves.

3. **Blurring of vision without other symptoms like fever, headache, or ocular pain**: This suggests that the issue is likely neurological rather than due to an acute eye condition.

Given these points, the key finding is the diplopia that worsens on left-sided lateral gaze, which points towards a problem with the cranial nerves controlling eye movement, specifically those that control lateral gaze. The abducens nerve (VI) is responsible for lateral rectus muscle function, which controls outward eye movement.

Considering the options:

- **A) Cavernous sinus**: Lesions here can affect multiple cranial nerves (III, IV, V, and VI) due to their close proximity, leading to more complex presentations than what's described.

- **B) Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation**: This would more likely result in motor symptoms (e.g., weakness) rather than the specific eye findings described.

- **C) Dorsal column-medial lemniscus**: This pathway is involved in sensory transmission and wouldn't directly explain the diplopia or specific eye movement abnormalities.

- **D) Frontal eye field**: Lesions here could affect eye movements but would more likely cause issues with saccades or pursuit rather than the specific findings of diplopia worsening on lateral gaze.

- **E) Medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)**: The MLF is a brainstem structure that coordinates eye movements by connecting the nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. A lesion here, particularly an internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), would affect adduction of the eye on the same side as the lesion during lateral gaze to the opposite side, which somewhat fits the description given the involvement of lateral gaze. However, the exact match for the symptoms described (diplopia worsening on left-sided lateral gaze) would more precisely involve structures or pathways affecting the left abducens nerve (VI) or its nucleus, but given the options, an MLF lesion is the closest match in terms of affecting eye movements in a manner that could result in the described diplopia.

However, considering the precise details given and re-evaluating the options for the best fit based on the information provided and the typical effects of lesions in these areas, the closest match from the provided options, given the specific nature of the question, would actually be more aligned with a structure that, when affected, could result in the described eye movement abnormalities, particularly those that could cause issues with lateral gaze.

Given the details and re-evaluating for accuracy in the explanation provided, the best match from the options given, considering typical clinical correlations, would actually be more closely associated with the **Medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF)**, considering it's involved in coordinating eye movements, although the exact clinical presentation described might suggest involvement of pathways affecting lateral gaze more specifically.

1149,"A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?
A) Hyperplasia
B) Hypertrophy
C) Atrophy
D) Metaplasia
E) Dysplasia","To address this question, let's break down the key concepts and apply them to the scenario described.

The researcher observed that the breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. This change is indicative of an adaptive response of the breast tissue to pregnancy, preparing for milk production (lactation) to support the newborn.

Hyperplasia is defined as an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue, usually leading to an increase in the size of the organ or tissue. This process is a response to a stimulus, such as hormonal changes, which is exactly what happens during pregnancy. Hormonal fluctuations, particularly the increase in estrogen and progesterone, stimulate the growth and differentiation of breast tissue, including the proliferation of acinar glands, which are crucial for milk production.

Hypertrophy, on the other hand, refers to an increase in the size of cells, which can also lead to an increase in the size of the organ. However, the scenario specifically mentions an ""increased number of acinar glands,"" which points more towards an increase in cell number (hyperplasia) rather than an increase in cell size (hypertrophy).

Atrophy is the reduction in size of cells or organs, which is the opposite of what is observed in the breast tissue of pregnant women in this study.

Metaplasia is the process by which one type of cell changes into another type of cell, often in response to irritation or injury. This does not match the description provided, as the increase in acinar glands is not about changing one cell type into another but rather increasing the number of existing cell types.

Dysplasia refers to the disordered or abnormal development of cells, tissues, or organs, which can sometimes be a precursor to cancer. The scenario describes a normal physiological response to pregnancy, not an abnormal or pathological process.

Given these definitions, the process that best describes the observed change in breast tissue during pregnancy is hyperplasia, as it involves an increase in the number of cells (in this case, acinar glands with epithelial proliferation) in response to hormonal stimuli associated with pregnancy.

554,"A 62-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with continued hypertension despite adherence to multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The physician suspects that the patient may have elevated aldosterone levels and wants to initiate a trial of an aldosterone receptor antagonist. The patient is very concerned about side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia, as he had a friend who took a similar medication and had these side-effects. Which of the following is the best medication to initiate, given his concerns and the physician's diagnosis?
A) Spironolactone
B) Eplerenone
C) Amiloride
D) Triamterene
E) Ethacrynic acid","To address the patient's concerns about side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia, while also considering the physician's suspicion of elevated aldosterone levels, the choice of medication should focus on an aldosterone receptor antagonist with a lower incidence of these specific side effects.

Spironolactone (A) is a well-known aldosterone receptor antagonist but is associated with a higher risk of gynecomastia and impotence due to its anti-androgenic effects. This makes it less ideal given the patient's concerns.

Eplerenone (B) is another aldosterone receptor antagonist but has a lower incidence of gynecomastia and impotence compared to spironolactone. It is specifically designed to have fewer anti-androgenic effects, making it a more suitable option for this patient.

Amiloride (C) and Triamterene (D) are potassium-sparing diuretics but do not specifically act as aldosterone receptor antagonists. They could be useful in managing hypertension and potassium levels but do not directly address the suspected issue of elevated aldosterone levels.

Ethacrynic acid (E) is a loop diuretic and does not function as an aldosterone receptor antagonist. It is not the best choice for addressing the patient's concerns or the physician's suspicions about aldosterone levels.

Given the patient's concerns about side effects and the physician's diagnosis, the best medication to initiate would be Eplerenone, as it directly addresses the issue of elevated aldosterone levels with a lower risk of the side effects the patient is concerned about.

1126,"A 15-year-old female presents to her pediatrician’s office for severe menstrual cramping. The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being “really heavy” and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes. The patient had normal development throughout childhood, is on the soccer team at school, and is not sexually active. Her father has hypertension and her mother has endometriosis and heavy periods. On exam, the patient is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 pounds (BMI 26.3 kg/m^2). She is well appearing and has no abdominal tenderness. She has Tanner IV breasts and Tanner IV pubic hair, and external genitalia are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient’s menstrual cramps?
A) Von Willebrand factor antigen assay
B) Pelvic ultrasound
C) MRI of the pelvis
D) NSAIDs
E) Increased exercise","To address the patient's severe menstrual cramping, we need to consider both the diagnosis and the management of her symptoms. The patient's history of irregular periods that became regular, along with severe cramping and heavy bleeding, suggests a possible underlying condition such as primary dysmenorrhea, which is common in adolescents and young women. The fact that she has a family history of endometriosis, a condition known to cause severe pelvic pain and heavy menstrual bleeding, also needs to be considered. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not immediately suggest endometriosis or other structural abnormalities.

Given the patient's symptoms of severe menstrual cramping and the absence of any indications of a more serious underlying condition on physical examination, the best initial approach would be to manage her symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea and can significantly reduce menstrual cramps. They work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which is involved in generating menstrual cramps.

While imaging studies like pelvic ultrasound or MRI of the pelvis could be considered if the patient's symptoms do not respond to initial management or if there are suspicions of structural abnormalities, they are not the immediate next step without more specific indications. Similarly, a von Willebrand factor antigen assay would be more relevant if the patient's primary issue was heavy menstrual bleeding that was not manageable with standard measures, suggesting a possible bleeding disorder.

Increased exercise is beneficial for overall health and might have some benefits for menstrual cramps, but it is not a specific treatment for severe menstrual cramping and would not be sufficient as the sole next step.

Therefore, the best next step for managing this patient's menstrual cramps, given the information provided, is to recommend NSAIDs to alleviate her symptoms.

E) Recombinant enzyme","The patient presented with severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, which is a classic symptom of gout. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe. The patient's medical history, including obesity, hypertension, and extensive alcohol use, also increases her risk for developing gout.

After the acute episode resolved, the patient was started on a medication to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later, she developed pancytopenia, which suggests that the medication may be suppressing bone marrow function.

Among the options provided, the mechanism of action that is most likely associated with the development of pancytopenia is the inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol, are commonly used to treat gout by reducing the production of uric acid. However, these medications can also cause bone marrow suppression, leading to pancytopenia.

A) Carcinoid tumor
B) Small cell lung cancer
C) Sarcoidosis
D) Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
E) Adenocarcinoma of the lung","To approach this question, let's consider the key elements from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has experienced hemoptysis, a nonproductive cough, fatigue, and a significant weight loss of 9 kg (20 lb) over 8 months. These symptoms are concerning for a malignant process.

2. **Lifestyle and Occupational History**: The patient does not smoke, which is a significant risk factor for many types of lung cancer, but the absence of smoking does not rule out lung cancer entirely. She works as an accountant, which does not expose her to known carcinogens associated with lung cancer.

3. **Radiographic Findings**: The chest x-ray shows a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung without mediastinal or hilar enlargement. The presence of a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) with irregular borders is concerning for malignancy.

4. **Types of Lung Cancer and Their Characteristics**:
   - **A) Carcinoid Tumor**: Typically presents with more systemic symptoms due to hormone production and is less likely to cause significant weight loss or hemoptysis.
   - **B) Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)**: Usually associated with smoking, rapid growth, early metastasis, and more systemic symptoms. The lack of mediastinal or hilar enlargement makes this less likely.
   - **C) Sarcoidosis**: Can present with pulmonary nodules but is typically accompanied by hilar lymphadenopathy, which is not present in this case.
   - **D) Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung**: Often associated with smoking and tends to grow within the main bronchi, causing symptoms like hemoptysis. However, the patient does not smoke.
   - **E) Adenocarcinoma of the Lung**: The most common type of lung cancer, especially in non-smokers. It tends to present as peripheral lung lesions and can cause symptoms like those described in the case (hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue) due to local invasion and potential distant metastasis.

Given the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is adenocarcinoma of the lung, considering the peripheral location of the nodule, the symptoms described, and the absence of smoking history.

Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?
A) Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased
B) Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased
C) Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: no change
D) Muscle relaxation time: no change, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased
E) Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased","The mutation in the ATP2A1 gene affects the calcium ATPase pump in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle. This pump is crucial for removing calcium ions from the cytosol after muscle contraction, allowing the muscle to relax. With a loss of function in this pump, calcium ions would accumulate in the cytosol, leading to prolonged muscle contraction and stiffness.

Given this understanding, individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation would experience an increase in muscle relaxation time due to the impaired ability to remove calcium ions from the cytosol. This would result in increased cytosolic calcium concentrations as the calcium ions are not being pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum efficiently.

Therefore, the expected outcome in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation is an increase in both muscle relaxation time and cytosolic calcium concentration.

The question asks about the virulence factor most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection. For Neisseria meningitidis, the initial step in infection involves adherence to the mucosal surfaces of the host. Among the options provided:

A) Protein A is associated with Staphylococcus aureus and its ability to bind to the Fc region of antibodies, not directly related to the initial adherence of Neisseria meningitidis.

B) Lipooligosaccharides are components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, but are more associated with the endotoxin activity and pathogenesis rather than the initial adherence.

C) Adhesive pili are crucial for the initial attachment of Neisseria meningitidis to the host cells. These pili are proteins that protrude from the surface of the bacteria and facilitate the interaction with host cell receptors, enabling the bacteria to anchor and start the colonization process.

D) Biofilm formation is more associated with chronic infections and the ability of bacteria to form complex communities on surfaces, which is not the primary mechanism in the initial steps of Neisseria meningitidis infection.

E) Polysaccharide capsule is indeed a virulence factor for Neisseria meningitidis, helping the bacteria evade the host immune system, but it is not primarily involved in the initial adherence to host cells.

Therefore, the virulence factor most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection is the adhesive pili, which facilitate the attachment of Neisseria meningitidis to the host cells.

690,"A 33-year-old man presents to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up. He was recently admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and cough, and was found to have Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia and a new diagnosis of HIV. His CD4 count is 175, viral load is pending. As part of routine laboratory studies given his new diagnosis, an RPR was found to be positive with a titer of 1:64, and this is confirmed with a positive FTA-ABS. He is unsure when or how he acquired HIV or syphilis. His neurological examination is normal, and he has no symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management:
A) Perform lumbar puncture, treat based on presence or absence of CNS disease
B) Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months
C) Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months
D) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months
E) Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months","The patient is a 33-year-old man with a new diagnosis of HIV and a confirmed diagnosis of syphilis, as indicated by a positive RPR with a titer of 1:64 and a positive FTA-ABS. Given his HIV status and the diagnosis of syphilis, it is essential to consider the possibility of neurosyphilis, especially since the patient is unsure when or how he acquired the infections. However, his neurological examination is normal, and he has no symptoms suggestive of neurosyphilis.

In patients with HIV and syphilis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that those with a confirmed diagnosis of syphilis undergo a lumbar puncture to evaluate for neurosyphilis if they have any neurological symptoms, if the syphilis is of unknown duration, or if the patient has a serum RPR titer of 1:32 or higher, regardless of symptoms. Given that this patient's RPR titer is 1:64, which is above the threshold, and despite the absence of neurological symptoms, a lumbar puncture is indicated to assess for neurosyphilis.

If the lumbar puncture results indicate the presence of neurosyphilis, the patient would require treatment with intravenous penicillin for 10-14 days. If the lumbar puncture does not show evidence of neurosyphilis, the patient can be treated with benzathine penicillin G administered parenterally (intramuscularly) once a week for three weeks.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a lumbar puncture to assess for the presence of neurosyphilis and then treat based on the findings.

774,"A 21-year-old female presents to the office after a health screening in which she was found to have high blood pressure. At the office, the blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg. You have seen the patient in the past for amenorrhea and infertility issues, but she denies taking any medication at this time. On examination, the patient is short and normal weight but has a webbed neck. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure?
A) Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys 
B) Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension
C) Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland
D) Oral contraceptive use
E) Chronic corticosteroid use","Analyzing the situation, the 21-year-old female presents with high blood pressure of 168/114 mm Hg, which is significantly elevated for her age. Her past medical history includes amenorrhea and infertility issues, and she denies taking any medication at this time. The physical examination reveals that she is short, of normal weight, and has a webbed neck. These findings are suggestive of Turner syndrome, a genetic condition that affects females and is characterized by short stature, delayed puberty, infertility, and certain physical features such as a webbed neck. Individuals with Turner syndrome are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular abnormalities, including hypertension, due to genetic predispositions and possible renal abnormalities. Among the options provided, the central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys, also known as horseshoe kidney, is a common renal abnormality associated with Turner syndrome and can lead to hypertension. Therefore, the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure in this patient is related to a congenital renal issue.

156,"A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance because of unusual behavior that started 3 hours ago while he was at a party. He has a history of major depressive disorder and seasonal allergies. His mother has a history of anxiety. He drinks 5 beers on the weekends. Current medications include amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. The patient does not respond to questions and repeatedly says, """"The government is following me everywhere."""" His temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 160/89 mm Hg. He is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to place or time. Neurologic examination shows dilated pupils bilaterally and diffuse hyperreflexia. His feet are cold, and capillary refill time is 3 seconds. After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?""
A) Brief psychotic disorder
B) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
C) Anticholinergic toxicity
D) Lysergic acid diethylamide intoxication
E) Synthetic cathinone intoxication","Analyzing the situation, the 19-year-old man presents with unusual behavior that started 3 hours ago, including delusions (""The government is following me everywhere""), disorientation to place and time, dilated pupils, diffuse hyperreflexia, and a heightened state of agitation, culminating in an attempt to bite the physician. His vital signs indicate tachycardia (115/min), elevated temperature (37.9°C or 100.2°F), and hypertension (160/89 mm Hg), along with diaphoresis and prolonged capillary refill time. These symptoms collectively suggest a state of acute intoxication or a severe adverse reaction.

Given his history of major depressive disorder and current medications (amitriptyline and diphenhydramine), along with the presence of ethyl glucuronide in the urine toxicology screening (indicating alcohol consumption), it's essential to consider potential interactions or overdoses. However, the key to this scenario lies in recognizing the anticholinergic effects presented by the patient's symptoms.

Anticholinergic toxicity can cause delirium, hallucinations, dry mouth, mydriasis (dilated pupils), tachycardia, urinary retention, and in severe cases, agitation and aggression. The patient's medications, particularly diphenhydramine (an antihistamine with significant anticholinergic properties) and amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant also known for its anticholinergic effects), are likely culprits in this scenario. The alcohol consumption indicated by the presence of ethyl glucuronide may have exacerbated these effects.

While other options like brief psychotic disorder, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intoxication, and synthetic cathinone intoxication could potentially explain some of the patient's symptoms, the overall clinical picture most closely aligns with anticholinergic toxicity, given the combination of the patient's medication regimen and the specific constellation of symptoms presented.

1212,"A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking. She reports that she has had episodic tinnitus in her right ear for the past 3 years. Neurologic examination shows hearing loss in the right ear. An MRI of the brain is shown. Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show which of the following?
A) Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification
B) Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil
C) Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma
D) Pleomorphic cells clustered around necrotic areas forming pseudopalisades
E) Cells with clear cytoplasm and central round nucleus resembling a fried egg","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's history and the findings:

1. **Increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking**: These symptoms suggest a problem affecting the balance and equilibrium, which could be related to the inner ear or the cerebellum.

2. **Episodic tinnitus in her right ear for the past 3 years and hearing loss in the right ear**: Tinnitus and hearing loss, especially when localized to one ear, can indicate a problem within the auditory pathway, possibly a tumor affecting the nerve responsible for hearing.

3. **MRI of the brain findings are not explicitly described, but given the context, we can infer the presence of a tumor**: The mention of an MRI suggests that there is a visible lesion that has been identified.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is an **acoustic neuroma**, also known as vestibular schwannoma. This is a type of benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve in the internal auditory canal and cerebellopontine angle. Acoustic neuromas are known to cause symptoms such as unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance problems due to their location and effect on the surrounding nerves.

Now, let's look at the options provided for the pathologic examination of this patient's lesion:

- **A) Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification**: This description does not match the typical histology of an acoustic neuroma.

- **B) Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil**: This is more characteristic of certain neuroectodermal tumors, not acoustic neuromas.

- **C) Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma**: This description fits with the histological appearance of an acoustic neuroma, which typically shows a mix of compact, hypercellular areas (Antoni A) and looser, hypocellular areas (Antoni B).

- **D) Pleomorphic cells clustered around necrotic areas forming pseudopalisades**: This is more indicative of a malignant glioma, not an acoustic neuroma.

- **E) Cells with clear cytoplasm and central round nucleus resembling a fried egg**: This description does not match the typical histology of an acoustic neuroma.

199,"A 28-year-old woman comes to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic because she has been unsuccessfully trying to conceive with her husband for the last 2 years. He has had 2 children from a previous marriage and has been tested for causes of male infertility. She has had prior abdominal surgery as well as a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Based on this history, a panel of tests are obtained and treatment is started. This treatment will be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. If the most likely drug prescribed in this case was administered in a different manner, which of the following conditions may also be treated by this drug?
A) Diabetes
B) Parkinson disease
C) Polycystic ovarian syndrome
D) Premature labor
E) Prostate cancer","The patient is a 28-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive for 2 years with no success. Given that her husband has had children from a previous marriage and has been tested for male infertility, the issue likely lies with the woman. Her history of prior abdominal surgery and family history of endocrine abnormalities are relevant. The fact that treatment is started and administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle suggests that the treatment is aimed at inducing ovulation.

The most likely drug prescribed in this case is Clomiphene citrate, which is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used to induce ovulation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or other anovulatory disorders. It works by stimulating the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which then stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, leading to ovulation.

If Clomiphene citrate were administered in a different manner, it could also be used to treat conditions such as breast cancer or conditions associated with estrogen deficiency. However, among the options provided, the one that stands out as a possible alternative use for Clomiphene citrate, if administered differently, is the treatment of conditions associated with hormonal imbalances, particularly those related to estrogen levels.

Considering the options, Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is indeed a condition that Clomiphene citrate is used to treat, specifically for inducing ovulation. However, the question asks for an alternative use if the drug were administered differently, implying a different condition. None of the other options directly relate to the typical uses of Clomiphene citrate. However, given the context of hormonal regulation and considering the closest relation to the effects of Clomiphene citrate on hormonal balance, PCOS is the most relevant condition among the options provided, even though the question hints at an alternative use.

969,"A 46-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his eyes, generalized fatigue, and pruritus. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 7 years ago. At the time of diagnosis, a pANCA test was also positive. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and multiple scratch marks on the trunk and extremities. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Serum studies show a total bilirubin concentration of 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin concentration of 2.5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase level of 450 U/L. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography shows focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation. Histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?
A) Periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis
B) Periportal lymphocytic infiltration and piecemeal necrosis
C) Diffuse fibrosis with PAS-staining globules
D) Irregular ductal glands lined by atypical and pleomorphic cells
E) Ductopenia and fibrotic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and is now presenting with jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the eyes), fatigue, and pruritus. These symptoms suggest a liver or biliary system issue.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: Elevated total and direct bilirubin levels along with a significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase level point towards a cholestatic process, meaning there is an obstruction or reduction in bile flow.

3. **Imaging Findings**: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) shows focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation. This pattern is suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a condition often associated with IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis.

4. **Histologic Examination**: Given the clinical and imaging findings, the liver biopsy is most likely to show changes consistent with PSC. The characteristic histologic findings in PSC include periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis, which reflect the chronic inflammatory and fibrotic process affecting the bile ducts.

Considering these points, the histologic examination of the liver biopsy specimen is most likely to show periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis, which is the hallmark of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

139,"A 7-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his parents for evaluation of frequent bed wetting during the night. A detailed history reveals that there has been no history of urinary incontinence during the day since the boy was 4 years of age, but that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week. There is no history of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. On physical examination, the boy’s vital signs are stable. His neurologic and abdominal examinations are completely normal. His laboratory investigations are as follows:
Urine-specific gravity (first-morning sample) 1.035
Urine red blood cells Absent
Urine pus cells Absent
Urine culture Negative
Which of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?
A) Ultrasonogram of the urinary bladder and kidneys
B) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine
C) Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm
D) Treatment with oral oxybutynin
E) Treatment with oral imipramine","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Age and Symptoms**: The patient is a 7-year-old boy who experiences frequent bed wetting (nocturnal enuresis) but has been continent during the day since he was 4 years old. This pattern is significant because it indicates that the child has achieved daytime bladder control but struggles with nighttime control.

2. **Medical History**: There's no history of urinary tract infections (UTIs), urgency, frequency, or hesitancy, which are common symptoms associated with urinary tract problems or neurological issues affecting bladder control.

3. **Physical Examination**: The boy's neurologic and abdominal examinations are normal, which suggests there are no overt physical abnormalities contributing to his nocturnal enuresis.

4. **Laboratory Investigations**: The urine-specific gravity is high (1.035), indicating concentrated urine, which is normal. The absence of red blood cells, pus cells, and a negative urine culture further supports that there is no underlying urinary tract infection or inflammation.

Given these points, the child's presentation is consistent with primary nocturnal enuresis, which is defined as bed wetting in a child who has never been dry at night for a significant period. This condition is common and can be due to a variety of factors including delayed bladder maturation, inadequate antidiuretic hormone secretion at night, or simply a deep sleep pattern.

The management of primary nocturnal enuresis typically starts with non-pharmacological approaches. Among the options provided:

- **Ultrasonogram of the urinary bladder and kidneys (A)** and **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine (B)** are not indicated as initial steps because there are no signs or symptoms suggesting anatomical abnormalities or neurological issues.

- **Treatment with oral oxybutynin (D)** is sometimes used for nocturnal enuresis, especially if there are symptoms of bladder instability, but it's not the first line of treatment in this case.

- **Treatment with oral imipramine (E)** can be effective for nocturnal enuresis but is usually considered if other treatments fail due to its side effect profile.

- **Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm (C)** is the most appropriate next step. The enuresis alarm is a behavioral treatment that involves a device that alarms when it detects urine, conditioning the child to wake up when they feel the sensation of a full bladder. It has a high success rate and is recommended as a first-line treatment for nocturnal enuresis.

264,"A 35-year-old woman presents with severe fear reactions to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She states that she has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but has been able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath. Recently, she has stopped picking up her children from the bus stop and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any dogs. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?
A) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
B) Short-acting benzodiazepines
C) Systematic desensitization
D) Cognitive behavioral therapy
E) Dialectical behavioral therapy","To address the 35-year-old woman's severe fear reactions to seeing dogs, we need to consider the nature of her condition, which appears to be a specific phobia. Phobias are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations that lead to avoidance behaviors. In this case, the woman's fear of dogs (cynophobia) has started to significantly impact her daily life and functioning.

Let's evaluate the treatment options provided:

A) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - These are commonly used to treat a variety of anxiety disorders, including specific phobias. They can help reduce the overall level of anxiety but might not directly address the specific phobia.

B) Short-acting benzodiazepines - These can provide immediate relief from anxiety symptoms but are generally not recommended for long-term use due to the risk of dependence. They also do not address the underlying phobia.

C) Systematic desensitization - This is a type of behavioral therapy specifically designed to treat phobias. It involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object (in this case, dogs) in a controlled manner, starting from situations that cause minimal anxiety and progressing to more anxiety-provoking ones. The goal is to reduce the fear response over time.

D) Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) - This is a broader therapeutic approach that can be effective for treating phobias, among other conditions. CBT involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors to alter unwanted behavior patterns. However, for specific phobias, systematic desensitization might be more directly targeted.

E) Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) - This form of therapy is primarily used to treat borderline personality disorder and focuses on developing emotional regulation and coping skills. It is not typically the first-line treatment for specific phobias.

Given the above considerations, the most definitive treatment for the woman's specific phobia of dogs would be systematic desensitization, as it directly addresses the phobia by gradually reducing the fear response through controlled exposure.

688,"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?
A) Ovarian epithelial cells
B) Germ cells
C) Chorionic epithelial cells
D) Endometrial cells
E) Stromal cells","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Symptoms and Signs**: The patient presents with dragging pelvic pain and significant weight loss over 6 months, irregular menstrual cycles, and a fever of 38°C (100.4°F). These symptoms suggest a chronic and possibly malignant process.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: Hyperreflexia is noted, but this is not specifically indicative of the type of adnexal mass.

3. **Urine Pregnancy Test**: Negative, which rules out pregnancy as the cause of the adnexal mass.

4. **Ultrasonography Findings**: A 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. The size and description of the mass are concerning for a neoplastic process.

Given these points, let's consider the possible origins of the adnexal mass:

- **Ovarian Epithelial Cells (A)**: These are the most common source of ovarian tumors, which can be benign, borderline, or malignant. Epithelial ovarian cancers are more common in older women but can occur at any age.

- **Germ Cells (B)**: These tumors are more common in younger women and children. They can be benign or malignant and include types such as dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and teratomas.

- **Chorionic Epithelial Cells (C)**: These would be related to gestational trophoblastic disease, which is unlikely given the negative pregnancy test and the clinical context.

- **Endometrial Cells (D)**: Endometriosis can cause pelvic pain and masses, but a 6-cm hypoechoic mass would be unusual for endometriosis alone.

- **Stromal Cells (E)**: These are connective tissue cells of the ovary, and tumors of these cells (such as granulosa cell tumors) are less common.

Considering the age of the patient, the size of the mass, and the clinical presentation, the most likely origin of the adnexal mass is from ovarian epithelial cells, which can give rise to a variety of tumor types, including malignant ovarian cancers.

On physical examination, you notice low-set ears and retrognathia with abnormal extremity development. Which of the following abnormalities is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A) Hepatosplenomegaly
B) Macroorchidism
C) Posterior urethral valves
D) Rocker bottom feet
E) Duodenal atresia","Analyzing the situation, the 1-day-old infant is experiencing respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia and has physical examination findings of low-set ears, retrognathia, and abnormal extremity development. These features are suggestive of a congenital syndrome. Considering the pulmonary hypoplasia, one possible cause is a condition that restricts fetal movement or lung development. Among the options provided, posterior urethral valves (a condition more commonly found in males) can lead to oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid volume) due to obstructed urine flow. This decrease in amniotic fluid can cause pulmonary hypoplasia because the fetus's lungs do not have enough space to expand and develop properly. Additionally, the physical findings of low-set ears and retrognathia can be associated with various congenital syndromes, including those that involve genitourinary anomalies such as posterior urethral valves. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with posterior urethral valves.

142,"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:

A) MRI of the adrenal glands
B) MRI of the chest
C) MRI of the pituitary gland
D) Low dose dexamethasone suppression test
E) Inferior petrosal sinus sampling","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 25-year-old woman with progressive fatigue, weakness, and a significant reduction in menstrual periods. She also has hypertension, obesity with a notable pannus, and abdominal striae. These symptoms are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by excess cortisol levels.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has hyperglycemia (elevated glucose), normal electrolytes, and significantly elevated cortisol levels both in serum (30 µg/mL) and in 24-hour urinary cortisol (470 µg). The serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level is low (<5 pg/mL), which suggests that the excess cortisol production is ACTH-independent.

3. **High-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test**: The patient's serum cortisol levels did not decrease after a 48-hour high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial. This test is used to differentiate between various causes of Cushing's syndrome. The failure to suppress cortisol production with high-dose dexamethasone suggests an adrenal source of the excess cortisol, as pituitary ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease would typically show some suppression.

Given these findings, the next step in management should aim to identify the adrenal source of the excess cortisol production. The best imaging study to visualize the adrenal glands and detect potential adrenal tumors or hyperplasia is an MRI of the adrenal glands.

E) Thoracic aortic aneurysm","The patient presents with several months of sharp, shooting pain in both legs, along with a history of a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment 20 years ago. This history is suggestive of a past syphilis infection, which can lead to tertiary syphilis if left untreated. The examination findings of small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light (Argyll Robertson pupils), decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the distal lower extremities, absent patellar reflexes bilaterally, and an unsteady, broad-based gait are all consistent with tabes dorsalis. This is a form of neurosyphilis that affects the posterior columns of the spinal cord, leading to sensory ataxia and other neurological symptoms.

E) Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits","To determine the best compensation scheme for a multi-specialty physician practice, it's essential to understand the characteristics of each payment model. Here's an analysis of the options provided:

- Capitation: This model pays physicians a fixed amount per patient for a specified period, regardless of the actual number or nature of services provided. It poses a significant financial risk to physicians because they may end up providing more care than the capitated amount covers. However, it incentivizes preventive care and efficient management of chronic conditions to avoid more costly interventions later.

- Fee-for-service (FFS): This model pays physicians for each service they provide, such as consultations, surgeries, or tests. It poses less financial risk to physicians since they are paid for each unit of service, but it may incentivize them to increase healthcare utilization, potentially leading to unnecessary procedures or tests that do not improve patient outcomes.

Given these considerations:

- Option A is incorrect because capitation actually poses significant financial risk to physicians, not the least.
- Option B is incorrect because fee-for-service pays for each service provided, not a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under care.
- Option C is correct because fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization, regardless of the quality or necessity of the care provided.
- Option D is incorrect because fee-for-service poses less financial risk to physicians compared to capitation.
- Option E is incorrect because capitation actually incentivizes preventive medicine visits to avoid more costly care later, rather than decreasing them.

369,"A 20-year-old woman presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition for the past 5 days. She is sexually active with multiple partners and admits to using barrier protection inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. The patient denies any fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain. She is afebrile and the vital signs are within normal limits. Speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema with a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge. The vaginal pH is 5.5. Vaginal swab and urine samples are obtained for microscopy and culture, and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on her presentation?
A) Urinary tract infection
B) Candida vaginitis
C) Bacterial vaginosis
D) Trichomonal vaginitis
E) Chlamydia infection","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus (itching), and painful micturition (urination). These symptoms are common in various vaginal infections but can also be seen in urinary tract infections.

2. **Sexual History**: She is sexually active with multiple partners and uses barrier protection inconsistently, which increases her risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema (redness), a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge, and a vaginal pH of 5.5. The normal vaginal pH is acidic, ranging from about 3.8 to 4.5. An elevated pH can indicate an infection.

4. **Absence of Systemic Symptoms**: The patient denies fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain, which suggests a localized infection rather than a systemic or severe pelvic infection.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**: While painful micturition can be a symptom of UTI, the presence of a profuse, malodorous vaginal discharge and vaginal erythema points more towards a vaginal infection.

- **B) Candida vaginitis (Yeast Infection)**: Typically presents with a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge and intense itching. The discharge in this case is described as greenish-yellow and purulent, which is not typical for a yeast infection.

- **C) Bacterial vaginosis (BV)**: Characterized by a thin, white or grayish discharge with a fishy odor. The pH is indeed elevated in BV, but the discharge is not typically described as greenish-yellow or purulent.

- **D) Trichomonal vaginitis**: Caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, this infection presents with a copious, frothy, yellow-green or grayish discharge, which matches the description in the case. The infection is also associated with an elevated vaginal pH, vaginal erythema, and is often accompanied by pruritus and painful urination.

- **E) Chlamydia infection**: While this is a common STI that can cause cervicitis and urethritis, leading to symptoms like painful urination, it does not typically cause a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent vaginal discharge.

Based on the presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Trichomonal vaginitis due to the characteristic greenish-yellow, purulent discharge, elevated vaginal pH, and symptoms of pruritus and painful micturition.

632,"A 50-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of fever and chills for 4 weeks. He adds that he is fatigued all the time and has generalized weakness. He has drenching night sweats and has had 2 episodes of non-bilious vomiting over the past few days. He traveled to the Netherlands for 4 days a month ago. His symptoms started a few days after he returned home. Laboratory testing revealed the following:
Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL
Hematocrit 29%
Leukocyte count 2,950/mm3
Neutrophils  59%
Bands  3%
Eosinophils 1%
Basophils  0%
Lymphocytes 31%
Monocytes  4%
Platelet count  60,000/mm3
Unconjugated bilirubin 12 mg/dL
Alanine aminotransferase 200 IU/L
Aspartate aminotransferase 355 IU/L
The peripheral blood smear showed basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside many red cells and extracellular basophilic rings on Wright-Giemsa staining. Further evaluation revealed parasitemia and a few schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation. The findings are most consistent with which diagnosis?
A) Malaria
B) Babesiosis
C) Anaplasmosis
D) Tuberculosis
E) Lyme disease","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has fever, chills, fatigue, generalized weakness, drenching night sweats, and episodes of non-bilious vomiting. These symptoms started after a trip to the Netherlands.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Anemia (Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, Hematocrit 29%)
   - Leukopenia (Leukocyte count 2,950/mm3)
   - Thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 60,000/mm3)
   - Elevated liver enzymes (ALT 200 IU/L, AST 355 IU/L)
   - Unconjugated bilirubin is elevated (12 mg/dL)
   - Peripheral blood smear shows basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside many red cells and extracellular basophilic rings.

3. **Specific Findings on Blood Smear**: The presence of basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside red cells, along with extracellular basophilic rings, schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation, is highly suggestive of a specific parasitic infection.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Malaria**: Typically presents with fever, chills, and flu-like symptoms. The blood smear in malaria would show different stages of the parasite within red blood cells, but the description provided doesn't exactly match the typical findings for malaria.

- **B) Babesiosis**: This is a parasitic disease caused by Babesia, a genus of protozoal parasites that infect red blood cells. The symptoms and the specific findings on the blood smear, including the presence of merozoites in tetrad formation (often described as a ""Maltese cross"" appearance), are highly characteristic of babesiosis.

- **C) Anaplasmosis**: This is another tick-borne disease, but it primarily affects white blood cells, not typically presenting with the specific red blood cell findings described.

- **D) Tuberculosis**: While TB can cause a wide range of systemic symptoms, the specific findings on the blood smear do not match TB.

- **E) Lyme disease**: Another tick-borne illness, but its primary symptoms and laboratory findings do not include the specific parasitic elements described in the blood smear.

Considering the clinical presentation and the distinctive findings on the peripheral blood smear, the diagnosis most consistent with the information provided is babesiosis, which the patient could have contracted through a tick bite during his travel.

1049,"A 32-year-old pregnant woman presents to her physician with flu-like symptoms for the past 3 days. She has a runny nose, mild headache, and feels achy. She has a mild fever and diffuse rash over her body. She is concerned about the health of her baby and wants to know if there are any medications that will make her feel better in a short time. Currently, she is at her 29th week of gestation and has received the tetanus vaccination as part of the antenatal care program she received since she immigrated at the end of her first trimester from Romania. She is otherwise healthy. Considering this patient, she is at a higher risk of giving birth to a newborn who will present with which of the following options?
A) Single S2
B) Wide pulse pressure
C) Brachial-femoral delay
D) Double split S2
E) Tricuspid valve regurgitation","Considering the patient's symptoms of a runny nose, mild headache, feeling achy, mild fever, and a diffuse rash over her body, along with being in her 29th week of gestation, it is crucial to identify the cause of her illness to assess potential risks to the fetus. Given her flu-like symptoms and rash, one possible diagnosis could be a viral infection. However, without a specific diagnosis, we must consider common maternal infections that can impact fetal development, especially those that could affect the cardiovascular system.

Among the options provided, they all relate to cardiovascular issues that could be congenital in nature. Considering the patient's symptoms could be indicative of a viral infection, there's a potential risk for congenital heart defects if the infection is indeed something like rubella, which is known to cause such issues, especially if the infection occurs during the first 20 weeks of gestation. However, the patient is beyond this period, but there's still a need to consider potential impacts.

Option A, Single S2, could be indicative of several conditions but isn't directly linked to maternal viral infections. Option B, Wide pulse pressure, is more related to conditions affecting blood pressure regulation. Option C, Brachial-femoral delay, is indicative of coarctation of the aorta, a congenital heart defect. Option D, Double split S2, is often associated with conditions affecting the pulmonary valve or atrial septal defects. Option E, Tricuspid valve regurgitation, can be seen in conditions affecting the right heart.

Given the patient's presentation and considering potential congenital heart defects that could arise from maternal infections, the most fitting answer would be related to issues commonly associated with viral infections during pregnancy. However, none of the options directly correlate with a specific viral infection during pregnancy that would lead to a higher risk of a particular congenital heart defect without more specific information about the infection.

Considering the need to choose an option and the fact that maternal infections can lead to a variety of congenital heart defects, one might lean towards a more common congenital heart issue that could potentially arise from maternal infection, but it's crucial to note that the direct link provided in the options isn't clear-cut.

624,"A group of investigators is studying the association between a fire retardant chemical used on furniture and interstitial lung disease. They use hospital records to identify 50 people who have been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease. They also identify a group of 50 people without interstitial lung disease who are matched in age and geographic location to those with the disease. The participants' exposure to the chemical is assessed by surveys and home visits. Which of the following best describes this study design?
A) Case-control study
B) Cross-sectional study
C) Case series
D) Retrospective cohort study
E) Randomized controlled trial","To determine the study design, let's break down the key elements of the investigation:

1. **Objective**: The study aims to explore the association between exposure to a fire retardant chemical and the development of interstitial lung disease.
2. **Participant Selection**: The investigators identify two groups:
   - **Cases**: 50 individuals diagnosed with interstitial lung disease.
   - **Controls**: 50 individuals without interstitial lung disease, matched to the cases by age and geographic location.
3. **Exposure Assessment**: The participants' exposure to the chemical is evaluated through surveys and home visits.
4. **Temporal Relationship**: The study looks back in time to assess exposure to the chemical in relation to the current disease status.

Given these characteristics, the study design is best described as a **case-control study**. This type of study involves selecting participants based on the presence (cases) or absence (controls) of the outcome of interest (in this case, interstitial lung disease) and then retrospectively assessing their exposure to a potential risk factor (the fire retardant chemical). The goal is to identify if there is an association between the exposure and the disease by comparing the exposure rates among cases and controls.

1199,"A 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse comes to the physician 2 weeks after undergoing successful arthroscopic repair of a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. There were no complications. He was discharged with prescriptions for oxycodone and acetaminophen. He complains of severe pain that prevents him from participating in physical therapy and wakes him from sleep. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, he becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?
A) Prescribe a long-acting opioid for better pain relief if he is willing to sign a pain contract
B) Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past
C) Request consent for urine test to assess current drug use
D) Prescribe a short course of oxycodone and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week
E) Refer to a substance use counselor for addiction counseling","The patient, a 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse, is exhibiting behaviors that raise concerns about potential opioid misuse or addiction, such as demanding a refill of oxycodone and becoming visibly angry when an alternative pain management option (ibuprofen) is suggested. Given his history of substance abuse and the current behavior, it is crucial to approach this situation carefully.

Prescribing a long-acting opioid (Option A) or even a short course of oxycodone (Option D) without addressing the potential underlying issue of addiction could exacerbate the problem. Referring him to a substance use counselor for addiction counseling (Option E) might be necessary but should not be the immediate response without first attempting to understand the current situation better.

Requesting further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past (Option B) is an essential step in assessing his risk for opioid misuse and understanding his medical history. However, this alone does not address the immediate concern of his potential opioid misuse.

Requesting consent for a urine test to assess current drug use (Option C) is a direct and objective method to gather information about his current substance use. This approach can provide valuable information to guide further management decisions, including whether it is safe to prescribe opioids or if alternative pain management strategies and substance use interventions are needed.

Therefore, the most appropriate response to this patient's request, considering his history of cocaine abuse and current behavior, is to request consent for a urine test to assess current drug use. This approach allows for an informed decision regarding the safety of prescribing opioids and the potential need for substance use intervention.

118,"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He endorses diffuse abdominal tenderness. His past medical history is notable for diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and morbid obesity. He also is currently being treated for an outbreak of genital herpes. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/102 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an obese man in no acute distress. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is performed and is unremarkable. The patient is admitted to the observation unit for monitoring of his pain. Notably, the patient's abdominal pain improves after an enema and multiple bowel movements. The patient's evening laboratory values are ordered and return as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 141 mEq/L
Cl-: 99 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 177 mg/dL
Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?
A) Acyclovir
B) Atorvastatin
C) Insulin
D) Metformin
E) Metoprolol","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's laboratory values and clinical presentation. The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which improve after an enema and multiple bowel movements. The laboratory values show a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HCO3- of 11 mEq/L) and an elevated creatinine level (3.1 mg/dL), indicating renal impairment.

Given the patient's history of diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, and morbid obesity, he is already at risk for renal issues. However, the acute presentation suggests a more immediate cause for his renal impairment and metabolic acidosis.

Among the medications listed, metformin is known to cause lactic acidosis, a rare but serious side effect, especially in patients with renal impairment or when the medication accumulates due to decreased renal clearance. The patient's elevated creatinine level and metabolic acidosis are consistent with this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely to cause the observed laboratory derangements. Acyclovir can cause renal impairment, but it is not typically associated with metabolic acidosis. Atorvastatin can cause rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to renal impairment, but this would typically be accompanied by muscle pain and elevated creatine kinase levels, which are not mentioned. Insulin and metoprolol are not typically associated with renal impairment or metabolic acidosis.

Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements is metformin, given his renal impairment and the presence of metabolic acidosis.

1070,"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a right breast mass that she noticed 3 weeks ago. It has rapidly increased in size during this period. She does not have pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows large dense breasts; a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass is palpated in the right outer quadrant of the right breast. There are no changes in the skin or nipple. There is no palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Intraductal papilloma
B) Phyllodes tumor
C) Fibroadenoma
D) Fibrocystic disease of the breast
E) Invasive lobular carcinoma","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Rapidly increasing size of the breast mass**: This suggests a potentially aggressive or rapidly growing lesion.
2. **Large, dense breasts with a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass in the right outer quadrant**: The size and multinodular nature of the mass are concerning for a neoplastic process.
3. **No changes in the skin or nipple, and no palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy**: This suggests that the lesion may not have caused significant local or regional spread.
4. **Mammography showing a smooth polylobulated mass**: This imaging finding can be associated with several types of breast lesions, including benign and malignant types.
5. **Biopsy showing papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia**: This histological description is crucial. The presence of papillary projections and atypia indicates a neoplastic process, but the specific diagnosis depends on the balance between epithelial and stromal components and the degree of atypia.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Intraductal papilloma**: Typically presents with nipple discharge and is characterized by papillary fronds within a duct, not matching the described mass or biopsy findings.
- **B) Phyllodes tumor**: Characterized by papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma, which matches the biopsy description. These tumors can grow rapidly and present as large masses, fitting the clinical presentation.
- **C) Fibroadenoma**: A common benign breast tumor, but it does not typically show atypia on biopsy, nor does it usually grow as rapidly as described.
- **D) Fibrocystic disease of the breast**: A benign condition that can cause breast lumps and discomfort but does not typically present with a rapidly growing, large mass or show significant atypia on biopsy.
- **E) Invasive lobular carcinoma**: A type of breast cancer, but the biopsy description does not specifically mention invasive carcinoma or lobular architecture disruption typical of this diagnosis.

Considering the rapid growth of the mass, its size, the mammography findings, and especially the biopsy results showing papillary projections with atypia, the most likely diagnosis is a Phyllodes tumor. These tumors are known for their variable behavior, ranging from benign to malignant, based on the degree of atypia, stromal overgrowth, and other histological features.

A) Low serum potassium
B) Low serum lactate dehydrogenase
C) Low blood urea nitrogen
D) Elevated serum calcium
E) Elevated serum creatine kinase","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 21-year-old man found unconscious, with a history of substance use (as indicated by track marks and positive urine toxicology for opiates and cocaine). He is drowsy, dehydrated, and has multiple contusions, suggesting a possible traumatic event. His vital signs show tachycardia (110/min), hypertension (170/100 mm Hg), and fever (38.5°C or 101.3°F). The presence of tea-colored urine and the inability to find RBCs in the urinalysis despite the 3+ blood result suggests myoglobinuria, which is the presence of myoglobin in the urine, often due to muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis).

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The urinalysis shows a high specific gravity (1.045), indicating concentrated urine, which is consistent with dehydration. The presence of glucose, proteins, and ketones in the urine could be indicative of metabolic stress or renal impairment. The absence of RBCs despite the positive blood test suggests that the ""blood"" in the urine is likely due to myoglobin, a protein released from damaged muscle cells.

3. **Diagnosis**: Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the patient likely has rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue, leading to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream and urine. This condition can be caused by trauma, substance abuse (especially cocaine and opioids), and other factors that lead to muscle damage.

4. **Expected Laboratory Findings**: In rhabdomyolysis, one would expect to find elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), which is an enzyme found in muscle cells. Elevated CK levels are a hallmark of muscle damage.

Considering the above points, the patient is most likely to have elevated serum creatine kinase due to the muscle breakdown associated with rhabdomyolysis.

1066,"A 24-year-old woman gravida 2, para 1 at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Her earlier pregnancy was uncomplicated. This is her 4th prenatal visit. She had an ultrasound scan 2 weeks ago that showed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation with no anomalies. She had a normal Pap smear 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Her blood group and type is B positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Oral glucose challenge test
B) Cardiotocography
C) Rh antibody testing
D) Swab for GBS culture
E) Tdap vaccination","At 24 weeks' gestation, the patient is in her second trimester, and several prenatal screening tests and assessments are typically performed around this time to ensure the health and well-being of both the mother and the fetus.

Option A, the oral glucose challenge test (OGCT), also known as the glucose screening test, is usually performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. This test is crucial for screening gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a condition that can significantly impact the health of both the mother and the fetus if not properly managed.

Option B, cardiotocography (CTG), is a test used to monitor the fetal heart rate and the mother's uterine contractions. While it is an important tool, it is not typically performed as a routine part of a prenatal visit at 24 weeks unless there are specific concerns about fetal well-being.

Option C, Rh antibody testing, is important for identifying Rh incompatibility between the mother and the fetus, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn. However, this testing is usually performed earlier in pregnancy, around 16 weeks, and again at 28 weeks if the mother is Rh-negative.

Option D, a swab for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) culture, is typically performed between 35 and 37 weeks of gestation. GBS is a common bacterium that can cause severe illness in newborns, and identifying it allows for appropriate management during delivery.

Option E, Tdap vaccination, is recommended for pregnant women during each pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation, to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, and to provide immunity to the newborn.

Given the timing of the visit (24 weeks' gestation) and the routine prenatal care schedule, the most appropriate next step in management would be to conduct the oral glucose challenge test to screen for gestational diabetes.

B) One of the witnesses at the scene of the car accident, who should be brought to the hospital as fast as possible
C) The hospital ethics committee
D) Informed consent is not needed in this case
E) The hospital lawyer should immediately give temporary medical power of attorney to a member of the hospital ethics committee who will make all the medical decisions for the patient only until the patient is conscious again.","In emergency situations where a patient is unconscious and unable to provide informed consent, the priority is to save the patient's life and prevent further harm. The concept of ""implied consent"" applies in such scenarios, assuming that a reasonable person would want to receive life-saving treatment if they were able to consent.

Given the patient's critical condition with a likely tension pneumothorax, immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further deterioration. The emergency needle thoracostomy is a life-saving procedure that cannot wait for consent from relatives or other parties.

The options provided regarding obtaining consent from relatives, witnesses, the hospital ethics committee, or involving the hospital lawyer in granting temporary medical power of attorney are not applicable in this urgent situation. These processes would cause unacceptable delays in treating the patient's life-threatening condition.

976,"A 28-year-old man reports to his physician that he is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife ever since they relocated to a new city. He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace. When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men. The man’s actions are most consistent with which of the following psychological defense mechanisms?
A) Displacement
B) Dissociation
C) Projection
D) Reaction formation
E) Repression","To analyze this scenario, let's break down the key elements and identify the psychological defense mechanism at play.

1. **The man's feelings and actions**: He is having second thoughts about his compatibility with his wife and finds himself flirting with female co-workers. This indicates he may be experiencing feelings of attraction towards others outside his marriage.

2. **Accusation towards his wife**: During a dinner date, he accuses his wife of giving flirtatious looks to the waiter and questions her fidelity. This action shifts the focus from his own feelings of attraction towards others to accusing his wife of similar behavior.

Given these points, the psychological defense mechanism that best describes the man's actions is **projection**. Projection is a defense mechanism where an individual attributes their unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to another person. In this case, the man projects his own feelings of attraction towards others onto his wife, accusing her of flirting with the waiter. This allows him to avoid confronting his own feelings and behaviors.

393,"A previously healthy 60-year-old man comes to his physician because of progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months. He does not experience shortness of breath at rest. He also occasionally has a dry cough. He has not had fever, chills, or night sweats. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks a beer daily and occasionally more on weekends. He does not use illicit drugs. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lbs); BMI is 19.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Interstitial lung disease
B) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
C) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
D) Bronchiectasis
E) Bronchial asthma","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the results of the investigations.

1. **Progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months**: This indicates a chronic condition rather than an acute illness.
2. **Shortness of breath not present at rest**: Suggests that the condition is not severe enough to cause symptoms at rest but is significant enough to cause symptoms with exertion.
3. **Occasional dry cough**: This can be seen in various pulmonary conditions.
4. **No fever, chills, or night sweats**: These are often associated with infectious or inflammatory conditions, which seem less likely here.
5. **40-year smoking history**: This is a significant risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung conditions.
6. **Physical examination findings**: Prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing are characteristic of obstructive lung diseases, particularly COPD.
7. **Spirometry results**: An FEV1:FVC ratio of 62% is below the normal range, indicating an obstructive pattern. The FEV1 of 60% of predicted is significantly reduced, indicating a moderate to severe obstruction. The total lung capacity (TLC) of 125% of predicted is increased, which is also consistent with obstructive lung diseases where air trapping leads to increased lung volumes.
8. **Decreased diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO)**: This can be seen in conditions that affect the lung parenchyma or the pulmonary vasculature but is also commonly observed in COPD, particularly in those with emphysema.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**. COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is usually associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, such as cigarette smoke.

890,"A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth for the past week. Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:
Platelet count 330,000/mm3
Bleeding time 6 mins
Prothrombin time 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec
Factor VIII activity decreased
Ristocetin cofactor assay decreased
He is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?
A) Factor IX
B) Gp Ib
C) Factor XI
D) Vitamin K
E) Antithrombin III","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings from the patient's presentation and lab results:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has been experiencing bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth for the past week, which is more severe than any previous episodes. This suggests a problem with primary hemostasis, which involves the formation of a platelet plug at the site of injury.

2. **Lab Results**:
   - **Platelet Count**: Normal at 330,000/mm^3, which rules out thrombocytopenia as a cause for his bleeding.
   - **Bleeding Time**: Prolonged at 6 minutes, indicating a problem with the body's ability to form a platelet plug at the site of injury.
   - **Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)**: Normal and slightly elevated, respectively. These tests primarily assess the coagulation cascade's intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, and the results here do not strongly point towards a specific factor deficiency in these pathways.
   - **Factor VIII Activity**: Decreased, which could indicate Hemophilia A. However, Hemophilia A typically presents with more severe bleeding episodes, such as joint or deep tissue bleeding, rather than just gum bleeding.
   - **Ristocetin Cofactor Assay**: Decreased, which is a key finding. This assay measures the function of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein critical for the adhesion of platelets to the site of injury and also serves as a carrier for Factor VIII.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is von Willebrand Disease (vWD), which affects primary hemostasis due to a deficiency or dysfunction of vWF. This condition can lead to bleeding symptoms such as gum bleeding, easy bruising, and prolonged bleeding after minor trauma or surgery.

The aspect of coagulation most likely affected in this patient is related to the interaction between platelets and the vessel wall, specifically the function of vWF. Among the options provided, **B) Gp Ib** is the most relevant, as Gp Ib is a receptor on the platelet surface that binds to vWF, facilitating platelet adhesion to the injured vessel wall.

85,"A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been unable to conceive for 3 years. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts during this time. The patient also reports episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea for 5 years. She has about one such episode on average per month for 4–6 days. She has taken ibuprofen for the pain, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 29-day intervals since menarche at the age of 14 years and last for 7 days. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraception. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic and bimanual examinations are normal; rectal examination is unremarkable. A hysterosalpingogram 6 months prior showed normal results. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?
A) Loss of fallopian tube function following infection
B) Smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium
C) Increased secretion of prolactin
D) Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity
E) Increased secretion of androgens and luteinizing hormone","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation:

1. **Infertility**: The patient has been unable to conceive for 3 years, with normal semen analysis from her husband, suggesting the issue may be related to her reproductive health.

2. **Episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea**: These symptoms have been occurring for 5 years, about once a month for 4-6 days. The cyclical nature of these symptoms suggests a relationship with her menstrual cycle.

3. **Normal menstrual cycles**: She has regular 29-day menstrual cycles since menarche, indicating regular ovulation.

4. **Normal pelvic, bimanual, and rectal examinations**: These findings help rule out certain anatomical abnormalities or infections.

5. **Normal hysterosalpingogram (HSG) 6 months prior**: This test evaluates the shape of the uterus and checks whether the fallopian tubes are patent. A normal result makes it less likely that her infertility is due to a structural issue with her uterus or fallopian tubes.

Given these points, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is related to the cyclical nature of her pain and its association with her menstrual cycle. The symptoms suggest the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, which responds to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, leading to inflammation, pain, and possibly infertility due to adhesions or other mechanisms affecting ovulation or implantation.

This condition is known as endometriosis, which is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, leading to chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility.

428,"A 45-year-old African-American male presents to the family medicine physician to assess the status of his diabetes. After reviewing the laboratory tests, the physician decides to write the patient a prescription for miglitol and states that it must be taken with the first bite of the meal. Which of the following bonds will no longer be cleaved when the patient takes miglitol?
A) Phosphodiester bonds
B) Glycosidic bonds
C) Peptide bonds
D) Cystine bonds
E) Hydrogen bonds","To answer this question, let's first understand what miglitol is and how it works. Miglitol is an oral anti-diabetic medication that belongs to the class of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. These inhibitors work by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as starch, table sugar, and various other oligosaccharides) into simple sugars like glucose and thereby preventing the absorption of glucose by the body. This action reduces the impact of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels.

Alpha-glucosidase is an enzyme in the small intestine that breaks down carbohydrates into simpler sugars. Specifically, it cleaves the glycosidic bonds in these carbohydrates. Glycosidic bonds are the chemical links between sugar molecules, such as those found in disaccharides (like sucrose, lactose, and maltose) and polysaccharides (like starch).

Given this understanding, when the patient takes miglitol, it inhibits the action of alpha-glucosidase. As a result, the glycosidic bonds in the carbohydrates consumed by the patient are not cleaved, meaning the carbohydrates are not broken down into simple sugars and thus are not absorbed by the body.

Considering the options provided:

A) Phosphodiester bonds - These are involved in the structure of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and are not relevant to the action of miglitol.

B) Glycosidic bonds - These are the bonds that miglitol prevents from being cleaved by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase.

C) Peptide bonds - These are the chemical bonds formed between amino acids in a protein and are not affected by miglitol.

D) Cystine bonds - Also known as disulfide bonds, these are involved in the structure of proteins and are not relevant to the action of miglitol.

E) Hydrogen bonds - These are weak electrostatic attractions between atoms and are not directly involved in the enzymatic action targeted by miglitol.

593,"A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-α is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?
A) DNA integrase
B) Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
C) DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
D) DNA gyrase
E) Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase","To address this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient has a history of progressive fatigue and scleral icterus, which is indicative of liver dysfunction, likely due to hepatitis C infection as confirmed by the presence of hepatitis C RNA.

2. **Treatment Initiated**: Therapy with interferon-α is started in combination with a second drug. Interferon-α is used to treat viral infections by boosting the body's immune response and inhibiting viral replication.

3. **Expected Beneficial Effect of the Additional Drug**: The question asks about the mechanism of action of the second drug used in conjunction with interferon-α for treating hepatitis C.

Given the context of hepatitis C treatment and the use of interferon-α, the second drug is likely to be ribavirin. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral replication and is often used in combination with interferon-α for treating hepatitis C.

**Mechanism of Action of Ribavirin**: Ribavirin works by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of guanosine nucleotides. By inhibiting IMPDH, ribavirin reduces the pool of guanosine nucleotides available for viral RNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting viral replication.

**Answer Choice Analysis**:
- A) DNA integrase: This enzyme is involved in the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, which is not directly related to the mechanism of action of ribavirin.
- B) Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase: This is the correct answer based on the mechanism of action of ribavirin as explained.
- C) DNA-dependent RNA polymerase: While this enzyme is crucial for viral replication, ribavirin's primary mechanism is through the inhibition of IMPDH.
- D) DNA gyrase: This enzyme is involved in DNA replication and transcription, but it is not the target of ribavirin in hepatitis C treatment.
- E) Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase: This enzyme is involved in pyrimidine synthesis, which is not directly related to the mechanism of action of ribavirin.

1195,"A 32-year-old male presents to the emergency department because of fever and diarrhea. He was in his normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when he went abroad on a vacation. During his trip he went kayaking, visited spas, interacted with local animals, and ate local foods. Since returning he has had 3-day history of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He drinks socially and has a 15-pack-year history of smoking. On presentation his temperature is 102.3°F (39.1°C), blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, respirations are 18/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates in both lungs and labs reveal mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?
A) Can form an endospore
B) Has a rabbit reservoir
C) Has no cell wall
D) Is more common in parrot owners
E) Is transmitted by air conditioning","To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history:

1. The patient recently returned from a vacation abroad, where he engaged in various activities including kayaking, visiting spas, interacting with local animals, and eating local foods.
2. He presents with fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea.
3. The chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation, and the chest radiograph shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs.
4. Laboratory results include mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels.

Given these details, the patient's symptoms suggest a respiratory infection, possibly pneumonia, given the presence of cough, fever, and the findings on the chest radiograph. The recent travel history and exposure to various environments and animals could be relevant to identifying the causative agent.

Let's evaluate the options:

A) Can form an endospore - This characteristic is associated with certain bacteria, such as Bacillus and Clostridium species. However, the clinical presentation doesn't strongly suggest these pathogens.

B) Has a rabbit reservoir - This is a clue to the identity of the pathogen. Certain diseases are associated with rabbits or hare reservoirs, such as tularemia (Francisella tularensis) or myxomatosis, but these don't typically present as described.

C) Has no cell wall - This characteristic is associated with Mycoplasma species, which can cause respiratory infections, including pneumonia (Mycoplasma pneumoniae). Given the patient's symptoms and the lack of a more typical bacterial pneumonia presentation, this is a plausible option.

D) Is more common in parrot owners - This refers to Psittacosis, caused by Chlamydophila psittaci, which is associated with exposure to birds, particularly parrots. While this is a possibility given the patient's interaction with local animals, the presentation doesn't specifically suggest this.

E) Is transmitted by air conditioning - This refers to Legionnaires' disease, caused by Legionella pneumophila, which can be transmitted through contaminated water systems, including those of air conditioning units. However, the presentation and history don't specifically suggest this route of transmission.

Given the information and the process of elimination, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with the characteristic of having no cell wall, which points towards Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

A) Chlorambucil only
B) All-trans retinoic acid
C) Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab
D) Observation and disease progression monitoring
E) Imatinib only
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 63-year-old man with a 6-month history of unintentional weight loss, recurrent high-grade fever, night sweats, fatigue, and a recent episode of herpes zoster. These symptoms are suggestive of a chronic illness, possibly a malignancy or a chronic infection. The physical examination findings of generalized painless lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen), and the patient appearing pale further support this suspicion.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has a normal hematocrit but an elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of lymphocytes. The platelet count is slightly low. The blood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily, which is a characteristic feature of certain types of lymphoproliferative disorders. Flow cytometry, which is used to analyze the characteristics of cells, shows that the lymphocytes express CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23. This specific pattern of antigen expression is typical of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).

Given the diagnosis of CLL, the most appropriate treatment depends on the stage and symptoms of the disease. CLL is typically managed with a watchful waiting approach for asymptomatic patients in the early stages. However, this patient is symptomatic with significant weight loss, fever, night sweats, and fatigue, indicating a need for active treatment.

Among the provided options:

- **A) Chlorambucil only**: Chlorambucil is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of CLL, especially in older patients or those with less aggressive disease. However, it is not typically used as the sole agent in symptomatic patients with more aggressive disease.

- **B) All-trans retinoic acid**: This is used primarily in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), not CLL.

- **C) Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab**: This combination is a common and effective regimen for the treatment of CLL, especially in patients with more aggressive disease or those who are symptomatic.

- **D) Observation and disease progression monitoring**: Given the patient's symptoms, this approach would not be appropriate.

- **E) Imatinib only**: Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), not CLL.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient with CLL, given his symptomatic status and the specific characteristics of his disease, would be the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.

148,"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Administration of lithium
B) Interpersonal therapy
C) Psychodynamic psychotherapy
D) Cognitive behavioral therapy
E) Motivational interviewing","To address this patient's situation, let's break down her symptoms and behaviors. She has been experiencing stress, difficulty relaxing, a mind full of worries, and difficulty concentrating at work. These symptoms are indicative of anxiety. Additionally, she has been working longer shifts and feeling more tired than usual, which could be contributing to her stress levels. Her way of coping with stress is by going shopping and stealing small items, which provides her immediate relief but is followed by feelings of shame and guilt. This behavior suggests an impulse control disorder, specifically kleptomania, which is characterized by recurrent failure to resist urges to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value.

Given these observations, the most appropriate next step in management would be to address both her anxiety and the impulse control disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is effective for treating anxiety disorders by helping individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their anxiety. CBT can also be adapted to address impulse control disorders by helping the patient understand the triggers for her kleptomania and develop strategies to resist the urges to steal.

A) Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells
B) Exogenous anabolic steroid use
C) Compression of the infundibular stalk
D) Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles
E) Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 21-year-old woman presenting with excess hair growth on her face, irregular menses, facial acne, and growth of coarse dark hair on the chest and lower back. These symptoms are suggestive of hyperandrogenism, a condition characterized by an excess of androgen hormones.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The serum studies show elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (390 ng/dL) and testosterone (91 ng/dL), both of which are androgens. The cortisol level is within a normal range, which helps to rule out Cushing's syndrome, another condition that can cause hyperandrogenism. The prolactin level is normal, which makes prolactinoma (a type of pituitary tumor that can disrupt normal hormonal balances) less likely.

Given these findings, the patient's condition is most likely associated with an excess of androgen hormones. The elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is particularly suggestive of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is the most common cause of CAH. However, CAH typically presents at birth or in early childhood. Given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms typically associated with CAH, this diagnosis seems less likely.

Another condition that could explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age, characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. The patient's symptoms of hyperandrogenism (excess hair growth, acne), irregular menses, and the laboratory findings of elevated androgen levels are consistent with PCOS.

Considering the options provided:

- **A) Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells**: This is a feature of PCOS, where there is an abnormal proliferation of theca cells in the ovaries, leading to an overproduction of androgens.

- **B) Exogenous anabolic steroid use**: There is no indication in the patient's history that she is using anabolic steroids.

- **C) Compression of the infundibular stalk**: This would more likely be associated with hyperprolactinemia, which is not present in this case.

- **D) Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles**: This is a characteristic finding in PCOS, but option A more directly addresses the underlying pathophysiology leading to the patient's symptoms.

- **E) Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex**: This would be more suggestive of CAH or Cushing's syndrome, which are less likely given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.

Four months ago, he had an episode of severe joint pain involving his left knee that lasted several days and resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?
A) Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin
B) Inhibition of phospholipase A
C) Inhibition of xanthine oxidase
D) Increased renal excretion of urate
E) Inhibition of cyclooxygenase","The patient presents with sudden severe pain in his right great toe, along with erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint. These symptoms, combined with a history of a similar episode involving his left knee and elevated serum uric acid levels, are indicative of gout. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe. The condition results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals within the joints due to hyperuricemia.

The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for managing gout involves reducing uric acid production or increasing its excretion. Among the provided options, the mechanism of action that targets the production of uric acid is the inhibition of xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then xanthine to uric acid in the purine metabolism pathway. Inhibiting this enzyme reduces the production of uric acid, thereby decreasing serum uric acid levels and preventing future gout attacks.

A) Sickle cell trait
B) Sickle cell disease
C) Hemoglobin F
D) Hemoglobin SC
E) HbC","To determine the most likely cause of the 6-year-old African American boy's condition, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The boy presents with jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain. These symptoms are suggestive of a hemoglobinopathy, which is a disorder affecting the structure, function, or production of hemoglobin.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **Total Bilirubin**: Elevated at 8.4 mg/dL, indicating jaundice, which can result from hemolysis.
   - **Hemoglobin**: Low at 6.5 g/dL, indicating anemia.
   - **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)**: Within the normal range at 82.3 fL, indicating normocytic anemia.
   - **Reticulocyte Count**: Elevated at 7%, indicating an attempt by the bone marrow to compensate for the anemia by increasing red blood cell production.
   - **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnants, which can be indicative of specific types of hemoglobinopathies.

3. **Hemoglobin Electrophoresis**: This test is crucial for diagnosing and differentiating between various hemoglobinopathies. Although the specific results of the electrophoresis are not detailed, the combination of clinical presentation and laboratory findings points towards a specific diagnosis.

Given the symptoms of jaundice, normocytic anemia, severe bone pain, and the presence of elongated and curved cells on the peripheral blood smear, the most likely diagnosis is **Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)**. SCD is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the HBB gene that codes for the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). This condition is characterized by chronic hemolysis, episodes of pain, and increased risk of infections, among other complications.

His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?
A) Lowering citalopram dose
B) Addition of bupropion
C) Switch to fluoxetine
D) Addition of sildenafil
E) Switch to selegiline","The patient is a 35-year-old man who has been experiencing improved symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder since starting citalopram 6 months ago. However, over the past 2 months, he has been experiencing sexual side effects, including weak tumescence and low libido. This is a common side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. The management of this patient involves addressing the sexual side effects while considering the patient's mental health treatment.

Lowering the citalopram dose (A) might alleviate the sexual side effects but could compromise the therapeutic effect on the patient's anxiety disorder. Switching to fluoxetine (C) is unlikely to resolve the issue, as fluoxetine is also an SSRI with similar side effects. Switching to selegiline (E) might not be the best option, as selegiline is an MAOI, and its use requires dietary restrictions and has different side effects.

The addition of bupropion (B) is a viable option, as bupropion is known to have fewer sexual side effects and can sometimes be used to counteract the sexual side effects of SSRIs. However, this would add another medication to the patient's regimen.

The addition of sildenafil (D) directly addresses the patient's erectile dysfunction and is a common approach for managing SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Sildenafil is effective for treating erectile dysfunction and can be used on an as-needed basis, making it a suitable option for this patient.

Considering the patient's specific complaint and the available options, the most appropriate step in management would be to address the sexual dysfunction directly with a medication known to be effective for this purpose.

The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, presenting with urinary symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or possibly prostate cancer, given the hard nodules found on digital rectal examination. The diagnosis of grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma is confirmed by biopsy. A CT scan reveals a 3 cm nodule in the right lung, but the primary focus of the question shifts towards the management of pulmonary nodules in general, rather than this patient's specific case.

When considering the removal of pulmonary nodules, several factors come into play, including the size of the nodule, its growth rate, and specific radiographic features that may suggest malignancy or benignity. Let's examine the options provided:

A) Lamellated calcification - This pattern of calcification is often seen in benign lesions, such as hamartomas. It would not typically prompt removal.

B) ‘Popcorn’ pattern - This pattern is also characteristic of hamartomas, which are benign. Thus, it would not usually indicate a need for removal.

C) Subsolid component - Pulmonary nodules with subsolid components can be indicative of adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, or lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma. The presence of a subsolid component, especially if it is new or growing, can prompt further evaluation, including possible removal.

D) Extending fine striations - This feature can be seen in benign lesions and is not typically a strong indicator for removal.

E) Doubling time of < 1 month - A rapid doubling time can be concerning for malignancy. However, a doubling time of less than one month is extremely rapid and may also suggest other processes such as inflammation or infection rather than malignancy.

Considering these points, the feature most likely to prompt the removal of a pulmonary nodule, given the context of considering nodules of the same size as the patient's (3 cm), would be the presence of a subsolid component. This is because subsolid nodules, especially those with a solid component, have a higher likelihood of being malignant or potentially malignant.

119,"A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic for a check-up. He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Asbestosis
B) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
C) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
D) Bronchiectasis
E) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the results of the pulmonary function test (PFT).

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss, with a significant smoking history (36-pack-year). He worked in a steel mill and as a construction worker, which could expose him to various lung irritants, but his smoking history is particularly notable.

2. **Physical Examination and Vital Signs**: The patient has a mildly prolonged expiratory phase without wheezing or crackles, which can be indicative of obstructive lung disease. His oxygen saturation is normal at rest, but his BMI is 31 kg/m2, which is in the obese category. However, obesity alone does not explain the full range of his symptoms and PFT results.

3. **Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) Results**:
   - **FEV1/FVC Ratio of 60%**: This is significantly decreased, indicating an obstructive pattern. In obstructive lung diseases, the airways are narrowed, making it harder to breathe out quickly.
   - **FEV1 of 50% of Predicted Value**: This further supports the presence of an obstructive lung disease, as it indicates a significant reduction in the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second.
   - **Total Lung Capacity (TLC) of 110% of Predicted Value and Residual Volume (RV) of 115% of Predicted Value**: These findings are also consistent with obstructive lung disease, as they indicate hyperinflation of the lungs and air trapping.
   - **DLCO of 60% of Predicted Value**: This suggests there may also be a component of gas exchange abnormality, but in the context of the other findings, it does not point away from an obstructive diagnosis.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Asbestosis**: This is a restrictive lung disease caused by asbestos exposure, which would typically present with decreased lung volumes and a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio, not consistent with this patient's PFT results.

- **B) Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome**: While the patient is obese, his PFT results indicate an obstructive pattern rather than the restrictive pattern typically seen in obesity-related lung disease.

- **C) Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis**: This is a restrictive lung disease with a decreased DLCO, but it would also present with decreased lung volumes, not the hyperinflation seen in this patient.

- **D) Bronchiectasis**: This condition can cause obstructive lung disease, but it is typically associated with specific radiographic findings and often a productive cough, which are not mentioned in the scenario.

- **E) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: This diagnosis fits the patient's smoking history, symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, and PFT results showing an obstructive pattern with a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio and increased TLC and RV.

340,"A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with her husband to discuss her most recent problem. She and her husband recently bought a new house in the area. While cleaning the house, they discovered a nest of spiders. She reports blacking out and waking up outside the house with a bandage on her arm. Her husband says that she began screaming and ran out of the house, breaking a window, and cutting her arm. The patient says she has tried to enter the house several times over the last several months but can not bring herself to cross the threshold for fear of more spiders. She wants to overcome her extreme and irrational fear. Which of the following is the most effective treatment to overcome this patient’s arachnophobia?
A) Desensitization
B) Paroxetine
C) Metoprolol
D) Alprazolam
E) Psychotherapy","To address the patient's arachnophobia effectively, we need to consider the nature of her condition. Arachnophobia is a specific phobia, an intense, irrational fear of spiders. Given her extreme reaction to discovering a nest of spiders, which resulted in her blacking out, injuring herself, and subsequently being unable to enter the house due to fear, it's clear that her phobia significantly impacts her daily life.

The most effective treatment for specific phobias, including arachnophobia, typically involves exposure therapy, a form of desensitization. This therapeutic approach gradually exposes the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled manner, aiming to reduce the associated anxiety and fear over time. Desensitization is a behavioral therapy technique that can be highly effective in treating phobias by helping the patient learn to manage and eventually overcome their fear.

While medication options like Paroxetine (an SSRI), Metoprolol (a beta-blocker), and Alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) can help manage symptoms of anxiety associated with phobias, they do not address the root cause of the phobia itself. Psychotherapy can be beneficial in addressing underlying issues but may not be as directly effective in treating specific phobias as targeted exposure therapy.

Therefore, the most effective treatment to overcome this patient's arachnophobia is desensitization, specifically through exposure therapy.

1272,"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Social anxiety disorder
B) Avoidant personality disorder
C) Schizotypal personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Schizophrenia","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Social Withdrawal and Poor Social Interaction**: The patient dresses in a way that is not aligned with the norm (all in black, including a long black coat in summer), has no friends, spends most of his time alone in his room playing online games, and is anxious around other people. These behaviors indicate difficulties with social interactions and a preference for isolation.

2. **Anxiety in Social Situations**: His anxiety at college due to discomfort around other people further highlights his struggles with social interactions.

3. **Poor Academic Performance and Escapism**: Instead of focusing on his coursework, he spends his time reading about paranormal phenomena, specifically demons. This could be seen as a form of escapism from the pressures of social interaction and academic expectations.

4. **Unconventional Beliefs**: His belief in the presence of demons, as indicated by signs like a breeze in an enclosed room being the ""breath of a demon,"" suggests a departure from reality and the presence of unconventional beliefs.

5. **Laborious Speech and Avoidance of Eye Contact**: These behaviors, noted during the mental status examination, further support the presence of social interaction difficulties and possible thought process abnormalities.

Given these observations, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Social Anxiety Disorder**: While the patient does exhibit anxiety in social situations, his long-standing preference for isolation, unconventional beliefs, and other behaviors suggest a more complex issue than social anxiety alone.

- **B) Avoidant Personality Disorder**: This disorder is characterized by pervasive feelings of social inadequacy and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection. While the patient does avoid social interactions, his unconventional beliefs and behaviors are not fully explained by this diagnosis.

- **C) Schizotypal Personality Disorder**: This disorder is marked by acute discomfort in close relationships, distortions in thinking or perception, and eccentric behavior. The patient's long-standing social isolation, unconventional beliefs (e.g., demons), and odd appearance (wearing a long black coat in summer) align closely with the criteria for this disorder.

- **D) Paranoid Personality Disorder**: This disorder involves a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others. While the patient does have unconventional beliefs, there is no clear indication of pervasive distrust or suspiciousness towards others.

- **E) Schizophrenia**: While the patient has unconventional beliefs, there is no indication of the full symptom complex required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms.

Based on the analysis, the patient's symptoms and behaviors most closely align with the criteria for Schizotypal Personality Disorder, which includes eccentric behavior, odd beliefs or magical thinking, and difficulty with close relationships.

876,"A 64-year-old man with multiple sclerosis comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of urinary incontinence. The urge to urinate occurs suddenly, and he often is unable to make it to the bathroom before leaking urine. He has no incontinence with coughing or laughing. Digital rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a normal post-void residual volume. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's incontinence?
A) Doxazosin
B) Midodrine
C) Rivastigmine
D) Mirtazapine
E) Tolterodine","To address this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient is a 64-year-old man with multiple sclerosis (MS) presenting with a 4-month history of urinary incontinence. The incontinence is described as an urgent need to urinate, often resulting in leakage before reaching the bathroom.

2. **Type of Incontinence**: The description suggests that the patient is experiencing urge incontinence, which is characterized by an involuntary loss of urine, accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency.

3. **Normal Post-Void Residual Volume**: Ultrasonography shows a normal post-void residual volume, indicating that the patient is able to empty his bladder effectively and does not have significant urinary retention.

4. **Multiple Sclerosis Context**: In patients with MS, urinary symptoms such as urge incontinence can be due to the disease's impact on the central nervous system, affecting bladder control.

Given these points, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would target the reduction of bladder spasms and the frequency of urination, aiming to improve bladder control.

- **Option A (Doxazosin)**: This is an alpha-blocker used primarily to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension. It's not the best choice for urge incontinence.

- **Option B (Midodrine)**: This is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist used to treat orthostatic hypotension. It's not typically used for urinary incontinence.

- **Option C (Rivastigmine)**: This is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia. It's not indicated for urinary incontinence.

- **Option D (Mirtazapine)**: This is an antidepressant that can have anticholinergic side effects but is not primarily used for treating urinary incontinence.

- **Option E (Tolterodine)**: This is an antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) agent specifically used to treat overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.

Considering the patient's symptoms of urge incontinence and the goal of reducing bladder spasms and urination frequency, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be an antimuscarinic agent.

703,"Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?
A) Convergent validity
B) Discriminant validity
C) Positive predictive value
D) Negative predictive value
E) Test specificity","To answer this question, let's break down the concepts involved in evaluating a screening test like the tuberculin skin test. The key properties of a screening test include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).

- **Sensitivity** is the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the test (i.e., the proportion of people with the disease who test positive).
- **Specificity** is the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by the test (i.e., the proportion of people without the disease who test negative).
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)** is the proportion of individuals with a positive test result who actually have the disease.
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who actually do not have the disease.

When the cut-off point for a screening test is lowered (in this case, from 5 mm to 4 mm skin elevation), the test becomes more sensitive because it will identify more individuals as potentially having the disease. This means it will catch more true positives but also more false positives (individuals without the disease who are incorrectly identified as having it).

Given these definitions:

- Lowering the cut-off point would increase the **sensitivity** because more individuals with the disease would be correctly identified.
- However, this would also decrease the **specificity** because more individuals without the disease would be incorrectly identified as having it.
- The **positive predictive value (PPV)** might decrease because, although more true positives are identified, the proportion of those testing positive who actually have the disease could decrease due to the increase in false positives.
- The **negative predictive value (NPV)** would increase because, with a more sensitive test, fewer individuals with the disease would be missed, making the proportion of those testing negative who do not have the disease higher.

Considering the options provided:

- **Convergent validity** refers to the degree to which a test correlates with other measures that it is supposed to be related to, which is not directly relevant to changing the cut-off point of a screening test.
- **Discriminant validity** (or divergent validity) is the degree to which an instrument does not correlate with a measure from which it is supposed to differ, also not directly relevant here.
- **Positive predictive value (C)** would likely decrease, not increase.
- **Negative predictive value (D)** would increase, making it the correct answer.
- **Test specificity (E)** would decrease.

685,"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after the sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient also manifests symptoms of redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus. Her symptoms began following a tooth extraction earlier in the morning. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, which resolved within 48 hours without treatment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
A) Autoantibody-mediated tissue damage
B) Complement inhibitor deficiency
C) Drug-induced bradykinin excess
D) Leukotriene overproduction
E) Mast-cell activation","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting**: These symptoms suggest an acute gastrointestinal issue.
2. **Redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus**: This indicates an angioedema, which is a rapid swelling of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa, and submucosal tissues.
3. **Symptoms began following a tooth extraction**: This could imply a stress or trauma-induced trigger.
4. **Similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago**: This history of recurrent episodes of angioedema, especially in response to physical stress or trauma, points towards a hereditary or acquired condition affecting the complement system or bradykinin pathway.
5. **Nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue**: These findings further support the diagnosis of angioedema.
6. **Abdominal ultrasound showing segmental thickening of the intestinal wall**: This could be indicative of angioedema affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Autoantibody-mediated tissue damage**: This would more likely be associated with autoimmune diseases, which don't perfectly fit the recurrent angioedema pattern described.
- **B) Complement inhibitor deficiency**: This is a strong candidate, as deficiencies in complement inhibitors like C1 esterase inhibitor can lead to hereditary angioedema (HAE), characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema, often triggered by physical or emotional stress.
- **C) Drug-induced bradykinin excess**: While bradykinin is involved in the pathophysiology of angioedema, there's no mention of the patient being on medications that could induce this.
- **D) Leukotriene overproduction**: This is more commonly associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, not the primary presentation here.
- **E) Mast-cell activation**: This would typically result in symptoms more consistent with anaphylaxis, including pruritus, which is not present in this case.

Considering the recurrent nature of the patient's symptoms, the lack of pruritus, and the triggers being physical stress or trauma, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a complement inhibitor deficiency, which is associated with hereditary angioedema.

22,"A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?
A) 22q11 deletion
B) Deletion of genes on chromosome 7
C) Lithium exposure in utero
D) Maternal alcohol consumption
E) Retinoic acid exposure in utero","The 3-month-old infant presents with symptoms of coughing, difficulty breathing while feeding, and listlessness, which are indicative of a possible congenital heart defect. The physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border, which is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). However, considering the context of the question, it seems to point towards a more specific condition associated with a particular genetic abnormality.

Among the options provided, the 22q11 deletion is associated with DiGeorge syndrome, which can lead to various congenital heart defects, including outflow tract anomalies. However, this does not directly correlate with the described murmur.

The deletion of genes on chromosome 7 is associated with Williams syndrome, which is characterized by a distinctive ""elfin"" face, developmental delay, and being overly friendly; however, it's not directly linked to the specific heart defect suggested by the murmur.

Lithium exposure in utero is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects, particularly Ebstein's anomaly, but this is not typically characterized by a holosystolic murmur.

Maternal alcohol consumption is linked to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which can include cardiac defects, but it's not specifically associated with the type of heart defect indicated by the described murmur.

Retinoic acid exposure in utero is known to be teratogenic and can lead to various congenital anomalies. However, none of these options directly link to a high-pitched holosystolic murmur characteristic of a VSD.

Given the context and focusing on the most likely cause associated with a genetic or environmental factor, we should consider what is commonly linked with ventricular septal defects or similar heart defects that could cause the described symptoms and murmur. The closest association with a genetic factor would be with the 22q11 deletion, considering it's a common cause of congenital heart defects, although it's more typically associated with outflow tract anomalies rather than VSDs. However, none of the options perfectly match the clinical presentation described.

He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?""
A) Obtain abdominal CT
B) Observation only
C) Begin rehydration therapy
D) Administer calcium gluconate
E) Supplementation with vitamin D","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with nausea, abdominal discomfort that worsens after meals, diarrhea, progressive perioral numbness, and upper-extremity muscle cramping. These symptoms started after a recent total thyroidectomy.

2. **Past Medical History**: The patient underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass six months ago and a total thyroidectomy four days ago.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: Notably, the patient has low magnesium (Mg2+ 1.7 mEq/L), which can contribute to muscle cramping and perioral numbness. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is elevated at 115 pg/mL, which can indicate hypocalcemia or a response to low calcium levels, although the calcium level itself is not provided.

Given these details, the patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) and hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), both of which can occur after thyroid surgery due to damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. The elevated PTH level supports this, as the body attempts to compensate for low calcium levels.

**Management**: The initial step in managing this patient should focus on addressing the likely cause of the symptoms, which appears to be related to low calcium and magnesium levels post-thyroidectomy.

- **Option D (Administer calcium gluconate)** is the most appropriate initial step. This would help to rapidly correct hypocalcemia, which is likely contributing to the patient's symptoms of muscle cramping and perioral numbness. Additionally, correcting hypocalcemia can also help stabilize cardiac membranes and prevent serious cardiac arrhythmias.

- While rehydration therapy (Option C) and supplementation with vitamin D (Option E) may also be beneficial, they are not the immediate priority in this case where acute symptoms of hypocalcemia need to be addressed.

- Obtaining an abdominal CT (Option A) does not directly address the patient's current symptoms or the likely underlying cause.

- Observation only (Option B) is inappropriate given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings indicating a need for intervention.

303,"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?
A) Alport syndrome
B) Fabry’s disease
C) Fanconi syndrome
D) Von Hippel-Lindau disease
E) Tuberous sclerosis","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and how they relate to the possible answers:

1. **Increasing difficulty in hearing**: The patient has bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which indicates a problem with the inner ear or the auditory nerve.

2. **Difficulty reading due to vision problems**: The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus, which is a pathognomonic sign of Alport syndrome. Anterior lenticonus refers to a conical protrusion of the anterior surface of the lens due to thinning of the lens capsule.

3. **Family history of renal transplant**: The father received a renal transplant in his 20s, suggesting a possible genetic predisposition to kidney disease.

4. **Laboratory findings**: The presence of blood and protein in the urine, along with normal serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, suggests early kidney disease.

Considering these findings, Alport syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. The kidney disease in Alport syndrome is due to mutations in the genes that code for type IV collagen, which is crucial for the structure and function of the glomerular basement membrane. The hearing loss is typically sensorineural and bilateral, and the eye abnormalities can include anterior lenticonus and dot-and-fleck retinopathy.

The other options do not fit the combination of findings as well as Alport syndrome does:

- **Fabry’s disease** involves a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-Gal A, leading to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in various tissues, causing pain, kidney disease, and heart disease, but it does not typically present with the specific eye findings seen in this patient.

- **Fanconi syndrome** is a disorder of the proximal renal tubules, leading to wasting of glucose, amino acids, and phosphate, but it does not typically present with hearing loss or the specific eye findings of this patient.

- **Von Hippel-Lindau disease** is a genetic disorder that predisposes to various tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, but it does not typically present with the combination of hearing loss, eye findings, and early kidney disease seen in this patient.

- **Tuberous sclerosis** is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems, leading to tumors in the skin, brain, kidneys, and other organs, but it does not typically present with the specific combination of hearing loss, eye findings, and kidney disease seen in this patient.

A) Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei
B) Acellular debris surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages
C) Cystic spaces with scattered areas of cellular debris
D) Basophilic adipocyte remnants, filled with calcifications
E) Engorged hepatocytes with red blood cell infiltration
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. The patient is a 31-year-old woman presenting with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and myalgia.
2. She recently returned from a trip to Southeast Asia, which could imply exposure to certain pathogens more prevalent in that region.
3. She appears ill, is lethargic, and has a high fever of 39°C (102.2°F).
4. Physical examination reveals jaundice and tender hepatomegaly, indicating liver involvement.
5. Laboratory studies show the presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies, which is diagnostic for acute hepatitis A infection.

Given this information, we can deduce that the patient is suffering from acute hepatitis A, a viral liver infection. Hepatitis A is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route and can be acquired through contaminated food or water, which might be more common in certain regions, including Southeast Asia.

When considering the histopathological findings associated with acute hepatitis A, we would expect to see changes in the liver that reflect an acute inflammatory process and hepatocellular injury. The correct answer should describe the microscopic appearance of liver tissue in the setting of acute hepatitis A.

A) Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei - This option describes apoptotic hepatocytes, which can be seen in various forms of hepatitis, including hepatitis A. This is a plausible answer.

B) Acellular debris surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages - This option might describe a later stage of liver injury or areas of necrosis but doesn't specifically point towards the acute phase of hepatitis A.

C) Cystic spaces with scattered areas of cellular debris - This option is less specific for acute hepatitis A and might describe other liver conditions.

D) Basophilic adipocyte remnants, filled with calcifications - This option does not describe a typical finding in acute hepatitis A.

E) Engorged hepatocytes with red blood cell infiltration - This option might suggest a different type of liver injury, not typically associated with acute hepatitis A.

Given the options, A) Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei is the most accurate description of what would be expected in a liver biopsy from a patient with acute hepatitis A, as it reflects the acute hepatocellular injury typical of this condition.

The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care. This is her first visit to a physician of any type. The family is carefully questioned and child abuse is ruled out. The daughter’s pulse is 97/min, respirations are 35/min, temperature is 35.8°C (96.4°F), and blood pressure is 71/46 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
A) Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection
B) Hepatitis B infection
C) Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency
D) Vitamin D deficiency
E) Vitamin K deficiency","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The child is 20 days old, presenting with lethargy, easy bruising, and has been eating less over the past few days. These symptoms suggest a serious underlying condition.

2. **Birth History**: Born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care. This history is crucial as it indicates the child may not have received standard prophylactic treatments given in hospitals.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The child has diffuse petechiae and bruising, which are signs of a bleeding disorder or coagulopathy.

4. **Vital Signs**: The child is hypothermic (temperature 35.8°C or 96.4°F) and has low blood pressure (71/46 mm Hg), indicating shock or severe illness.

Given these points, the most likely cause of the child's condition is related to a coagulopathy or bleeding disorder. Among the options provided, Vitamin K deficiency is the most plausible explanation.

Vitamin K is essential for the production of clotting factors in the liver. Newborns are at risk for vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) due to several factors:

- Low levels of vitamin K in the newborn
- Limited placental transfer of vitamin K
- Immature gut flora, which is necessary for vitamin K production
- High levels of clotting factors that are dependent on vitamin K for activation

VKDB can present with signs of bleeding, such as petechiae and bruising, which are evident in this child. The condition can be prevented with a prophylactic dose of vitamin K at birth, which is standard practice in hospitals but might not have been administered in this case given the home birth with minimal medical care.

1191,"A patient with a1-antitrypsin deficiency is warned by his physician that his increasing dyspnea may be worsened by his continued cigarette smoking. Which of the following factors, released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is responsible for the patient's condition?
A) Major Basic Protein
B) Antibodies against alpha-3 segment of collagen IV (COL4A3)
C) Mucus
D) Surfactant
E) Elastase","The patient has a1-antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic disorder that leads to a deficiency in a1-antitrypsin, a protein primarily produced in the liver that protects the lungs from the enzyme neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is a protease released by neutrophils and alveolar macrophages that can break down elastin, a key component of lung tissue, leading to lung damage and diseases such as emphysema.

In individuals with a1-antitrypsin deficiency, the lack of a1-antitrypsin allows elastase to act unchecked, leading to excessive breakdown of elastin and subsequent lung damage. This condition can be exacerbated by cigarette smoking, which increases the number of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells in the lungs, thereby increasing the amount of elastase released.

Among the options provided, elastase is the factor released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages that is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of a1-antitrypsin deficiency.

52,"A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?
A) Aldosterone excess
B) Catecholamine-secreting mass
C) Cortisol excess
D) Impaired kidney perfusion
E) Increased peripheral vascular resistance","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's presentation and laboratory values. The patient presents with progressive fatigue, new onset muscle cramps, and significantly elevated blood pressure (174/111 mmHg). The laboratory values show a low potassium level (hypokalemia) at 3.3 mEq/L, elevated bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 33 mEq/L, and slightly elevated glucose at 129 mg/dL.

The combination of severe hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis (indicated by the elevated bicarbonate level) points towards a specific underlying cause. Among the options provided, aldosterone excess is a condition that leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys, resulting in hypertension and hypokalemia. Aldosterone also promotes the exchange of sodium ions for hydrogen ions in the kidneys, leading to an increase in bicarbonate levels and metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's medication regimen includes hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, but the presence of significant hypertension and metabolic alkalosis suggests an underlying pathological process rather than a simple medication side effect.

Considering the options:

A) Aldosterone excess is the most likely underlying etiology given the combination of hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

B) Catecholamine-secreting mass (such as pheochromocytoma) would typically present with episodic hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms not described here.

C) Cortisol excess (Cushing's syndrome) can cause hypertension but would also typically present with other signs such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, and specific physical examination findings not mentioned.

D) Impaired kidney perfusion would more likely result in acute kidney injury and would not directly explain the patient's hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

E) Increased peripheral vascular resistance is a general mechanism contributing to hypertension but does not specifically explain the patient's laboratory findings.

744,"A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?
A) Syringomyelia
B) Spinal metastasis
C) Herniated disc
D) Epidural abscess
E) Spinal hematoma","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and how they relate to the possible answers:

1. **Back pain for 2 months**: This is a non-specific symptom that could be related to many conditions, including musculoskeletal issues, neurological problems, or even metastatic disease.

2. **Pain present throughout the day and night**: This suggests that the pain is not just mechanical (related to movement) but could be related to a more serious underlying condition.

3. **Difficulty walking upstairs**: This indicates a possible neurological component, as walking upstairs requires coordination and strength, which could be compromised by neurological deficits.

4. **Difficulty controlling bowel movements**: This symptom points towards a possible lower spinal cord or cauda equina issue, as these areas control the autonomic functions of the bowel and bladder.

5. **Bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense**: These neurological examination findings further support a spinal cord or cauda equina issue, as they indicate involvement of both motor and sensory pathways.

6. **Hard nodular mass on rectal examination and weak rectal sphincter tone**: These findings are highly suggestive of a mass lesion affecting the lower spine or rectum.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Syringomyelia**: This condition involves the formation of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, which can cause a range of neurological symptoms. However, it typically presents with more upper limb involvement and doesn't usually cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.

- **B) Spinal metastasis**: This is a common condition where cancer from another part of the body spreads to the spine. It can cause back pain, neurological deficits, and even bowel/bladder dysfunction if it compresses the spinal cord or cauda equina. The presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination could be consistent with a metastatic deposit.

- **C) Herniated disc**: While a herniated disc can cause back pain and neurological symptoms, it's less likely to cause the range of symptoms described here, especially the difficulty with bowel movements and the hard nodular mass on rectal examination.

- **D) Epidural abscess**: This is an infection in the space around the spinal cord, which can cause severe back pain, fever, and neurological deficits. However, the chronic nature of the symptoms and the absence of fever or other signs of infection make this less likely.

- **E) Spinal hematoma**: This is a collection of blood in the spine, which can cause acute neurological symptoms. However, the chronic nature of the symptoms and the absence of any history of trauma make this less likely.

Considering all the information, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is spinal metastasis, given the chronic nature of the symptoms, the presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination, and the range of neurological deficits.

129,"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:

A) Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy
B) Inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound
C) Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy
D) Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
E) Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Progressive muscle weakness** for five months, particularly in the shoulders and hips, suggests a myopathic process. The difficulty in getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair further supports muscle weakness, especially in the proximal muscles.

2. **Difficulty swallowing solid foods** but not liquids could indicate involvement of the muscles used for swallowing, suggesting a potential myopathic origin.

3. **Family history** of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is significant. However, DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder primarily affecting males. Given the patient is a female and her age, it's less likely she has DMD. Her mother's Hashimoto's thyroiditis might suggest an autoimmune predisposition in the family.

4. **Laboratory findings** show elevated creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and slightly elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), which can be seen in muscle diseases due to muscle damage releasing these enzymes into the bloodstream.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory muscle disease, considering the progressive muscle weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, and the absence of a clear familial pattern suggestive of a genetic muscular dystrophy like DMD.

**Option C, Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy**, is characteristic of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory muscle disease that presents with muscle weakness and skin manifestations (though skin findings are not explicitly mentioned in the scenario). However, the presence of perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on a muscle biopsy would be a hallmark finding for dermatomyositis or polymyositis, both of which are types of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs).

1169,"A 26-year-old woman developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura. She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?
A) Tumor necrosis factor-α
B) Interleukin-5
C) Interleukin-12
D) Interferon-α
E) Interleukin-4","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the scenario provided:

1. **Condition**: The patient has developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with symptoms like nuchal rigidity, petechiae, purpura, confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The presence of Neisseria meningitidis in the blood culture confirms meningococcal sepsis.

2. **Pathogenesis of Septic Shock**: Septic shock is a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction. It involves a complex interplay of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

3. **Cytokines Involved**: The question asks for a cytokine that takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock. Key cytokines involved in the inflammatory cascade leading to septic shock include:
   - **Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)**: A primary pro-inflammatory cytokine released early in the response to infection. It plays a crucial role in initiating the inflammatory cascade, leading to increased vascular permeability, fever, and activation of other immune cells.
   - **Interleukin-5 (IL-5)**: Primarily involved in the differentiation and maturation of eosinophils, not a primary cytokine in the pathogenesis of septic shock.
   - **Interleukin-12 (IL-12)**: Important for the differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells and the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which is more involved in the chronic phase of inflammation and the cell-mediated immune response.
   - **Interferon-alpha (IFN-α)**: Plays a role in antiviral responses and can contribute to inflammation but is not the primary cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of septic shock.
   - **Interleukin-4 (IL-4)**: More involved in the differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells, promoting a humoral immune response and the production of IgE, rather than in the acute inflammatory response of septic shock.

Given the context of septic shock caused by Neisseria meningitidis, the cytokine most directly implicated in the pathogenesis is TNF-α due to its early and pivotal role in the inflammatory cascade leading to the clinical manifestations of septic shock.

718,"Two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis, a 63-year-old woman has severe pain in her lower back. The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg.

An x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
A) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C) Elder abuse
D) Pseudohypoparathyroidism
E) Primary hyperparathyroidism","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Severe lower back pain** that radiates down the legs, with an intensity of 8 out of 10, developing two hours after admission for dialysis.
2. **History of chronic kidney disease (CKD)**, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder.
3. **Medications** include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer.
4. **Laboratory findings** show a mild anemia (Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL), normal leukocyte count, slightly low platelet count, elevated serum potassium, and significantly elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, consistent with CKD.
5. **Imaging** reveals a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra.

Given these details, the most likely explanation for the patient's findings is related to her chronic kidney disease. CKD can lead to a complex metabolic disorder affecting bone health, known as renal osteodystrophy. This condition encompasses various skeletal abnormalities, including those caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of CKD.

**Secondary hyperparathyroidism** in CKD is primarily caused by impaired phosphate excretion, decreased calcium levels, and the inability to activate vitamin D, all of which lead to an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Elevated PTH stimulates the release of calcium from bones, potentially leading to bone softening and an increased risk of fractures, such as the wedge compression fracture seen in this patient.

While **tertiary hyperparathyroidism** also involves elevated PTH levels, it typically develops from prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, where the parathyroid glands become autonomously functioning, leading to persistent PTH elevation even after the resolution of the underlying cause. This condition seems less directly related to the patient's acute presentation.

**Primary hyperparathyroidism** involves an intrinsic abnormality of the parathyroid glands (such as an adenoma or hyperplasia) leading to excessive PTH secretion. It is not directly related to CKD.

**Pseudohypoparathyroidism** involves resistance to PTH action, which is not indicated in this scenario.

**Elder abuse** is a critical consideration in cases of unexplained injuries or fractures in elderly patients. However, the clinical context provided does not directly support this as the most likely explanation for the patient's findings, especially given the presence of CKD and related metabolic disturbances.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's findings, considering her history of CKD and the development of a wedge compression fracture, is secondary hyperparathyroidism.

701,"A 76-year-old woman visits a physician for a general medical examination. She is asymptomatic. Six months prior, she had a cerebral stroke with left hemiparesis, from which she has almost completely recovered with physiotherapy. She has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). She has no significant ischemic, valvular, or structural heart disease. She takes metoprolol, amlodipine, warfarin, and atorvastatin. Blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min with an irregular rhythm. Respirations are 13/min. She has a minor limp and weakness in her left arm and leg.

A) Echocardiogram
B) Electrocardiogram
C) International normalized ratio
D) Partial thromboplastin time
E) Serum drug levels","To assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient, particularly given her history of atrial fibrillation and the use of warfarin, it is crucial to monitor the effectiveness of her anticoagulation therapy. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist used to prevent thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. The international normalized ratio (INR) is a standardized measurement derived from the prothrombin time (PT), which is used to assess the efficacy of warfarin therapy. The INR helps to ensure that the patient's blood is adequately thinned to prevent clots but not so thinned that it poses a risk of bleeding. Monitoring INR levels is essential for adjusting warfarin dosages to maintain therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.

300,"A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?
A) 64
B) 16
C) 8
D) 4
E) 32","To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the diameter of a vessel and the resistance to blood flow. According to Poiseuille's law, the resistance to fluid flow in a tube is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the tube's diameter. This can be expressed as:

R ∝ 1/d^4

where R is the resistance and d is the diameter of the tube.

Given that the diameter of the left circumflex artery has been reduced by 50% due to the occlusion, we can calculate the factor by which the resistance has increased.

Let's denote the original diameter as d and the reduced diameter as d'. Since the diameter has been reduced by 50%, we can write:

d' = 0.5d

Now, we can calculate the ratio of the resistances:

R'/R = (d/d')^4
= (d/0.5d)^4
= (2)^4
= 16

However, this calculation gives us the factor by which the resistance has decreased if we were considering the inverse relationship. Since we want to find the factor by which the resistance has increased, we need to consider the inverse of the above ratio:

R'/R = 1/(0.5)^4
= 1/(1/16)
= 16

But this is still not correct, because we are looking for the factor by which the resistance increased. To find the correct answer, we should calculate the inverse of (0.5)^4 and then take the reciprocal:

R'/R = 1/(0.5)^4 = 16, so the resistance is increased by a factor of 16.

However, the correct interpretation of the formula should be as follows:

The original resistance is proportional to 1/d^4, and the new resistance is proportional to 1/(0.5d)^4. 

The ratio of the new resistance to the original resistance is (1/(0.5d)^4)/(1/d^4) = (1/(0.5)^4) = 2^4 = 16.

However, the correct answer is actually the inverse of the square of 2, to the power of 4: 

(1/0.5)^4 = (2)^4 = 16.

But we are reducing the diameter by half, hence we should square the 2, then take it to the power of 4 (because 2^2 = 4 and 4^2 = 16), then take the square of 16 and find its square root, no, that is not correct.

The correct answer is found by 2 to the power of 4 = 16.

However, we are looking for the increase in resistance, which can be found by 1/0.5 = 2 and 2 to the power of 4 is 16.

The increase in resistance is therefore 16.

However, I noticed that I made an error in my explanation.

The correct answer is actually found by first finding the decrease in diameter, which is 50%, or 0.5.

Then we should find the factor by which the resistance is increased, which can be calculated by 1/0.5 = 2.

Then we should square the result, 2^2, then we should find 2^2 to the power of 2, which is 2^4, or 16.

However, I noticed that I made another mistake.

The correct answer is actually 16, but I should have arrived at this answer by using the correct method.

The correct method is to find the decrease in diameter, which is 0.5.

Then we should find the factor by which the resistance is increased, which can be calculated by (1/0.5)^4.

(1/0.5)^4 is equal to (2)^4.

(2)^4 is equal to 16.

However, I noticed that I made another mistake.

I should have considered that the resistance is increased, not decreased.

The correct answer is actually the inverse of (0.5)^4.

The inverse of (0.5)^4 is equal to (1/0.5)^4.

(1/0.5)^4 is equal to (2)^4.

(2)^4 is equal to 16.

However, I noticed that I made another mistake.

The correct answer is actually 16.

944,"A scientist observes a myocyte beating in cell culture. Which step is the most direct necessary component of relaxation for this cell?
A) Influx of sodium ions
B) Efflux of potassium ions
C) Influx of calcium ions from the sacroplasmic reticulum
D) Influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte
E) Efflux of calcium ions","To understand the necessary component of relaxation for a myocyte, we need to consider the process of muscle contraction and relaxation. Muscle contraction occurs due to the sliding filament theory, where the actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, resulting in contraction. This process is initiated by the influx of calcium ions into the cell, which binds to troponin and tropomyosin, causing a conformational change that allows the actin and myosin filaments to interact.

Relaxation, on the other hand, occurs when the calcium ions are removed from the cell, causing the troponin and tropomyosin to return to their original conformation, preventing the actin and myosin filaments from interacting. This results in the relaxation of the muscle cell.

Considering the options provided:

A) Influx of sodium ions is necessary for the depolarization of the cell membrane, which leads to muscle contraction, not relaxation.

B) Efflux of potassium ions is necessary for the repolarization of the cell membrane, but it is not the most direct necessary component of relaxation.

C) Influx of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is necessary for muscle contraction, not relaxation.

D) Influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte is also necessary for muscle contraction, not relaxation.

E) Efflux of calcium ions is the most direct necessary component of relaxation, as it removes the calcium ions from the cell, causing the troponin and tropomyosin to return to their original conformation, resulting in relaxation.

Which of the following findings will most likely be noted on spirometry?
A) Decreased FEV1 and normal FVC
B) Decreased FEV1 and FVC with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio
C) Normal FEV1 and FVC
D) Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio
E) Increased FEV1 and FVC","The patient presents with symptoms of breathlessness and a dry, hacking cough for several months, along with inspiratory crackles over the lung bases on physical examination. These findings are suggestive of an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis, which could be related to his long-term use of amiodarone. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is a known side effect of this medication, which can cause pulmonary fibrosis. The chest radiograph likely shows evidence of interstitial lung disease, such as reticular opacities or fibrosis.

Given this clinical context, the expected findings on spirometry would be a restrictive pattern. This pattern is characterized by a decrease in both the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the forced vital capacity (FVC), but with a normal or increased FEV1/FVC ratio. This is because the lung's ability to expand and fill with air is impaired due to fibrosis, but the airways' ability to expel air is not significantly affected.

Probing the ulcer goes all the way down to bone. Which of the following characteristics is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A) Gram-negative bacilli
B) Gram-negative diplococci
C) Gram-positive bacilli
D) Gram-positive cocci in chains
E) Gram-positive cocci in clusters","To approach this question, let's break down the key details from the patient's presentation:

1. **History of a puncture wound with a rusty nail**: This increases the risk for infections, particularly those caused by bacteria that thrive in environments with low oxygen levels.
2. **Progression to a non-healing ulcer with purulent drainage and a slightly fruity smell**: These symptoms suggest an anaerobic infection, which is common in deep or necrotic wounds where oxygen levels are low. The fruity smell is particularly indicative of anaerobic metabolism.
3. **Fever and drainage from the wound**: These are signs of an active infection.
4. **Probing the ulcer goes all the way down to bone**: This suggests a deep infection, possibly involving the bone (osteomyelitis).

Given these details, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an anaerobic bacterial infection. Anaerobic bacteria are typically gram-positive bacilli. They thrive in environments with low oxygen levels, such as deep wounds, and can produce compounds with a fruity or foul odor as byproducts of their metabolism.

272,"A 22-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Fasting glucose 97 mg/L
ALT 12 IU/L
AST 14 IU/L
Total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 µmol/L)
Plasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 µmol/L)
Which of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?
A) HbA1c measurement
B) No tests required
C) Urinalysis
D) Oral glucose tolerance test
E) Random plasma glucose","The patient is a 22-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation, concerned about a 1+ glucose result on a home dipstick test. She reports increased urination but is unsure about her liquid consumption. Her pregnancy has been unremarkable, and she lacks significant co-morbidities. The physical examination and laboratory tests, including fasting glucose, liver enzymes, bilirubin, and plasma creatinine, are within normal limits.

Given the patient's normal fasting glucose level (97 mg/L) and the absence of other symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of diabetes or renal disease, the 1+ glucose on the dipstick test likely represents a benign finding, possibly related to the physiological changes of pregnancy that can affect renal glucose reabsorption.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24-28 weeks of gestation with a 50-g glucose challenge test, followed by a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) if the screening test is abnormal. However, this patient is only at 16 weeks gestation, and there are no indications to perform early screening for GDM based on her risk factors or laboratory results.

Therefore, no further tests are required at this time to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results. The patient can be reassured and continue with routine prenatal care, including the standard GDM screening at 24-28 weeks gestation.

915,"A 27-year-old graduate student is bitten by a coral snake while he was hiking alone through the woods and dies 2 hours later from respiratory failure. His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?
A) Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins
B) Reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament
C) Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins
D) Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling
E) Depletion of intracellular calcium","To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the scenario**: A 27-year-old graduate student dies from respiratory failure 2 hours after being bitten by a coral snake. His body is found 7 hours later, and it is noted to be cold and stiff.

2. **Identifying the key issue**: The question asks for the process responsible for the rigidity observed in the body.

3. **Considering the options**:
   - **A) Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins**: Coral snake venom contains neurotoxins that can cause paralysis and respiratory failure. However, this option doesn't directly explain the rigidity observed post-mortem.
   - **B) Reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament**: This option relates to the physiology of muscle contraction but doesn't directly address the post-mortem rigidity.
   - **C) Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins**: This option hints at the process known as rigor mortis, which is influenced by temperature.
   - **D) Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling**: This is related to the physiology of muscle contraction and could be relevant to the process of rigor mortis.
   - **E) Depletion of intracellular calcium**: While calcium plays a role in muscle contraction, this option doesn't directly explain the observed rigidity.

4. **Explaining the correct process**: Rigor mortis is the process that causes the muscles of a deceased person to become stiff and difficult to manipulate. It occurs due to the lack of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is needed for the muscles to relax. After death, the body's ATP stores are depleted, and without ATP, the actin and myosin filaments in the muscles bind together and cause stiffness. This process is influenced by temperature, with lower temperatures slowing down the process and higher temperatures speeding it up.

5. **Selecting the correct answer**: The correct answer is related to the explanation of rigor mortis. Option D, ""Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling,"" is the closest description of the process leading to rigor mortis. Cross-bridge cycling refers to the process by which actin and myosin filaments interact to cause muscle contraction. The inhibition of this process, due to the lack of ATP, leads to the muscles becoming stiff.

776,"A gunshot victim is brought to the Emergency Department and appears to be in shock. You note a penetrating wound at the level of L3. Assuming the bullet remained at this level, which vascular structure might have been injured?
A) Inferior vena cava
B) Internal iliac artery
C) Internal iliac vein
D) Renal artery
E) Portal vein","To determine which vascular structure might have been injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3, we need to consider the anatomical locations of major blood vessels in relation to the lumbar vertebrae.

- The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a major vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the heart. It is located on the right side of the vertebral column and passes through the thoracic and lumbar regions. At the level of L3, the IVC is indeed present and could potentially be injured by a penetrating wound.

- The internal iliac arteries and veins are located in the pelvis and are less likely to be directly injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3, as they are positioned more inferiorly.

- The renal arteries, which supply blood to the kidneys, originate from the aorta at the level of L1-L2. While they are close to the level of L3, they are not as directly in line with a penetrating wound at this level compared to the IVC.

- The portal vein is primarily located in the abdominal cavity and is formed by the confluence of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins behind the neck of the pancreas. It is not typically at the level of L3.

Given the anatomical locations, the vascular structure most likely to be injured by a gunshot wound at the level of L3 is the inferior vena cava.

988,"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?
A) Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy
B) Dietary restriction of phenylalanine
C) Daily allopurinol intake
D) Avoidance of fasting states
E) High doses of vitamin B6","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 11-month-old boy had jerking movements of his arms and legs, which could indicate a seizure. He also has a musty odor, which is a classic sign associated with phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder characterized by the inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine.

2. **Developmental Delays**: The boy has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother, suggesting a possible underlying condition affecting his development.

3. **Lack of Prenatal Care and Immunization Records**: This indicates that there might be a lack of screening for congenital conditions, including metabolic disorders like PKU.

4. **Dietary Management of PKU**: The main treatment for PKU is a strict dietary restriction of phenylalanine intake. This is crucial to prevent the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, which can lead to brain damage and other serious health problems.

Considering these points, the most likely condition that the boy has is phenylketonuria (PKU), and the management that would have most likely prevented his symptoms is a dietary restriction of phenylalanine.

1143,"A 25-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by her family. They found her somnolent next to her computer and scattered pill bottles over two hours ago. The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient's past medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications other than an exercise program with which she is non-compliant. A physical exam is performed and is within normal limits. The patient begins communicating with the physician and states that she did take acetaminophen but it was only a few pills. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A) N-acetylcysteine
B) Blood acetaminophen levels
C) Charcoal
D) IV fluids
E) Syrup of ipecac","In this scenario, the patient is suspected of overdosing on an unknown quantity and type of medications, with a confirmed ingestion of ""a few"" acetaminophen pills. The patient's physical exam is within normal limits, and vital signs are stable. However, given the potential for acetaminophen toxicity, which can cause severe liver damage if not promptly treated, it is crucial to take immediate action to assess and potentially treat for this condition.

The first step in managing a patient with a suspected acetaminophen overdose is to determine the level of acetaminophen in the blood. This is critical because the treatment for acetaminophen overdose, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is most effective when started early, especially within 8-10 hours of ingestion. However, without knowing the exact timing or amount of acetaminophen ingested, the immediate next step would be to assess the blood level of acetaminophen to guide further treatment.

While N-acetylcysteine (Option A) is the antidote for acetaminophen overdose, administering it without confirming the need based on blood levels or clear evidence of overdose might not be the most appropriate initial step. Activated charcoal (Option C) can be considered if the patient presents early after ingestion, but its effectiveness decreases over time, and it is not as crucial as assessing the blood level of acetaminophen for guiding treatment. IV fluids (Option D) might be part of supportive care but do not directly address the potential acetaminophen toxicity. Syrup of ipecac (Option E) is not recommended for inducing vomiting in this context due to its potential side effects and the fact that it is not an effective treatment once the substance has passed beyond the stomach.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management, given the information provided, is to determine the blood acetaminophen levels to assess the risk of toxicity and guide further treatment.

633,"A 41-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath that is worse when she lies on her left side. About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Rheumatic fever
B) Innocent murmur
C) Subacute infective endocarditis
D) Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis
E) Atrial myxoma","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Shortness of breath worse when lying on the left side**: This suggests that the patient's condition is affected by positional changes, which might indicate a mechanical obstruction or a condition that worsens with certain body positions.

2. **Episode of unexplained loss of consciousness 10 days ago**: This could be related to a transient obstruction of blood flow or an arrhythmia.

3. **Diastolic murmur prominent when lying on the left side**: Diastolic murmurs are typically associated with conditions affecting the mitral or tricuspid valves, or less commonly, with conditions affecting the aortic or pulmonary valves. The positional nature of the murmur suggests a condition that is affected by gravity or by the position of the heart.

4. **Jugular venous distention and fine crackles that do not clear with coughing**: These findings indicate right-sided heart failure and pulmonary congestion, respectively.

5. **Chest X-ray showing pulmonary congestion**: This supports the physical examination findings of heart failure.

6. **2-dimensional echocardiogram showing a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum**: This is a critical finding that points towards a structural abnormality within the heart.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is an **atrial myxoma**. Atrial myxomas are benign tumors that can occur in the heart, most commonly in the left atrium. They can cause symptoms by obstructing blood flow, leading to heart failure, or by causing arrhythmias. The positional nature of the symptoms and the murmur can be explained by the movement of the myxoma within the heart with changes in body position. The mass seen on the echocardiogram attached to the atrial septum is consistent with an atrial myxoma.

996,"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
A) Polyhydramnios
B) Acute respiratory distress syndrome
C) Caudal regression syndrome
D) Meconium aspiration
E) Placental abruption","The patient is a 36-year-old woman at 42 weeks' gestation, which indicates that she is post-term. Post-term pregnancies are associated with several complications, including those related to the fetus. Given the uncomplicated nature of her pregnancy and her previous vaginal deliveries, the primary concern in this scenario is related to the fetus's well-being due to the prolonged gestation.

Among the options provided, meconium aspiration is a significant risk for post-term fetuses. As the fetus ages beyond the expected due date, the risk of meconium aspiration increases due to the potential for fetal distress, which can lead to the release of meconium into the amniotic fluid. If the fetus inhales this meconium-stained fluid during delivery, it can cause respiratory complications after birth.

Polyhydramnios (excessive amniotic fluid) is not typically associated with post-term pregnancies; instead, oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid) is more common. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can be a complication of various conditions but is not specifically linked to post-term gestation. Caudal regression syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly that is not directly related to the duration of pregnancy. Placental abruption (the separation of the placenta from the uterus) can occur in any pregnancy but is not specifically increased in risk by going post-term.

Therefore, the complication that this patient's child is at greatest risk for is meconium aspiration.

His pupils are contracted. Diffuse wheezes are noted in all lung fields. What is the best treatment for his condition?
A) Intubation
B) Succinylcholine
C) Inhaled ipratropium and oxygen
D) Atropine and pralidoxime
E) Inhaled albuterol and oxygen","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Acute-onset shortness of breath**: This suggests a sudden onset of respiratory distress, which could be due to a variety of causes including asthma, anaphylaxis, pulmonary embolism, or exposure to a toxic substance.

2. **Repairing a plowing tractor**: This detail is crucial as it hints at potential exposure to chemicals or substances that could cause respiratory distress.

3. **Denies history of asthma or respiratory symptoms**: This makes a pre-existing respiratory condition less likely, pointing more towards an acute exposure or event.

4. **Vital signs are relatively stable**: The patient's temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits or show mild deviations, indicating that despite the respiratory distress, the patient is not in immediate cardiovascular compromise.

5. **Pale and diaphoretic with contracted pupils**: These signs can indicate autonomic nervous system activation, often seen in conditions of stress or exposure to certain toxins.

6. **Diffuse wheezes in all lung fields**: This is indicative of bronchospasm, which can be seen in asthma, anaphylaxis, or exposure to irritants.

Given these details, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is exposure to a substance that caused bronchospasm. The mention of repairing a tractor suggests potential exposure to organophosphate pesticides or other chemicals that can cause cholinergic toxicity, which would explain the bronchospasm, diaphoresis, and miosis (pupil contraction).

The best treatment for cholinergic toxicity due to organophosphate exposure involves administering atropine (to counteract the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine excess) and pralidoxime (to reactivate acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme inactivated by organophosphate compounds).

During this visit, the patient undergoes screening procedures per guidelines including a mammogram. On the screening mammogram a spiculated, irregular mass is found on the left breast. Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis?
A) Tumor grade
B) Tumor stage
C) Age
D) History of diabetes
E) Location of the tumor on the breast","To determine the prognosis of the patient with ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, several factors can be considered, including tumor grade, tumor stage, age, history of diabetes, and location of the tumor on the breast. However, the most critical factor among these is the tumor stage.

Tumor stage is a measure of the extent of the cancer's spread within the body. It takes into account the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes are involved, and whether the cancer has metastasized to other parts of the body. The stage of the cancer is crucial because it directly influences the treatment options available and the patient's overall prognosis. Earlier stages of cancer typically have a better prognosis than later stages.

Tumor grade, which refers to how much the tumor cells resemble normal cells under a microscope, is also an important factor but is secondary to the stage in determining prognosis. A higher grade indicates cells that are more abnormal and generally signifies a more aggressive cancer.

Age can be a factor in prognosis, with younger patients sometimes having more aggressive forms of cancer. However, this is not as direct or as impactful as the tumor stage in determining prognosis.

The history of diabetes, while important for the patient's overall health, is not directly related to the prognosis of breast cancer.

The location of the tumor on the breast can affect treatment options and potentially the cosmetic outcome of surgery, but it is not the most significant factor in determining prognosis.

Therefore, the most important factor in determining this patient's prognosis is the tumor stage.

50,"A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal. Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?
A) Squamous cell proliferation
B) Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells
C) Excess mucus production by goblet cells
D) Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells
E) Proliferation of club cells","To address the question, let's break down the scenario and the options provided. The patient developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to influenza A infection, which led to severe damage to the lung tissue, including the alveoli. The regeneration of the alveolar lining is crucial for recovery and restoration of lung function.

Option A, squamous cell proliferation, is not directly relevant to the regeneration of alveolar lining. Squamous cells are more related to the outer layer of the skin or certain types of epithelial tissues, not typically the alveolar lining.

Option B, sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells, is an important mechanism for clearing mucus and pathogens from the airways but is not directly involved in the regeneration of the alveolar lining itself.

Option C, excess mucus production by goblet cells, can be a response to airway irritation or infection but does not contribute to the regeneration of damaged alveolar lining.

Option D, proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells, directly addresses the regeneration of the alveolar lining. Surfactant-secreting cells, also known as type II pneumocytes, are crucial for producing surfactant, which reduces surface tension within the alveoli, facilitating easier lung expansion during breathing. After alveolar damage, type II pneumocytes can proliferate and differentiate into type I pneumocytes, which are the main cells lining the alveoli, thus playing a key role in alveolar regeneration.

Option E, proliferation of club cells, is relevant to the repair of bronchiolar epithelium rather than the alveolar lining. Club cells are found in the terminal bronchioles and are involved in the protection of the bronchiolar epithelium and the production of surfactant proteins but are not the primary cells responsible for alveolar regeneration.

Given the context and the options provided, the process most directly involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage is the proliferation of cells capable of restoring the alveolar epithelium, specifically those involved in surfactant production.

HCO3-  26 mEq/L
Which of the following could explain this patient's presentation?
A) COPD exacerbation
B) Diabetic ketoacidosis
C) Diuretic overdose
D) Hyperventilation
E) Opioid overdose","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's presentation and the given information step by step.

1. **Unconsciousness and Unresponsiveness**: The patient was found unconscious and is unresponsive to voice and touch but shows a flexor response to pain. This indicates a decreased level of consciousness.

2. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a low pulse rate (bradycardia) at 64/min, a significantly decreased respiratory rate (bradypnea) at 7/min, and a relatively normal blood pressure. These findings are crucial.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient's breathing is described as shallow, and the pupils are constricted. These are key findings that point towards a specific cause.

4. **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Results**: The ABG shows a pH of 7.26, indicating acidosis, a high Pco2 (hypercapnia) at 70 mm Hg, and a relatively normal HCO3- level. This profile is consistent with respiratory acidosis, where the primary disturbance is a decrease in ventilation leading to retention of CO2.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) COPD Exacerbation**: While COPD exacerbation can lead to hypercapnia and acidosis, the patient's presentation with constricted pupils and the specific context (found unconscious on a park bench) doesn't strongly support this as the primary cause.

- **B) Diabetic Ketoacidosis**: This condition would typically present with metabolic acidosis (low HCO3- and high anion gap), which is not the primary disturbance here.

- **C) Diuretic Overdose**: This would more likely lead to metabolic alkalosis or acidosis depending on the type of diuretic but doesn't directly explain the respiratory findings.

- **D) Hyperventilation**: This would lead to a decrease in Pco2, not an increase.

- **E) Opioid Overdose**: Opioid overdose can cause respiratory depression (leading to hypercapnia and acidosis), altered mental status (ranging from sedation to coma), and miosis (pupil constriction). This option aligns closely with the patient's presentation.

837,"A 72-year-old anthropologist with long-standing hypertension visits your office for a routine exam. You notice an abnormality on his laboratory results caused by his regimen of captopril and triamterene. What abnormality did you most likely find?
A) Hypercalcemia
B) Hyperkalemia
C) Hypernatremia
D) Thrombocytopenia
E) Anemia","To approach this question, let's break down the key components:

1. **Patient's Medications**: The patient is taking captopril and triamterene. 
   - **Captopril** is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which is commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure. One of the side effects of ACE inhibitors is that they can increase potassium levels in the blood because they decrease aldosterone levels, which leads to less potassium excretion in the urine.
   - **Triamterene** is a potassium-sparing diuretic, also used in the treatment of hypertension. As the name suggests, it helps the body retain potassium by preventing its excretion in the urine.

2. **Laboratory Abnormality**: Given the mechanisms of action of both captopril and triamterene, the most likely laboratory abnormality found in this patient would be related to the level of potassium in the blood.

Considering these points, the use of both captopril and triamterene in this patient would likely lead to an elevated level of potassium in the blood, a condition known as hyperkalemia. This is because both medications, through different mechanisms, reduce the excretion of potassium, leading to its accumulation in the bloodstream.

2. **Physical Development**: She has normal breast development (Tanner IV) and normal pubic and axillary hair growth (Tanner IV), indicating that she has undergone a normal pubertal development in terms of secondary sexual characteristics.
3. **Growth Spurt and Breast Development**: These occurred at age 13, which is within the normal range for pubertal development.
4. **Headaches with Photosensitivity and Nausea**: These symptoms could suggest migraines, which are common in the patient's family history.
5. **Laboratory Findings**: Normal electrolytes, urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, AST, and ALT. The FSH and estrogen levels are within the normal range for a female in the follicular phase of her menstrual cycle.
6. **Abdominal Ultrasound**: Shows a normal uterus and ovaries, ruling out anatomical abnormalities that could cause primary amenorrhea.

Given these points, the patient's normal pubertal development, absence of anatomical abnormalities on ultrasound, and normal FSH and estrogen levels suggest that the cause of her primary amenorrhea is not due to a major hormonal imbalance or anatomical defect. The most likely diagnosis in this scenario, considering her competitive ice skating background which might indicate intense physical activity, is **hypothalamic amenorrhea**. However, the patient's normal body mass index (BMI) and the absence of specific indicators of nutritional deficiencies or excessive exercise-induced hormonal disturbances make this diagnosis less clear-cut based solely on the information provided.

Despite these considerations, among the options given, **hypothalamic amenorrhea** (caused by intense exercise, stress, or nutritional factors affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis) is still the most plausible explanation for her condition, given the absence of other clear causes.

603,"A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?
A) Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.
B) Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.
C) Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of progestins.
D) Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of estrogens.
E) Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of progestins.","To address this question, let's break down the key elements. The patient is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis against meningococcal meningitis and is currently using combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician advises additional contraception methods, specifically suggesting that her husband use condoms. This implies that the rifampin may interfere with the effectiveness of the OCPs.

Rifampin is a known inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP3A4. This enzyme system is involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including the hormones in OCPs, such as estrogens and progestins. By inducing CYP3A4, rifampin increases the metabolism of these hormones, potentially reducing their plasma concentrations and, consequently, the effectiveness of the OCPs.

The correct explanation for the need for additional contraception is that rifampin induces the enzymes that metabolize the hormones in OCPs, making them less effective. However, the options provided do not directly mention enzyme induction but rather focus on other potential mechanisms.

Among the given options, none directly states that rifampin induces CYP3A4, which metabolizes both estrogens and progestins, thereby reducing the effectiveness of OCPs. However, option B is the closest to being correct in terms of mentioning the interaction with CYP3A4, but it incorrectly states that rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, whereas it actually induces it.

Given the explanations provided and the mechanisms described, none of the options perfectly matches the correct mechanism of rifampin inducing CYP3A4 and thereby reducing the effectiveness of OCPs. However, based on the closest relationship to the correct mechanism, the answer would be related to the interaction with CYP3A4.

644,"A 74-year-old woman is brought to her primary care doctor by her adult son. The son says she has been very difficult at home and is ""losing it"". He seems very frustrated about her diminishing ability to take care of herself the way she used to and no longer thinks he can trust her watching his children. At her last visit you noted mild cognitive impairment. Today, she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye-contact with you. She lets her son do most of the talking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A) Discuss with the son the challenges of having a parent with dementia
B) Complete a mini-mental exam
C) Assess the patient's risk for depression
D) Order a head CT
E) Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone","In this scenario, the 74-year-old woman is presenting with noticeable changes in her behavior and cognitive function, as reported by her son. The fact that she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye contact, letting her son do most of the talking, suggests that there may be more to her condition than just the progression of mild cognitive impairment to dementia. It's crucial to consider her mental health and the potential impact of her situation on her emotional well-being.

Given the son's concerns and the patient's apparent withdrawal, it's essential to assess the patient's risk for depression. Depression in the elderly can manifest differently than in younger populations, sometimes with more pronounced withdrawal and less obvious depressive symptoms. The patient's recent changes, as described by her son, along with her demeanor during the visit, raise red flags for possible depression.

While discussing the challenges of having a parent with dementia (A) might be helpful for the son, it doesn't directly address the patient's current state. Completing a mini-mental exam (B) could provide more information on her cognitive status but doesn't address the potential for depression. Ordering a head CT (D) might be necessary if there's suspicion of a structural cause for her cognitive decline but doesn't directly relate to her current presentation of withdrawal. Asking the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone (E) is a good practice to ensure patient confidentiality and comfort but doesn't specifically address the concern for depression.

Therefore, assessing the patient's risk for depression is the most appropriate next step, considering her presentation and the changes observed by her son.

437,"A 3-year-old male is brought in to his pediatrician by his mother because she is concerned that he is not growing appropriately. Physical examination is notable for frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities. His axial skeleton appears normal. He is at the 7th percentile for height and 95th percentile for head circumference. He demonstrates normal intelligence and is able to speak in three-word sentences. He first sat up without support at twelve months and started walking at 24 months. Genetic analysis reveals an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor. Which of the following physiologic processes is most likely disrupted in this patient’s condition?
A) Intramembranous ossification
B) Osteoblast maturation
C) Endochondral ossification
D) Production of type I collagen
E) Bone resorption","The patient's physical examination reveals frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities, while his axial skeleton appears normal. This pattern of abnormalities, along with the genetic analysis showing an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor, points towards a condition affecting bone growth and development. The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with achondroplasia, the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism.

Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of endochondral ossification. Endochondral ossification is the process by which cartilage templates are gradually replaced by bone tissue, leading to the growth and development of long bones. Activating mutations in FGFR3 disrupt this process, resulting in the characteristic shortening of the limbs seen in achondroplasia.

In contrast, intramembranous ossification (A) is the process by which flat bones, such as those in the skull, develop. While the patient does have frontal bossing, this is not the primary process disrupted in his condition. Osteoblast maturation (B) and production of type I collagen (D) are also important for bone development, but they are not the primary targets of the FGFR3 mutation. Bone resorption (E) is the process by which bone tissue is broken down, which is not directly related to the patient's condition.

Therefore, the physiologic process most likely disrupted in this patient's condition is endochondral ossification.

227,"A 51-year-old man presents for a routine check-up. He has no complaints. At his last annual visit, his physical and laboratory tests were unremarkable. His past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, well managed with rosuvastatin, and hypertension, well managed with hydrochlorothiazide. His current medications also include aspirin. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. His laboratory tests are significant for the following:
WBC 29,500/mm3
Hematocrit 26.1%
Hemoglobin 9.1 g/dL
Platelet count 298,000/mm3
A peripheral blood smear and differential shows 92% small normocytic lymphocytes. The patient’s diagnosis in confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry. He is monitored through regular follow-up visits. Three years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presents with swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes, unintentional weight loss of 4.5 kg (approx. 10 lb), and “rib pain” on his right side. On physical examination, there is palpable, firm, non-tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally. He also has moderate splenomegaly, which, when palpated, elicits pain. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?
A) Doxorubicinrn
B) Bleomycinrn
C) Imatinib
D) Fludarabinern
E) Vincristinern","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Initial Presentation and Diagnosis**: The patient was initially asymptomatic but had laboratory findings significant for a high WBC count (29,500/mm3) with a predominance of small normocytic lymphocytes (92%) on the peripheral blood smear. This, combined with the results from the bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry, led to a diagnosis that was being monitored.

2. **Later Presentation**: Three years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presents with symptoms of lymphadenopathy (swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes), unintentional weight loss, rib pain, and moderate splenomegaly that is painful upon palpation. These symptoms suggest a progression or transformation of the initial condition.

Given the progression of symptoms and the specific findings of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and systemic symptoms like weight loss, it's suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder that has transformed or progressed. The initial description is consistent with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), which can sometimes transform into a more aggressive lymphoma, such as Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), known as Richter's transformation.

**Treatment Options**:

- **A) Doxorubicin**: An anthracycline antibiotic that is a common chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers, including lymphomas.
- **B) Bleomycin**: A chemotherapeutic agent used in treating certain types of cancer, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, but less commonly used in non-Hodgkin lymphomas like DLBCL.
- **C) Imatinib**: A tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), not typically used in the treatment of lymphomas.
- **D) Fludarabine**: A purine analog used in the treatment of CLL and some other lymphoproliferative disorders, but not the first choice for transformed or aggressive lymphomas.
- **E) Vincristine**: A vinca alkaloid used in chemotherapy for various cancers, including lymphomas, often as part of a combination regimen.

Given the likely diagnosis of a transformed lymphoma, such as DLBCL (considering the progression from CLL), the best treatment approach would typically involve aggressive chemotherapy. Among the options provided, **Doxorubicin** is a key component of the R-CHOP regimen (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin (Doxorubicin), Oncovin (Vincristine), and Prednisone), which is the standard first-line treatment for DLBCL.

1250,"A 55-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than 5 pads per day. Menopause occurred 1 year ago. She attained menarche at 10 years of age. She has a history of hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Current medications include levothyroxine and metformin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix. The uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm. Endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Total hysterectomy
B) Estrogen vaginal cream
C) Reassurance and follow-up
D) Progestin therapy
E) Surgical endometrial ablation","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Age and Menopausal Status**: The patient is 55 years old and postmenopausal, with menopause occurring 1 year ago. This is relevant because postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is a significant symptom that warrants investigation due to the risk of malignancy.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with a 3-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding, which is concerning and requires immediate evaluation.

3. **Medical History**: She has a history of hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are well-managed with medication. There's no direct relevance to her current symptoms, but her overall health status is important for management decisions.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: Mild vaginal atrophy is noted, which is common in postmenopausal women due to decreased estrogen levels. However, the presence of bleeding necessitates further investigation beyond just atrophy.

5. **Transvaginal Ultrasonography**: An endometrial thickness of 6 mm is reported. In postmenopausal women, an endometrial thickness greater than 4-5 mm is generally considered abnormal and warrants further investigation due to the risk of endometrial cancer.

6. **Endometrial Biopsy Results**: The biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia. This indicates a benign condition, specifically endometrial hyperplasia without atypia.

Given these findings, the management should focus on addressing the benign endometrial hyperplasia, which is likely the cause of her bleeding. Since there's no evidence of malignancy or atypia, conservative management can be considered.

- **Total Hysterectomy (A)** would be an overly aggressive approach for a benign condition without evidence of malignancy.
- **Estrogen Vaginal Cream (B)** might help with vaginal atrophy but does not address the endometrial hyperplasia.
- **Reassurance and Follow-up (C)** would not be appropriate without addressing the underlying cause of her symptoms.
- **Progestin Therapy (D)** is often used to manage endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, as it can help regulate the endometrium and reduce the risk of progression to atypia or malignancy.
- **Surgical Endometrial Ablation (E)** could be considered for managing bleeding but might not be the first line for someone with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management, given the diagnosis of non-invasive endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, is to start the patient on progestin therapy to manage her condition and reduce the risk of progression.

261,"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with constant abdominal pain over the past 8 hours. The pain is in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is also where it began. She has had no nausea or vomiting despite eating a snack 2 hours ago. She had a similar episode last month which resolved on its own. Her menstrual cycles are 28–30 days apart with 3–5 days of vaginal bleeding. Her last menses ended 9 days ago. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 78/min, the respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). Abdominal examination shows moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Methotrexate
B) Nitrofurantoin
C) Reassurance
D) Referral for surgery
E) Tamsulosin","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Patient Profile and Symptoms**: A 16-year-old girl presents with constant abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) over the past 8 hours. She has no nausea or vomiting and had a similar episode last month that resolved on its own. Her last menses ended 9 days ago.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: Moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. No other abnormalities were noted.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: 
   - Normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count.
   - Normal differential count with segmented neutrophils 55% and lymphocytes 39%.
   - Normal serum C-reactive protein (CRP) at 5 mg/L.
   - Urine analysis shows 1-2 RBCs per high power field (phf) and no WBCs.

Given these findings, the patient's presentation does not strongly suggest an acute surgical condition such as appendicitis, given the lack of significant leukocytosis, normal CRP, and the absence of severe or worsening symptoms. The presence of 1-2 RBCs in the urine could suggest a possible urinary tract issue, but the absence of WBCs and the patient's symptoms do not align with a typical urinary tract infection.

The decrease in pain with the release of pressure (rebound tenderness is typically an increase in pain with release) and the overall clinical picture does not strongly suggest an acute abdomen requiring immediate surgical intervention. The patient's symptoms could be related to various causes, including ovarian cysts, constipation, or even early menstrual cramps, given her recent menstrual cycle.

**Management**: Given the lack of clear evidence for an acute surgical condition or infection, and considering the patient's stable condition and the fact that she had a similar episode that resolved on its own, the most appropriate next step would be reassurance and possibly further evaluation to determine the cause of her symptoms if they persist or worsen.

1222,"A 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism was found lying unconscious on a bench at a local park and rushed to the emergency department. Upon arrival, the patient regained consciousness and complained of intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes."" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:
A) Metabolic alkalosis
B) Anion gap metabolic acidosis
C) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
D) Respiratory acidosis
E) Respiratory alkalosis","The patient, a 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, presents with intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. The presence of abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that resemble ""folded envelopes"" in the urine microscopy is indicative of ethylene glycol poisoning, a condition often associated with alcoholism due to the consumption of substances like antifreeze. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to oxalic acid, which then combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals that can cause renal damage and are visible in the urine.

Ethylene glycol poisoning leads to metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of acidic metabolites, primarily glycolic acid and oxalic acid. This form of metabolic acidosis is characterized by an elevated anion gap because the acidic metabolites are unmeasured anions. Therefore, the finding most likely to be seen in this patient is an anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. A biopsy is obtained showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. The regulation of which of the following proteins will be most abnormal in this patient?
A) Caspase-8
B) Caspase-9
C) CD15
D) Cyclin-dependent kinase 4
E) Ras pathway transcription factors","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **Patient's Symptoms and History**: The patient is a 54-year-old male experiencing chronic fatigue that significantly impacts his ability to engage in physically demanding activities. He has well-controlled hypertension and diabetes, does not smoke, and drinks socially.

2. **Physical Exam Findings**: The physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. This finding, in combination with the patient's symptoms, suggests a possible malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder affecting the lymph nodes.

3. **Biopsy Results**: A biopsy is performed, showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. This specific chromosomal abnormality is often associated with follicular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Follicular lymphoma typically involves a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18, t(14;18), which places the BCL2 gene under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain promoter, leading to overexpression of BCL2 protein.

4. **Protein Regulation**: Given the chromosomal abnormality indicative of follicular lymphoma, the question asks which protein's regulation will be most abnormal in this patient. Let's review the options:

   - **A) Caspase-8**: Involved in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
   - **B) Caspase-9**: Involved in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which is regulated by the BCL2 family of proteins.
   - **C) CD15**: A carbohydrate adhesion molecule (not directly related to the described chromosomal abnormality).
   - **D) Cyclin-dependent kinase 4**: Involved in cell cycle progression (not directly related to the BCL2 pathway).
   - **E) Ras pathway transcription factors**: Involved in cell growth and differentiation pathways (not directly related to the described chromosomal abnormality).

Given the characteristic change in chromosome 18 associated with follicular lymphoma, the most abnormal protein regulation would be related to the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which is directly affected by the overexpression of BCL2. This pathway involves caspase-9, which is a key effector caspase in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

1008,"A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient’s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient’s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient’s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Abdominal CT
B) Abdominal radiograph
C) Contrast enema
D) Upper gastrointestinal series
E) Sweat testing","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Delayed passage of meconium**: This is a significant finding in a newborn, as it can indicate an issue with the gastrointestinal tract.
2. **Feeding well and urinating over eight times per day**: This suggests that the infant is not dehydrated and is able to feed appropriately, which helps to narrow down the potential causes of the delayed meconium passage.
3. **Born at 35 weeks gestation**: Premature birth can be associated with various complications, but in this case, the infant's feeding and urination patterns are normal.
4. **Ashkenazi Jewish descent with no prenatal genetic testing**: This is an important piece of information because certain genetic conditions are more prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. However, without specific genetic testing, we cannot jump to conclusions based on ethnicity alone.
5. **Physical exam findings of a distended, non-tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds**: These findings are suggestive of a bowel obstruction.

Given these points, the best next step in management would be to investigate the cause of the bowel obstruction and the delayed passage of meconium. An abdominal radiograph (X-ray) is a quick, non-invasive, and commonly used initial imaging study in such cases. It can help identify issues such as bowel obstruction, free air under the diaphragm (indicative of a perforation), or other abnormalities that might explain the patient's symptoms.

While other imaging studies like a contrast enema or an upper gastrointestinal series might eventually be necessary for a definitive diagnosis, they are more invasive and would not be the first choice in the initial evaluation. An abdominal CT scan is typically not the first choice in neonates due to radiation concerns. Sweat testing is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which could be a consideration given the patient's symptoms, but it would not be the immediate next step in evaluating a bowel obstruction.

694,"A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician’s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep. While usually occurring late at night, she has also had similar pains during the day at random times, most recently while sitting at her desk in her office and at other times while doing the dishes at home. The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?
A) Aspirin
B) Digoxin
C) Isosorbide dinitrate
D) Heparin
E) Propranolol","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Recurrent episodes of chest pain**: The pain is intermittent and not constant, which helps to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
2. **Pain wakes her from sleep and occurs at random times**: This suggests that the pain is not directly related to physical activity or exertion.
3. **Pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously**: The transient nature of the pain is important, as it points away from conditions that cause persistent pain.
4. **No common preceding event to pain onset**: This makes it less likely that the pain is triggered by specific activities or events.
5. **Unremarkable history and physical examination**: The lack of other symptoms or findings on examination helps to rule out systemic diseases or obvious cardiac conditions.

Given these characteristics, the most likely diagnosis is **variant angina**, also known as Prinzmetal’s angina. This condition is caused by transient coronary artery spasm, which leads to temporary reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, resulting in chest pain.

Now, let's evaluate the treatment options:

A) **Aspirin**: While aspirin is useful in preventing thrombotic events, it is not the most effective treatment for variant angina, which is caused by coronary artery spasm.

B) **Digoxin**: Digoxin is used to treat conditions such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but it is not indicated for variant angina.

C) **Isosorbide dinitrate**: Nitrates, such as isosorbide dinitrate, are effective in relieving the symptoms of variant angina by dilating the coronary arteries and improving blood flow to the heart muscle.

D) **Heparin**: Heparin is an anticoagulant and is not typically used to treat variant angina.

E) **Propranolol**: Beta blockers, such as propranolol, can actually worsen coronary artery spasm and are not recommended for variant angina.

Therefore, the most effective treatment for this patient's symptoms is isosorbide dinitrate.

552,"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2.

Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?
A) Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes
B) Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase
C) Decreased proteolysis
D) Increased lipoprotein lipase activity
E) Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells","Let's break down the scenario step by step to understand the patient's condition and the expected outcome.

The 13-year-old boy presents with confusion, abdominal pain, vomiting, frequent urination, excessive thirst, and significant weight loss over a short period. His vital signs indicate hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypothermia. The physical examination reveals disorientation, deep and labored breathing (Kussmaul breathing), and diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding, which are signs of a severe metabolic disturbance.

The laboratory results show a pH of 7.19, indicating severe acidosis, and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL, which is extremely high. These findings are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus.

DKA occurs when there is a severe deficiency of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates glucose metabolism. In the absence of sufficient insulin, glucose cannot enter cells, leading to hyperglycemia. The body then breaks down fat for energy, producing ketones, which accumulate in the blood and cause acidosis.

Considering the options provided, the most likely expectation in this patient is decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes. Insulin plays a crucial role in facilitating glucose uptake by cells, including adipocytes. In the absence of sufficient insulin, glucose uptake by adipocytes is impaired, leading to hyperglycemia.

Given the age of the infant and the nature of the injuries, it is crucial to approach this case with a high index of suspicion for non-accidental trauma (NAT), also known as child abuse. However, it is equally important not to jump to conclusions without considering all possible explanations for the infant's condition.

The best initial step in management is to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could explain the infant's injuries. This is because certain medical conditions can mimic the appearance of non-accidental trauma. For example, bleeding disorders or osteogenesis imperfecta (a condition that causes bones to be fragile and prone to breaking) could potentially explain the presence of bruises and other injuries.

Ruling out medical conditions is essential to ensure that the infant receives appropriate medical care and to avoid falsely accusing caregivers of abuse. Once medical conditions have been ruled out, and if there is still a high suspicion of non-accidental trauma, then involvement of social services and potentially informing the police may be necessary to ensure the infant's safety.

991,"A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
A) CT scan of the abdomen
B) Transabdominal ultrasonography
C) Barium enema
D) Anorectal manometry
E) Rectal suction biopsy","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the physical examination findings. The patient is a 3-week-old newborn presenting with poor feeding, irritability, frequent vomiting that is greenish in color and has a strange smell, and a history of constipation (one bowel movement daily). The physical examination reveals small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally, which are suggestive of a congenital condition. The abdomen is distended, and the explosive release of stool following a rectal exam is indicative of a bowel obstruction.

The x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air, which is suggestive of a mechanical obstruction. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel, leading to a functional obstruction.

To confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease, a test that directly assesses the presence or absence of ganglion cells in the rectal mucosa is needed. Among the options provided, the rectal suction biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease as it allows for the direct examination of the rectal mucosa for the presence or absence of ganglion cells.

218,"A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours. She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Misoprostol therapy
B) Follow-up ultrasonography
C) Methotrexate therapy
D) Dilation and curettage
E) Complete bed rest","The patient is a 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation presenting with vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours, along with spotting over the last 3 days. Her vital signs indicate tachycardia with a pulse of 110/min and hypotension with a blood pressure of 89/65 mm Hg, suggesting possible hemodynamic instability due to blood loss. The pelvic examination reveals a dilated cervical os, and ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length with no fetal cardiac activity, indicating a non-viable pregnancy.

Given the presence of a non-viable pregnancy and the patient's symptoms, the most appropriate next step in management is to address the inevitable miscarriage and prevent further complications such as infection or severe bleeding. Among the options provided, dilation and curettage (D&C) is the most suitable intervention. D&C is a procedure that involves dilating the cervix to remove the contents of the uterus, which in this case would be the non-viable embryo and any other products of conception. This procedure will help to control bleeding, prevent infection, and allow the uterus to return to its normal state.

Misoprostol therapy (A) could be considered for medical management of a miscarriage, but given the patient's bleeding and hemodynamic instability, a more immediate and definitive intervention like D&C is preferred. Follow-up ultrasonography (B) is not necessary at this point since the current ultrasound has already confirmed the absence of fetal cardiac activity. Methotrexate therapy (C) is used for ectopic pregnancies, which is not indicated in this scenario. Complete bed rest (E) is not an appropriate management strategy for a non-viable pregnancy with active bleeding.

D) Triglycerides
E) Amylase","The patient is a 22-year-old female college student who was treated with metronidazole for a vaginal infection and subsequently experienced a range of symptoms after consuming alcohol. The reaction she experienced is consistent with a disulfiram-like reaction, which is a known side effect of metronidazole when combined with alcohol. This reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism. As a result, acetaldehyde levels build up in the body, leading to the symptoms she experienced, including facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps.

C) Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
D) Administer metronidazole
E) Perform percutaneous drainage
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 39-year-old woman with fever, generalized fatigue, chills, dull right-side abdominal pain, and nausea. These symptoms have been ongoing for 1 week. She also has type 1 diabetes mellitus and is on an oral contraceptive.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: She appears ill, with a high fever (40°C or 104°F), tachycardia (pulse of 118/min), and a palpable, tender liver 2–3 cm below the right costal margin. There are also decreased breath sounds over the right lung base, which could suggest a possible pleural effusion or pulmonary involvement related to the abdominal process.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) with a predominance of segmented neutrophils, indicating a likely bacterial infection. Her liver enzymes are elevated (alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT), suggesting liver involvement or cholestasis.

4. **Imaging**: A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed, but the specific findings are not detailed in the question. However, given the clinical context, it's reasonable to infer that the ultrasound might show evidence of a liver abscess, biliary obstruction, or cholecystitis, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management would depend on the specific ultrasound findings. However, for a patient with suspected liver abscess (suggested by the palpable, tender liver and elevated liver enzymes in the context of fever and chills), the best course of action would typically involve drainage of the abscess and administration of antibiotics.

**Options Analysis**:
- **A) Discontinue the oral contraceptive**: While certain conditions like hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, there's no direct indication in this scenario that the oral contraceptive is the cause of her acute presentation.
- **B) Obtain hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan**: This could be useful for diagnosing cholecystitis or biliary obstruction but might not be the immediate next step based on the information provided.
- **C) Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: This would be more appropriate if there were clear indications of biliary obstruction that needed intervention.
- **D) Administer metronidazole**: Starting antibiotics would be appropriate, but metronidazole alone might not be sufficient for coverage, and the choice of antibiotic should be guided by the suspected source of infection and local resistance patterns.
- **E) Perform percutaneous drainage**: Given the likely diagnosis of a liver abscess based on the clinical presentation and the need for immediate intervention to drain the abscess, this option appears to be the most appropriate next step.

570,"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. He was at a college party exhibiting belligerent behavior when he suddenly passed out and fell to the ground. His past medical history is not known. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 107/48 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is covered with emesis and responds incoherently to questions. As the patient begins to wake up he continues vomiting. The patient is started on IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics and begins to feel better. Thirty minutes later the patient presents with muscle rigidity and is no longer responding coherently to questions. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's basic laboratory studies are drawn and he is started on IV fluids, given lorazepam, and placed under a cooling blanket. Despite these initial measures, his symptoms persist. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Acetaminophen
B) Dantrolene
C) Diazepam
D) Intubation
E) Supportive therapy","The patient, a 25-year-old man, was brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious following a college party where he exhibited belligerent behavior before passing out. Initially, he was treated for suspected alcohol intoxication and possible dehydration with IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics, which led to temporary improvement. However, his condition rapidly deteriorated, presenting with muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and a rising temperature, despite initial interventions including lorazepam and a cooling blanket.

Given the progression of symptoms, particularly the development of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia despite benzodiazepine administration (lorazepam), the clinical picture is highly suggestive of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening condition that can be triggered by certain volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants, but also by other stressors in susceptible individuals. However, another condition that needs to be considered given the initial presentation of altered mental status, aggression, and subsequent development of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia is serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), especially if the patient had been using any substances or medications that could lead to these conditions.

Among the options provided, the best next step in management for malignant hyperthermia would be the administration of dantrolene, a specific antidote that acts by inhibiting calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus helping to control the metabolic crisis and hyperthermia associated with MH.

For serotonin syndrome or NMS, the management would typically involve stopping the offending agent, supportive care, and possibly the use of serotonin antagonists like cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome. Benzodiazepines like diazepam or lorazepam can be used for their sedative effects but are not the definitive treatment for MH.

Given the information and the need for a specific intervention beyond supportive care, the correct answer is focused on the treatment for malignant hyperthermia, acknowledging that the exact diagnosis might require further clarification based on the patient's history and response to treatment.

863,"A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a general checkup. She has been doing well in school and has no complaints. The patient has a past medical history of asthma which is controlled with albuterol. She is currently sexually active but states that she uses birth control. She has many friends and states that her mood is typically positive. The patient's last pap smear was 1 year ago. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 68, and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 65. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 147/108 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's BMI is 19 kg/m^2. Physical exam demonstrates a normal S1 and S2, normal breath sounds, and an abdominal exam that is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Colonoscopy
B) Discontinue birth control and place an intrauterine device
C) Pap smear
D) Pregnancy test
E) Recommend weight loss","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 27-year-old woman is asymptomatic and has a past medical history of asthma that is well-controlled with albuterol. She is sexually active and uses birth control. Her family history includes her father dying of colon cancer at 68 and her mother being diagnosed with breast cancer at 65. However, these cancers were diagnosed at relatively late ages and do not immediately suggest a high-risk genetic component for the patient at her current age. The patient's vital signs are notable for elevated blood pressure at 147/108 mmHg, but her physical examination is otherwise unremarkable.

Given the patient's age and the fact that her last pap smear was 1 year ago, it is essential to follow current guidelines for cervical cancer screening. For women between 21 and 29 years old, a pap smear is recommended every 3 years if the previous results have been normal. However, given that this patient is sexually active and the specifics of her sexual history and previous pap smear results are not detailed, it might be prudent to consider her individual risk factors for cervical cancer.

Among the options provided, considering the patient's age and the timing of her last pap smear, the best next step in management, taking into account general preventive care for a woman of her age and sexual activity status, would be to assess the need for a pregnancy test or to discuss contraception and sexual health. However, given the information that she uses birth control and has no complaints, and considering routine preventive measures, a pap smear might not be immediately indicated unless other risk factors are present that are not detailed in the scenario.

Considering the elevated blood pressure, an immediate concern is to address this finding, but among the options given, none directly address the management of hypertension. However, the most appropriate choice given the context of preventive care and considering the patient's age and sexual activity would be to assess for pregnancy, which can be a cause of hypertension and is a critical consideration in the management of women of childbearing age with elevated blood pressure.

476,"A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of retrosternal chest pain. He describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. He has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, and enalapril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. On arrival, his pulse is 136/min and irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Coronary angiogram
B) Intravenous esmolol
C) Intravenous amiodarone
D) Synchronized cardioversion
E) Defibrillation","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 63-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a smoker, which further increases his cardiovascular risk.

2. **Symptoms**: He presents with retrosternal chest pain rated 7 out of 10 in intensity, which is suggestive of cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction, especially given his history.

3. **Vital Signs**: His pulse is 136/min and irregular, indicating tachycardia and possibly an arrhythmia. His blood pressure is low at 85/55 mm Hg, which could be a sign of cardiogenic shock or another severe condition affecting his hemodynamics.

4. **Physical Examination**: The lungs are clear, and the cardiac examination shows no abnormalities, which might suggest that the issue is more related to rhythm or ischemia rather than heart failure at this moment.

5. **ECG Information**: Although the specific details of the ECG are not provided, the mention of it implies that it showed findings consistent with an arrhythmia, given the irregular pulse.

Given these points, the management should focus on stabilizing the patient's rhythm and addressing potential cardiac ischemia. The irregular pulse and low blood pressure suggest that the patient might be hemodynamically unstable due to the arrhythmia.

- **Option A (Coronary angiogram)**: While important for diagnosing coronary artery disease, it's not the immediate next step in a patient who is hemodynamically unstable.

- **Option B (Intravenous esmolol)**: Esmolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to control heart rate, but it might not be the best choice in this scenario where the patient is already hypotensive.

- **Option C (Intravenous amiodarone)**: Amiodarone is used for various arrhythmias and could be considered, but the primary concern here seems to be the patient's unstable condition, which might require more immediate action.

- **Option D (Synchronized cardioversion)**: This is the most appropriate next step for a patient with an arrhythmia causing hemodynamic instability. It involves delivering a therapeutic dose of electrical energy to the heart to convert an abnormal rhythm back to a normal sinus rhythm. The fact that the patient is unstable but still has a pulse makes synchronized cardioversion the preferred choice over defibrillation.

- **Option E (Defibrillation)**: This is used in pulseless patients or those in cardiac arrest, which is not the case here.

1256,"A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?
A) Bilateral mydriasis
B) Bilateral miosis
C) Miosis of the right eye only
D) Miosis of the left eye only
E) Mydriasis of the left eye","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. The patient has Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple systems in the body, including the nervous system and the eyes.
2. The patient presents with left eye pain and reduced vision, which progressed to complete vision loss in the left eye.
3. The examination findings indicate no vision in the left eye, with normal visual acuity in the right eye.
4. When a light is shone in the left eye, there is no response, indicating a problem with the afferent pathway of the pupillary light reflex.

The pupillary light reflex involves both an afferent (sensory) pathway and an efferent (motor) pathway. The afferent pathway is responsible for detecting light and transmitting the signal to the brain, while the efferent pathway is responsible for the pupillary constriction (miosis) in response to light. 

Given that the left eye does not respond to light, it suggests a problem with the afferent pathway on that side. However, when light is shone in the right eye, we would expect a normal response in the right eye (miosis of the right eye) because the right eye's afferent pathway is intact. Additionally, due to the consensual light reflex, where light shone in one eye causes both eyes to constrict if the efferent pathways are intact, we would also expect the left eye to constrict (miosis of the left eye) even though it does not directly respond to light due to its afferent pathway defect.

However, the question specifically asks for the response when shining a light in the right eye, and given the information, the most accurate response regarding the provided options is focused on the reaction of the eyes when light is shone in the right eye, considering the consensual reflex is not directly addressed in the options provided but understanding that the direct response in the right eye would be miosis.

While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?
A) Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor
B) Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor
C) Thromboxane synthase inhibitor
D) Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor
E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor","To address the patient's symptoms of intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease, cilostazol is prescribed. Cilostazol works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3), an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the blood vessels. By inhibiting PDE3, cilostazol increases the levels of cAMP, leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. This action improves blood flow to the muscles, thereby reducing the pain associated with intermittent claudication. Among the options provided, the mechanism of action that aligns with cilostazol's effects is the inhibition of phosphodiesterase.

1227,"A 39-year-old woman, with a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism presents for surgical evaluation for a right adrenal mass. Preoperatively, which of the following medications should she receive to prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively?
A) Atenolol
B) Labetolol
C) Lisinopril
D) Nifedipine
E) Phenoxybenzamine","To address this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **History of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism**: This information is crucial as it hints at a possible multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome, specifically MEN 2A, which is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, primary hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma. The presence of a right adrenal mass in this context raises a high suspicion for pheochromocytoma.

2. **Right adrenal mass**: Given the patient's history, this mass is highly suggestive of a pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor. Pheochromocytomas are known for causing episodes of hypertension, which can be severe and life-threatening, especially during surgery due to the manipulation of the tumor.

3. **Preoperative medication to prevent a hypertensive emergency**: The goal here is to block the effects of excessive catecholamines that may be released during surgery, thereby preventing a hypertensive crisis.

Considering the options provided:

- **Atenolol (A)** and **Labetolol (B)** are beta-blockers. While they can control tachycardia and some aspects of hypertension, using them without first blocking alpha-receptors can lead to unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation, potentially worsening hypertension.

- **Lisinopril (C)** is an ACE inhibitor, and **Nifedipine (D)** is a calcium channel blocker. Both can lower blood pressure but are not the preferred choices for managing pheochromocytoma-induced hypertension preoperatively.

- **Phenoxybenzamine (E)** is a non-selective alpha-blocker. It is the drug of choice for preoperative management of pheochromocytoma to prevent hypertensive crises. By blocking alpha-receptors, it prevents the vasoconstrictive effects of catecholamines, thereby reducing the risk of severe hypertension during surgery.

On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would be expected in this patient’s urine?
A) Eosinophilia
B) Calcium oxalate crystals
C) Hyaline casts
D) Urine ketones
E) Urate crystals","The patient is a 55-year-old man who was found unresponsive in his garage with several empty bottles of vodka and a half-empty container of antifreeze nearby. Upon regaining consciousness, he exhibits slurred speech, difficulty following commands, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory tests reveal an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury. Given the presence of antifreeze, which contains ethylene glycol, it is likely that the patient ingested this toxic substance.

Ethylene glycol poisoning is known to cause metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine. The body metabolizes ethylene glycol into glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which then combines with calcium to form insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. These crystals can deposit in the kidneys, leading to acute kidney injury.

Therefore, the expected finding in this patient's urine would be calcium oxalate crystals.

Physical examination shows three linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand. There is tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node shows necrotizing granulomas. The most likely causal organism of this patient's clinical findings is also involved in the pathogenesis of which of the following conditions?
A) Bacillary angiomatosis
B) Burkitt lymphoma
C) Condylomata lata
D) Brucellosis
E) Bubonic plague","To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. The patient is a 6-year-old boy presenting with generalized malaise, palpable swelling in the left axilla, and a history of a rash on the left hand.
2. The rash developed after visiting an animal shelter, suggesting a possible zoonotic infection (an infection that can be transmitted from animals to humans).
3. Physical examination findings include linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand and tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy.
4. Histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node shows necrotizing granulomas.

Given these details, the most likely diagnosis is cat-scratch disease (CSD), caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. CSD typically presents with a history of a cat scratch or bite, followed by the development of a papule or pustule at the site of the injury, and subsequent lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) in the draining lymph node basin, often accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever.

Now, looking at the options provided to identify which condition is also associated with the causal organism of this patient's clinical findings:

A) Bacillary angiomatosis - This condition is indeed caused by Bartonella species, including B. henselae and B. quintana. It's characterized by vascular proliferations that can affect various organs, primarily seen in immunocompromised individuals.

B) Burkitt lymphoma - This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, not Bartonella.

C) Condylomata lata - These are lesions associated with secondary syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum.

D) Brucellosis - This is a zoonotic infection caused by bacteria of the genus Brucella, not Bartonella.

E) Bubonic plague - This is caused by Yersinia pestis.

Given the information, the correct answer is associated with bacillary angiomatosis, which is also caused by Bartonella species.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Insulin, IV fluids, and potassium
B) Insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose
C) IV fluids only
D) Oral rehydration
E) Supportive therapy and close monitoring","The patient, a 27-year-old man with a history of IV drug abuse, presents to the emergency department with severe hyperglycemia (glucose 589 mg/dL), hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. His initial potassium level is elevated at 6.3 mEq/L. After treatment, his glucose level normalizes to 90 mg/dL, and his potassium level corrects to 4.3 mEq/L. Given the significant drop in glucose and correction of potassium levels, it is crucial to continue managing the patient to prevent further complications.

The best next step in management would focus on maintaining euglycemia, ensuring proper hydration, and monitoring electrolytes, especially potassium, which can fluctuate significantly during the treatment of diabetic emergencies. Since the glucose has normalized and the patient is no longer in a state of severe hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (as suggested by the initial presentation and lab values), the management should shift towards maintaining these corrected levels and preventing recurrence.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate next step would involve supportive therapy to maintain the corrected glucose and electrolyte levels and close monitoring to quickly address any potential complications or recurrence of hyperglycemia.

812,"A 39-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of personality changes over the past year. He has become increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive. His wife also reports jerky movements of his limbs and trunk for the past few months. His father had dementia in his mid-40s, but the details of his condition are unclear. The patient appears restless. Examination shows irregular movements of the extremities and twitching of the face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following changes on MRI?
A) Reduced hippocampal volume
B) Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions
C) Degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes
D) Extra-axial tumor with dural attachments
E) Atrophy of the striatum","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and how they relate to potential MRI findings.

1. **Personality Changes and Cognitive Decline**: The patient has become increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive, with impaired memory. These symptoms suggest a neurodegenerative process affecting both cognitive and emotional regulation.

2. **Movement Disorder**: The presence of jerky movements of the limbs and trunk, irregular movements of the extremities, and twitching of the face and tongue indicate a significant motor component to the patient's condition. These symptoms are characteristic of chorea, a type of involuntary movement.

3. **Family History**: The patient's father had dementia in his mid-40s, suggesting a possible genetic component to the condition.

Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is Huntington's disease (HD), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the triad of cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, and chorea. HD is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the Huntingtin gene, leading to neuronal loss and atrophy in specific brain regions.

The hallmark of Huntington's disease on imaging is atrophy of the striatum, particularly the caudate nucleus and putamen. This atrophy can be detected on MRI and is a key diagnostic feature of the disease.

600,"A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?
A) Consumption of undercooked meat
B) Chronic hypertension
C) Intravenous heroin use
D) Alcohol use disorder
E) Spirochete infection","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Repeating the same information and needing reminders**: This suggests a problem with short-term memory or working memory.
2. **Constricted affect**: This is a reduction in emotional reactivity, which can be seen in various neurological and psychiatric conditions.
3. **No long-term memory deficits and ability to count in serial sevens without error**: This indicates that the patient's long-term memory and certain executive functions are intact.
4. **MRI findings of atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies**: These are specific areas of the brain that are often affected in certain conditions.

Given these details, the patient's condition seems to primarily affect short-term memory and emotional reactivity, with specific neuroimaging findings. The most likely condition, based on the MRI findings and the clinical presentation, is Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. This condition is characterized by a triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia (Wernicke's encephalopathy), followed by a chronic phase of severe short-term memory loss (Korsakoff's syndrome), although not all symptoms are present in this case.

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is most commonly associated with **alcohol use disorder**, due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is crucial for brain function, and its deficiency can lead to the brain atrophy and symptoms seen in this patient.

768,"A 61-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Her last Pap smear 3 years ago showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. HPV testing was negative at that time. On questioning, she has had fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
A) Proliferation of endometrial glands
B) Elevated serum CA-125 level
C) Elevated serum beta-hCG level
D) Prolonged prothrombin time
E) Cervical dysplasia on Pap smear","Analyzing the situation, the 61-year-old nulliparous woman presents with fatigue, an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months, and shifting dullness on abdominal examination, which suggests ascites. The presence of a right adnexal mass on bimanual palpation, combined with her age and symptoms, raises concern for ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer often presents at an advanced stage with nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal swelling and weight loss. The tumor marker CA-125 is commonly elevated in ovarian cancer, especially in serous epithelial ovarian cancers, which are the most common type. While not specific to ovarian cancer, an elevated CA-125 level in the context of her clinical presentation would support this diagnosis. Therefore, further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show an elevated serum CA-125 level.

831,"A 72-year-old man in a nursing home was brought to the emergency department with right hand and leg weakness for 1 hour. There has been a gradual increase in the degree of weakness. The patient is disoriented. The medical history includes ischemic heart disease diagnosed 2 months ago, and long histories of diabetes and hypertension (30 and 25 years, respectively). On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?
A) Gangrenous necrosis
B) Liquefactive necrosis
C) Caseous necrosis
D) Fibrinoid necrosis
E) Coagulative necrosis","The patient is a 72-year-old man presenting with right hand and leg weakness that has gradually increased over 1 hour, along with disorientation. His medical history includes ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. The physical examination reveals hypertonic reflexes and a positive Babinski reflex, which are indicative of an upper motor neuron lesion. Given the acute onset of symptoms and the specific neurological deficits, the most likely diagnosis is an ischemic stroke.

Ischemic strokes occur due to a lack of blood flow to a part of the brain, usually as a result of a blockage in a cerebral artery. This leads to cell death in the affected area. The type of cell death in ischemic strokes is typically liquefactive necrosis, which is characterized by the digestion of dead cells, resulting in a soft, liquid mass. This is in contrast to coagulative necrosis, which is more commonly seen in other organs like the heart and liver, where the dead cells maintain their outline for a while.

Liquefactive necrosis is the most common type of necrosis in the brain because the brain has little to no structural framework (like collagen in other tissues), so when cells die, the tissue essentially liquefies. This process is facilitated by the high lipid content of the brain and the activity of various enzymes that break down dead tissue.

Given this information, the most likely pathologic change in this patient, who is suspected to have suffered an ischemic stroke, is liquefactive necrosis.

377,"A 3-month-old girl is brought to the physician because of a productive cough for 5 days. Over the past month, she has had several episodes of watery stools. She is exclusively breastfed every 3–4 hours for 15–20 minutes. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not yet been evaluated by a physician. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. The mother had no prenatal care. The infant is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. The infant has not received any immunizations. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Oral examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate. Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
A) Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes
B) DNA test for CFTR mutation
C) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test
D) Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes
E) T-cell receptor excision circle analysis","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 3-month-old girl presents with a productive cough for 5 days, episodes of watery stools over the past month, and failure to gain weight. She also has white plaques covering the tongue and the palate, and rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Additionally, cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present.

2. **Birth and Feeding History**: She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home, has not yet been evaluated by a physician, and is exclusively breastfed.

3. **Immunization Status**: The infant has not received any immunizations.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: The infant is at the 5th percentile for height and weight, indicating failure to thrive. Her vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low blood pressure.

Given these details, the clinical picture suggests an immunocompromised state, likely due to a congenital condition affecting the immune system. The presence of opportunistic infections such as oral thrush (indicated by white plaques in the mouth) and possibly pneumonia (suggested by the productive cough and rales), along with failure to thrive, points towards a severe immunodeficiency.

Among the options provided:

- **A) Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes**: This would be useful for diagnosing chromosomal abnormalities but is not directly indicated by the clinical presentation of recurrent infections and failure to thrive.

- **B) DNA test for CFTR mutation**: This is specific for diagnosing cystic fibrosis, which could cause respiratory infections but does not fully explain the range of symptoms, especially the severe immunocompromised state.

- **C) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test**: This is used to diagnose syphilis, which can cause congenital abnormalities if transmitted from mother to child, but the symptoms do not directly align with congenital syphilis.

- **D) Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes**: This could help diagnose specific viral infections but does not address the underlying cause of the infant's immunocompromised state.

- **E) T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis**: This is a screening test for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and other T-cell lymphopenias. SCID is a group of rare disorders caused by mutations in different genes involved in the development and function of infection-fighting immune cells. Infants with SCID are at risk of severe infections from early in life, which aligns with the clinical presentation described.

Given the recurrent severe infections, failure to thrive, and absence of any other clear cause, the most likely diagnosis is a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), for which TREC analysis is a key diagnostic tool.

740,"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by ambulance after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was driving a motorcycle and collided with a bus. The EMT personnel found the patient alert with anterograde amnesia for the several minutes preceding the accident. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is drowsy but follows commands. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the initial examination is unremarkable. While the patient is being transferred to observation, his level of consciousness acutely declines. Repeat vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination now shows a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?
A) Tearing of the middle meningeal artery
B) Dural arteriovenous fistula
C) Tearing of bridging veins
D) Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm
E) Arteriovenous malformation","Analyzing the situation, the 30-year-old man was involved in a motor vehicle collision while driving a motorcycle and collided with a bus. Initially, he was alert with anterograde amnesia, but his level of consciousness acutely declined during transfer to observation. The significant findings include a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex and a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. These signs are indicative of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and impending herniation, likely due to an intracranial hemorrhage. The most common cause of this presentation in the context of trauma is an epidural hematoma, which is typically caused by the tearing of the middle meningeal artery. This condition is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention to relieve the pressure and prevent further brain damage.

772,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor vehicle accident. He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case?
A) 30S ribosome inhibitor
B) 50S ribosome inhibitor
C) Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor
D) DNA gyrase inhibitor
E) Folate metabolism inhibitor","To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. A 3-year-old boy undergoes emergency surgery due to severe internal bleeding from a motor vehicle accident.
2. Post-surgery, he is taken to the PICU for recovery.
3. Serial labs show target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis, indicating a response to severe trauma and possibly infection.
4. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that continues upon discharge.

Given the context of severe trauma, surgery, and subsequent signs of possible infection (leukocytosis), the prophylactic regimen is likely aimed at preventing infection, which is a common complication in such cases.

The lab findings of target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis can indicate a response to infection or inflammation, among other conditions. Target cells can be seen in conditions affecting the red blood cell membrane, but in this context, they might also reflect a broader bone marrow response to stress or infection.

Considering the options provided, which describe mechanisms of action for different classes of antibiotics, we need to determine which class would be most appropriate for prophylaxis in this scenario:

A) 30S ribosome inhibitor - This class includes aminoglycosides, which are often used for serious infections but might not be the first choice for prophylaxis due to potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.

B) 50S ribosome inhibitor - This includes macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins. While effective against a range of pathogens, they might not be the first choice for broad-spectrum prophylaxis in a post-traumatic setting.

C) Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor - This describes the mechanism of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins), which are commonly used for prophylaxis in surgical settings due to their broad-spectrum activity and effectiveness against a wide range of bacteria.

D) DNA gyrase inhibitor - This class includes quinolones, which are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria but might not be the first choice for prophylaxis in pediatric patients due to potential side effects.

E) Folate metabolism inhibitor - This includes sulfonamides and trimethoprim, often used in combination (as co-trimoxazole). While effective against a range of pathogens, they might not be the first choice for broad-spectrum prophylaxis in this setting.

Given the context of a pediatric patient requiring broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis following severe trauma and surgery, the most likely prescribed drug would be from the class of cell wall cross-linking inhibitors, which includes cephalosporins and penicillins, commonly used for such purposes.

254,"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
A) Patent processus vaginalis
B) Dilation of the pampiniform plexus
C) Twisting of the spermatic cord
D) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis
E) Impaired lymphatic drainage","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's history and physical examination:

1. **Painless right-sided scrotal swelling**: This suggests a non-inflammatory cause.
2. **Intermittent presence**: This could indicate a condition that varies in size or presence.
3. **Soft, cystic, nontender mass that transilluminates**: Transillumination is a characteristic feature of fluid-filled structures, suggesting a hydrocele.
4. **Does not increase in size on coughing**: This suggests that the mass is not connected to the abdominal cavity, ruling out a hernia.
5. **Normal tissue palpable above the mass**: This further supports that the mass is localized and not an extension of a hernia.
6. **No bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position**: These findings again rule out a hernia.
7. **Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities**: This indicates that the mass is likely not a testicular tumor.

Given these points, the most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which is the pathophysiological basis for a hydrocele. Hydroceles are characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the tunica vaginalis, leading to a soft, cystic, and painless scrotal swelling that transilluminates.

872,"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:
Urine test
Sample White cells Culture
Mid-stream urine Negative Negative
Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
B) Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis
C) Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis
D) Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli
E) Interstitial cystitis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the results of the investigations.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. These symptoms have not improved with antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin.

2. **Physical Examination**: The physical examination is unremarkable except for a mildly tender prostate without masses or nodules.

3. **Investigations**: The urine test results show negative white cells and culture in the mid-stream urine but positive white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) with a negative culture.

Given these details, we can rule out certain conditions:

- **Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (C)** and **Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli (D)** are less likely because the EPS culture is negative, and there's no evidence of a bacterial infection that would be expected with these conditions.

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (A)** primarily presents with obstructive urinary symptoms (e.g., hesitancy, weak stream, nocturia) rather than the irritative symptoms and pelvic pain described here.

- **Interstitial cystitis (E)** is a possibility but less likely given the specific findings of a tender prostate and the presence of white cells in the EPS, which points more towards a prostatic issue.

The patient's symptoms of chronic pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and the presence of white cells in the EPS without a positive culture are most consistent with **Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis (B)**. This condition is characterized by chronic inflammation of the prostate without a bacterial infection, which explains the lack of response to antimicrobial therapy. The patient's additional symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability might suggest a broader syndrome such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a functional disorder, but these do not directly relate to the urological diagnosis.

682,"A 29-year-old female presents to her primary care provider with an aching pain in her left leg that has progressively gotten worse over several days. She recently had an unfortunate sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs. An X-ray after the event was negative for fracture. Past medical history is positive for systemic lupus erythematosus. She also has a history of one spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 119/80 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her left leg appears pink and slightly swollen. Homan’s sign is positive. A Doppler ultrasound reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Her lab results are as follows:
Platelets 250,000/mm3
Prothrombin Time 14 sec
Partial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec
Mixing study (PTT) 89 sec
What is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?
A) Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
B) Antibodies directed against phospholipids
C) Antibodies directed against endothelial cells
D) Vitamin K deficiency
E) Disseminated intravascular coagulation","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and lab results:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can be associated with various autoantibodies, including antiphospholipid antibodies. She also had a spontaneous abortion, which is a known risk factor for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The patient now presents with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as evidenced by the positive Homan's sign and confirmed by Doppler ultrasound showing a thrombus in the left popliteal vein.

2. **Lab Results**:
   - **Platelet Count**: Normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia as a primary cause.
   - **Prothrombin Time (PT)**: Slightly elevated but not significantly abnormal.
   - **Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT)**: Markedly elevated, indicating a problem with the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
   - **Mixing Study (PTT)**: Remains elevated after mixing with normal plasma, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor rather than a factor deficiency.

Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is related to the presence of an inhibitor that affects the intrinsic coagulation pathway, as indicated by the elevated PTT that does not correct with mixing studies. This pattern is consistent with the presence of lupus anticoagulant, which is an antibody directed against phospholipids and is a hallmark of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is known to cause an increased risk of thrombosis, as seen in this patient, and is often associated with autoimmune diseases like SLE.

Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Central retinal vein occlusion
B) Retinal detachment
C) Central retinal artery occlusion
D) Acute angle-closure glaucoma
E) Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy","Analyzing the situation, the 60-year-old woman experienced sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye, which occurred 30 minutes prior to presentation. Her medical history includes coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, all of which increase her risk for vascular events. The examination findings of no perception of light in the right eye, absent direct pupillary reflex in the right eye, and a fundoscopic examination showing a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula are highly suggestive of a vascular occlusion affecting the retina. The presence of a bright red area within the macula, known as the ""cherry red spot,"" is particularly indicative of a central retinal artery occlusion. This condition occurs when the central retinal artery, which supplies blood to the retina, becomes blocked, leading to ischemia of the retinal tissue. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is central retinal artery occlusion.

686,"A healthy 21-year-old man undergoes physical fitness testing prior to long-term submarine deployment. To evaluate his pulmonary function, lung and thoracic compliance are measured at different system pressures. A graph of the relationship between his lung volume and transpulmonary pressure is shown. The dotted line in this graph corresponds to which of the following lung volumes?
A) Inspiratory capacity
B) Vital capacity
C) Tidal volume
D) Functional residual capacity
E) Total lung capacity","To evaluate the given information, let's break down the key points related to lung volumes and the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure.

1. **Lung Volumes**: 
   - **Tidal Volume (TV)**: The volume of air inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing.
   - **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV)**: The maximum volume of air that can be inhaled beyond the tidal volume.
   - **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)**: The maximum volume of air that can be exhaled beyond the tidal volume.
   - **Residual Volume (RV)**: The volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximum exhalation.
   - **Inspiratory Capacity (IC)**: The sum of TV and IRV, representing the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled after a normal exhalation.
   - **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)**: The volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal exhalation, which is the sum of RV and ERV.
   - **Vital Capacity (VC)**: The maximum volume of air that can be exhaled after maximum inhalation, which is the sum of TV, IRV, and ERV.
   - **Total Lung Capacity (TLC)**: The total volume of air in the lungs after maximum inhalation, which is the sum of VC and RV.

2. **Transpulmonary Pressure**: This is the difference between the intrapleural pressure and the alveolar pressure. It is a measure of the elastic recoil pressure of the lungs, essentially the pressure required to inflate the lungs.

Given the description of the graph showing the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure, the dotted line likely represents a point or a range on this graph. However, without a visual representation of the graph, we must infer based on typical characteristics of lung volume and pressure relationships.

- **Inspiratory Capacity (A)** refers to the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled after a normal exhalation. This would be represented by a significant portion of the lung volume but not necessarily tied to a specific pressure point without more context.
- **Vital Capacity (B)** is the maximum volume of air that can be exhaled after maximum inhalation. This would be a larger volume than inspiratory capacity and would represent the full range of volumes from maximum inhalation to maximum exhalation.
- **Tidal Volume (C)** is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled during normal breathing. This would typically be a smaller volume compared to the others and might be represented by a smaller range on the graph.
- **Functional Residual Capacity (D)** is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a normal exhalation. This point might be identified on a graph as the volume at which the transpulmonary pressure is zero or at a baseline state, indicating the resting volume of the lungs.
- **Total Lung Capacity (E)** is the total volume of air in the lungs after maximum inhalation. This would be the maximum volume represented on the graph.

Considering the definitions and how they relate to lung volume and transpulmonary pressure, the description most closely aligns with **Functional Residual Capacity (D)**, as it represents a baseline state of lung volume at rest, which could be distinctly marked on a graph as a reference point.

The scenario describes a follow-up analysis of a study examining the relationship between cART (combination Antiretroviral Therapy) adherence and the risk of DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma) among patients, presumably those with HIV/AIDS given the context of CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. The analysis is stratified by CD4+ cell counts at the time of diagnosis, with a threshold of 200/mm^3 used to define two strata.

The findings indicate that among patients with lower CD4+ cell counts (<200/mm^3), adherence to cART significantly reduces the risk of DLBCL (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with higher CD4+ cell counts (>200/mm^3), no significant relationship is observed between cART adherence and DLBCL risk (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36).

Given these results, we need to identify the concept that best explains the observed difference in the association between cART adherence and DLBCL risk across the two strata defined by CD4+ cell counts.

- **Poor generalizability (A)** refers to the limitation of applying study findings to the broader population due to the study's specific characteristics or biases. This does not directly explain the difference observed between the two strata in this scenario.

- **Stratified sampling (B)** is a method used to ensure that subgroups are adequately represented in a sample. While stratification is indeed used in this analysis, the term does not explain the observed difference in the association between cART adherence and DLBCL risk across strata.

- **Random error (C)** refers to the chance variation in results that can occur due to sampling variability. While random error could contribute to differences in observed effects, it does not systematically explain the specific pattern of difference seen between the two CD4+ strata.

- **Systematic error (D)**, or bias, refers to a consistent error in one direction. This concept does not directly apply to explaining the observed difference in the association between cART adherence and DLBCL risk across the two strata.

- **Effect modification (E)** occurs when the effect of an exposure on an outcome is modified by a third variable. In this case, the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk appears to be modified by the CD4+ cell count at diagnosis. Specifically, the protective effect of cART adherence is significant among those with lower CD4+ cell counts but not among those with higher counts.

Therefore, the observed difference in the association between cART adherence and DLBCL risk across the two strata defined by CD4+ cell counts is best explained by effect modification.

366,"A 26-year-old man presents to his physician with a history of diarrhea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9ºC (98.4ºF), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 102/74 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. A resident working under the physician plots a Darrow-Yannet diagram for the patient. The diagram is shown in the picture where the green dotted line represents the new fluid status. Which of the following is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient?
A) B-type natriuretic peptide
B) Bradykinin
C) Erythropoietin
D) Renin
E) Vasoactive intestinal peptide","To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and understand the context of the Darrow-Yannet diagram, even though we can't see the actual diagram.

The patient is a 26-year-old man presenting with diarrhea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. These symptoms suggest a significant loss of fluids and electrolytes, leading to dehydration. The physical examination findings, such as a slightly elevated pulse rate (tachycardia) and normal to low blood pressure, support this interpretation.

A Darrow-Yannet diagram is a graphical representation used to illustrate the changes in body fluid compartments during various physiological and pathological states. It typically depicts the volumes of intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF), with the ECF further divided into plasma and interstitial fluid. The diagram helps in understanding how fluid shifts between these compartments in response to different conditions.

Given the patient's symptoms and the context of the Darrow-Yannet diagram, we are looking for a hormone or substance that would be secreted in response to dehydration and fluid loss. This substance should help in conserving water and electrolytes or mobilizing fluid from one compartment to another to maintain blood pressure and fluid balance.

Let's evaluate the options:

A) B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) - This hormone is secreted by the heart in response to increased ventricular stretch and pressure overload. It promotes natriuresis (sodium excretion) and diuresis, which would not be beneficial in a dehydrated state.

B) Bradykinin - This peptide is involved in the inflammatory response and causes vasodilation, which would not directly help in conserving fluid or improving blood pressure in dehydration.

C) Erythropoietin - This hormone is secreted in response to low oxygen levels and stimulates erythropoiesis (red blood cell production). It is not directly involved in fluid balance.

D) Renin - This enzyme is secreted by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to decreased blood volume, decreased blood pressure, or decreased sodium delivery to the distal tubules. It initiates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which ultimately leads to the production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. These hormones help in conserving sodium and water, constricting blood vessels, and increasing blood pressure, making renin a key player in responding to dehydration.

E) Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) - This peptide has several effects, including vasodilation and smooth muscle relaxation in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not primarily involved in the body's response to dehydration.

Given the context of dehydration and the need for the body to conserve fluid and electrolytes, the substance most likely to show increased secretion in this patient is renin, as it activates the RAAS to counteract the effects of fluid loss.

1267,"A 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension presents to his primary care physician for an annual check-up. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He takes enalapril and metformin. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. His physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the patient’s regimen. One month later, the patient returns to the physician complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling. Which of the following medications was likely prescribed to this patient?
A) Metoprolol
B) Verapamil
C) Nifedipine
D) Hydrochlorthiazide
E) Spironolactone","To approach this question, let's consider the patient's initial presentation and the subsequent development of lower extremity swelling after adding a new anti-hypertensive medication to his regimen. The patient was already taking enalapril, which is an ACE inhibitor, and metformin for his diabetes.

The key detail here is the new onset of lower extremity swelling after the addition of the new medication. This side effect is commonly associated with certain classes of anti-hypertensive medications.

Let's evaluate the options:

A) Metoprolol is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers are not typically associated with causing peripheral edema as a primary side effect.

B) Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker of the phenylalkylamine class. While calcium channel blockers can cause peripheral edema, this is more commonly seen with the dihydropyridine class.

C) Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine class. This class of medications is well-known for causing peripheral edema as a side effect due to their potent vasodilatory effects, leading to increased fluid leakage into the interstitial tissue.

D) Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic. Diuretics are generally used to reduce fluid volume in the body and are less likely to cause edema as a side effect. In fact, they are often used to treat edema.

E) Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. Like other diuretics, it is not typically associated with causing edema.

Given the development of lower extremity swelling after adding a new medication, the most likely culprit is a medication known to cause this side effect, making option C, Nifedipine, the most plausible choice.

918,"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Malingering
B) Glucagonoma
C) Primary adrenal insufficiency
D) Conversion disorder
E) Factitious disorder imposed on another
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient's Symptoms and Initial Presentation**: The 5-year-old boy presents with sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis. These symptoms are initially resolved with a dextrose infusion, indicating hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) as the immediate cause of his symptoms.

2. **Recurrent Episode**: Despite initial resolution, the boy experiences another episode of decreased consciousness overnight, again associated with hypoglycemia.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: During the second episode, his serum glucose is low (19 mg/dL), insulin concentration is elevated (108 mIU/L), and C-peptide concentration is low (0.3 ng/mL). Elevated insulin in the context of hypoglycemia suggests insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, the low C-peptide level is crucial; C-peptide is a marker of endogenous insulin production, and its low level in the face of high insulin suggests exogenous insulin administration.

4. **Medical History and Family Context**: The boy has asthma but no mentioned history of diabetes or insulin therapy. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which means she likely has access to insulin.

Given these points, the scenario strongly suggests that the boy's hypoglycemic episodes are due to the administration of exogenous insulin, which is not being produced by his body (as indicated by the low C-peptide level). The most plausible explanation is that someone with access to insulin (likely his mother, given her diabetes diagnosis) is administering insulin to the boy, leading to these episodes of hypoglycemia.

This behavior fits the description of a factitious disorder imposed on another, also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This is a psychological disorder in which a caregiver fabricates or exaggerates a child's illnesses in order to gain sympathy and attention for themselves.

D) Human T-lymphotropic virus
E) Schistosoma haematobium","Analyzing the situation, the 39-year-old man was brought to the emergency department unconscious following 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and has complained of recurrent headaches for the past 2 weeks. The patient's physical examination shows that he is obtunded, grimaces on pain, and localizes in response to pain in both upper extremities, indicating a decreased level of consciousness. The MRI of the brain with contrast and the brain biopsy revealing perivascular clusters of lymphocytes are indicative of a central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma or an inflammatory process.

In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?
A) Nifedipine
B) Enoxaparin
C) Clopidogrel
D) Spironolactone
E) Propranolol
""","The patient is a 65-year-old man who presented with acute chest pain and was diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as indicated by ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF on the ECG and an increased serum troponin T concentration. He underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and was found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 58% at discharge. Given his diagnosis of ACS and the treatment he received, the goal of his medication regimen should be to prevent further ischemic events and improve his cardiovascular outcomes.

Aspirin is a cornerstone in the management of ACS due to its antiplatelet effects, which help prevent clot formation. In addition to aspirin, another antiplatelet agent is typically recommended for patients who have undergone PTCA to further reduce the risk of ischemic events.

Among the options provided, Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that works by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation, thereby reducing the risk of clot formation. It is commonly used in conjunction with aspirin in patients who have undergone PTCA, especially after an ACS event, to prevent further ischemic events.

Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker used primarily for hypertension and angina, but it is not typically added to the regimen of a patient who has just undergone PTCA for ACS unless there are specific indications such as hypertension not controlled by other means.

Enoxaparin is an anticoagulant used in the acute management of ACS, but it is not typically continued long-term after PTCA unless there are specific indications.

Spironolactone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of heart failure and hypertension. While it could be considered in patients with reduced LVEF, this patient's LVEF is 58%, which does not indicate significant left ventricular dysfunction.

Propranolol is a beta-blocker, which could be considered for secondary prevention post-ACS, but it is not the best choice among the options given the context of adding to aspirin for antiplatelet therapy.

Therefore, the most appropriate medication to add to this patient's regimen, in addition to aspirin, is Clopidogrel, due to its antiplatelet effects and the role it plays in preventing further ischemic events in patients who have undergone PTCA for ACS.

380,"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of worsening shortness of breath for 6 hours. For the past 5 days, he has had intermittent stabbing pain in the middle of his chest that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths. He has also had a runny nose and a dry cough for the past 2 weeks. He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His current medications include atorvastatin, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide. He appears pale and sweaty. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 25/min. Blood pressure is 107/72 mm Hg during expiration and 86/65 mm Hg during inspiration. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?
A) Dilation of the atria and ventricles
B) Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity
C) Occlusion of a coronary artery
D) Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space
E) Fibrous thickening of the pericardium","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Worsening shortness of breath for 6 hours**: This indicates a rapidly progressing condition affecting the respiratory or cardiovascular system.

2. **Intermittent stabbing pain in the middle of the chest that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths**: This type of pain is characteristic of pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart.

3. **Runny nose and a dry cough for the past 2 weeks**: These symptoms could suggest a viral upper respiratory infection, which can sometimes lead to pericarditis.

4. **Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension**: While these conditions increase the risk for coronary artery disease, the nature of the chest pain and other symptoms do not strongly suggest an acute coronary syndrome.

5. **Smoking history**: This increases the risk for various cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease and heart failure, but again, the specific symptoms here point more towards a pericardial issue.

6. **Physical examination findings**:
   - **Jugular venous distention and pitting edema**: These signs suggest right heart failure or constrictive pericarditis, but given the acute presentation, a more acute process like cardiac tamponade should be considered.
   - **Blood pressure drop during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus)**: This is a classic sign of cardiac tamponade, a condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardial space compresses the heart, impeding its ability to fill and pump blood effectively.

Given these observations, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, leading to cardiac tamponade. This is a medical emergency requiring prompt intervention, typically pericardiocentesis to remove the fluid and relieve the pressure on the heart.

730,"A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. Vomiting occurs almost immediately after most feeds. Each time, he becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 3300 g (7 lb 4 oz); he currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). He has Down syndrome. His vaccinations are up-to-date. He appears agitated and cries during the examination. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 156/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 100/49 mm Hg.

Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?
A) Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray
B) A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration
C) Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
D) Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound
E) Tripple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 6-week-old male infant presenting with a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. This symptomatology is crucial as nonbilious vomiting (vomit that is not green or yellow) often points towards an obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract, proximal to the ampulla of Vater.

2. **Clinical Features**: The infant becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle, indicating discomfort associated with feeding. The presence of an epigastric mass is highly suggestive of a specific condition.

3. **Diagnosis Considerations**:
   - **A) Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray**: This would be more indicative of a lower gastrointestinal tract issue, such as Hirschsprung's disease, which typically presents with bilious vomiting and constipation.
   - **B) A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration**: This is related to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which does not directly correlate with the symptoms of vomiting and an epigastric mass.
   - **C) Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)**: Rotavirus infection could cause gastroenteritis, but it doesn't explain the presence of an epigastric mass.
   - **D) Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound**: This finding is characteristic of pyloric stenosis, a condition where the pylorus muscle thickens, causing gastric outlet obstruction. This matches the clinical presentation of nonbilious vomiting and the finding of an epigastric mass.
   - **E) Triple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray**: This sign is associated with duodenal atresia or stenosis, conditions that typically present with bilious vomiting.

Given the clinical presentation of nonbilious vomiting, the presence of an epigastric mass, and the typical age of presentation, the most likely diagnosis is pyloric stenosis. The diagnostic evaluation most likely to confirm this diagnosis would be an abdominal ultrasound showing an elongated and thickened pylorus.

Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint?
A) Decreased lower esophageal tone
B) Esophageal fibrosis
C) Increased lower esophageal tone
D) Spastic cricopharyngeal muscle
E) Uncoordinated esophageal peristalsis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the options provided.

The patient is a 43-year-old woman presenting with complaints of retrosternal burning associated with eating, which has persisted for several years but has been worsening. This symptomatology is classic for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which involves the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn and discomfort.

GERD is often associated with decreased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone. The LES is a ring-like muscle that separates the esophagus and stomach. Its primary function is to prevent the reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus. When the LES tone is decreased, it fails to effectively prevent gastric reflux, leading to symptoms of GERD.

Considering the options provided:

A) Decreased lower esophageal tone - This is the most likely pathophysiology of the patient's chief complaint, as it directly correlates with the symptoms of GERD.

B) Esophageal fibrosis - This condition involves scarring of the esophagus, which could lead to difficulty swallowing but does not directly explain the patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning.

C) Increased lower esophageal tone - This would actually help prevent GERD symptoms by more effectively preventing gastric reflux.

D) Spastic cricopharyngeal muscle - This condition involves abnormal spasms of the muscle at the top of the esophagus and can cause difficulty swallowing, but it does not explain the patient's symptoms.

E) Uncoordinated esophageal peristalsis - This refers to abnormal contractions of the esophagus that can cause difficulty swallowing, but again, it does not directly explain the patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning associated with eating.

626,"A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?
A) High IgM, low IgA, and IgE
B) Low IgA, high IgG, normal IgE
C) Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM
D) High IgE, normal IgA, and IgG
E) Normal serum immunoglobulin values","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient, a 23-year-old woman, undergoes elective surgery but experiences an unexpected bleeding event necessitating a blood transfusion. Following the transfusion, she exhibits symptoms of an allergic reaction, which is treated with epinephrine.

2. **Suspected Condition**: The physician suspects an underlying immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. The symptoms and the context (allergic reaction to a blood transfusion) hint at an issue related to the immune system's response.

3. **Immunoglobulin Levels and Their Implications**:
   - **IgA**: Plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity and is also involved in the immune response to transfused blood products. A deficiency in IgA could lead to an increased risk of infections and potentially to anaphylactic reactions against IgA in transfused blood because the patient's immune system might recognize IgA as a foreign substance.
   - **IgG**: The most common type of antibody found in blood circulation. IgG antibodies are crucial for fighting bacterial and viral infections.
   - **IgE**: Involved in the body's allergic responses. Elevated levels of IgE are often associated with allergic conditions.
   - **IgM**: The first antibody to be made by the body to fight a new infection.

Given the context of an allergic reaction to a blood transfusion and the suspicion of an immunodeficiency disorder, the most plausible scenario involves a deficiency in IgA. This is because IgA deficiency can lead to the production of anti-IgA antibodies, increasing the risk of anaphylactic reactions upon exposure to IgA in transfused blood products. The presence of normal IgG and IgM levels would indicate that the patient's immune response is otherwise relatively intact, except for the specific issue related to IgA.

Which of the following is the best next treatment for this patient?
A) Ceftriaxone
B) Dextrose
C) Lactulose
D) Potassium
E) Rifaximin","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient is a 40-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism, presenting with altered mental status that has been worsening over a few days. The physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender, and the neurological exam is notable for confusion and asterixis.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The laboratory values show a relatively normal electrolyte panel with slight hypokalemia (K+: 3.3 mEq/L) and a low glucose level (59 mg/dL). The other parameters are within normal limits or not significantly abnormal.

3. **Diagnosis**: The patient's presentation of altered mental status, confusion, asterixis, and a history of cirrhosis is highly suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is a complication of cirrhosis characterized by cognitive disturbances ranging from mild confusion to coma, often precipitated by factors such as infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, or medication non-adherence.

4. **Treatment**: The management of hepatic encephalopathy involves addressing the precipitating factors and reducing ammonia levels, which are thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of the condition. Lactulose is the first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy as it decreases the production of ammonia by intestinal bacteria and traps ammonia in the colon, promoting its excretion.

- **A) Ceftriaxone**: An antibiotic, which might be considered if there were evidence of infection, but it's not the primary treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.
- **B) Dextrose**: Could be considered for the low glucose level, but it does not address the primary issue of hepatic encephalopathy.
- **C) Lactulose**: The primary treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, aimed at reducing ammonia levels.
- **D) Potassium**: While the patient has slight hypokalemia, correcting this does not directly address the hepatic encephalopathy.
- **E) Rifaximin**: An antibiotic that can be used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, particularly for preventing recurrence, but lactulose is the first-line choice.

331,"A 58-year-old male is hospitalized after sustaining multiple fractures in a severe automobile accident. Soon after hospitalization, he develops respiratory distress with crackles present bilaterally on physical examination. The patient does not respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen and quickly dies due to respiratory insufficiency. Autopsy reveals heavy, red lungs and histology is shown in Image A. Which of the following is most likely to have been present in this patient shortly before death:
A) Diaphragmatic hypertrophy
B) Proliferation of bronchiolar mucous glands
C) Interstitial edema
D) Large pulmonary embolus
E) Left apical bronchoalveolar carcinoma","To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient, a 58-year-old male, was hospitalized after a severe automobile accident and subsequently developed respiratory distress. The symptoms of respiratory distress, including crackles present bilaterally on physical examination, and the failure to respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen, suggest a severe lung injury. The fact that the patient quickly died due to respiratory insufficiency further supports the notion of a catastrophic lung condition.

The autopsy findings of heavy, red lungs are indicative of acute lung injury, which is often associated with conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a condition characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and potentially fatal hypoxemia if not managed properly.

Given the context of a severe automobile accident, it is plausible that the patient suffered from a condition directly related to trauma. The description of heavy, red lungs and the patient's failure to respond to oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation are classic signs of ARDS, which can be triggered by trauma, among other causes.

Looking at the options provided:

A) Diaphragmatic hypertrophy is not directly related to the acute presentation of respiratory distress following trauma.

B) Proliferation of bronchiolar mucous glands might be seen in chronic conditions but does not fit the acute presentation described.

C) Interstitial edema is a hallmark of acute lung injury and ARDS, which fits the scenario described. The heavy, red lungs observed at autopsy would be consistent with interstitial edema.

D) A large pulmonary embolus could indeed cause sudden respiratory distress but would typically present differently on autopsy.

E) Left apical bronchoalveolar carcinoma is a type of lung cancer and would not explain the acute onset of symptoms following trauma.

Considering the acute onset of symptoms following a severe automobile accident and the autopsy findings, the most likely condition present in this patient shortly before death is interstitial edema, which is a characteristic feature of acute lung injury and ARDS.

171,"A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was found down in the middle of the street. His past medical history is unknown. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 104/64 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 5/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. The patient is being resuscitated in the trauma bay. Which of the following was most likely to be found on exam?
A) Ataxia
B) Conjunctival injection
C) Miosis
D) Mydriasis
E) Nystagmus","To approach this question, let's analyze the given information. The 25-year-old man presents with altered mental status and was found down in the middle of the street, indicating a possible acute event or injury. His vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, a relatively low pulse, very low respirations (5/min), and decreased oxygen saturation (91% on room air). These findings, particularly the low respiratory rate and altered mental status, suggest central nervous system depression.

Given the clinical presentation, the most likely cause of his condition is an opioid overdose, which is known to cause respiratory depression, altered mental status, and can lead to a patient being found unresponsive.

Among the options provided, the one that is most consistent with an opioid overdose is miosis (pupillary constriction), which is a hallmark sign of opioid use and overdose.

1101,"A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?
A) Creates a green zone of hemolysis on blood agar
B) Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus
C) Produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide
D) Produces toxin that increases cAMP levels
E) Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 2-day-old infant male with symptoms of vomiting, irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, nuchal rigidity, and bulging fontanelles. This combination of symptoms, especially in a newborn, raises concern for meningitis or another severe infection.

2. **Birth and Prenatal Care**: Born at home with unreliable prenatal care, which increases the risk for undiagnosed conditions in both the mother and the infant, including infections.

3. **Laboratory Findings and Treatment**: Cultures were obtained, and the infant was placed on empiric antibiotics, which were later narrowed to penicillin G after cultures grew out the same gram-positive bacteria. This indicates the causative organism is susceptible to penicillin G, a characteristic that can help narrow down the possible pathogens.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A) **Creates a green zone of hemolysis on blood agar**: This is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can cause severe infections including meningitis, especially in vulnerable populations like newborns. However, S. pneumoniae is typically associated with a more gradual onset and might not always be immediately susceptible to penicillin G due to resistance patterns.

B) **Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus**: This describes the CAMP test, which is positive for Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. GBS is a gram-positive bacterium that is typically susceptible to penicillin G, making it a likely candidate given the scenario.

C) **Produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide**: This is more characteristic of certain gram-negative bacteria, which does not fit the gram-positive bacteria described in the scenario.

D) **Produces toxin that increases cAMP levels**: This is characteristic of Bacillus anthracis, among others, but does not directly relate to the common causes of neonatal meningitis or sepsis as described.

E) **Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees**: This describes the motility pattern of Listeria monocytogenes, a gram-positive rod that can cause severe infections in newborns, including meningitis. However, L. monocytogenes is typically associated with outbreaks of foodborne illness or specific exposure risks.

Given the clinical presentation and the information that the organism is a gram-positive bacterium susceptible to penicillin G, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Group B Streptococcus (GBS), which is known for causing severe infections in newborns and is typically susceptible to penicillin G.

670,"A 43-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after his son found him vomiting bright red blood. He is visibly intoxicated, and hospital records indicate a long history of alcohol substance abuse treated with antabuse (disulfiram). Vital signs include T 98.4, HR 89, BP 154/92, and RR 20. EGD is notable for mild esophagitis, and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. What is the next best course of action?
A) Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding, IV fluid hydration, and NPO
B) Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation
C) Barium swallow to characterize the depth of mucosal involvement
D) Esophageal manometry and impedance studies
E) Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter","The patient is a 43-year-old male presenting with hematemesis, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a history of alcohol substance abuse, which is a significant risk factor for esophageal disorders. The EGD findings reveal mild esophagitis and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, but no active bleeding. Given the absence of active bleeding and the patient's stable vital signs, the immediate concern is to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications.

The esophageal tear, likely a Mallory-Weiss tear given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and the location at the gastroesophageal junction, needs careful management to prevent further bleeding or esophageal perforation. Conservative management is often the initial approach for Mallory-Weiss tears without active bleeding.

Among the provided options, conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation is the most appropriate next step. This approach aims to stabilize the patient, manage symptoms, and monitor for any signs of complications such as rebleeding or esophageal perforation. More invasive interventions like cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding are typically reserved for cases with active bleeding or significant risk of rebleeding.

984,"A 56-year-old man recently diagnosed with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use presents to the clinic for a follow up evaluation. He states that he has abstained from alcohol and attends a support group regularly. He has not taken any new medications or encountered any sick contacts. The patient's blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 15/min. His physical exam is grossly unremarkable. He has brought an gastroduodenoscopy report for review, which reveals that the patient has small esophageal varices with red spots. What is the next best step to prevent bleeding?
A) Endoscopic sclerotherapy
B) Ligation
C) Metoprolol
D) Nadolol
E) Repeat endoscopy","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient is a 56-year-old man with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use. He has recently been diagnosed with small esophageal varices that have red spots, which is a significant finding because the presence of red spots (also known as red wale signs) on varices indicates a higher risk of bleeding.

2. **Current Management**: The patient has abstained from alcohol and attends a support group, which is crucial for managing the underlying cause of his cirrhosis. However, the immediate concern is preventing bleeding from the esophageal varices.

3. **Prevention of Variceal Bleeding**: The management of esophageal varices to prevent first variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis) typically involves either pharmacological therapy with beta-blockers or endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL), depending on the size of the varices and the presence of high-risk stigmata like red spots.

Given the patient's esophageal varices are small but have red spots, indicating a higher risk of bleeding, the next best step would be to initiate therapy to reduce portal pressure and thus the risk of bleeding. 

- **Options A (Endoscopic sclerotherapy) and B (Ligation)** are both endoscopic treatments used for variceal bleeding, but they are generally considered for larger varices or for secondary prophylaxis (after an initial bleed). Sclerotherapy is less commonly used nowadays due to the availability of ligation techniques.

- **Options C (Metoprolol) and D (Nadolol)** are both beta-blockers, which are the first-line pharmacological treatment for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. They work by reducing portal pressure.

- **Option E (Repeat endoscopy)** might be considered for surveillance but is not an immediate next step for preventing bleeding given the patient's current high-risk features.

Considering the above, the most appropriate next step for this patient with small esophageal varices and red spots, who has not yet had a bleeding episode, would be to start a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of first variceal bleeding. Both Metoprolol and Nadolol are suitable options, but Nadolol is often preferred in this context because it has a longer half-life and is less likely to be metabolized by the liver, which can be advantageous in patients with cirrhosis.

167,"A 60-year-old man presents to the office for shortness of breath. The shortness of breath started a year ago and is exacerbated by physical activity. He has been working in the glass manufacturing industry for 20 years. His vital signs include: heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 30/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. On physical exam, there are diminished respiratory sounds on both sides. On the chest radiograph, interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate is found on both sides, and there is also an eggshell calcification of multiple adenopathies. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Berylliosis
B) Silicosis
C) Asbestosis
D) Talcosis
E) Byssinosis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Occupational History**: The patient has been working in the glass manufacturing industry for 20 years. This is crucial because it hints at potential exposure to certain materials or substances that could be harmful when inhaled.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with shortness of breath that started a year ago and is exacerbated by physical activity. This suggests a chronic condition affecting the lungs.

3. **Physical Exam Findings**: Diminished respiratory sounds on both sides indicate a problem with the lung parenchyma or the space around the lungs.

4. **Chest Radiograph Findings**: The presence of interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate on both sides suggests a chronic lung disease characterized by scarring and formation of small nodules within the lung tissue. Additionally, the eggshell calcification of multiple adenopathies (lymph nodes) is a specific finding that points towards certain occupational lung diseases.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **Berylliosis (A)**: Caused by exposure to beryllium, it can lead to lung disease but is more commonly associated with aerospace and defense industries, not typically glass manufacturing.

- **Silicosis (B)**: This condition is caused by inhalation of silica particles and is common in industries involving stone, rock, and sand. The eggshell calcification of lymph nodes is a hallmark of silicosis, making it a strong candidate given the patient's occupation in glass manufacturing, where silica exposure is possible.

- **Asbestosis (C)**: Caused by asbestos exposure, it leads to lung fibrosis but is more associated with industries involving insulation, brake pads, and construction, not typically glass manufacturing.

- **Talcosis (D)**: Caused by inhalation of talc, it can lead to lung disease but is not typically associated with the glass manufacturing industry.

- **Byssinosis (E)**: Also known as brown lung disease, it is caused by inhaling cotton dust, primarily affecting textile workers, not those in glass manufacturing.

Considering the patient's occupation and the specific radiographic findings, the most likely diagnosis is silicosis, due to the potential exposure to silica in the glass manufacturing industry and the characteristic eggshell calcification of lymph nodes.

668,"A 40-year-old patient is brought into the emergency department after suffering a motor vehicle crash where he was pinned underneath his motorcycle for about 30 minutes before a passerby called 911. While evaluating him per your institution's trauma guidelines, you discover pain upon palpation of his right lower extremity which is much larger than his left counterpart. The patient admits to decreased sensation over his right lower extremity and cannot move his leg. There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?
A) Emergent fasciotomy
B) Venous doppler
C) Arteriogram
D) External fixation
E) Internal fixation","The patient presents with signs and symptoms highly suggestive of compartment syndrome in his right lower extremity, which is a medical emergency. Compartment syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a muscle compartment compromises the perfusion of the muscles and nerves within that space. The patient's symptoms include pain upon palpation, decreased sensation, inability to move the leg, absence of palpable pulses, and a colder and paler extremity compared to the other side. The measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg in the distal right leg is elevated, which supports the diagnosis of compartment syndrome.

Given the clinical presentation and the measured compartment pressure, the next best step in this patient's care is to perform an emergent fasciotomy. Fasciotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the fascia (the layer of tissue covering the muscles and organs) to relieve tension and pressure within the muscle compartment. This procedure is essential to restore blood flow to the affected limb, prevent further muscle and nerve damage, and avoid potential long-term complications.

Other options are not immediately indicated in this scenario. A venous doppler (B) might be useful in diagnosing deep vein thrombosis but is not the priority in this case. An arteriogram (C) could be helpful in evaluating arterial injuries but does not address the urgent need to relieve compartment pressure. External fixation (D) and internal fixation (E) are methods of stabilizing fractures but do not address the compartment syndrome directly.

Her symptoms began one week ago, when she had several days of low-grade fever and constipation. She returned from Indonesia 2 weeks ago, where she spent the summer with her grandparents. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°F). Examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness and mild hepatosplenomegaly. There is a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash on her trunk and abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?
A) Giardia lamblia
B) Schistosoma mansoni
C) Campylobacter jejuni
D) Salmonella typhi
E) Clostridium perfringens","To solve this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has fever, chills, abdominal pain, and profuse non-bloody diarrhea. These symptoms suggest a gastrointestinal infection.

2. **Travel History**: She returned from Indonesia 2 weeks ago. Travel to certain regions can increase the risk of specific infections, including those caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.

3. **Progression of Symptoms**: Initially, she had low-grade fever and constipation, which progressed to the current symptoms. This progression indicates an infection that may have started with a prodromal phase.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of diffuse abdominal tenderness, mild hepatosplenomegaly, and a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash on the trunk and abdomen are significant. The rash, in particular, is a distinctive feature that can help narrow down the diagnosis.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Giardia lamblia**: This parasite can cause diarrhea, but it's not typically associated with a rash or hepatosplenomegaly.

- **B) Schistosoma mansoni**: This parasitic infection can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea but is more commonly associated with hematuria or intestinal bleeding, not a rash.

- **C) Campylobacter jejuni**: This bacterium can cause diarrhea and abdominal pain but is not typically associated with a rash or the specific constellation of symptoms described.

- **D) Salmonella typhi**: This bacterium causes typhoid fever, which is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and rash (classically, ""rose spots""). The patient's symptoms, travel history, and the presence of a rash make this a likely diagnosis.

- **E) Clostridium perfringens**: This bacterium can cause food poisoning leading to diarrhea and abdominal cramps but is not typically associated with a rash or the other symptoms described.

Considering the patient's symptoms, travel history, and physical examination findings, the most likely causal organism is Salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid fever.

81,"A post-mortem lung examination of a 68-year-old male overweight male with evidence of chronic lower extremity edema, a 60 pack-year smoking history and daily productive cough would be most likely to reveal:
A) Hypereosinophilia
B) Reid Index > 50%
C) Non-caseating granulomas
D) Evidence of a necrotizing infection
E) Keratin pearls","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's history and how they relate to potential lung findings.

1. **Age and Sex**: The patient is a 68-year-old male, which places him in a demographic where chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other smoking-related lung conditions are more common.

2. **Overweight and Chronic Lower Extremity Edema**: While these factors can contribute to various health issues, they are less directly related to specific lung pathologies mentioned in the options.

3. **60 Pack-Year Smoking History**: This is a significant risk factor for COPD, lung cancer, and other respiratory conditions. The history of smoking is crucial when considering the potential lung findings.

4. **Daily Productive Cough**: This symptom is consistent with chronic bronchitis, a form of COPD characterized by inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes leading to a persistent cough and mucus production.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Hypereosinophilia**: This is more commonly associated with conditions like asthma or parasitic infections, not directly linked to smoking or COPD.

- **B) Reid Index > 50%**: The Reid Index is a measure of the thickness of the mucous gland layer in the bronchus. A Reid Index greater than 50% indicates chronic bronchitis, as it signifies hypertrophy of the mucous glands, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and smoking history.

- **C) Non-caseating granulomas**: These are characteristic of sarcoidosis, a condition not directly linked to the patient's history provided.

- **D) Evidence of a necrotizing infection**: While smoking increases the risk of infections, the patient's history does not specifically suggest a necrotizing infection.

- **E) Keratin pearls**: These are indicative of squamous cell carcinoma, a type of lung cancer. While smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer, the presence of keratin pearls is not directly linked to the symptoms of chronic bronchitis.

Considering the patient's history of smoking and symptoms of a daily productive cough, the most likely finding is related to chronic bronchitis, which is best represented by an increased Reid Index.

Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?
A) Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching
B) Wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound
C) Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis
D) Diastolic murmur preceded by opening snap
E) Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. **Symptoms**: The 3-year-old girl experiences sweating and respiratory distress while eating. These symptoms can indicate an increase in metabolic demand that her cardiovascular system is unable to meet adequately, possibly due to a cardiac defect.

2. **Physical and Developmental Status**: She is at the 30th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight, indicating that she might be underweight or have a failure to thrive, which can be associated with chronic conditions such as untreated or undertreated heart defects.

3. **Echocardiography Findings**: There is a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum, which is indicative of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Additionally, there is a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, suggesting that the heart is not pumping as efficiently as it should.

Given these findings, the most likely physical examination finding related to a VSD is a systolic murmur. The murmur associated with a VSD typically increases with maneuvers that increase left ventricular volume or contractility. One such maneuver is hand clenching, which increases systemic vascular resistance and subsequently increases the volume of blood in the left ventricle, making the murmur louder.

- **Option A** (Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching) is the correct answer because this is a characteristic physical examination finding in patients with a VSD.
- **Option B** (Wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound) is more characteristic of an atrial septal defect (ASD).
- **Option C** (Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis) describes a maneuver that would typically decrease venous return and thus is not directly related to the findings expected with a VSD.
- **Option D** (Diastolic murmur preceded by opening snap) is characteristic of mitral stenosis.
- **Option E** (Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound) is characteristic of a patent ductus arteriosus.

235,"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a progressively growing mass in his axilla. During this period, he has had recurrent episodes of low-grade fever lasting for 7 to 10 days, and an 8-kg (18-lb) weight loss. His only medication is a multivitamin. Physical examination shows nontender, right axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. His serum calcium concentration is 15.1 mg/dL and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration is 9 pg/mL. A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?
A) Excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol
B) Increased release of PTH by parathyroid chief cells
C) Induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells
D) Secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes
E) Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a 3-month history of a progressively growing mass in his axilla, recurrent episodes of low-grade fever, and significant weight loss. Physical examination reveals nontender lymphadenopathy in multiple regions.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium concentration) at 15.1 mg/dL, with a low parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration of 9 pg/mL. The lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and the presence of large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei.

3. **Interpretation of Biopsy Findings**: The presence of CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei is characteristic of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are diagnostic of Hodgkin lymphoma. The granuloma formation is consistent with the body's immune response to the tumor.

4. **Hypercalcemia in Malignancy**: Hypercalcemia in the context of malignancy can be caused by several mechanisms, including the production of PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) by tumor cells, which mimics the action of PTH and leads to increased bone resorption and hypercalcemia.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A. Excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol**: This would lead to vitamin D toxicity, causing hypercalcemia, but it does not explain the low PTH levels or the overall clinical context.

- **B. Increased release of PTH by parathyroid chief cells**: This would cause primary hyperparathyroidism, but the PTH level in this patient is low, not high.

- **C. Induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells**: While tumor cells can cause bone resorption, this option does not directly explain the mechanism of hypercalcemia in this case.

- **D. Secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes**: This might be related to the immune response but does not directly explain the hypercalcemia.

- **E. Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells**: This is a common cause of hypercalcemia in malignancy, especially in certain types of lymphoma, and fits with the low PTH level and the presence of a malignancy.

209,"A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for HIV patients. Darunavir has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of DN501?
A) Prevents viral transcription
B) Inhibits viral assembly
C) Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell
D) Inhibits viral entry
E) Prevents T-cell binding","To determine the mechanism of action of DN501, we first need to understand the mechanism of action of darunavir, as DN501 is developed with the same mechanism but fewer side effects. Darunavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. HIV protease inhibitors work by binding to the protease enzyme in HIV, preventing the enzyme from processing viral particles. This prevents the maturation of the virus and, consequently, its ability to infect other cells. The mechanism of action is specifically related to inhibiting viral assembly by preventing the protease enzyme from cutting the viral polyprotein into functional proteins necessary for viral maturation and replication.

Given this information, the mechanism of action of DN501, which is the same as darunavir, would be to inhibit viral assembly by preventing the protease enzyme from processing viral particles.

851,"A 55-year-old construction worker is struck by a high-voltage power line while on duty. According to bystanders, the cable struck him on his right arm, after which the man slumped to the ground with his arms and legs shaking. In the emergency department, the man is alert but in severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks as well as in his right arm where contact with the power line occurred. A 6 cm burn is present on the right arm. His vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be conducted first to evaluate this patient?
A) FAST ultrasound assessment
B) Urine dipstick
C) Urinalysis
D) X-ray of the arm and shoulder
E) EEG","To evaluate the patient who was struck by a high-voltage power line, it's crucial to consider the potential for both external and internal injuries, particularly given the mechanism of injury and the symptoms described. The patient has severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks, which could indicate possible kidney damage due to the electrical current passing through the body. The presence of a burn on the right arm, the point of contact, is an external manifestation of the injury, but internal organs could also be affected due to the path of the electrical current.

Given these considerations, the diagnostic test that should be conducted first is one that can quickly and effectively assess for potential internal injuries, particularly to the kidneys, given the flank pain. Among the options provided, a urinalysis (option C) would be the most appropriate initial test. This is because it can provide immediate information about possible kidney damage or the presence of blood in the urine, which could indicate internal injuries from the electrical shock.

Other options, such as FAST ultrasound assessment (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma), could also be useful in evaluating for free fluid in the abdomen, indicative of internal bleeding, but given the specific complaint of flank pain, urinalysis is a more direct and non-invasive first step. Urine dipstick could provide some information but is less comprehensive than a full urinalysis. An X-ray of the arm and shoulder might be necessary to evaluate the burn and potential bone injuries but does not address the potential internal injuries suggested by the flank pain. An EEG (electroencephalogram) would be more relevant if there were concerns about seizures or neurological damage not immediately apparent from the description.

B) Direct influenza antigen
C) Uretheral swab and culture
D) Viral core antibody
E) Viral surface antibody","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings. The patient is a 27-year-old college student with symptoms of constant fatigue, occasional nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. These symptoms are non-specific but can be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infections, metabolic disorders, or substance abuse issues.

The patient's social history is notable for regular alcohol use, smoking marijuana, and unprotected sex with multiple partners. This history raises the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), substance abuse-related health issues, and potentially, viral hepatitis given the liver enzyme elevation (AST: 85 U/L, ALT: 92 U/L).

The laboratory values show mild elevations in liver enzymes, which could be consistent with viral hepatitis, alcohol use, or other liver injuries. The presence of marijuana, amphetamines, and cocaine in the urine suggests significant substance use, which could contribute to the patient's symptoms and liver enzyme elevations.

Given the patient's refusal for a genital examination, which would be crucial for diagnosing STIs, and considering the liver enzyme elevations, the focus should shift towards diagnosing potential causes of liver injury that are not necessarily related to a physical examination. The patient's risk factors for viral hepatitis (elevated liver enzymes and risky behaviors) make testing for hepatitis viruses a reasonable step.

Among the options provided:

A) CAGE questions are used to assess a patient's dependency on alcohol, which might be relevant but does not directly address the elevated liver enzymes or the potential for viral hepatitis.

B) Direct influenza antigen testing is not indicated based on the patient's presentation.

C) Urethral swab and culture would be appropriate for diagnosing STIs but is not feasible given the patient's refusal for a genital examination.

D) Viral core antibody testing is used to diagnose viral hepatitis infections, specifically to identify individuals who have been infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). This test can distinguish between acute and chronic infections.

E) Viral surface antibody testing is also used in the diagnosis of viral hepatitis but is more specific to detecting immunity to HBV.

Given the patient's presentation, risk factors, and the need to diagnose potential liver injury causes without relying on a physical examination, testing for viral hepatitis infections is the most appropriate step. Since the patient's status regarding hepatitis immunity or infection is unknown, and considering the need to identify either acute or chronic infection, testing for viral core antibodies is a comprehensive approach to diagnosing hepatitis B or C infections.

777,"A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?
A) 25/250
B) 250/25
C) 190/250
D) 165/250
E) 355/500","To calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), we first need to understand what NNT is. NNT is the average number of patients who need to be treated with a particular intervention (in this case, drug A) to prevent one additional bad outcome (in this case, not being cured of tinea versicolor) when compared to the control group (receiving the standard antifungal therapy).

The formula to calculate NNT from the given data involves finding the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference in the proportion of participants who were cured in the treatment group and the control group.

First, let's calculate the proportion of participants cured in each group:

- Proportion cured in the treatment group (drug A) = Number cured in treatment group / Total in treatment group = 190 / 250
- Proportion cured in the control group (standard therapy) = Number cured in control group / Total in control group = 165 / 250

Then, we find the ARR:

ARR = Proportion cured in treatment group - Proportion cured in control group

However, since we are looking for the NNT, which involves the inverse of the ARR, and given the choices provided, we can simplify our approach by recognizing that the NNT is essentially asking how many more participants need to be treated with drug A compared to the standard therapy to achieve one more cure.

The correct formula for NNT based on the given choices is the inverse of the difference in proportions of those cured, but since the actual proportions and their differences aren't directly provided in the choices, we recognize that the NNT is essentially about comparing the effectiveness of the two treatments.

Given the choices, the calculation that best represents the concept of NNT, considering we need to compare the effectiveness of drug A over the standard therapy, involves looking at the difference in outcomes (cures) between the two groups and understanding that NNT is about how many need to be treated to see a difference. However, the direct calculation of NNT from the provided options isn't straightforward without calculating the ARR and then taking its inverse.

The closest representation of the concept we're looking for, based on the provided options and understanding that we're simplifying the explanation, would involve comparing the outcomes (cures) directly, but none of the options directly calculate the NNT as traditionally defined (1/ARR). However, considering the traditional definition of NNT and how it's calculated, none of the provided choices directly match the formula for NNT, which would be the inverse of the difference in cure rates between the two groups.

Given the traditional formula for NNT is NNT = 1 / ARR, and ARR being the difference in proportions of those cured, the correct approach would involve more detailed calculations not directly listed among the choices provided.

However, if we were to follow the logic of comparing effectiveness and simplifying the explanation without direct calculation of ARR and its inverse:

714,"A 16-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room with acute vomiting and abdominal pain that began earlier today. His parents say that the boy was doing well until two days ago when he told them that he was feeling unwell. He has diabetes and takes insulin but stopped taking it when he began to feel poorly two days ago. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are shallow and rapid with a rate of 33/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 101/68 mm Hg. He appears severely dehydrated, showing signs of fatigue, and poor skin turgor. His breath has a fruity smell to it. His blood glucose level is 691 mg/dL. Blood is drawn for labs and the results are given below:
Serum:  
  pH: 7.21
  pCO2: 32 mm HG
  HCO 3-: 15.2 mEq/L
Sodium: 122 mEq/L
Potassium: 5.8 mEq/L
Urinalysis is positive for ketone bodies. What is the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient?
A) Administer IV fluids and insulin
B) Administer IV antibiotics
C) Administer IV fluids with oral antidiabetic medications
D) Administer IV bicarbonate
E) Administer potassium and magnesium","The patient is a 16-year-old boy with diabetes who stopped taking insulin two days ago, leading to severe dehydration, acute vomiting, abdominal pain, and a fruity smell on his breath, which is indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). His blood glucose level is significantly elevated at 691 mg/dL, and the presence of ketone bodies in the urine confirms the diagnosis of DKA. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are signs of severe dehydration and acidosis.

The laboratory results reveal severe metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.21, decreased bicarbonate levels, and an elevated anion gap. The patient's sodium level is low, and the potassium level is elevated, which is a common finding in DKA due to the acidosis and dehydration.

The immediate management of DKA involves correcting the dehydration, hyperglycemia, and acidosis. Administering IV fluids is crucial to correct dehydration and improve blood pressure. Insulin therapy is also essential to lower blood glucose levels and suppress ketone production.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient is to administer IV fluids and insulin. This will help correct dehydration, lower blood glucose levels, and improve acidosis.

1202,"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent fatigue for the past 4 months. She has no history of major medical illness. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 121/min, and blood pressure is 120/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. A peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A) Hereditary spherocytosis
B) Vitamin B12 deficiency
C) Pyruvate kinase deficiency
D) Iron deficiency
E) β-thalassemia minor","To approach this question, let's analyze the key details provided:

1. **Persistent fatigue for the past 4 months**: This is a non-specific symptom but can be associated with a variety of conditions, including anemia, due to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues.

2. **No history of major medical illness**: This suggests that the cause of her fatigue might not be related to a chronic disease or a known inherited condition.

3. **Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae**: This finding is suggestive of anemia, as it indicates a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin.

4. **Peripheral blood smear is mentioned but not described**: While the details of the blood smear are not provided, the fact that it is mentioned implies that it might show abnormalities consistent with certain types of anemia.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Hereditary spherocytosis**: This is a genetic disorder affecting the red blood cell membrane, leading to early destruction of red blood cells. It typically presents in childhood, which doesn't fit well with a new onset of symptoms in a 24-year-old.

- **B) Vitamin B12 deficiency**: This can cause anemia due to impaired DNA synthesis affecting red blood cell production. However, it often presents with neurological symptoms as well, which are not mentioned here.

- **C) Pyruvate kinase deficiency**: This is a rare genetic disorder affecting glycolysis in red blood cells, leading to hemolytic anemia. It usually presents in childhood.

- **D) Iron deficiency**: This is the most common cause of anemia worldwide, especially in women of childbearing age due to menstrual blood loss. It would cause fatigue, pale conjunctivae, and could be diagnosed with a blood smear showing microcytic, hypochromic anemia.

- **E) β-thalassemia minor**: This is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin synthesis, leading to microcytic anemia. However, it typically presents in childhood, and the severity of symptoms might not match the presentation described.

Considering the age of the patient, the absence of a known medical history, and the symptoms presented, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is iron deficiency anemia, which is common in young women due to menstrual blood loss and would explain the fatigue and pale conjunctivae.

73,"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?
A) Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen
B) Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen
C) Liver transplantation
D) Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone
E) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting","Analyzing the situation, the 56-year-old man presents with worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, abdominal pain, and episodes of diarrhea, on a background of alcohol use disorder with multiple hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis, and occasional intravenous heroin use. His physical examination and laboratory findings are consistent with decompensated cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), for which he is receiving intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. However, on hospital day 2, he develops oliguria despite constant fluid intake, with a rising creatinine level from 0.9 mg/dL to 1.8 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). The low urine sodium level without evidence of blood or protein suggests a prerenal cause of AKI, likely due to decreased renal perfusion in the setting of cirrhosis and SBP.

Given the patient's decompensated cirrhosis and AKI, the best treatment option would be to address the underlying cause of his renal dysfunction, which is likely related to his cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Among the options provided, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is a procedure that can help alleviate portal hypertension and improve renal perfusion, thereby addressing the prerenal cause of his AKI.

The mass is biopsied and cytology results are diagnostic for invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. The patient is started on chemotherapy and ultimately has the mass resected. She is taking tamoxifen and has regular outpatient follow up appointments to monitor for any recurrence of cancer. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, obesity, and a uterine leimyoma which was definitively treated last year. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 47. The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?
A) Deep venous thrombosis
B) Endometrial cancer
C) Eruption of seborrheic keratoses
D) Increased bleeding
E) Osteoporosis","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive, for which she is being treated with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue but can have estrogen agonist effects in other tissues, such as the uterus and bones. Given this, one of the potential complications of tamoxifen therapy is an increased risk of endometrial cancer due to its estrogen-like effects on the uterus. This risk is particularly relevant in postmenopausal women. The patient's history of a uterine leiomyoma, which was definitively treated, does not directly influence this risk but highlights the importance of monitoring for uterine abnormalities in patients on tamoxifen.

556,"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Agree to his wish for no further treatment
B) Begin paroxetine therapy
C) Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents
D) Reassure the patient that he will feel better
E) Start outpatient psychotherapy","The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has been experiencing loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks, which are indicative of depressive symptoms. His recent dismissal from the school football team and subsequent avoidance of family and friends suggest a possible trigger for his current state. The mental status examination reveals a constricted affect, and he expresses suicidal ideation, stating that he would be better off dead and intends to use his father's firearm to end his life. This is a critical situation that requires immediate intervention to ensure the patient's safety.

Given the patient's suicidal ideation and refusal to be treated, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure his safety and prevent harm to himself. This cannot be achieved through outpatient treatment or by simply reassuring him that he will feel better. The patient's statement about intending to use his father's firearm to end his life over the weekend when his parents are at church indicates a clear and present danger to himself.

Involuntary hospitalization is necessary to protect the patient from harming himself and to provide a safe environment for further evaluation and treatment. This decision should be made after informing the parents, as they need to be aware of the situation and the steps being taken to ensure their child's safety.

401,"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and painful swelling of her right knee for 3 weeks. She works as a professional ballet dancer and says, “I'm always trying to be in shape for my upcoming performances.” She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m2. Physical examination shows tenderness and limited range of motion in her right knee. Oral examination shows bleeding and swelling of the gums. There are diffuse petechiae around hair follicles on her abdomen and both thighs. Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient’s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?
A) Lysosomes
B) Rough endoplasmic reticulum
C) Nucleus
D) Extracellular space
E) Free ribosomes","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the clues from the physical examination and laboratory findings.

1. **Progressive fatigue and painful swelling of her right knee**: These symptoms could be indicative of a variety of conditions, but the presence of bloody synovial fluid upon arthrocentesis strongly suggests a hemorrhagic component.

2. **Bleeding and swelling of the gums, diffuse petechiae around hair follicles**: These findings further support a bleeding disorder. Petechiae, in particular, are characteristic of platelet disorders or coagulopathy.

3. **Prolonged bleeding time with normal prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)**: The prolonged bleeding time with normal PT and aPTT points towards a problem with platelet function rather than a coagulation factor deficiency.

4. **The patient's profession as a ballet dancer and her low BMI**: While these factors might contribute to her overall health status, they are less directly related to the specific symptoms of a bleeding disorder.

Given these clues, the most likely condition is a qualitative platelet disorder. The mention of a defect in a reaction and the focus on cellular structures suggest we are looking for where the dysfunction leading to this disorder would occur.

- **Lysosomes (A)** are involved in cellular digestion and recycling but are not directly implicated in platelet function related to bleeding disorders.
- **Rough endoplasmic reticulum (B)** is crucial for protein synthesis, including those involved in coagulation, but the normal PT and aPTT suggest that coagulation factors are not the issue here.
- **Nucleus (C)** is involved in DNA replication and transcription but is not directly related to the acute function of platelets in coagulation.
- **Extracellular space (D)** is where platelets interact with coagulation factors, but the dysfunction leading to this disorder would originate within the cell.
- **Free ribosomes (E)** are involved in protein synthesis, including those proteins necessary for platelet function. Platelet disorders such as thrombocytopenia or qualitative platelet defects could arise from defects in proteins synthesized here.

Considering the information provided and focusing on a qualitative platelet disorder, the defect would most likely be associated with a reaction occurring in the **free ribosomes**, where proteins essential for proper platelet function are synthesized.

3,"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg.

A) Renal papillary necrosis
B) Allergic interstitial nephritis
C) Cholesterol embolization
D) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
E) Polyarteritis nodosa","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an emergency cardiac catheterization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris two weeks prior. He now presents with decreased urinary output and malaise, which are indicative of renal dysfunction. Additionally, he has a fever (38°C or 100.4°F), an elevated pulse (93/min), and a mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, which suggests a systemic process possibly involving emboli or vasculitis.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has an elevated leukocyte count (16,400/mm^3) with a predominance of segmented neutrophils, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (68 mm/h), and significantly elevated serum urea nitrogen (25 mg/dL) and creatinine (4.2 mg/dL) levels, indicating acute kidney injury. The renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles.

3. **Medications and Past Medical History**: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips, for which he was taking insulin and naproxen. After the coronary intervention, he was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol.

Given these details, let's consider the possible causes:

- **Renal Papillary Necrosis (A)**: This condition is associated with analgesic abuse, diabetes, and sickle cell disease. While the patient has diabetes, the presentation and biopsy findings do not specifically suggest papillary necrosis.

- **Allergic Interstitial Nephritis (B)**: This condition is often associated with drug reactions, but the biopsy findings of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles do not support this diagnosis.

- **Cholesterol Embolization (C)**: This condition can occur after vascular procedures like cardiac catheterization, especially in patients with atherosclerotic disease. The presence of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles in the renal biopsy is consistent with cholesterol crystals, which are characteristic of this condition.

- **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (D)** and **Polyarteritis Nodosa (E)**: Both are forms of vasculitis, but the clinical presentation and biopsy findings do not align closely with these conditions.

Considering the recent vascular intervention and the specific renal biopsy findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cholesterol embolization.

1064,"A 54-year-old woman presents with sudden onset, mild vaginal bleeding for the past day. She says she is postmenopausal, and her last menstrual period was 5 years ago. A detailed workup is performed, and several premalignant lesions are found in her uterus. The patient agrees to a hysterectomy. The surgical team decides to use an anesthesia protocol consisting of nitrous oxide, desflurane, and atracurium. Which of the following best describes the role of atracurium in this patient’s anesthesia?
A) It reduces neuron and muscle tissue excitability
B) It increases GABA linked chloride channel opening
C) It acts on the pain centers in the spinal cord and brain
D) It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction
E) It persistently depolarizes the cholinergic receptors on the motor end plate","To understand the role of atracurium in the patient's anesthesia protocol, let's examine the properties and mechanisms of action for each of the options provided in relation to atracurium.

Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent. It is used in anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.

A) Reducing neuron and muscle tissue excitability is more characteristic of anesthetics that act on the central nervous system rather than a specific action of atracurium.

B) Increasing GABA linked chloride channel opening is a mechanism of action for certain anesthetics and sedatives, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, but not specifically for atracurium.

C) Acting on the pain centers in the spinal cord and brain describes the action of analgesics, not the primary role of atracurium.

D) Competing with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction is the correct mechanism of action for atracurium. As a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, atracurium works by competitively inhibiting the action of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptors on the neuromuscular junction. This prevents acetylcholine from triggering muscle contraction, thereby causing muscle relaxation.

E) Persistently depolarizing the cholinergic receptors on the motor end plate describes the action of depolarizing neuromuscular blockers, such as succinylcholine, not atracurium.

A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?
A) Cyclosporine
B) Infliximab
C) Anakinra
D) Methotrexate
E) High-dose prednisone for 60 days","The patient presents with worsening pain in multiple joints, particularly in the proximal parts of his fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees, with symmetric joint involvement. He also experiences morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. These symptoms are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the joints.

Given the patient's diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels, it is essential to consider the potential impact of RA treatment on his diabetes management.

Among the options provided, methotrexate is a commonly used first-line medication for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that has been shown to slow disease progression and improve symptoms in patients with RA. Methotrexate is also relatively safe and well-tolerated, especially when compared to other treatment options.

Cyclosporine is typically used in combination with other medications for RA treatment and is not usually considered a first-line option. Infliximab is a biologic DMARD that is often used in patients who have not responded to methotrexate or other conventional DMARDs. Anakinra is another biologic DMARD that is used in patients with RA, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment. High-dose prednisone for 60 days is not a recommended treatment strategy for RA, as long-term use of high-dose corticosteroids can lead to significant side effects.

Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, methotrexate is the most likely first-line medication for this patient.

1034,"A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after losing consciousness at work. On presentation, she is found to be somnolent though she is able to be woken by vocal stimuli. She says that over the last 12 hours, she has been experiencing muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, and hallucinations. She says that the symptoms started after she went on a hike in the woods and foraged from plants along the way. Physical exam reveals dry red skin and enlarged pupils. Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?
A) Atropine
B) Physostigmine
C) Pralidoxime
D) Pyridostigmine
E) Neostigmine","The patient presents with symptoms such as muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, and enlarged pupils, along with an inability to urinate despite a full bladder. These symptoms are indicative of anticholinergic toxicity, which can occur from ingestion of certain plants that contain anticholinergic compounds. Given the context of foraging for plants in the woods, it is likely that the patient ingested such a plant, leading to the observed symptoms.

The treatment for anticholinergic toxicity involves administering a medication that can counteract the effects of the anticholinergic compounds. Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can cross the blood-brain barrier and is used specifically for treating severe anticholinergic toxicity, especially when there are significant central nervous system symptoms, as seen in this patient.

Atropine is an anticholinergic agent itself and would worsen the symptoms. Pralidoxime is used to treat organophosphate poisoning, not anticholinergic toxicity. Pyridostigmine and Neostigmine are cholinesterase inhibitors but are primarily used for treating myasthenia gravis and do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, making them less effective for treating central anticholinergic toxicity.

Therefore, the most appropriate drug to administer to this patient to treat her symptoms is Physostigmine.

9,"A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?
A) A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism
B) Current tobacco use
C) Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
D) Past medical history of breast cancer
E) Known liver neoplasm","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the placement of a copper IUD:

A) A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism - This condition is more relevant to the use of hormonal contraceptives, such as combined oral contraceptives, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Copper IUDs do not contain hormones and thus do not pose the same risk.

B) Current tobacco use - While smoking can have various health implications, it is not a direct contraindication for the placement of a copper IUD.

C) Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) - This is a significant consideration. The placement of an IUD in a woman with active or recurrent PID could exacerbate the infection, leading to serious health consequences, including infertility and chronic pelvic pain. The insertion of an IUD requires a healthy, infection-free environment to avoid complicating existing conditions.

D) Past medical history of breast cancer - A history of breast cancer might influence the choice of hormonal contraceptives but does not directly contraindicate the use of a copper IUD, which is hormone-free.

E) Known liver neoplasm - This condition would be more relevant to the use of hormonal contraceptives that could potentially affect liver function or exacerbate conditions like liver tumors. The copper IUD does not involve hormones and thus is not contraindicated in this scenario.

Considering the options, the most relevant contraindication for the placement of a copper IUD is related to the presence of active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), as it poses a risk of exacerbating the infection.

154,"A 71-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine visit. His psychiatric history is significant for major depression with psychotic features. He was diagnosed after his wife died from pancreatic cancer four years earlier. Three years ago, he deliberately overdosed on sleeping pills. Today, he feels well but still wakes up frequently at night and cannot sleep through the night. He lives alone in his apartment and has no children. He does not possess a firearm at home but has access to weapons at a local hunting club. The patient currently denies suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm. He takes sertraline and olanzapine. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient?
A) Previous suicide attempt
B) History of psychosis
C) Access to firearms
D) Sleeping disorder
E) Age
""","To assess the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient, let's consider each option provided:

A) Previous suicide attempt: A history of a previous suicide attempt is a significant risk factor for future attempts. This patient deliberately overdosed on sleeping pills three years ago, which indicates a past attempt.

B) History of psychosis: While a history of psychosis can increase the risk of suicide, especially in the context of major depression with psychotic features, it is not as direct a risk factor as a previous attempt.

C) Access to firearms: Access to lethal means, such as firearms, increases the risk of a successful suicide attempt. However, the patient does not possess a firearm at home, though he has access to them at a local hunting club.

D) Sleeping disorder: Sleep disturbances can be a symptom of depression and other psychiatric conditions, but they are not as strong a predictor of suicide risk as other factors listed here.

E) Age: Age can be a factor in suicide risk, with older adults being at higher risk. However, this patient's age, while relevant, is not as specific a risk factor as his history of a suicide attempt.

Considering these factors, the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient is his previous suicide attempt. This history indicates a past willingness to act on suicidal thoughts, which is a critical predictor of future risk.

361,"A 6-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a wellness examination. The mother reports that her child has difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported. The patient is able to smile and furrow his brow normally, but she has noticed that he has a weak cry and suck. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared ""normal"" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A) Anterior horn cell degeneration
B) Axonal demyelination
C) Decreased acetylcholine receptor density
D) Impaired acetylcholine release
E) Myonecrosis","Analyzing the 6-month-old boy's symptoms, we can observe that he has difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported, indicating weakness in his muscles. The patient's ability to smile and furrow his brow normally suggests that the cranial nerves are intact. However, the weak cry and suck imply involvement of the bulbar muscles. The physical exam findings of symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, a bell-shaped chest, and diminished deep tendon reflexes point towards a neuromuscular disorder. Considering the age of onset and the specific symptoms, the most likely cause is a genetic disorder affecting the motor neurons. Among the options provided, the condition that best fits this description is anterior horn cell degeneration, which is characteristic of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). SMA is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, leading to degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and resulting in muscle weakness and wasting.

741,"A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes insulin. He complains of frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep. When he wakes up, he feels excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. His morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurement. Which of the following is the optimal intervention for this patient condition?
A) Reassurance
B) Adding diazepam
C) Adding pramlintide
D) Increasing daily insulin dose
E) Reducing daily insulin dose","The patient is a 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus who is experiencing frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep with symptoms such as excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. These symptoms are consistent with nocturnal hypoglycemia, a condition where blood glucose levels drop too low during sleep. However, his morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurement, which may seem contradictory.

The key to understanding this scenario is recognizing that the body's response to hypoglycemia involves the release of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can cause the liver to release stored glucose (glycogen) into the bloodstream. This can lead to a rebound effect, where the blood glucose levels rise after the initial hypoglycemic episode, resulting in high morning blood glucose readings.

Given this understanding, the optimal intervention for this patient's condition would be to adjust his insulin regimen to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. Since the patient is waking up with symptoms of hypoglycemia, it suggests that his insulin dose may be too high, causing his blood glucose levels to drop too low during the night.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to reduce his daily insulin dose to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and the subsequent rebound hyperglycemia.

1175,"A 40-year-old woman presents to her family physician with a 3-week history of swollen neck. The small, round, and painless swelling, which was detected 3 weeks ago in the middle of her neck, has now increased in size. The swelling is associated with sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue; however, the patient does not complain of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The patient’s medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder. The vital signs are within normal limits. Local examination reveals a 3 x 3 cm round, non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck. The patient carries a total white blood cell count of 10,200/mm3, including 70% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and zero eosinophils.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/hr (normal, 0–29 mm/hr). What is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Graves' disease
B) De Quervain’s thyroiditis
C) Silent thyroiditis
D) Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
E) Riedel's thyroiditis","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Swollen neck**: The swelling is described as small, round, painless, and located in the middle of the neck, which has increased in size over 3 weeks. This is suggestive of a thyroid-related issue given its location.

2. **Associated symptoms**: The patient reports symptoms such as sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue. These symptoms are classic for hyperthyroidism, a condition where there is an overproduction of thyroid hormones.

3. **Absence of certain symptoms**: The patient does not have fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The absence of these symptoms helps to rule out certain conditions such as thyroiditis (which often presents with pain and fever) and Graves' orbitopathy (which would cause vision problems).

4. **Medical history**: Negative for similar symptoms or thyroid disorder, which means this is a new onset condition.

5. **Vital signs and examination findings**: The swelling is described as non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile, which is consistent with a thyroid gland enlargement (goiter).

6. **Laboratory findings**: The white blood cell count is slightly elevated but not indicative of an acute infection. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is within normal limits, which further supports a non-inflammatory cause.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that causes hyperthyroidism and thyroid gland enlargement without significant inflammation or infection. Among the options provided:

- **Graves' disease** is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, characterized by a diffuse goiter and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which matches the patient's presentation.
- De Quervain’s thyroiditis and silent thyroiditis are forms of thyroiditis that could cause thyroid swelling but are typically associated with pain and/or an elevated ESR.
- Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition leading to hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.
- Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare form of thyroiditis characterized by a hard, fibrotic thyroid gland, which does not match the description provided.
