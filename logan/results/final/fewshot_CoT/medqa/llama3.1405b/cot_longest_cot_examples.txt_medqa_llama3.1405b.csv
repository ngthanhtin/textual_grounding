""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

A) It indicates an increased likelihood of bias
B) It indicates decreased external validity
C) It indicates a lack of statistical significance
D) It reflects a smaller sample size
E) It indicates more narrow confidence intervals","To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the abstract and the table.

The medical student notices that the standard error (SE) surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. This observation is crucial in understanding the reliability and precision of the estimates provided in the study.

Standard error is a measure of the variability or dispersion of a set of values. A higher standard error indicates that the values are more spread out, which can affect the precision of the estimates. Several factors can contribute to a higher standard error, including a smaller sample size, increased variability in the data, or both.

Looking at the table, we can see that the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group has a significantly smaller number of participants (202) compared to the pulmharkimab 75 mg/day group (388) and the placebo group (395). This difference in sample size is likely the primary reason for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group.

A smaller sample size tends to result in less precise estimates, as there is less data available to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This reduced precision is reflected in the wider confidence intervals (i.e., the ± 2 SE range) for the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group.

Considering the options provided:

A) It indicates an increased likelihood of bias - This is not directly related to the increased standard error.

B) It indicates decreased external validity - External validity refers to the generalizability of the study findings to the broader population. While a smaller sample size might affect external validity, it is not the most direct explanation for the increased standard error.

C) It indicates a lack of statistical significance - The p-values in the table indicate that some of the results are statistically significant, so this option is not the best explanation.

D) It reflects a smaller sample size - This is the most plausible explanation, as a smaller sample size tends to result in higher standard errors due to reduced precision.

E) It indicates more narrow confidence intervals - This is the opposite of what is observed, as the confidence intervals for the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group are actually wider due to the increased standard error.

A) Pearson correlation analysis
B) Chi-square test
C) Analysis of variance
D) Meta-analysis
E) Kaplan-Meier analysis","To determine if the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up are statistically significant, the cardiologist needs to compare the means of these measurements across the different groups (pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, and placebo). 

The most appropriate statistical method for this purpose is the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is used to compare means among three or more groups to determine if at least one group mean is different from the others. This method is suitable for the given data because the outcome variables are approximately normally distributed, and the comparison involves more than two groups.

The other options are not suitable for the following reasons:
- Pearson correlation analysis is used to measure the linear relationship between two continuous variables, which is not the objective here.
- Chi-square test is used for categorical data, not for comparing means of continuous data.
- Meta-analysis is a statistical method for combining the results of multiple studies, not for analyzing data from a single study.
- Kaplan-Meier analysis is used for survival analysis, which is not relevant to the given data.

1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.","To answer this question, let's first define what a type 1 error is. A type 1 error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. This is also known as a ""false positive"" finding. In the context of the study described, a type 1 error would mean that the authors concluded that mepolizumab significantly reduced asthma exacerbations when, in fact, it did not.

Now, let's examine the options provided:

A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups. - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is not related to the power of a study, but rather to the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis.

B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. - This statement is correct. A type 1 error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected.

C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. - This statement is incorrect. This describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is an alpha (α) error, not a beta (β) error. Beta errors are related to type 2 errors.

E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study. - This statement is incorrect. While confidence intervals can provide information about the precision of an estimate, a type 1 error is not directly dependent on the confidence interval.

906,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
A) Measurement bias
B) Recall bias
C) Lead-time bias
D) Selection bias
E) Length-time bias","To answer this question, let's break down the concept presented in the conclusion and relate it to the types of biases provided in the options.

The conclusion suggests that initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations. However, the question posits that if the conclusion about the benefits of ultrasonography (in terms of lower radiation exposure without compromising outcomes) was due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, this would introduce a specific type of bias.

The key concept here is ""earlier detection."" When a screening or diagnostic method allows for the earlier detection of a condition, it can make it seem like there is an improvement in outcomes or survival rates, even if the actual outcome or the natural history of the disease has not changed. This is precisely what lead-time bias addresses.

Lead-time bias occurs when results make a disease seem to have a longer survival or increased lifespan after diagnosis, but this apparent improvement is not due to the actual effectiveness of early detection or treatments but rather the earlier time of diagnosis. This bias is particularly relevant in screening studies where the earlier detection of a disease does not necessarily translate to improved outcomes but can make it seem like there is a benefit.

Given this explanation, the type of bias that would be exemplified if the conclusion about the benefits of point-of-care ultrasound was due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis is lead-time bias.

1172,"A 67-year-old man is brought to the hospital by his relatives. He complains of early satiety, abdominal discomfort after food intake, and abdominal bloating. These symptoms have been present since the patient was 52, but they were milder at that time so he paid little attention to them since. Tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities began a few months ago. His relatives also note that he has become excessively somnolent and forgetful. The patient’s medical history is significant for acute hepatitis B 20 years ago. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. His weight is 61 kg (134.5 lb), height is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in), and BMI is 18.6 kg/m2. His vital signs include: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F). The patient’s skin is pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic. Lymph nodes and the thyroid gland are not enlarged. Lung and heart examinations are within normal limits for his age. The patient’s tongue is bright red with atrophic papillae. The abdomen is distended and tender to palpation in the epigastric area. Neurological examination shows symmetrical bilateral distal hypoesthesia for all sensations and decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities. On a mini-mental status examination, the patient scores 25. The patient’s blood test results are as follows:
Erythrocytes 2.8 x 109/mm3

Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?
A) Chronic bilirubin toxicity
B) Chronic hyperglycemia
C) Chronic acetaldehyde influence
D) Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids
E) Influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters","To address the patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms, which include tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities, excessive somnolence, and forgetfulness, we need to consider the underlying causes that could be linked to his medical history and laboratory findings.

The patient has a history of acute hepatitis B 20 years ago, but his current liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and conjugated bilirubin) do not indicate significant liver dysfunction that would explain his neurological symptoms through options like chronic bilirubin toxicity (A).

There's no evidence of chronic hyperglycemia (B) as his fasting plasma glucose and HbA1C levels are within normal limits, ruling out diabetes mellitus as a cause for his neurological symptoms.

The patient drinks alcohol occasionally, but there's no clear indication of chronic alcohol abuse that would lead to chronic acetaldehyde influence (C), which can cause neurological symptoms.

The patient's laboratory findings show a macrocytic anemia (indicated by a high mean corpuscular volume of 142 µm^3) with a low reticulocyte count, suggesting a production problem in the bone marrow rather than a loss or destruction of red blood cells. This type of anemia can be associated with a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, which are crucial for DNA synthesis and the methylation of myelin phospholipids. A deficiency in these vitamins can lead to neurological symptoms such as those described in the patient's case.

Given the information, the most plausible explanation for the patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms is impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids (D), likely due to a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, which is consistent with his macrocytic anemia and neurological presentation.

658,"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm.

Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?
A) Begin aspirin therapy
B) Begin clopidogrel
C) Carotid endarterectomy
D) Begin warfarin and heparin
E) Begin warfarin","Analyzing the situation, the 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations, described as his heart 'racing and pounding', which have increased in frequency over the past 3 weeks. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago. The patient's ECG results are not explicitly described, but given the context of palpitations and the absence of other symptoms such as chest pain, the most likely diagnosis is atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cause of palpitations and a significant risk factor for future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) due to the formation of thrombi in the atria.

Given the patient's history of ischemic stroke and the likely diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs would be anticoagulation therapy. Aspirin therapy (A) and clopidogrel (B) are antiplatelet agents but are not the most effective choices for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Carotid endarterectomy (C) is a surgical procedure to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries and is not directly relevant to this patient's condition. Beginning warfarin and heparin (D) might be considered for acute anticoagulation, but heparin is typically used in the acute setting and not for long-term management. Therefore, the most appropriate long-term anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in this patient with atrial fibrillation would be to begin warfarin (E), aiming for a target INR of 2.0-3.0.

He appears sluggish, with pale and dry skin, decreased skin turgor, and elasticity. There are diminished vesicular sounds and disseminated moist rales at the bases of both lungs, indicating a respiratory infection.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: The complete blood count shows a mild anemia (Hb 12 g/dL), leukocytosis (17,500/mm^3) with a predominance of neutrophils, and a normal platelet count. The sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a pathogen commonly associated with cystic fibrosis lung infections. The sweat test shows an elevated chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L, which is diagnostic for cystic fibrosis.

Given these findings, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. CF leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and traps bacteria, resulting in recurrent respiratory infections, malnutrition, and other complications.

The elevated sweat chloride concentration is a hallmark of CF, and the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture further supports this diagnosis. The clinical presentation of poor weight gain, frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, and respiratory symptoms also aligns with CF.

Considering the options provided:

- **A** refers to alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is a different condition that also affects the lungs but is not indicated by the elevated sweat chloride concentration.
- **B** correctly identifies the abnormal CFTR protein as the cause of cystic fibrosis, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.
- **C** refers to eosinophilic disorders, which are not indicated in this case.
- **D** refers to mitochondrial disorders, which are not suggested by the patient's presentation or laboratory findings.
- **E** refers to primary ciliary dyskinesia, another condition affecting mucociliary clearance, but it does not explain the elevated sweat chloride concentration.

1133,"A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?
A) Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma
B) Dissection of an intracerebral vessel
C) Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses
D) Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm
E) Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles","To determine the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Characteristics of the Headache**: The headache is described as intermittent, throbbing, bilateral, and ""band-like,"" extending to the neck. It is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, which are common features of migraines. The headache worsens with coughing or laughing, which suggests an increase in intracranial pressure during these activities.

2. **Temporal Relationship with Other Symptoms**: The headache started approximately 3 weeks ago, around the same time the patient had a runny nose and a temperature elevation, suggesting a possible link to an acute illness.

3. **Medical History**: The patient has stage 1 arterial hypertension and stable angina pectoris, for which she takes several medications, including aspirin, rosuvastatin, lisinopril, and isosorbide mononitrate. None of these conditions or medications are directly linked to causing new-onset headaches of this nature.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: The physical examination is notable for S2 accentuation heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, which may indicate pulmonary hypertension or another cardiac issue, but there's no direct correlation with the headache. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless, which makes sinusitis less likely as a cause.

5. **Neurological Examination**: The neurological exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms, indicating that the headache is likely not due to a focal neurological lesion or meningeal irritation.

Given these considerations, the most plausible explanation for the patient's headache is related to the dilation of intracerebral arterioles. This could be secondary to the patient's hypertension or possibly related to changes in intracranial pressure. The worsening of the headache with coughing or laughing supports the idea that changes in intracranial pressure may be contributing to the headache.

449,"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 
A) Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound
B) Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months
C) Elective endovascular repair
D) Elective open surgical repair
E) Emergency open surgical repair","To determine the best course of treatment for this patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), we need to consider several factors, including the size of the aneurysm, the patient's symptoms, and his overall health status.

The patient presents with a small, unruptured AAA with a diameter of 4.1 cm. Generally, aneurysms less than 4 cm in diameter are considered small and are monitored with regular ultrasound checks, while those between 4 and 5.5 cm may be considered for repair, especially if the patient is symptomatic or has a high risk of rupture.

Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass, along with the aneurysm size being just above the threshold for small aneurysms, intervention is likely warranted. However, the fact that the aneurysm is unruptured means that emergency surgery is not immediately required.

The patient's history of hypertension, high cholesterol, transient ischemic attacks, smoking, and heavy alcohol use increases his risk for complications and may influence the choice between endovascular and open surgical repair. Endovascular repair is generally considered less invasive and may be preferred for patients with significant comorbidities, while open surgical repair is often recommended for patients who are younger and have fewer health issues.

Considering these factors, the best course of treatment for this patient would likely involve elective repair of the aneurysm to prevent future complications, such as rupture. Given the patient's age and comorbidities, an endovascular approach might be more suitable.

C) Fluconazole
D) Vancomycin and meropenem
E) Valacyclovir","The patient presents with a 4-week history of fatigue and headache that have worsened progressively, along with symptoms of somnolence and short-term memory deficits. The physical examination reveals white patches on the tongue and oral mucosa that can be easily scraped off, which is indicative of oral candidiasis. Laboratory studies show a significantly low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 80/mm3, which is consistent with advanced HIV infection. The patient's HIV test is also positive.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows a leukocyte count of 25/mm3 with 60% lymphocytes, a protein concentration of 52 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 37 mg/dL. The India ink stain reveals organisms with prominent capsules, which is characteristic of Cryptococcus neoformans.

Given the patient's neurological symptoms and the CSF findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be directed against Cryptococcus neoformans, which is a common opportunistic pathogen in HIV-infected individuals.

The recommended treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is a combination of Amphotericin B and flucytosine. Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal that is effective against a wide range of fungal pathogens, including Cryptococcus neoformans. Flucytosine is a nucleoside analog that is converted to 5-fluorouracil within fungal cells, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's neurological symptoms is a combination of Amphotericin B and flucytosine.

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?
A) Yeasts metabolize glucogenic amino acids which are filtered in the urine into glucose
B) There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules
C) Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules
D) There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules
E) Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate","To address this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 61-year-old man with symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss, which are classic symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. His family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus further supports this diagnosis.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The findings of dry skin, a pustular rash, an accentuated second heart sound, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity in both feet are consistent with complications of diabetes mellitus. The fundoscopic examination showing microaneurysms is indicative of diabetic retinopathy.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: The HbA1c of 9% indicates poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The urinalysis shows glucosuria (glucose in the urine), which is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus due to the body's inability to properly absorb glucose from the bloodstream, leading to its excretion in the urine.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options regarding the cause of glucosuria:

- **A) Yeasts metabolize glucogenic amino acids which are filtered in the urine into glucose**: This option is not directly relevant to the primary cause of glucosuria in diabetes mellitus.

- **B) There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules**: While diabetes does affect the kidneys, the primary issue is not with the primary active transport of glucose.

- **C) Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules**: This option is accurate. In diabetes mellitus, the high blood glucose levels exceed the capacity of the secondary active transporters (like SGLT2) in the renal tubules to reabsorb glucose. As a result, glucose spills into the urine.

- **D) There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules**: The primary issue in diabetes-related glucosuria is not with passive transport.

- **E) Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate**: While diabetes can affect the glomerular filtration rate, this is not the direct cause of glucosuria in this context.

549,"A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm × 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?
A) Stop antiretroviral therapy and continue antitubercular therapy
B) Change antiretroviral therapy to darunavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine
C) Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin
D) Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-ethambutol-streptomycin
E) Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change","The patient, a 24-year-old man with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV-1 infection, was started on a 4-drug antitubercular regimen and later initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) after showing significant improvement. However, he presented with fever, increased cough, generalized lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy 3 weeks after starting ART. Notably, his CD4+ T cell count increased, and HIV RNA decreased, indicating an immune response to ART. The negative sputum smear and the timing of the symptoms in relation to the initiation of ART suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) rather than a treatment failure or a new infection.

Given this context, the most appropriate initial step in treatment would be to manage the symptoms of IRIS without discontinuing the effective ART or antitubercular therapy. Changing or stopping these therapies could compromise the patient's virological and immunological progress. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids might be considered to manage the inflammatory symptoms of IRIS, but these options are not listed. However, among the provided options, the best course of action is to continue both therapies without change, as altering them could lead to more harm than benefit.

304,"A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Hypothalamic amenorrhea
B) Hyperprolactinemia
C) Imperforate hymen
D) Vaginal septum
E) Normal development","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings:

1. **Age and Primary Amenorrhea**: The patient is 16 years old and has never had a menstrual period, which is considered primary amenorrhea.
2. **Physical Development**: She has normal breast development (Tanner IV) and normal pubic and axillary hair growth (Tanner IV), indicating that she has undergone a normal pubertal development in terms of secondary sexual characteristics.
3. **Growth Spurt and Breast Development**: These occurred at age 13, which is within the normal range for pubertal development.
4. **Headaches with Photosensitivity and Nausea**: These symptoms could suggest migraines, which are common in the patient's family history.
5. **Laboratory Findings**: Normal electrolytes, urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, AST, and ALT. The FSH and estrogen levels are within the normal range for a female in the follicular phase of her menstrual cycle.
6. **Abdominal Ultrasound**: Shows a normal uterus and ovaries, ruling out anatomical abnormalities that could cause primary amenorrhea.

Given these points, the patient's normal pubertal development, absence of anatomical abnormalities on ultrasound, and normal FSH and estrogen levels suggest that the cause of her primary amenorrhea is not due to a major hormonal imbalance or anatomical defect. The most likely diagnosis in this scenario, considering her competitive ice skating background which might indicate intense physical activity, is **hypothalamic amenorrhea**. However, the patient's normal body mass index (BMI) and the absence of specific indicators of nutritional deficiencies or excessive exercise-induced hormonal disturbances make this diagnosis less clear-cut based solely on the information provided.

Despite these considerations, among the options given, **hypothalamic amenorrhea** (caused by intense exercise, stress, or nutritional factors affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis) is still the most plausible explanation for her condition, given the absence of other clear causes.

C) The patient has a pyretic reaction due to bacterial contamination of the pills.
D) The patient’s condition is due to a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction triggered by the drug.
E) The drug has stimulated the hypothalamic temperature center to produce hyperthermia.","To determine the pathogenesis of this patient's condition, let's analyze the symptoms and laboratory findings presented.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient experiences fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, profuse sweating, and a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months. These symptoms appeared suddenly after taking 2 foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has a reddish maculopapular rash over the trunk, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in the abdomen, rotational bilateral nystagmus, and bilateral cataracts.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient's total blood count shows a slightly low total leukocyte count but no other significant abnormalities.

Given the sudden onset of symptoms after taking the fat-burning pills, it's clear that the condition is related to the consumption of these pills. The symptoms and findings suggest a systemic reaction that could be related to a metabolic or toxic effect of the drug.

**Analysis of Options**:

- **A**: Increased concentration of epinephrine could cause some of the symptoms like tachypnea and sweating but does not fully explain the range of symptoms, especially the visual disturbances and nystagmus.

- **B**: Uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation could lead to a significant increase in heat production at the cellular level, explaining the hyperthermia. This mechanism is consistent with the use of certain drugs that affect mitochondrial function, leading to increased heat production and potentially causing the other systemic symptoms.

- **C**: A pyretic reaction due to bacterial contamination would likely present with more typical signs of infection and might not explain the full range of systemic symptoms, especially the visual disturbances.

- **D**: A type 1 hypersensitivity reaction could cause some systemic symptoms but typically would include more pronounced allergic reactions such as angioedema or anaphylaxis, which are not described.

- **E**: Stimulation of the hypothalamic temperature center could cause hyperthermia but does not fully explain the range of systemic symptoms.

**Conclusion**: The best explanation for the pathogenesis of this patient's condition is the uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased heat production and explaining the hyperthermia and other systemic symptoms.

1266,"A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to her primary care doctor by her son who is concerned about the patient's ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Alzheimer dementia
B) Delirium
C) Lewy body dementia
D) Normal pressure hydrocephalus
E) Pseudodementia","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Age and Living Situation**: The patient is a 74-year-old woman living alone, which places her at risk for various geriatric syndromes due to social isolation and decreased support.

2. **Medical History**: She has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are common chronic conditions in the elderly but do not directly explain her current symptoms.

3. **Symptoms and Signs**:
   - **Cognitive Decline**: Indicated by disorganization, difficulty navigating new areas, and inability to recall words.
   - **Urinary Urgency and Incontinence**: Suggests a possible neurological or urological issue.
   - **Balance Issues**: Could be related to neurological or musculoskeletal problems.
   - **Tremor**: Specifically, a low-frequency tremor that worsens with movement, which is suggestive of a parkinsonian tremor.
   - **Altered Mental Status**: Fluctuating somnolence and confusion, indicated by disorientation to place and situation, and failure to recognize her doctor.

4. **Medication and Substance Use**: Recently started on multiple medications for anxiety and consumes a significant amount of alcohol daily.

Given these points, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed down based on the presence of cognitive decline, parkinsonian features (tremor), and fluctuating mental status.

- **Alzheimer Dementia (A)**: While it's a common cause of cognitive decline, it typically doesn't present with such rapid fluctuation in mental status or with prominent parkinsonian features early on.

- **Delirium (B)**: Characterized by an acute onset of fluctuating cognitive impairment, altered consciousness, and difficulty maintaining attention. While the patient shows some features of delirium, her presentation also includes more chronic elements and specific neurological signs.

- **Lewy Body Dementia (C)**: This condition is marked by cognitive decline, visual hallucinations (not explicitly mentioned here), and parkinsonian motor symptoms. The fluctuating cognition and attention, along with the parkinsonian tremor, make this a strong consideration.

- **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (D)**: Classically presents with the triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. While the patient has urinary urgency and incontinence, the gait disturbance is not clearly described, and the cognitive issues seem more fluctuant than typical for NPH.

- **Pseudodementia (E)**: Refers to depression that presents with symptoms mimicking dementia. While the patient was started on medications for anxiety, there's no clear indication that depression is the primary issue here, especially given the presence of specific neurological signs.

Considering the combination of fluctuating cognitive impairment, parkinsonian features, and the absence of a clear alternative explanation, Lewy Body Dementia seems the most fitting diagnosis.

He underwent surgery to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. During surgery, he experienced an acute drop in blood pressure and ST elevations in multiple leads, which resolved with fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions.

2. **Post-Surgical Period:** The patient remained sedated and had relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the ICU, when he experienced an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen. This indicates a severe respiratory compromise.

3. **Clinical Findings:** On auscultation, air entry was present bilaterally with crackles, indicating lung involvement. A 2/6 systolic murmur was heard, which could suggest cardiac involvement, but the specifics of the murmur are not detailed enough to pinpoint a diagnosis like a ventricular septal defect or papillary muscle rupture.

4. **Swan-Ganz Catheter Readings:** The readings showed a low central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 mmHg, normal right ventricular pressure (RVP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), with a low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 5 mmHg. These findings do not strongly support cardiogenic shock or significant left ventricular dysfunction as the primary cause of his respiratory failure.

5. **Chest X-ray (Image A):** Although the description of the chest X-ray is not provided, given the context, it would likely show bilateral infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage.

Considering these points, the patient's severe respiratory compromise, as evidenced by oxygen desaturation despite maximal oxygen therapy, along with the presence of crackles on auscultation and likely bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray, points towards ARDS as the direct cause of death. ARDS is a known complication of severe trauma, surgery, and fluid resuscitation, all of which were present in this patient's case.

212,"A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 88 μm3
Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Serum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L
An excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?
A) Antinuclear antibody
B) Hepatitis C virus antibodies
C) JAK-2 mutation
D) Peripheral blood flow cytometry
E) Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings. The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of HIV, presenting with painless swelling of the neck, intermittent fevers, severe night sweats, and significant unintentional weight loss. These symptoms are suggestive of a systemic illness, with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly indicating involvement of the lymphoid system.

The laboratory findings show anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL), leukocytosis (leukocyte count 18,000/mm^3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 130,000/mm^3), and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is a marker of cell turnover and can be elevated in various conditions, including lymphomas.

Given the patient's history of HIV and the presence of systemic symptoms along with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, the differential diagnosis includes opportunistic infections and malignancies, particularly lymphomas. The histopathologic analysis of the excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node is crucial for confirming the diagnosis.

The next best diagnostic step would be to further characterize the nature of the lymph node pathology, considering the patient's HIV status and the clinical presentation. Among the options provided:

- Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is more relevant for autoimmune disorders and does not directly relate to the current clinical context.
- Hepatitis C virus antibodies testing is relevant for another type of viral infection but does not directly follow from the lymph node biopsy results.
- JAK-2 mutation testing is relevant for myeloproliferative neoplasms, which could be a consideration but does not directly follow from the given information.
- Peripheral blood flow cytometry could be useful in assessing for lymphoma cells in the blood but would not be the immediate next step following a lymph node biopsy that has provided histopathologic confirmation of a diagnosis.
- Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is specific for hairy cell leukemia, a rare type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, but it is not the most likely next step given the clinical presentation and the results of the lymph node biopsy.

However, given the context of HIV and the symptoms and lab findings suggesting a lymphoma, and considering the excisional biopsy has confirmed a diagnosis (though the specific diagnosis isn't mentioned), the most appropriate next step would generally involve further characterization of the lymphoma, which could involve molecular studies or other tests not listed here. But among the options provided, considering a need to relate the choice to lymphoma workup in the context of HIV, none directly address the need for further lymphoma characterization that would typically follow a biopsy confirmation. Peripheral blood flow cytometry (option D) might be considered in a broader diagnostic workup for lymphoma, especially to assess for systemic involvement, but it's not the direct next step after a biopsy has confirmed a diagnosis without knowing more specifics about that diagnosis.

Given the constraints of the question and the options provided, and recognizing the information provided points towards a diagnosis of lymphoma but without specifying the type or the need for systemic staging, the logical progression to characterize the lymphoma in the blood could involve flow cytometry, but this isn't perfectly aligned with the immediate next steps after a biopsy confirms a diagnosis without more context on the type of lymphoma.

375,"A 50-year-old man presents to his physician with chronic cough, aching joints in his hips and lower back, and malaise over the past 2 months. He describes himself as being “generally healthy” before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 12.9 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 9,300/mm3
Platelet count 167,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm/hr
Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine Positive
Acid-fast stain Negative
 Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Histoplasmosis
B) Mycetoma
C) Blastomycosis
D) Valley fever
E) Chromomycosis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the diagnostic findings:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a chronic cough, aching joints in his hips and lower back, and malaise over the past 2 months. These symptoms suggest a systemic illness with both respiratory and musculoskeletal involvement.

2. **Travel History**: The patient went on a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. This is a crucial piece of information as it exposes the patient to certain endemic pathogens.

3. **Physical Examination and Imaging**: The patient has a fever, mild fremetus, and dullness with percussion on the right side, indicating a possible lung consolidation. The chest X-ray and CT confirm a right-sided consolidation, a small pleural effusion, and mild hilar adenopathy, suggesting a pulmonary infection or inflammation.

4. **Lung Biopsy**: The biopsy reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores. This finding is characteristic of a fungal infection.

5. **Laboratory Tests**: The patient has an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), indicating inflammation. The periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and silver methenamine stains are positive, which are used to identify fungi. The acid-fast stain is negative, which helps to rule out certain other pathogens.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a fungal infection that is endemic to the region the patient visited. Among the options provided:

- **Histoplasmosis** is caused by inhaling the spores of a fungus called Histoplasma capsulatum, which is found in bird and bat droppings. While it can cause similar symptoms, it is more commonly associated with the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys.

- **Mycetoma** is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by various species of fungi or bacteria. It doesn't typically present with the systemic symptoms described.

- **Blastomycosis** is caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis and is more commonly found in the Midwest, particularly around the Great Lakes.

- **Valley fever**, also known as coccidioidomycosis, is caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii. It is endemic to the southwestern United States, including Arizona, and can cause symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness to severe pulmonary and disseminated disease.

- **Chromomycosis** is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by various dematiaceous fungi. It doesn't match the presentation described.

Given the patient's travel history to Arizona and the findings of spherules with endospores in the lung biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis).

747,"A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely inciting factor for this patient’s condition?
A) Decreased carbohydrate intake
B) Increased tryptophan intake
C) Medication change
D) Surreptitious diuretic abuse
E) Surreptitious opiate abuse","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with fever, worsening malaise, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, and neurological signs including hyperreflexia, increased muscle tone, and clonus. These symptoms suggest a condition affecting the central nervous system.

2. **Medication History**: The patient is on citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), for major depressive disorder. She previously took paroxetine, another SSRI, but switched due to inadequate symptom control.

3. **Dietary Changes**: She recently started a low-carbohydrate diet and is taking an amino acid supplement.

4. **Significant Findings**: The neurological examination reveals signs consistent with serotonin syndrome, a condition caused by excessive levels of serotonin in the body. These signs include hyperreflexia, increased muscle tone, and clonus.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Decreased carbohydrate intake**: While dietary changes can influence mood and physiological states, there's no direct link between low carbohydrate intake and the acute neurological symptoms presented.

- **B) Increased tryptophan intake**: Tryptophan is an amino acid precursor to serotonin. An increase in tryptophan could theoretically contribute to increased serotonin levels, potentially leading to serotonin syndrome, especially in the context of SSRI use.

- **C) Medication change**: The patient has been stable on her current dose of citalopram for 6 months, making a medication change less likely to be the immediate cause.

- **D) Surreptitious diuretic abuse**: There's no indication of diuretic abuse or symptoms that would suggest such abuse (e.g., hypokalemia, which is not mentioned in the basic metabolic panel results).

- **E) Surreptitious opiate abuse**: Opiate abuse can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms, but the specific constellation of findings here does not align closely with typical opiate overdose or withdrawal symptoms.

Considering the recent introduction of an amino acid supplement (which could contain tryptophan) and the symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, the most plausible explanation is an increase in tryptophan intake, which could exacerbate serotonin levels in the context of SSRI therapy.

867,"An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient’s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?
A) Child abuse
B) Insufficient production of procollagen type 1
C) Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1
D) Defective collagen type 3
E) Dysfunctional structure of laminins","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Age and Developmental Stage**: The patient is an 11-month-old male infant who has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. This suggests that, until now, he has had a relatively normal development.

2. **Symptoms and History**: The infant had a minor trauma (hitting his right leg against a chair) 2 days ago, which resulted in edema, bruising, and an inability to stand or crawl due to pain when putting weight on the leg. This indicates an exaggerated response to a relatively minor injury.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: Notable findings include blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities, and a slightly deformed, edematous, and warm right calf. These findings suggest a systemic condition affecting connective tissue.

4. **Radiographic Findings**: An incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis is identified on X-ray. This type of fracture from a minor injury suggests bone fragility.

Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is related to a condition that affects bone strength and connective tissue. The options provided point towards various genetic conditions affecting connective tissue and collagen production.

- **Option A (Child Abuse)**: While child abuse is a critical consideration in cases of unexplained fractures in infants, the systemic findings (e.g., blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility) and the specific context provided in the scenario make it less likely as the primary cause.

- **Option B (Insufficient production of procollagen type 1)**: This directly points towards Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by bones that break easily, often with little or no apparent cause. OI is most commonly due to mutations affecting the genes that encode for type I collagen, a critical component of bone matrix. The condition also often includes other systemic features such as blue sclerae and joint hypermobility, which are present in this patient.

- **Option C (Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1)**: This refers to Marfan Syndrome, which primarily affects the cardiovascular system, eyes, skin, and skeleton. While it does involve connective tissue, the primary findings in this case (e.g., bone fragility, blue sclerae) are more suggestive of OI.

- **Option D (Defective collagen type 3)**: This is associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome type IV, characterized by fragile blood vessels and does not primarily present with bone fragility or the specific ocular findings noted in this case.

- **Option E (Dysfunctional structure of laminins)**: Laminins are important in the structure of the basal lamina, but defects in laminins are more commonly associated with muscular dystrophies rather than the clinical picture presented here.

Given the combination of bone fragility, blue sclerae, and joint hypermobility in response to a minor injury, the most likely diagnosis is Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is directly related to insufficient production of procollagen type 1.

159,"A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?""
A) Obtain abdominal CT
B) Observation only
C) Begin rehydration therapy
D) Administer calcium gluconate
E) Supplementation with vitamin D","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with nausea, abdominal discomfort that worsens after meals, diarrhea, progressive perioral numbness, and upper-extremity muscle cramping. These symptoms started after a recent total thyroidectomy.

2. **Past Medical History**: The patient underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass six months ago and a total thyroidectomy four days ago.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: Notably, the patient has low magnesium (Mg2+ 1.7 mEq/L), which can contribute to muscle cramping and perioral numbness. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is elevated at 115 pg/mL, which can indicate hypocalcemia or a response to low calcium levels, although the calcium level itself is not provided.

Given these details, the patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) and hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), both of which can occur after thyroid surgery due to damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. The elevated PTH level supports this, as the body attempts to compensate for low calcium levels.

**Management**: The initial step in managing this patient should focus on addressing the likely cause of the symptoms, which appears to be related to low calcium and magnesium levels post-thyroidectomy.

- **Option D (Administer calcium gluconate)** is the most appropriate initial step. This would help to rapidly correct hypocalcemia, which is likely contributing to the patient's symptoms of muscle cramping and perioral numbness. Additionally, correcting hypocalcemia can also help stabilize cardiac membranes and prevent serious cardiac arrhythmias.

- While rehydration therapy (Option C) and supplementation with vitamin D (Option E) may also be beneficial, they are not the immediate priority in this case where acute symptoms of hypocalcemia need to be addressed.

- Obtaining an abdominal CT (Option A) does not directly address the patient's current symptoms or the likely underlying cause.

- Observation only (Option B) is inappropriate given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings indicating a need for intervention.

683,"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base.

510,"An 81-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his son to be evaluated for memory issues. The patient’s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F).

He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Alzheimer's disease
B) Frontotemporal dementia
C) Lewy body dementia
D) Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
E) Vascular dementia","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Progressive memory issues**: The patient has difficulty remembering recent events and names, which have worsened over several years. This suggests a dementia process.
2. **Acute worsening and fluctuating symptoms**: The patient's symptoms acutely worsened recently, and he experienced a transient episode of not being able to see out of his right eye, which resolved. This fluctuation in symptoms is characteristic of certain types of dementia.
3. **Lack of insight**: The patient seems unaware of his memory issues, which is common in dementia.
4. **History of cerebrovascular events**: The patient has a history of a left basal ganglia hemorrhage and a right middle cerebral artery infarction, which indicates significant vascular disease.
5. **Physical examination findings**: The patient has muscle weakness, reduced tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side, consistent with a previous stroke. His gait is hemiparetic, further indicating previous cerebrovascular events.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and is associated with a history of stroke or other cerebrovascular events. The patient's history of stroke, evidence of previous cerebrovascular events on physical examination, and the fluctuating nature of his symptoms support this diagnosis.

While Alzheimer's disease is a common cause of dementia, the patient's history of cerebrovascular events and the fluctuating nature of his symptoms make vascular dementia more likely. Frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia are less likely given the patient's presentation and history. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus typically presents with the triad of dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence, which is not fully present in this case.

A) Reassess in 3 months
B) Immobilize the right knee with conservative treatment (i.e. rest, ice)
C) Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint
D) Pavlik harness
E) Surgical pinning of the right hip","The patient is a 14-year-old obese boy presenting with severe right hip and knee pain, which has worsened acutely. The physical examination reveals an externally rotated right leg with a limited range of motion in the right hip, but no tenderness to palpation or joint erythema, edema, or effusion. The plain radiographs show displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck, which is indicative of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). SCFE is a serious condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head.

Given the patient's age and the acute worsening of symptoms, conservative treatment or reassessment in 3 months would not be appropriate. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint is also not indicated for SCFE. A Pavlik harness is used for treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants, not for SCFE in adolescents.

The most appropriate course of treatment for this patient is surgical pinning of the right hip to stabilize the femoral head and prevent further displacement. This procedure should be performed as soon as possible to minimize the risk of complications.

E) Decreased right atrial pressure","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings from the patient's presentation and physical examination:

1. **Leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness**: These symptoms can be indicative of fluid overload and possibly congestive heart failure (CHF), especially when combined with the patient's history of myocardial infarction.

2. **History of myocardial infarction 4 years ago**: This increases the patient's risk for developing heart failure due to the potential for damaged heart muscle.

3. **Fatigue and syncope**: These symptoms can be related to decreased cardiac output, which is a hallmark of heart failure.

4. **Jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema**: These physical examination findings are classic signs of fluid overload, often seen in CHF.

5. **Pulmonary auscultation showing bilateral wheezes**: This could indicate pulmonary congestion, which is another sign of CHF.

6. **Cardiac auscultation findings (decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur)**: An S3 gallop is particularly suggestive of heart failure, as it indicates increased fluid volume within the ventricle.

7. **Ascites and positive hepatojugular reflux**: These findings further support the diagnosis of right-sided heart failure, as they indicate fluid accumulation in the abdomen and increased venous pressure.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is heart failure, specifically with a component of right-sided heart failure given the ascites and hepatojugular reflux. However, the presence of an S3 gallop and the overall clinical picture also suggest left ventricular dysfunction.

On an echocardiogram, the clinical findings most consistent with this patient's presentation would be those that indicate right ventricular dysfunction or elevated pressures in the right side of the heart, given the signs of right-sided heart failure. However, the options provided seem to lean more towards left-sided heart failure or general heart failure markers.

Among the options provided:

- **A) Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 41%** would indicate systolic heart failure, which could be consistent with the patient's symptoms but does not directly address the signs of right-sided heart failure.

- **B) Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation** would be a direct indicator of right ventricular dysfunction or elevated right ventricular pressures, consistent with the patient's signs of right-sided heart failure.

- **C) Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle** could indicate left ventricular dysfunction but is not as directly related to the patient's signs of right-sided heart failure.

- **D) Abnormal left ventricular relaxation** would indicate diastolic dysfunction, which could contribute to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) but does not directly address the signs of right-sided heart failure.

- **E) Decreased right atrial pressure** is the opposite of what would be expected in right-sided heart failure, where increased right atrial pressure would lead to jugular venous distension and other signs of fluid overload.

Given the patient's presentation, the most likely clinical finding observed on an echocardiogram that is listed among the options is increased peak tricuspid regurgitation, which would indicate elevated pressures in the right ventricle and be consistent with the signs of right-sided heart failure.

Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan
B) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
C) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
D) Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
E) Percutaneous cholecystostomy","The patient presents with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and yellowish discoloration of the sclera, indicating jaundice. Laboratory tests show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and leukocyte count, suggesting an infectious or obstructive process affecting the liver and bile ducts. The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder are consistent with cholangitis, likely caused by gallstones. The patient's condition deteriorates after 12 hours, with increasing fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, indicating severe sepsis.

Given the patient's critical condition and the need for urgent intervention, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to relieve the biliary obstruction and drain the infected bile. ERCP is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed at the bedside and is effective in managing acute cholangitis.

853,"A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with nausea, vomiting, fever, and pain in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen for the past 18 hours. He mentions that he has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain at the same location over the last 3 months and that these episodes usually occur after a heavy meal and subside within 1 or 2 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. On examination of the abdomen, tenderness is present over the right upper quadrant; palpation over the area produces an inspiratory pause. An urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct stone, but no stone in the common bile duct or in the gallbladder. Laboratory results show the following:
Hemoglobin 15.4 g/dL (9.56 mmol/L)
Total leukocyte count 14,000/mm3 (17.4 x 10*9/L)

B) Medical management followed by elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy
C) Medical management followed by elective open cholecystectomy
D) Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ECRP)
E) Cholecystotomy","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, fever, and pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. These symptoms, combined with the history of intermittent episodes of pain in the same location that worsen after heavy meals, are suggestive of gallbladder disease, specifically cholecystitis or cholelithiasis (gallstones).

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of tenderness over the right upper quadrant and an inspiratory pause upon palpation (Murphy's sign) further supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

3. **Ultrasonogram Findings**: The urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct but no stone in the common bile duct or gallbladder. This finding is concerning for a possible bile duct obstruction, which could be due to a stone that has migrated from the gallbladder into the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) but is not visualized on the ultrasound.

4. **Laboratory Results**: The elevated total leukocyte count, segmented neutrophils, and liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) are consistent with an inflammatory process affecting the liver and biliary system, further supporting the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis or a bile duct obstruction.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to address the possible bile duct obstruction suggested by the dilated common bile duct on ultrasonography. While surgery (cholecystectomy) is typically the definitive treatment for gallbladder disease, an urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate and potentially clear any obstruction in the bile ducts before proceeding with surgery. ERCP is a procedure that combines upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and fluoroscopy to diagnose and treat conditions of the bile and pancreatic ducts.

1246,"A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 2-month history of a non-productive cough and fatigue. During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 ml of turbid fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows:

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?""
A) Bronchial adenocarcinoma
B) Mesothelioma
C) Nephrotic syndrome
D) Tuberculosis
E) Congestive heart failure","To determine the underlying cause of the patient's pleural effusion, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Patient's History and Symptoms**: The patient has a 2-month history of non-productive cough, fatigue, significant weight loss, and increasing shortness of breath. These symptoms are non-specific but can be associated with various conditions, including malignancies, infections, and heart failure.

2. **Travel and Occupational History**: The patient's travel to India could potentially expose her to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. However, her occupation in a textile factory for 50 years and a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years significantly increase her risk for lung diseases, including lung cancer and mesothelioma, especially if she was exposed to asbestos.

3. **Physical Examination and Laboratory Findings**: The patient appears thin, indicating possible malnutrition or cachexia often seen in advanced diseases. The dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base suggest pleural effusion, which is confirmed by the chest x-ray showing nodular pleural lesions and a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right side.

4. **Pleural Fluid Analysis**: The pleural fluid is turbid, with a low erythrocyte count, elevated leukocyte count, normal glucose, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and high protein. These findings are consistent with an exudative pleural effusion, which can be caused by various conditions including infections, malignancies, and autoimmune diseases.

Given the patient's long history of smoking and occupational exposure, the presence of nodular pleural lesions, and the exudative nature of the pleural effusion, the most likely underlying causes would be either bronchial adenocarcinoma or mesothelioma. However, the presence of nodular pleural lesions is more suggestive of mesothelioma, which is known for its association with asbestos exposure and its characteristic pleural involvement.

389,"An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Initiate proton pump inhibitor
B) Obtain abdominal ultrasound
C) Reassurance and counseling on positioning
D) Recommend modification of mother’s diet
E) Switch to hydrolyzed formula","Analyzing the situation, the 8-week-old male patient is experiencing episodes of regurgitation after breastfeeding, which started about two weeks ago. The patient's mother has tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. The patient is otherwise healthy, with no signs of diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. His growth parameters are within normal limits, and the physical examination is unremarkable.

Given the patient's age and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is gastroesophageal reflux (GER), a common condition in infants. GER is often characterized by regurgitation of milk after feeding, which can be managed with conservative measures.

The best next step in management would be to provide reassurance and counseling on positioning, as this can help alleviate symptoms of GER. Positioning the infant upright after feeding and using a wedge pillow can help prevent regurgitation. This approach is non-invasive and can be effective in managing symptoms.

Initiating a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) may be considered if the symptoms are severe or persistent, but it is not the first line of treatment. Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound is not necessary at this stage, as there are no signs of abdominal distension or other concerning symptoms. Recommending modification of the mother's diet may be considered if the patient has a suspected food allergy or intolerance, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history. Switching to a hydrolyzed formula is also not necessary, as the patient is breastfeeding and there is no indication of a formula intolerance.

759,"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, and mild intermittent abdominal pain that is not affected by eating. He reports that over the last 6 months he slept a lot more than usual and lost 14.9 kg (33 lbs) without trying to lose weight. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that is worse when he is working and in the yard. There is no significant family history. His long-standing male partner passed away 2 years ago in a fatal car accident. His blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 23/min, and the temperature is 38°C (100.5°F). On physical examination, he has pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. There is a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border. His head bobs with each heartbeat. There are small, painless, red macules on both palms.

A) Viridans streptococci
B) Treponema pallidum
C) Malignant colonic neoplasm
D) Collagen vascular disease
E) Group D streptococci","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, mild intermittent abdominal pain, significant weight loss, chest pain, and shortness of breath. These symptoms suggest a systemic illness with both abdominal and cardiac involvement.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - Pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae indicate anemia and possible thrombocytopenia or vasculitis.
   - A new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border is indicative of aortic regurgitation.
   - The head bobbing with each heartbeat (De Musset's sign) also supports aortic regurgitation.
   - Small, painless, red macules on both palms (Janeway lesions) are associated with infective endocarditis.
   - A palpable spleen suggests splenomegaly, which can be seen in infective endocarditis due to septic emboli.

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - Anemia is confirmed by a low hemoglobin level.
   - The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is slightly below the normal range, indicating microcytic anemia.
   - Serum ferritin and iron are low, while total iron-binding capacity is high, indicating iron deficiency anemia.

4. **Colonoscopy Findings**: A neoplastic growth in the descending colon.

Given these findings, the patient's cardiac symptoms and signs (aortic regurgitation, Janeway lesions) are most likely due to infective endocarditis. The presence of a neoplastic growth in the colon could potentially be a source of bacteremia leading to endocarditis, especially if the tumor is ulcerated or if there was an invasive procedure (like a biopsy) that could have introduced bacteria into the bloodstream.

However, the direct link between the colonic neoplasm and the cardiac findings (infective endocarditis) would be through bacteria that are commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract. Among the options provided, **Group D streptococci (Enterococci)** are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and are known to cause infective endocarditis, especially in patients with underlying heart disease or in those with bacteremia originating from the gut.

A) Inflammation and edema
B) Abnormal gastric rotation
C) Neoplastic growth
D) Scarring and fibrosis
E) Walled-off pancreatic fluid collection","To determine the underlying cause of this patient's vomiting, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with nonbilious emesis (vomiting) that includes undigested food and dark brown emesis, indicating possible gastrointestinal obstruction or bleeding. Early satiety and severe episodic epigastric pain that worsens at night and is partially relieved by food or antacids suggest a condition affecting the upper gastrointestinal tract.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium (indicative of a distended or gas-filled structure) and a succussion splash (a sound heard when the patient is rocked back and forth, indicating fluid and gas in a hollow viscus) are key findings pointing towards a gastric outlet obstruction.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has mild electrolyte imbalances, elevated urea nitrogen, and a positive test for occult blood in the stool, which can be seen in conditions causing gastric outlet obstruction due to possible dehydration, renal concentration of the urine, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a gastric outlet obstruction. Among the options provided:

- **A) Inflammation and edema**: Could be a contributing factor but is not the most direct cause of the obstruction.
- **B) Abnormal gastric rotation**: Could potentially lead to obstruction but is not directly indicated by the symptoms or findings.
- **C) Neoplastic growth**: A tumor could cause gastric outlet obstruction, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and the presence of a tympanitic mass.
- **D) Scarring and fibrosis**: Could cause obstruction, especially in conditions like peptic ulcer disease, but there's less direct evidence for this in the scenario.
- **E) Walled-off pancreatic fluid collection**: Could potentially cause gastric outlet obstruction but is less directly indicated by the symptoms and findings.

Considering the presence of a tympanitic mass, succussion splash, and the overall clinical picture, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vomiting is a neoplastic growth causing gastric outlet obstruction.

A) Chronic inflammatory bowel disease
B) Obesity
C) Ibuprofen
D) History of abdominal surgery
E) Alcohol","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and the findings:

1. **Increasingly severe abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting** for 2 days, with the last bowel movement being the day before and no passage of flatus since then. This pattern suggests an obstruction of the bowel.

2. **Past medical history** includes appendectomy at age 39, psoriasis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic back pain. None of these conditions directly point to a cause of bowel obstruction except possibly for the history of abdominal surgery, which can lead to adhesions.

3. **Medications** include a topical corticosteroid, ramipril, metformin, and ibuprofen. While NSAIDs like ibuprofen can cause gastrointestinal issues, they are not a common cause of bowel obstruction.

4. **Physical examination** shows a distended abdomen with frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds, indicating an attempt by the bowel to push contents past an obstruction. The digital rectal examination shows an empty rectum, further supporting the diagnosis of an obstruction.

5. **Laboratory studies** are relatively unremarkable, with no significant electrolyte imbalances, normal liver enzymes, and a normal hematocrit, which does not immediately suggest a chronic process like inflammatory bowel disease.

6. **Abdominal ultrasound** shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel, which is consistent with a mechanical obstruction.

Given these points, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is related to his **history of abdominal surgery**. Adhesions from previous surgeries are a common cause of small bowel obstruction in adults. These adhesions can form during the healing process after surgery and may not cause symptoms until years later.

A) Autoimmune liver damage
B) Congestive hepatopathy
C) Insulin resistance
D) Acetaminophen use
E) Alcohol use","To determine the underlying cause of the liver abnormalities in this 42-year-old man, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Clinical Presentation and History**: The patient has no history of serious illness but has intermittent bilateral knee pain, for which he takes 650 mg acetaminophen every other day. He is overweight (BMI of 36.3 kg/m2) and has a history of smoking and moderate alcohol consumption.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin, indicating hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver).

3. **Laboratory Studies**:
   - Elevated liver enzymes: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 92 U/L and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 144 U/L, suggesting liver injury.
   - Normal hemoglobin, platelet count, and hemoglobin A1c levels.
   - Elevated ferritin levels, which can be seen in various conditions including liver disease.
   - Negative hepatitis B and C serologies, making viral hepatitis less likely.
   - Low titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which is not significant enough to suggest autoimmune hepatitis.
   - Normal total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels.

4. **Imaging**: Transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver, consistent with fatty liver disease.

Given these findings, the most likely underlying cause of the liver abnormalities is related to the patient's metabolic profile, particularly his obesity and insulin resistance. The patient's elevated liver enzymes and the ultrasound findings of a hyperechoic liver are characteristic of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is closely associated with insulin resistance and obesity.

While acetaminophen use and alcohol consumption could contribute to liver damage, the pattern of liver enzyme elevation (ALT > AST) and the ultrasound findings more strongly suggest NAFLD. Autoimmune liver damage is less likely given the low ANA titers and lack of other specific autoantibodies. Congestive hepatopathy would typically present with different clinical and imaging findings.

3. **Physical Examination**: The patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic, with bilateral rales over the lower lobes upon lung auscultation. The cardiac examination reveals S2 accentuation and the presence of S3, indicative of increased fluid volume or ventricular volume overload, but there is no leg edema.

4. **Arterial Blood Gases (ABG) Analysis**: The ABG shows an alkalotic pH (7.49), low PaO2 (58 mm Hg), low PaCO2 (30 mm Hg), and a slightly decreased HCO3- level (22 mEq/L). This profile suggests a respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia.

Given these findings, the patient's respiratory failure could be attributed to several factors, but the most likely cause is related to her recent surgery and the potential for pulmonary embolism (PE), especially considering her recent immobility and history of smoking. The absence of leg edema does not rule out this possibility. 

- **Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli (Option A)** is consistent with a pulmonary embolism, where the blockage of an artery in the lungs leads to alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused, thereby increasing dead space and leading to hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis as seen in the ABG results.

- **Ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons (Option B)** would more likely result in a different clinical presentation, not directly related to the findings described.

- **Alveolar fibrosis (Option C)** is a chronic condition that would not typically present acutely in this manner.

- **Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation (Option D)** could be a contributing factor given her history of opioid abuse, but the ABG profile and the rest of the clinical presentation do not strongly support this as the primary cause.

- **Decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction (Option E)** might lead to respiratory failure, but the clinical findings and the context provided do not specifically point towards bronchial obstruction as the primary issue.

Therefore, the most likely cause of respiratory failure in this patient, based on the given data, is related to increased alveolar dead space, likely due to a pulmonary embolism.

914,"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?
A) Affinity maturation
B) Random assortment
C) Random nucleotide addition
D) VDJ recombination
E) Isotype switching","To solve this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. The patient presents with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including fever, malaise, dyspnea, productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain, which are typical of pneumonia.
2. The presence of focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe on the chest radiograph supports this diagnosis.
3. The patient's serum contains a protein thought to be elevated in response to her condition, and an amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of this protein is isolated and labeled.
4. This labeled sequence binds strongly to a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages.

Given these details, we are dealing with an immune response to an infection. The process of isolating a sequence from the patient's serum and observing its binding to a protein on the surface of immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) suggests an interaction between an antibody (or a part of it) and a receptor on these cells.

The amino acid sequence isolated from the patient's serum protein, which is thought to be elevated in response to her condition, likely represents a part of an antibody. The process of adding a fluorescent marker to this sequence and observing its binding to proteins on the surface of immune cells indicates an interaction relevant to the immune response.

Considering the options provided:

- **Affinity maturation** is the process by which activated B cells undergo rapid proliferation and differentiation, accompanied by hypermutation in the immunoglobulin genes and selection of cells with high-affinity antibodies. This process is crucial for refining the immune response but does not directly relate to the interaction described.

- **Random assortment** and **Random nucleotide addition** are not directly relevant to the scenario described, as they relate more to genetic diversity and the generation of antibody diversity rather than the specific interaction between an antibody sequence and a cell surface receptor.

- **VDJ recombination** is the process by which the immune system generates a diverse repertoire of antibodies and T-cell receptors by combining different variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments. This process is fundamental to the adaptive immune response but is not what is being described in the interaction between the isolated sequence and the immune cell surface protein.

- **Isotype switching** (or class switching) is the process by which a B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (e.g., switching from producing IgM to IgG, IgA, or IgE). This process involves a change in the heavy chain constant region gene that's expressed, without altering the antigen specificity of the antibody (which is determined by the variable region). The interaction described between the amino acid sequence from the patient's serum protein and the protein on the surface of neutrophils and macrophages could involve different classes of antibodies binding to Fc receptors on these cells, which would be a result of isotype switching.

Given the context of the immune response and the interaction described, the most relevant process is isotype switching, as it would influence how the antibody (or parts of it) interacts with different immune cells via their Fc receptors.

608,"A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following?
A) The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population
B) The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group
C) The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population
D) The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths
E) The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year","To determine the primary measure used in this study, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. The study aimed to assess mortality in relation to various factors among psychiatric patients.
2. The researchers calculated ""Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs)"" to express their findings.

Given these points, the focus is on understanding what SMRs represent. The Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) is a statistical method used to compare the number of observed deaths in a study population to the number of expected deaths in that population, based on the mortality rates of a standard population. This is crucial for studies like the one described, where the mortality experience of a specific group (psychiatric patients in a community-based setting) is compared to that of a broader, standard population.

The SMR is calculated by dividing the observed number of deaths in the study population by the expected number of deaths, which is derived from the mortality rates of the standard population. This ratio helps to identify if the mortality in the study population is higher or lower than what would be expected based on the standard population's mortality rates.

Considering the options provided:

A) Refers to the crude death rate, which is not specific to the calculation of expected versus observed deaths.
B) Describes an age-specific death rate, which is relevant but does not directly define the SMR.
C) Incorrectly suggests dividing expected deaths by a standard population, which is not how SMR is calculated.
D) Correctly defines the SMR as the observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths.
E) Refers to the proportion of deaths due to a specific disease, which is not what SMR measures.

888,"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?
A) Hemolytic anemia and ataxia
B) Gum disease and poor wound healing
C) Irregularly irregular heart rhythm
D) Hepatitis C infection
E) Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum","To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. The patient is a 27-year-old man who presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident.
2. He has a history of asthma and cocaine use.
3. His initial presentation includes hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (high heart rate), and signs of pelvic instability.
4. He is treated with IV fluids, norepinephrine (to raise blood pressure), a pelvic binder, blood transfusion, and hydromorphone (for pain).
5. Shortly after treatment, he develops acute respiratory distress with bilateral wheezing, poor air movement, and further drops in blood pressure.

Given the sudden onset of respiratory distress and the patient's history of asthma, one might initially consider an asthma exacerbation. However, the scenario's context and the specific details of the treatment and the reaction suggest another cause.

The administration of blood transfusion followed by the sudden onset of symptoms such as respiratory distress, wheezing, and a drop in blood pressure points towards a transfusion reaction. Among the options provided, the one that is most consistent with a severe transfusion reaction, particularly an anaphylactic reaction or an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, would involve pre-existing antibodies against certain blood components.

Option E, ""Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum,"" directly relates to the presence of pre-existing antibodies against ABO blood group antigens, which could lead to a severe hemolytic transfusion reaction if incompatible blood is transfused. This scenario is the most likely explanation for the sudden and severe symptoms observed in the patient following the blood transfusion.

A) Adverse effect of anesthetic
B) Gram negative bacteria in the bloodstream
C) Trauma to the bile duct
D) Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder
E) Excessive lysis of red blood cells","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 43-year-old woman who, five days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy, develops low-grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells during the surgery. Upon examination, she shows jaundice and moderate tenderness over the liver, with the liver palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: Notable findings include elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase of 760 U/L), indicating liver damage, and a significant increase in eosinophils (13%), which can suggest an allergic reaction or a specific type of infection. The patient also has a positive anti-HAV IgG and anti-HBs, indicating past immunization or infection with hepatitis A and B, respectively, but no current acute infection. The liver biopsy shows massive centrilobular necrosis, indicating severe liver damage.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the acute onset of liver dysfunction following surgery and transfusion, we need to consider causes that could lead to such a rapid progression of liver injury.

- **Adverse effect of anesthetic (A)**: Certain anesthetics can cause liver damage, but this is relatively rare and usually associated with specific agents like halothane, which is less commonly used today.

- **Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream (B)**: This could lead to sepsis and potentially liver dysfunction, but the presentation would likely include more systemic signs of infection and sepsis.

- **Trauma to the bile duct (C)**: This could occur during surgery but would more likely present with signs of bile duct obstruction rather than centrilobular necrosis.

- **Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder (D)**: This condition can occur post-surgically but is less likely to cause the degree of liver damage seen here.

- **Excessive lysis of red blood cells (E)**: This could potentially occur due to a transfusion reaction, but the laboratory findings do not strongly support this.

Considering the acute onset of symptoms following surgery and the specific pattern of liver damage, the most plausible explanation is an adverse reaction to the anesthetic used during surgery. This is supported by the pattern of liver damage (centrilobular necrosis) and the absence of other clear causes for such severe liver dysfunction in the immediate post-operative period.

769,"An unresponsive 92-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance and is quickly followed by his grand-daughter. Approx. 1 month ago, he had a radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and several rounds of chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer in Nicaragua and was discharged from the hospital with a suprapelvic catheter and a plan for more chemotherapy. He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?
A) Renal biopsy
B) Ultrasound
C) Abdominal-pelvic CT scan
D) Blood analysis
E) Urine analysis","To evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient, especially considering his complex medical history, including a recent radical prostatectomy and pelvic radiation, and the presence of a suprapelvic catheter with signs of infection (redness, swelling, and thick green-white pus), a diagnostic method that can provide detailed images of the urinary tract and surrounding structures is necessary. 

Option A, Renal biopsy, is an invasive procedure that is more suited for diagnosing kidney diseases rather than evaluating urinary tract obstruction directly. 

Option B, Ultrasound, is a non-invasive and commonly used initial imaging technique for assessing the urinary tract. It can help identify obstructions by showing dilated ureters or renal pelvis, but it might not provide detailed information about the surrounding tissues or the exact nature of the obstruction, especially in a patient with a history of pelvic surgery and radiation.

Option D, Blood analysis, can provide information about the patient's renal function and possible infection (through white blood cell count and other markers) but does not directly evaluate urinary tract obstruction.

Option E, Urine analysis, would be challenging given the patient's suprapelvic catheter is not producing urine, and the presence of pus suggests an infection that needs to be addressed. While urine analysis can provide valuable information about urinary tract infections, it does not directly assess obstruction.

Option C, Abdominal-pelvic CT scan, is the most comprehensive imaging modality for evaluating urinary tract obstruction in this patient. It can provide detailed images of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and surrounding structures, helping to identify the location and nature of the obstruction. It can also help in assessing complications from the patient's surgery and radiation therapy. Given the patient's complex medical history and the need for precise imaging to guide further management, an abdominal-pelvic CT scan is the best method.

She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess.

E) Cephalexin","The patient presents with symptoms of intermittent vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in her left ear, along with a history of an untreated ear infection in the same ear. The physical examination reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane that is immobile, indicating a severe middle ear infection. The presence of nystagmus to the right and hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear further supports the diagnosis of a serious otological condition, likely labyrinthitis or a complication of otitis media such as mastoiditis or petrositis.

Given the severity of the infection and the potential for complications, the choice of antibiotic should cover a broad spectrum of pathogens, including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and should be able to penetrate into the central nervous system or the inner ear structures effectively.

Among the options provided:

- Ofloxacin (A) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity but might not be the first choice for suspected CNS or inner ear infections due to variable penetration.
- Cefepime (B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and has good penetration into the CNS, making it a suitable option for severe infections.
- Cefotaxime (C) is a third-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, and has good CNS penetration. However, its activity against certain Gram-positive cocci is less than that of some other cephalosporins.
- Amoxicillin (D) is a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic but might not be sufficient for severe infections or those caused by more resistant organisms.
- Cephalexin (E) is a first-generation cephalosporin with good activity against Gram-positive bacteria but limited activity against Gram-negative bacteria, making it less suitable for this case.

Considering the severity of the infection and the need for broad-spectrum coverage with good penetration into the inner ear structures or CNS, Cefepime (B) would be the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient.

She reports that she has not urinated for the past 2 days and that the urine leakage occurs during both day and night and is not associated with physical exertion. The medical history is significant for arterial hypertension and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and depression for 3 years. She is prescribed amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin, metformin, and amitriptyline. Her weight is 75 kg (165 lb) and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 40 in). Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.4℃ (97.5℉).

E) Prescribing prostaglandin E2","To manage this patient, let's break down the key points from the case presentation:

1. **Symptoms and Signs**: The patient presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region. These symptoms, combined with the physical examination findings of a distended urinary bladder and lower abdominal tenderness, strongly suggest urinary retention.

2. **Medical History**: The patient has poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can lead to neuropathy. The neurological examination findings of decreased Achilles reflexes, diminished fine touch, and vibratory sensation support the presence of neuropathy, which could be contributing to the urinary retention.

3. **Physical Examination**: The gynecologic examination notes bulging of the posterior vaginal wall, which could indicate pelvic organ prolapse, but this does not directly explain the urinary retention symptoms.

4. **Ultrasound Examination**: Shows an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities, further supporting the diagnosis of urinary retention.

Given these points, the immediate next step in managing this patient should focus on relieving the urinary retention to prevent further complications such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage.

**Options Analysis**:

- **A) Installing a vaginal pessary**: This might be considered for managing pelvic organ prolapse but does not address the immediate issue of urinary retention.

- **B) Bladder catheterization**: This is the most appropriate immediate step to relieve urinary retention, especially in the absence of any structural abnormalities that would prevent catheterization.

- **C) Cystostomy**: This is a more invasive procedure and would not be considered as a first-line treatment for urinary retention unless there were complications or difficulties with bladder catheterization.

- **D) Prescribing bethanechol**: This medication can be used to treat urinary retention but would not be the immediate next step, especially when a more direct and effective method like catheterization is available.

- **E) Prescribing prostaglandin E2**: This is not typically used for urinary retention and would not be the appropriate next step.

**Conclusion**: The most appropriate next step in managing this patient with urinary retention is to perform bladder catheterization to immediately relieve the retention and then consider further management options based on the underlying cause.

1005,"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years.

On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?
A) Amoxicillin
B) Cefazolin
C) Ceftriaxone
D) Levofloxacin
E) Penicillin","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presenting with a productive cough, yellow-green sputum, worsening shortness of breath, and a fever of 102°F (38.9°C). These symptoms are indicative of an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely caused by a bacterial infection. The patient's history of frequent hospitalizations for similar symptoms and his long history of smoking support this diagnosis. The presence of wheezing on pulmonary auscultation and the patient's difficulty speaking also suggest severe respiratory compromise.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the likelihood of a bacterial infection, the addition of antibiotics to his treatment regimen is warranted. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by the patient's medical history, the severity of his symptoms, and the local antibiotic resistance patterns.

Among the options provided, Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those commonly responsible for exacerbations of COPD, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is also well-tolerated and has a relatively low risk of side effects.

Therefore, the best choice for this patient is to add Levofloxacin to his treatment regimen.

""","The patient is a 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 20 weeks of gestation, with a history of a previous unremarkable pregnancy and delivery of a healthy RhD positive girl. Her blood type is A Rh-, indicating she is Rh negative. Given her Rh negativity and previous exposure to RhD positive blood (from her previous child and possibly the blood transfusion 3 years ago), there is a risk of Rh sensitization. However, her anti-D antibody screen is currently negative.

To prevent Rh sensitization, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies, anti-D immunoglobulin (also known as RhoGAM) is administered to Rh-negative mothers. The standard practice is to administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks of gestation and again postpartum if the newborn is RhD positive. This approach helps prevent the formation of antibodies against RhD positive blood, which could affect future pregnancies.

Given this information, the best next step in management is to repeat the antibody screening at 28 weeks to ensure she has not developed antibodies since the initial screening. Then, administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks to prevent Rh sensitization. Additionally, anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered after delivery if the newborn is RhD positive to further prevent sensitization.

A) Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments
B) Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host
C) Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan
D) Associated with longstanding hypertension
E) Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Progressive memory loss and confusion**: The patient has been experiencing increasing confusion over the past 6 weeks, which progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost and forgetting the names of his children. This suggests a rapidly progressive dementia.

2. **Myoclonus and ataxia**: The physical exam reveals myoclonus (rapid jerky movements) and ataxia (coordination and balance problems), which are indicative of neurological dysfunction.

3. **Paranoia and hallucinations**: The patient has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations, suggesting psychiatric or neurological involvement.

4. **Previous medical history**: The patient had a previous car crash requiring internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. There were no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago.

Given these details, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a prion disease, specifically Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, ataxia, and psychiatric symptoms. It is caused by the misfolding of prion proteins, which can occur sporadically or be transmitted through exposure to infected tissue.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) **Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments**: This is true of prion diseases like CJD. Prions are notoriously difficult to inactivate and can survive autoclaving, which is a method used to sterilize medical equipment.

B) **Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host**: This is not true of prions. Prions do not contain genetic material and can survive outside of a host, albeit not in a living state.

C) **Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan**: This is characteristic of bacteria, not prions.

D) **Associated with longstanding hypertension**: This is not a characteristic of CJD or prion diseases.

E) **Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein**: This is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, not CJD.

506,"A 42-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with decreased consciousness and convulsions. His wife reports that 30 min following the onset of her husband’s condition, which started approximately 6 hours ago, he treated his garden bed with pesticides against mice. He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications. His blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 104/min, respiratory rate is 10/min, and the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient’s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?
A) Fumarate
B) Citrate
C) Isocitrate
D) Malate
E) Succinate","To solve this question, let's break down the key information provided and relate it to the biochemical pathways involved.

1. **Sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide:** Sodium fluoroacetate is known to be toxic because it is converted into fluorocitrate in the body. Fluorocitrate is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase.

2. **Aconitase and the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle):** Aconitase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle. This cycle is crucial for cellular respiration and energy production in aerobic organisms.

3. **Effect of aconitase inhibition:** When aconitase is inhibited by fluorocitrate, the conversion of citrate to isocitrate is blocked. As a result, citrate accumulates because it cannot be converted to isocitrate.

Given this information, let's look at the options:

- A) Fumarate: Fumarate is another intermediate in the citric acid cycle, but its production is downstream of the aconitase step and would not accumulate due to aconitase inhibition.
- B) Citrate: This is the correct answer. Citrate accumulates because the enzyme that converts it to isocitrate (aconitase) is inhibited by fluorocitrate.
- C) Isocitrate: Isocitrate production is directly blocked by the inhibition of aconitase, so it would not accumulate.
- D) Malate: Like fumarate, malate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, but its production is also downstream of the aconitase step and would not accumulate due to aconitase inhibition.
- E) Succinate: Succinate is another downstream intermediate in the citric acid cycle and would not accumulate due to aconitase inhibition.

She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 141 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L

A) Expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins
B) Irregular blastic lesion
C) Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone
D) Poorly marginated lesion extending into adjacent soft tissue
E) Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 59-year-old woman has a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips, which is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension, recurrent renal stones, and previous fractures, including a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her serum findings are notable for elevated calcium levels (Ca2+: 11.2 mg/dL), decreased phosphate levels (Phosphate: 2.3 mg/dL), and elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alkaline phosphatase: 120 U/L). These laboratory results are suggestive of hyperparathyroidism, which can lead to bone resorption and the formation of brown tumors. Brown tumors are characteristic of osteitis fibrosa cystica, a condition associated with hyperparathyroidism. Radiographically, brown tumors appear as well-defined cystic lesions with peritrabecular fibrosis.

111,"A 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion. His wife states that he has been unable to recall his birthday or her name. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C 3 years ago but refused treatment. He has been treated twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is a calcium supplement. He emigrated from India 15 years ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows scleral icterus and spider angiomas. There are fine tremors of the hands bilaterally. The abdomen is distended and shifting dullness is present.

A) Pancreatic fluid leakage
B) Aseptic peritoneal inflammation
C) Neoplastic growth
D) Bacterial translocation
E) Perforated viscus","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings from the ascitic fluid analysis.

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C (untreated), previous episodes of acute pancreatitis, and now presenting with fever, abdominal pain, confusion, scleral icterus, spider angiomas, fine tremors of the hands, and a distended abdomen with shifting dullness. This clinical picture suggests advanced liver disease, likely cirrhosis given the ascites (indicated by shifting dullness) and signs of hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, inability to recall important dates or names).

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has an elevated leukocyte count, indicating an inflammatory or infectious process. The liver function tests show hypoalbuminemia, which is consistent with cirrhosis (liver not producing enough albumin). The bilirubin is mildly elevated, which can also be seen in cirrhosis.

3. **Ascitic Fluid Analysis**: The analysis shows a low albumin concentration, a glucose concentration that is not very low, and a significantly elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils (60%). The high neutrophil count in the ascitic fluid is particularly suggestive of a bacterial infection.

Given these findings, the most likely explanation is **bacterial translocation**, which is a process where bacteria move from the gastrointestinal tract to normally sterile tissues and organs, such as the peritoneal cavity, often seen in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. This condition is known as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a complication of cirrhosis.

The other options are less likely based on the information provided:
- **Pancreatic fluid leakage** would likely present with more severe abdominal pain and possibly elevated amylase or lipase levels in the ascitic fluid, which is not mentioned.
- **Aseptic peritoneal inflammation** would not typically cause such a high neutrophil count in the ascitic fluid.
- **Neoplastic growth** could cause an elevated leukocyte count but would not typically present with such acute symptoms or the specific ascitic fluid findings seen here.
- **Perforated viscus** would likely present with more severe abdominal pain, possibly pneumoperitoneum on imaging, and a more dramatic clinical picture.

713,"A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?
A) Pedunculated cervical growth
B) Inflammation of the cervix
C) Cervical trauma
D) Fetal vessels overlying cervical os
E) Premature separation of the placenta","Analyzing the situation, the 29-year-old woman, who is 24 weeks pregnant, presents with vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. The key findings include a tender, bruised cervix with a closed cervical os, and the ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall, which is not indicative of placental abruption or placenta previa.

1112,"A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient’s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient’s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient’s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3℃ (97.3℉). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient’s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies.

D) Mucosal eosinophilia
E) Villous hyperplasia","The patient's symptoms, including episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash, along with the presence of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies, are highly indicative of celiac disease. This autoimmune disorder is triggered by the ingestion of gluten, leading to inflammation and damage in the small intestine. The intestinal biopsy in patients with celiac disease typically shows villous atrophy, which is the flattening of the villi in the small intestine, and crypt hypertrophy, which is an increase in the depth of the crypts. These changes result from the immune response to gluten and lead to malabsorption of nutrients.

1033,"An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.5°F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air.

A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A) High-dose IV dexamethasone
B) Immediate debridement
C) Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics
D) Biopsy of wound
E) Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen","The patient presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity, which had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation. The physical examination reveals a severely tender area with warmth, crepitus, and a foul-smelling discharge. The pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings, which is a classic sign of necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.

Given the patient's presentation, the next best step in management would be to initiate immediate treatment to control the infection and prevent further tissue damage. This would involve surgical debridement to remove the necrotic tissue and empiric IV antibiotics to cover for a broad spectrum of pathogens.

High-dose IV dexamethasone (option A) may be considered in some cases of necrotizing fasciitis, but it is not the primary treatment and should not delay surgical debridement. Biopsy of the wound (option D) may be helpful in diagnosing the condition, but it should not delay treatment. Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen (option E) may be helpful in identifying the extent of the infection, but it should not delay surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy.

Therefore, the next best step in management is immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics.

465,"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Acute stress response
B) Antisocial personality disorder
C) Borderline personality disorder
D) Normal grief response
E) Post-traumatic stress disorder","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements presented in the scenario:

1. **Initial Presentation and Behavior**: The patient is a 22-year-old woman experiencing a spontaneous abortion, which is a traumatic event. Initially, she is grateful for the care she is receiving, indicating an attachment to the medical staff and a desire for their help.

2. **Change in Behavior Upon Receiving News**: Upon learning of the miscarriage, her behavior shifts dramatically to anger and aggression. She accuses the medical staff of incompetence and evil intentions, which is an intense emotional reaction.

3. **Destructive Behavior and Self-Harm**: The patient's behavior escalates to self-harm (new lacerations on her wrists) and destruction of property (breaking medical equipment in the room). This indicates a severe emotional dysregulation and impulsivity.

Given these observations, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Acute Stress Response**: While the patient is indeed under acute stress due to the miscarriage, her behavior (self-harm and property destruction) suggests a more complex underlying issue than a typical stress response.

- **B) Antisocial Personality Disorder**: This disorder is characterized by a disregard for others' rights, lack of empathy, and manipulativeness. However, the patient's initial gratitude and attachment to the medical staff do not align well with this diagnosis.

- **C) Borderline Personality Disorder**: This disorder is marked by unstable relationships, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and self-harm. The patient's rapid shift from gratitude to anger, accusations, self-harm, and destructive behavior are consistent with the criteria for borderline personality disorder.

- **D) Normal Grief Response**: While grief can manifest in many ways, the patient's extreme behavior, including self-harm and property destruction, goes beyond what is typically considered a normal grief response.

- **E) Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: PTSD is characterized by symptoms that occur after a traumatic event, including flashbacks, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. While the patient has experienced a traumatic event (miscarriage), her behavior in the scenario provided does not directly indicate PTSD symptoms.

Considering the above analysis, the patient's behavior aligns most closely with the criteria for borderline personality disorder due to her intense emotional dysregulation, rapid shifts in feelings towards others, self-harm, and destructive behavior.

She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5°C (38.1°F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient’s condition?
A) Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline with outpatient follow-up
B) Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission
C) Oral vancomycin with outpatient follow-up
D) Methotrexate with outpatient follow-up
E) Exploratory laparotomy","The patient presents with symptoms of lower abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting, along with a history of recent treatment for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection and irregular periods. The physical examination reveals marked tenderness in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, along with cervical motion tenderness and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. These findings are highly suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent long-term complications such as infertility and chronic pelvic pain.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms, including the presence of a fever, vomiting, and significant abdominal tenderness, outpatient treatment may not be sufficient. The patient's condition warrants close monitoring and aggressive treatment to ensure resolution of the infection and prevention of complications.

Among the provided options, choice B, intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission, is the most appropriate next step in treating this patient's condition. Cefotetan is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic effective against many of the bacteria that cause PID, including anaerobic bacteria, while doxycycline provides coverage against Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, common pathogens in PID. Inpatient admission allows for close monitoring of the patient's condition, aggressive pain management, and the ability to adjust the treatment regimen as needed.

B) Patient’s weight
C) High triglyceride levels
D) High LDL-cholesterol
E) Serum glucose level","Analyzing the patient's laboratory results, we can identify several abnormalities that may indicate the need for treatment. The patient's blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, which is considered stage 1 hypertension according to the American Heart Association. However, this level of blood pressure may not necessarily require immediate pharmacological treatment and may be managed with lifestyle modifications.

The patient's weight is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that he is obese. While obesity is a significant health concern, it is not a specific laboratory abnormality that would be an indication for treatment.

The patient's triglyceride level is 170 mg/dL, which is considered borderline high. However, the American Heart Association recommends that triglyceride levels be below 150 mg/dL. While this level may not be severely elevated, it is still a concern.

The patient's LDL-cholesterol level is 186 mg/dL, which is considered high. The American Heart Association recommends that LDL-cholesterol levels be below 100 mg/dL for individuals with no cardiovascular risk factors. Given the patient's family history of heart disease and his sedentary lifestyle, his LDL-cholesterol level is a significant concern.

The patient's serum glucose level is 105 mg/dL, which is considered impaired fasting glucose. However, this level is not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus.

Considering these factors, the most significant laboratory abnormality that is an indication for treatment is the patient's high LDL-cholesterol level. This level puts him at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and treatment with lifestyle modifications and possibly statin therapy may be necessary to reduce his risk.

An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?
A) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
B) Metabolic alkalosis
C) Variceal gastrointestinal bleeding
D) Portal vein thrombosis
E) Hypoglycemia","To determine the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient's condition, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, presenting with abdominal distension and persistent somnolence for the past 2 weeks. His physical examination reveals altered mental status, significant abdominal distension with shifting dullness and a positive fluid wave (indicative of ascites), hyperreflexia, and asterixis.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: Key laboratory findings include elevated ammonia levels (100 µg/dL) with normal electrolytes, glucose, and arterial blood gas results. The elevated ammonia level is particularly significant in the context of liver disease, as it suggests hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of cirrhosis characterized by cognitive disturbances ranging from mild confusion to coma.

3. **Imaging and Endoscopy Results**: The abdominal ultrasound confirms cirrhosis and ascites without other abnormalities. The upper GI endoscopy reveals gastric varices without active bleeding, and the MRI of the brain is insignificant, ruling out other potential causes of altered mental status.

Given these findings, the patient's condition is most consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a condition where liver dysfunction leads to an accumulation of toxins (including ammonia) in the blood, which in turn affects brain function.

**Precipitating Factors for Hepatic Encephalopathy**: Common precipitating factors include infections (such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), gastrointestinal bleeding, certain medications, and metabolic disturbances.

Considering the options provided and the patient's presentation:

- **Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)** is a common complication of ascites that can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension, fever (38.0°C or 100.4°F), and altered mental status, in the context of cirrhosis and ascites, make SBP a likely precipitating factor.

- **Metabolic Alkalosis** is not indicated by the patient's normal electrolyte and arterial blood gas results.

- **Variceal Gastrointestinal Bleeding** is not supported as there are no signs of active bleeding on endoscopy.

- **Portal Vein Thrombosis** is not suggested by the ultrasound findings.

- **Hypoglycemia** is not present according to the glucose level.

Therefore, the most likely precipitating factor for this patient's condition is Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows a normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?""
A) Acute hepatitis A
B) Choledocholithiasis
C) Autoimmune hepatitis
D) Cholecystitis
E) Pancreatitis
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant**: This type of pain is suggestive of a biliary or gallbladder pathology, given its location and character.
   
2. **Nausea and vomiting**: These symptoms often accompany biliary colic or gallbladder inflammation.

3. **No diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria**: The absence of these symptoms helps to rule out other abdominal pathologies such as gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, or kidney stones.

4. **History of resection of the terminal ileum due to Crohn's disease**: This is important because it could lead to issues with bile salt reabsorption, potentially increasing the risk of gallstones.

5. **Mild scleral icterus and elevated total bilirubin**: These findings indicate jaundice, which can result from obstruction of the bile ducts.

6. **Elevated alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT**: These laboratory findings suggest cholestasis (obstruction of bile flow) and some degree of hepatocellular injury.

7. **Abdominal ultrasonography showing a dilated common bile duct and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones**: This is highly suggestive of a gallstone obstructing the common bile duct, which would explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is a gallstone obstructing the common bile duct, which is known as choledocholithiasis. This condition would explain the biliary colic, jaundice, and laboratory evidence of cholestasis and hepatocellular injury.

684,"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fever (41.5℃ (106.7℉)) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm³, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm³), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?
A) Staphylococcus aureus
B) Streptococcus pyogene
C) Streptococcus pneumoniae
D) Neisseria meningitidis
E) Non-typeable H. influenzae","To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with fever, diarrhea, dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse, which suggests a severe systemic infection.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), indicating a severe infection that has led to sepsis.

3. **Peripheral Smear and Autopsy Findings**: The gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. This morphology is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

4. **Organism Identification**: 
   - **Staphylococcus aureus** (A) is a gram-positive cocci, but it is not typically described as lancet-shaped diplococci.
   - **Streptococcus pyogenes** (B) is a gram-positive cocci in chains, but it is not typically associated with the described morphology or the presentation.
   - **Streptococcus pneumoniae** (C) matches the description given from the autopsy specimen and is a common cause of severe infections, including pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, especially in individuals with certain predisposing conditions.
   - **Neisseria meningitidis** (D) is a gram-negative diplococci, not gram-positive, and thus does not match the description.
   - **Non-typeable H. influenzae** (E) is a gram-negative coccobacillus and does not match the gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci description.

Given the information, the organism most likely responsible for the patient's condition is **Streptococcus pneumoniae**, which is known for causing severe infections, including those leading to sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, especially in individuals with predisposing conditions.

1072,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he has not been able to walk since waking up that morning. His mother said that when he tried to get out of bed that he was unable to stand without support. He also complained of prickling in his hands and feet. Three weeks ago, he had a fever, dry cough, and a sore throat. The fever and sore throat subsided a week after they began, but the cough is persisting. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medication. His vital signs are within normal limits. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is severe weakness in both lower extremities and mild sensory loss of the hands and feet. Knee and ankle jerk reflexes are absent. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

A) Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
B) Prednisone
C) Botulism antitoxin
D) Intravenous acyclovir
E) Gabapentin","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 10-year-old boy woke up unable to walk, with severe weakness in both lower extremities, mild sensory loss in the hands and feet, and absent knee and ankle jerk reflexes. This suggests an acute neurological condition affecting the peripheral nerves.

2. **Recent Illness**: The boy had a fever, dry cough, and sore throat three weeks ago, with the fever and sore throat resolving but the cough persisting. This history could be relevant if considering post-infectious complications.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: The boy's blood work shows a normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is slightly elevated, indicating some level of inflammation. The serum electrolytes are within normal limits. The creatine kinase (CK) level is normal, which is important as it rules out muscle damage as the primary cause of weakness.

4. **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis**: The CSF shows a very low leukocyte count, normal glucose concentration, and elevated protein concentration. This profile is consistent with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.

Given these findings, the most appropriate treatment for Guillain-Barré Syndrome is **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)** or plasmapheresis. IVIG is often the first line of treatment due to its ease of administration and effectiveness in reducing the severity and duration of the illness.

C) Surgical debridement
D) Oral indomethacin therapy
E) Bone scintigraphy
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Progressive neck pain, headaches, and numbness in both hands**: These symptoms suggest involvement of the cervical spine.
2. **Intermittent lower back pain that improves with movement**: This could indicate inflammatory back pain, but the improvement with movement is somewhat atypical for inflammatory conditions.
3. **Recurrent episodes of gout**: This indicates the patient has a history of inflammatory arthritis.
4. **Intravenous heroin use**: This significantly increases the risk for infectious complications, including endocarditis and osteomyelitis.
5. **Physical examination findings of warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion in the neck, along with severe pain upon palpation over the midcervical spinal processes**: These are classic signs of an infectious or inflammatory process affecting the spine.
6. **Laboratory studies showing elevated leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and anemia**: These findings support the presence of an infectious or inflammatory condition.
7. **MRI showing signs of inflammation and a bone biopsy confirming the diagnosis**: Although the specific diagnosis isn't stated, the context suggests an infectious process, likely osteomyelitis or discitis, given the patient's history of intravenous drug use and the acute presentation.

Given these points, the most appropriate next step in management would be initiating antimicrobial therapy to cover for the most likely pathogens responsible for osteomyelitis or discitis in this context, which would include coverage for Staphylococcus aureus and possibly gram-negative organisms.

181,"A 4-month-old infant is brought to the office by his parents due to sudden nose bleeding without trauma of any kind. He has a 1-month history of multiple bruising that measures 1 cm in diameter each in the hands and feet, and tiny red spots that appeared in the upper and lower extremities without any trauma either. He has no prior bleeding history nor any relevant family history. The vital signs include: heart rate 190/min, respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 99/42 mm Hg, and temperature 36.6 °C (97.9 °F). His physical exam shows pale skin color, petechiae in the soft palate and in the upper and lower extremities as well as ecchymosis in the back of the hands and feet.

A) Von Willebrand disease
B) Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia
C) Aspirin
D) Bernard-Soulier disease
E) Scurvy","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and how they relate to the potential answers:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The infant presents with sudden nose bleeding, multiple bruising, and tiny red spots (petechiae) without any trauma. This suggests a bleeding disorder.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **Platelet Count**: Elevated at 450,000/mm^3, which is not typically associated with bleeding disorders due to thrombocytopenia but could suggest a qualitative platelet disorder.
   - **Coagulation Tests**: Normal partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR) suggest that the coagulation cascade is intact, and the problem may lie with platelet function rather than coagulation factors.
   - **Blood Smear**: Shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets. The presence of large platelets is particularly noteworthy.
   - **Platelet Aggregation Test with Ristocetin**: Normal, which helps to rule out certain platelet disorders.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Von Willebrand Disease**: Typically associated with abnormalities in the von Willebrand factor, which affects platelet adhesion. However, the normal ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test makes this less likely.

- **B) Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia**: Characterized by abnormalities in platelet aggregation due to defects in the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets. However, this condition usually presents with abnormalities in platelet aggregation tests not specifically mentioned here.

- **C) Aspirin**: Affects platelet aggregation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and thus thromboxane A2 production. However, there's no mention of aspirin use in the scenario.

- **D) Bernard-Soulier Disease**: Characterized by large platelets, thrombocytopenia (not present here, but the platelet count can sometimes be normal or slightly elevated in variants), and a deficiency in the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex, which is crucial for the initial adhesion of platelets to the damaged vessel wall. The normal ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation might initially seem to contradict this diagnosis, but some forms of Bernard-Soulier syndrome can have variable results in this test.

- **E) Scurvy**: Caused by vitamin C deficiency, leading to collagen synthesis defects and potentially bleeding symptoms. However, the laboratory findings do not directly support this diagnosis.

Considering the presence of large platelets and the clinical presentation of a bleeding disorder without clear evidence of coagulation cascade defects or thrombocytopenia, Bernard-Soulier disease becomes a plausible diagnosis despite some atypical features.

1159,"A 27-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by police when she attacked her date outside of a pizza restaurant. The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police. She seemed to be responding to internal stimuli when being initially interviewed. The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub. Since the incident, the patient has calmed down and is currently resting. She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative. Lab values are obtained and are below.

Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?
A) IM haloperidol
B) Haloperidol depot
C) Clozapine
D) Urine toxicology
E) ANA and anti-dsDNA levels","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the clues from the physical examination and laboratory results.

1. **Behavioral Disturbances and Psychiatric History**: The patient's acute episode of aggression, refusal to explain her behavior, and history of depression and anxiety suggest a psychiatric component. However, the presence of internal stimuli and the patient's later calm and cooperative demeanor hint at a more complex issue than a simple psychiatric disorder.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient's poor hygiene, odd body odor, and multiple ulcers in the oropharynx are significant. These findings, especially the ulcers, can be indicative of certain autoimmune conditions or infections but are also seen in the context of severe medication side effects or systemic diseases.

3. **Cardiac Friction Rub**: This finding suggests the presence of pericarditis, which can be due to various causes including autoimmune diseases, infections, or as a side effect of certain medications.

4. **Laboratory Results**: The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia (Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL), slightly elevated creatinine (1.7 mg/dL), and low magnesium (Mg2+: 1.5 mEq/L). The reticulocyte count is within a range that suggests an attempt to compensate for the anemia.

Given these findings, the patient's presentation seems to involve a systemic condition that could explain both the psychiatric and physical symptoms. The history of medication non-compliance and the specific physical findings (e.g., oropharyngeal ulcers, friction rub) and lab results (e.g., anemia, elevated creatinine) suggest a condition that could be autoimmune in nature or related to a systemic disease.

Option E, **ANA and anti-dsDNA levels**, is the most appropriate next step in management. These tests are crucial for diagnosing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can present with a wide range of symptoms including psychiatric disturbances, mucocutaneous manifestations (like oropharyngeal ulcers), renal involvement (suggested by the elevated creatinine), and hematologic abnormalities (such as anemia). The presence of a friction rub also aligns with SLE, which can cause pericarditis.

A) Rathke cleft cyst
B) Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome
C) Craniopharyngioma
D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia
E) Pituitary adenoma","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings:

1. **Short stature and lack of growth**: The boy's height and weight are at the 5th percentile, and he hasn't had a change in clothing or shoe size over the past year, indicating a growth issue.
2. **Visual disturbances and headaches**: He frequently bumps into obstacles and has headaches at night, which could suggest a problem affecting his vision or an intracranial issue.
3. **Polydipsia and polyuria**: His constant thirst for cold water and frequent urination are classic symptoms of diabetes insipidus.
4. **Family history**: His mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and had precocious puberty, which might hint at a genetic or familial component to his condition.
5. **Laboratory findings**: Notably, his insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is low, which is a marker of growth hormone activity. His thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels are within normal limits, ruling out primary thyroid dysfunction as the cause of his growth issues.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is something that would explain his growth hormone deficiency (as indicated by low IGF-1), visual disturbances, and symptoms of diabetes insipidus. A **craniopharyngioma** is a type of brain tumor that occurs near the pituitary gland and can cause these exact symptoms by compressing or damaging nearby structures, including the pituitary gland and optic nerves. This would lead to deficiencies in growth hormone and possibly other pituitary hormones, as well as visual disturbances due to the tumor's proximity to the optic chiasm.

A) Focussed assessment sonography for trauma (FAST)
B) Insertion of intercostal chest tube
C) CT scan of the head and neck
D) X-rays of the extremities
E) Intubation and mechanical ventilation","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **High-speed motor-vehicle collision**: The patient was involved in a severe accident, which significantly increases the risk of serious injuries, including head trauma, fractures, and internal injuries.

2. **Unrestrained passenger**: The lack of restraint increases the risk of injury, particularly to the head, chest, and abdomen, due to the potential for being thrown around the vehicle or ejected.

3. **Acute myeloid leukemia and chemotherapy**: The patient's underlying medical condition and treatment could affect his overall health, immune status, and ability to recover from injuries. However, in the immediate trauma setting, the focus is primarily on stabilizing life-threatening injuries.

4. **Vital signs and initial assessment**: The patient's vital signs show a relatively stable blood pressure and pulse but indicate potential neurological compromise (sluggish pupils, unresponsive to commands but groans, opens eyes, and withdraws extremities to painful stimuli). There are signs of potential respiratory compromise (decreased breath sounds over the right lung base), and there are obvious injuries (lacerations, bruises, possible fractures).

Given these points, the immediate priorities in trauma management are to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABCs) are stable. The patient's decreased level of consciousness and decreased breath sounds over one lung field raise concerns about his airway and respiratory status.

The most appropriate next step in management, considering the potential for respiratory compromise and the need to secure the airway, especially in a patient with a decreased level of consciousness and signs of possible lung injury, is to ensure a secure airway.

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?
A) Alcohol-induced liver injury
B) Immune response to streptococcal infection
C) Intestinal IgA deficiency
D) Myoglobin toxicity
E) Protein deposition","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with acute onset bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, recent weight loss, and a history of generalized seizures. Additionally, she admits to occasional cocaine use and binge drinking.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Anemia (Hemoglobin: 9 g/dL, Hematocrit: 30%)
   - Normal leukocyte count with normal differential
   - Normal platelet count
   - Elevated BUN and creatinine, suggesting renal impairment
   - Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), indicating liver injury
   - Positive blood alcohol level
   - Urine protein positive, indicating kidney damage

Given these findings, we need to consider the possible causes that could explain the multi-organ involvement (gastrointestinal, renal, and hepatic).

- **Alcohol-induced liver injury (A)** could explain the elevated liver enzymes but does not fully account for the renal impairment or the gastrointestinal symptoms.
- **Immune response to streptococcal infection (B)** could be a consideration given the patient's recent history of impetigo (a skin infection often caused by streptococcal bacteria). However, this does not directly explain the liver and kidney findings.
- **Intestinal IgA deficiency (C)** is not directly supported by the laboratory findings provided.
- **Myoglobin toxicity (D)** could be a consideration if the patient had significant muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis), but there is no direct evidence of this in the provided information.
- **Protein deposition (E)** does not clearly relate to the patient's presentation.

However, considering the patient's history of impetigo and the multi-organ involvement, an immune-mediated response could be a plausible explanation. Specifically, **post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)** could explain the renal impairment, and the liver enzyme elevation could be secondary to various factors including the infection itself or other toxins (e.g., alcohol). PSGN is an immune complex-mediated disease that can occur after streptococcal infections, including skin infections like impetigo. It can cause renal impairment, which is consistent with the patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels, as well as the positive protein in the urine.

Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings, considering the provided options and the clinical context, is an **immune response to streptococcal infection**, which aligns with option **B**.

308,"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?
A) Follow the daughter’s wishes to withhold the operation
B) Refer this case to the court
C) Contact another family member for consent
D) Perform the surgery without consent
E) Report the daughter to the police","In this scenario, the patient is comatose and unable to make decisions for himself. The daughter, as the patient's surrogate decision-maker, has been asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation. However, she has refused consent, citing her desire to ""live in peace"" due to the patient's past abusive and neglectful behavior towards his children.

While the daughter's feelings and experiences are understandable, her decision to withhold consent for the operation raises ethical concerns. As a surrogate decision-maker, her role is to make decisions that are in the best interests of the patient, rather than her own interests.

Given the patient's comatose state and lack of written advanced directive, the most appropriate course of action would be to refer this case to the court. The court can review the situation and make a decision that is in the best interests of the patient, taking into account the patient's medical needs and the daughter's concerns.

Referring the case to the court is the most appropriate option because it allows for an objective and impartial decision to be made, rather than relying solely on the daughter's wishes. This approach also respects the patient's autonomy and ensures that his medical needs are being met.

The other options are not appropriate because:

* Following the daughter's wishes to withhold the operation (A) would not be in the best interests of the patient and could result in harm or even death.
* Contacting another family member for consent (C) may not be feasible or appropriate, especially if the daughter is the patient's primary surrogate decision-maker.
* Performing the surgery without consent (D) would be a violation of the patient's autonomy and could result in legal and ethical consequences.

520,"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after being involved in a shooting. He sustained a gunshot wound in an altercation outside of a bar. On arrival, he is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 79/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows multiple abrasions over the arms and thorax. There is a 1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding on the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Chest tube insertion in the fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line
B) CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
C) Local wound exploration
D) Exploratory laparotomy
E) Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient is a 36-year-old man who sustained a gunshot wound. He is oriented to person but not to place or time, indicating some level of disorientation. His vital signs show tachycardia (elevated heart rate) and hypotension (low blood pressure), which are signs of potential shock. However, his oxygen saturation is normal.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: There are multiple abrasions and a 1-cm entry wound on the right side of the chest with minimal bleeding. The cardiopulmonary examination is normal, but the abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness without guarding or rebound.

3. **Diagnostic Findings**: The focused assessment with sonography (FAST) does not show obvious free fluid in the pericardium but is equivocal for the abdomen. The chest X-ray shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe, which could indicate a pulmonary contusion or other injury.

Given these points, the patient's management should focus on stabilizing his condition, addressing potential injuries, and further evaluating the extent of his injuries.

- **Option A (Chest tube insertion)** might be considered if there were clear signs of a pneumothorax or hemothorax, which are not explicitly mentioned here.
- **Option B (CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis)** is a comprehensive imaging approach that would help in identifying the extent of injuries, including potential internal injuries not immediately apparent on physical examination or initial FAST assessment. Given the patient's stable oxygen saturation and the initiation of fluid resuscitation and mechanical ventilation, this would be a logical next step to guide further management.
- **Option C (Local wound exploration)** might be considered in certain cases but does not address the potential for internal injuries.
- **Option D (Exploratory laparotomy)** is a more invasive approach that might be indicated if there were clear signs of peritonitis or severe abdominal injury, which are not clearly present here.
- **Option E (Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery)** could be considered for certain thoracic injuries but does not seem immediately indicated based on the information provided.

Considering the need for further evaluation to guide management and the lack of clear indications for immediate surgical intervention, the most appropriate next step would be to conduct a comprehensive imaging assessment.

C) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
D) Hemolytic uremic syndrome
E) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 35-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation, presenting with fever, persistent headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and bleeding gums. She also has a history of recent travel to Sri Lanka, which could be relevant for considering infectious diseases endemic to that region.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has pallor, mild scleral icterus, scattered petechiae over the trunk and back, but no lymphadenopathy. These findings suggest a hematologic issue with possible thrombocytopenia and anemia.

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **Hemoglobin**: Low at 8.2 g/dL, indicating anemia.
   - **Leukocyte count**: Normal at 10,000/mm^3.
   - **Platelet count**: Significantly low at 18,000/mm^3, indicating severe thrombocytopenia.
   - **INR and Fibrin split products**: Normal, which does not support a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
   - **Serum urea and creatinine**: Slightly elevated, indicating some degree of renal impairment.
   - **Bilirubin**: Elevated, with a predominantly indirect (unconjugated) fraction, suggesting hemolysis.
   - **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: Markedly elevated, supporting the presence of hemolysis.
   - **Urine analysis**: Shows proteinuria, hematuria, but no bacteriuria.

4. **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Not described in detail, but given the context, it might show evidence of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) HELLP syndrome**: Characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count. It's a complication of pregnancy but typically occurs later in gestation and is associated with more significant liver enzyme elevation.

- **B) Dengue hemorrhagic fever**: Given the patient's recent travel to Sri Lanka, this is a plausible diagnosis. Dengue fever can cause severe thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and hemorrhagic manifestations, fitting with the patient's presentation.

- **C) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**: Characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, fever, and neurological symptoms. While some findings align, the absence of significant renal failure and neurological symptoms makes this less likely.

- **D) Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)**: Similar to TTP but with more pronounced renal failure and less neurological involvement. The patient's mild renal impairment does not strongly support this diagnosis.

- **E) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia**: Could explain the hemolysis but does not account for the severe thrombocytopenia or the overall clinical picture.

Considering the travel history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is **B) Dengue hemorrhagic fever**.

352,"A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue. She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, """"I know I have cancer."""" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale.

A) Factitious disorder
B) Somatic symptom disorder
C) Conversion disorder
D) Primary hyperparathyroidism
E) Acute small bowel hemorrhage","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the information provided:

1. **Chief Complaint and History**: The patient is a 26-year-old nurse presenting with a 2-month history of fatigue, episodes of lower abdominal pain, and a recent 2-week sick leave. She expresses a desire to return to work but is convinced she has cancer, specifically requesting a diagnostic laparoscopy. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease and is on omeprazole.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient appears pale with a rapid pulse (120/min) and low blood pressure (90/65 mm Hg), indicating possible anemia or hypovolemia. The mental status examination reveals tiredness and a depressed mood. Physical findings include pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, numerous crusts along her left arm veins (suggestive of frequent intravenous access or injection), a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, and generalized weakness of the proximal muscles.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has a low hemoglobin level (7.5 g/dL) with a normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and an elevated reticulocyte count (13.3%), indicating anemia with an appropriate bone marrow response. Serum electrolytes, calcium, and stool occult blood test are normal or negative. Abdominal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities.

Given these findings, the patient's anemia and rapid pulse suggest blood loss, but the normal stool occult blood test and lack of abdominal abnormalities on ultrasonography make gastrointestinal bleeding less likely as the primary cause. The presence of crusts along her arm veins and her profession as a nurse raise suspicion of self-induced blood loss or other manipulative behaviors.

**Factitious Disorder (A)** is characterized by the intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological symptoms, often for the purpose of assuming the sick role. This diagnosis fits with the patient's unexplained anemia, rapid pulse, low blood pressure, and the presence of crusts along her veins, suggesting possible self-induced phlebotomy or other forms of blood loss. Her insistence on having cancer and request for invasive diagnostic procedures despite lack of evidence also support this diagnosis.

**Somatic Symptom Disorder (B)** involves excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to somatic symptoms that cause significant distress and result in a substantial disruption of daily life. While this patient does exhibit excessive concern about her symptoms, the key feature here is the likely intentional production of symptoms, which aligns more with Factitious Disorder.

**Conversion Disorder (C)**, now referred to as Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder, involves neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition. This does not fit well with the patient's presentation of anemia and signs of blood loss.

**Primary Hyperparathyroidism (D)** is not supported by the patient's normal calcium levels.

**Acute Small Bowel Hemorrhage (E)** is unlikely given the negative stool occult blood test and lack of abdominal abnormalities on ultrasonography.

A) Activation of the antithrombin enzyme
B) Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme
C) Inhibition of the ADP receptors
D) Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors
E) Blockage of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors","To address this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient is a 75-year-old man presenting with a racing heart and lightheadedness for 3 hours, symptoms that have recurred but never lasted this long. He has a history of myocardial infarction and is on medications including captopril, metoprolol, and atorvastatin.

2. **Clinical Findings**: His pulse is irregular, and cardiac auscultation reveals an irregular heart rhythm. The ECG shows the absence of P-waves with an irregular RR complex, which is indicative of atrial fibrillation (AF), a type of arrhythmia characterized by rapid and irregular heart rhythms.

3. **Laboratory Reports**: The reports show normal electrolyte levels, renal function, and lipid profiles. Cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no acute myocardial infarction.

4. **Treatment and Mechanism**: The patient is discharged with an additional anticoagulation drug. The primary concern in atrial fibrillation is the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke. Anticoagulation therapy is prescribed to prevent these events.

Given the context, let's examine the options:

- **A) Activation of the antithrombin enzyme**: This is the mechanism of action for heparin, which is not typically the first-line anticoagulant for long-term management of atrial fibrillation but could be used in acute settings.

- **B) Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme**: This is the mechanism of action for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are not used as anticoagulants in this context.

- **C) Inhibition of the ADP receptors**: This is the mechanism of action for antiplatelet drugs like clopidogrel, which might be used in some cardiovascular conditions but is not the primary choice for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation.

- **D) Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors**: This is the mechanism of action for warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant for long-term prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation.

- **E) Blockage of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors**: This is the mechanism of action for certain antiplatelet drugs used in acute coronary syndromes, not typically for long-term anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation.

Considering the need for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and the mechanisms listed, the most appropriate choice for long-term management to prevent thromboembolic events would be the inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which is how warfarin works.

D) Initiate hemodialysis
E) Perform CT scan with contrast of the abdomen","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the information provided:

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient is a 64-year-old man with a 2-day history of lower back pain, fever, chills, and nausea. He has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He also has a history of smoking and a recent amputation of his left third toe due to a non-healing ulcer.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has a fever of 39.4°C (102.9°F), tachycardia (pulse of 102/min), and elevated blood pressure (150/94 mm Hg). There is a 1-cm round ulcer on the sole of his right foot and costovertebral angle tenderness on the left side, indicating possible pyelonephritis.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has an elevated leukocyte count (19,000/mm^3), indicating an infection. His serum creatinine is elevated at 2.4 mg/dL, suggesting worsening kidney function. The urine analysis shows blood, protein, a high number of white blood cells (WBC), positive nitrite, and numerous WBC casts, all of which are indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI), specifically pyelonephritis given the systemic symptoms and costovertebral angle tenderness.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms, including systemic signs of infection (fever, chills), the presence of costovertebral angle tenderness, and the laboratory evidence supporting a diagnosis of pyelonephritis, along with his underlying chronic kidney disease and diabetes, which increase the risk of complications from infections, the most appropriate management would be to initiate treatment that effectively targets the likely bacterial pathogens responsible for pyelonephritis.

Considering the patient's complicated presentation and the need for close monitoring due to his underlying conditions, outpatient treatment would not be the best option. Among the choices provided, inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics would be the most appropriate next step to ensure effective treatment of the infection and to monitor the patient's condition closely.

Given the patient's presentation and the need for effective treatment against common urinary pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, given his complicated UTI presentation, the choice of antibiotic should cover these organisms effectively.

A) Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors
B) Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets
C) Deficiency of von Willebrand factor
D) Excess circulating thrombin
E) Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and laboratory findings. The patient is six days post-aortic valve replacement surgery and presents with bluish discolorations around peripheral intravenous catheters, severe right leg pain, multiple hematomas on the upper extremities, and a tender, erythematous, and swollen right calf. Laboratory studies show a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) at 48,000/mm3, a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 15 seconds, and a slightly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 40 seconds.

The combination of thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT, and aPTT, along with the clinical presentation of hematomas and a swollen, painful leg, suggests a coagulopathy. Given the recent surgery and the use of prophylactic unfractionated heparin, one of the primary concerns would be a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is caused by the formation of antibodies against the complex of heparin and platelet factor 4, leading to platelet activation, thrombocytopenia, and paradoxically, an increased risk of thrombosis due to the excess circulating thrombin.

Among the options provided:

A) Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors would primarily affect the PT and possibly aPTT but does not directly explain the thrombocytopenia or the clinical presentation of thrombosis.

B) Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets describes a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), which does not fully account for the prolonged PT and aPTT or the context of recent heparin use.

C) Deficiency of von Willebrand factor would primarily affect platelet adhesion and aggregation, leading to bleeding manifestations, but does not explain the prolonged PT and aPTT or the specific context of this case.

D) Excess circulating thrombin is a consequence of the coagulopathy seen in HIT, where the immune response to heparin leads to increased thrombin generation, which in turn consumes platelets and clotting factors, leading to thrombocytopenia and prolonged coagulation times.

E) Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation is a component of the pathophysiology of HIT but is more specifically described by the mechanism involving excess circulating thrombin as a result of the immune response to heparin.

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is the excess circulating thrombin due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

961,"A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a “nagging” headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient’s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Hematocrit: 60%
Leukocyte count: 10,050 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 350,000/mm^3

Which of the following underlies the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
A) Medication side effect
B) Myeloproliferative neoplasm
C) Neuronal hyperexcitability
D) Toxic exposure
E) Viral infection","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Patient's Symptoms**: The patient presents with a headache and dizziness that have been ongoing for a month. These symptoms are nonspecific but can be indicative of various conditions. The recent onset of dizziness and nausea that resolves when stepping outside to shovel snow might suggest a condition that improves with physical activity or a change in environment.

2. **Medical History**: The patient has hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma, for which he is taking amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. None of these conditions or medications directly point to a cause for his current symptoms.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: The most striking abnormality in the patient's lab results is an elevated hemoglobin (20 g/dL) and hematocrit (60%). These values are significantly above the normal range, indicating polycythemia, which is an increase in the number of red blood cells in the blood.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that leads to an overproduction of red blood cells. Among the options provided:

- **A) Medication side effect**: None of the patient's medications are known to cause significant polycythemia as a side effect.
- **B) Myeloproliferative neoplasm**: This category of diseases includes conditions like polycythemia vera, which is characterized by the overproduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets due to a mutation in the JAK2 gene. This condition fits the patient's laboratory findings.
- **C) Neuronal hyperexcitability**: This does not directly relate to the patient's laboratory findings of polycythemia.
- **D) Toxic exposure**: There's no indication in the patient's history of exposure to toxins that could cause polycythemia.
- **E) Viral infection**: While some viral infections can affect blood cell production, they are not typically associated with significant polycythemia.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings is a myeloproliferative neoplasm, specifically polycythemia vera, which can cause an increase in blood viscosity leading to symptoms like headache and dizziness due to decreased blood flow to the brain.

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?
A) Overflow proteinuria
B) Transient (functional) proteinuria
C) Tubular proteinuria
D) Orthostatic proteinuria
E) Isolated proteinuria","To determine the category of proteinuria the patient is experiencing, let's analyze the provided information. The patient has complaints of increased fatigue and back pain that have progressively worsened over the past few months. His laboratory results show anemia (low hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL), elevated creatinine (2.7 mg/dL) indicating impaired kidney function, hypercalcemia (elevated calcium of 12.1 mg/dL), and proteinuria without hematuria or pyuria.

Given the presence of anemia, renal impairment, and hypercalcemia, along with the patient's symptoms of fatigue and back pain, a systemic condition affecting multiple systems, including the kidneys, is likely. The most common cause of such a presentation would be a paraproteinemia, such as multiple myeloma, which can lead to overflow proteinuria due to the excessive production of light chains that exceed the kidney's reabsorptive capacity.

Overflow proteinuria is characterized by the presence of large amounts of protein in the urine due to conditions that lead to an overproduction of proteins, such as multiple myeloma. This type of proteinuria is not typically associated with significant kidney damage in the early stages but can lead to renal impairment over time due to the toxic effects of light chains on renal tubules.

Considering the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the patient's proteinuria best fits the category of overflow proteinuria.

609,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child’s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents’ death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
A) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway
B) Aminolevulinic acid synthetase of the heme metabolism pathway
C) Adenosine deaminase of the purine metabolism pathway
D) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway
E) Thymidylate synthetase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway","To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Behavioral Changes and Physical Symptoms**: The boy exhibits violent behavior, tries to hurt himself, shows facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements. These symptoms suggest a severe neurological or psychiatric condition.

2. **Medications**: The boy has been taking multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. Allopurinol is particularly notable as it is used to treat high levels of uric acid in the blood and is often prescribed for conditions like gout or for patients with certain types of cancer undergoing chemotherapy. However, in the context of a 10-year-old boy, especially one with neurological symptoms, its use might indicate a different condition.

3. **Lack of Teeth**: The boy has had no teeth since the age of 2. This is an unusual symptom that, combined with the others, points towards a specific condition.

4. **Parental Death and Medication Cessation**: The boy stopped taking his medications after his parents' death, which likely exacerbated his condition.

Given these points, the condition that fits best is Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which is involved in the purine metabolism pathway. This deficiency leads to an overproduction of uric acid, which can cause severe neurological symptoms, including those described in the scenario. The lack of teeth can also be associated with this condition due to the high levels of uric acid affecting tooth development.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by severe gout, kidney problems, and neurological symptoms including self-mutilation, which aligns with the boy's behavior of trying to hurt himself. The use of allopurinol in his medication regimen further supports this diagnosis, as it is used to manage the high uric acid levels associated with this condition.

310,"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. The patient’s vitals are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 39/min, and temperature 37.1°C (98.8℉). On physical examination, the patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15 and is cyanotic. There are open fractures of the left femur and left tibia, a likely shoulder dislocation, multiple contusions on the limbs and thorax, and a puncture wound on the left side of his chest. There are no breath sounds on the left side and there is hyperresonance to percussion on the left. Preparations are made for an emergency needle thoracostomy to be performed to treat this patient’s likely tension pneumothorax. Which one of the following is the best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure?
A) The patient’s closest relatives (spouse, child or parent), who must be brought to the hospital as fast as possible
B) One of the witnesses at the scene of the car accident, who should be brought to the hospital as fast as possible
C) The hospital ethics committee
D) Informed consent is not needed in this case
E) The hospital lawyer should immediately give temporary medical power of attorney to a member of the hospital ethics committee who will make all the medical decisions for the patient only until the patient is conscious again.","In emergency situations where a patient is unconscious and unable to provide informed consent, the priority is to save the patient's life and prevent further harm. The concept of ""implied consent"" applies in such scenarios, assuming that a reasonable person would want to receive life-saving treatment if they were able to consent.

Given the patient's critical condition with a likely tension pneumothorax, immediate intervention is necessary to prevent further deterioration. The emergency needle thoracostomy is a life-saving procedure that cannot wait for consent from relatives or other parties.

The options provided regarding obtaining consent from relatives, witnesses, the hospital ethics committee, or involving the hospital lawyer in granting temporary medical power of attorney are not applicable in this urgent situation. These processes would cause unacceptable delays in treating the patient's life-threatening condition.

Therefore, the best choice is that informed consent is not needed in this case, as the emergency nature of the situation dictates immediate action to save the patient's life.

706,"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?
A) Diabetic polyuria
B) Overactive detrusor muscle
C) Primary polydipsia
D) Urethral hypermobility
E) Vescicovaginal fistula","Analyzing the patient's symptoms, the 35-year-old woman is experiencing progressive urinary leakage that has worsened over the past year, initially occurring during athletic exercise but now also happening when she laughs or coughs. This pattern suggests stress incontinence, which is the involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. The patient's history of two childbirths, including a vaginal delivery, increases her risk for stress urinary incontinence due to potential pelvic floor muscle weakening. The observation of urine leakage when the patient is asked to Valsalva during the examination supports this diagnosis. Among the options provided, urethral hypermobility is a common cause of stress urinary incontinence, where the urethra moves excessively during increases in abdominal pressure, leading to inadequate closure and leakage. The other options do not align as closely with the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

823,"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a change in his skin color. The patient went on a long hike this morning, and his girlfriend noticed that his skin had changed color when they were driving home. The patient has a past medical history of marijuana use, IV drug use, alcohol use, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, fluticasone, and ibuprofen. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 10/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory studies are ordered and are seen below.

Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL
Hematocrit: 32%
Leukocyte count: 5,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 207,000/mm^3

Physical exam is notable for a patient with skin that appears yellow/orange. Cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?
A) A pathology responsive to sofosbuvir
B) Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity
C) Hyperpigmentation of the liver
D) Increased consumption of beta-carotene
E) Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient presents with a change in skin color, described as yellow/orange, which was noticed after a long hike. This suggests jaundice, which is a sign of hyperbilirubinemia.

2. **Laboratory Studies**:
   - Hemoglobin and hematocrit are slightly low, which could indicate mild anemia but are not directly related to the skin color change.
   - Leukocyte and platelet counts are within normal limits, suggesting no acute infection or thrombocytopenia.
   - Serum bilirubin levels are elevated (total bilirubin 11.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 7.8 mg/dL), which directly correlates with the patient's jaundice. The elevation in both total and direct bilirubin suggests a liver or biliary issue rather than a purely hemolytic cause.

3. **Physical Exam**: The patient's skin appears yellow/orange, consistent with jaundice. Other exams are within normal limits, indicating no other obvious signs of liver disease or other pathology.

Given the information, let's evaluate the options:

A) **A pathology responsive to sofosbuvir**: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used to treat hepatitis C. While hepatitis C can cause liver dysfunction and jaundice, there's no specific indication in the patient's history or labs that points directly to hepatitis C as the cause.

B) **Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity**: This enzyme is involved in the conjugation of bilirubin. A deficiency, as seen in Gilbert's syndrome, would primarily affect the conjugation of bilirubin, leading to an increase in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, which is not the case here.

C) **Hyperpigmentation of the liver**: This option does not directly relate to the patient's presentation of jaundice.

D) **Increased consumption of beta-carotene**: Beta-carotene can cause a yellow/orange discoloration of the skin, but it does not cause an increase in bilirubin levels.

E) **Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT**: This pattern can be seen in alcoholic liver disease, which could explain the patient's jaundice due to liver dysfunction. The patient's history of alcohol use supports this possibility.

Given the patient's history of alcohol use and the presentation of jaundice with elevated direct bilirubin, the most likely underlying pathology is related to alcoholic liver disease, which would be associated with increased liver enzymes, often with AST > ALT.

160,"A 9-year-old boy is brought to a physician by his mother for evaluation of generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst. The mother mentions that her boy is always tired, and seems to be getting worse. He prefers watching television rather than going out and playing with other kids. Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian. The pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. He is in the bottom 10th percentile for height and weight according to his age. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. He recently had a urinalysis that showed elevated urinary calcium excretion.

What is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Renal artery stenosis
B) Primary hyperaldosteronism
C) Bartter's syndrome
D) Pheochromocytoma
E) Gitelman's syndrome","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 9-year-old boy with symptoms of generalized weakness, increased urination (polyuria), and increased thirst (polydipsia). He also has a history of frequent constipation since birth and cravings for salty foods. He is short and underweight for his age.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The urinalysis shows elevated urinary calcium excretion. Serum electrolytes reveal low potassium (hypokalemia) with normal sodium and chloride levels. The plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration are both elevated.

Given these findings, the patient's condition seems to involve renal electrolyte wasting, particularly of potassium and calcium, along with an overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), as indicated by the high plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration.

**Differential Diagnosis**:

- **Bartter's Syndrome (C)**: This is a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to impaired sodium, potassium, and chloride reabsorption. It results in hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated renin and aldosterone levels. The symptoms and lab findings in this case are consistent with Bartter's syndrome, especially the elevated urinary calcium excretion, which is a hallmark of this condition.

- **Gitelman's Syndrome (E)**: This condition is similar to Bartter's syndrome but involves a defect in the distal convoluted tubule. It typically presents with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypomagnesemia, but urinary calcium excretion is usually low, not elevated.

- **Primary Hyperaldosteronism (B)** and **Renal Artery Stenosis (A)** would typically cause hypertension, which is not present in this case.

- **Pheochromocytoma (D)** is a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines, causing hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms not matching this patient's presentation.

**Conclusion**: The combination of clinical presentation and laboratory findings, particularly the elevated urinary calcium excretion, hypokalemia, and elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, points towards Bartter's syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.

A) Ultrasonography of the neck
B) Echocardiography
C) Warfarin therapy
D) CT angiography of the head
E) Digital subtraction angiography of the neck","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements from the patient's history and physical examination that will guide us towards the most appropriate next step in management.

1. **History and Physical Examination Findings:**
   - The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gout.
   - He reports occasional episodes of weakness and numbness in his left hand.
   - He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years, which significantly increases his risk for vascular diseases.
   - Physical examination reveals a bruit on the right side of the neck, which is indicative of turbulent blood flow, often associated with stenosis of the carotid artery.

2. **Clinical Significance of Findings:**
   - The presence of a carotid bruit is a significant finding that suggests carotid artery stenosis, which is a risk factor for stroke.
   - Given the patient's history of vascular disease and the presence of a bruit, further evaluation of the carotid arteries is warranted to assess for stenosis.

3. **Options for Next Steps:**
   - **A) Ultrasonography of the neck:** This is a non-invasive, first-line imaging modality for assessing the carotid arteries and determining the degree of stenosis. It's an appropriate initial step for evaluating carotid artery disease.
   - **B) Echocardiography:** While useful for evaluating cardiac structure and function, it's not directly relevant to the assessment of carotid artery stenosis.
   - **C) Warfarin therapy:** Anticoagulation may be considered in certain cases of carotid artery disease, especially if there's a high risk of stroke, but it's not the next step without first confirming the diagnosis and assessing the degree of stenosis.
   - **D) CT angiography of the head:** This provides detailed images of the cerebral and carotid vasculature and can be used to evaluate stenosis, but it's typically reserved for situations where ultrasonography is inconclusive or not feasible.
   - **E) Digital subtraction angiography of the neck:** This is an invasive procedure that provides detailed images of blood vessels and is usually reserved for cases where intervention (like angioplasty or stenting) is planned.

Given the patient's presentation and the need for a non-invasive initial assessment of the carotid arteries, ultrasonography of the neck is the most appropriate next step in management.

His past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, well managed with rosuvastatin, and hypertension, well managed with hydrochlorothiazide. His current medications also include aspirin. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. His laboratory tests are significant for the following:
WBC 29,500/mm3
Hematocrit 26.1%
Hemoglobin 9.1 g/dL

On physical examination, there is palpable, firm, non-tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally. He also has moderate splenomegaly, which, when palpated, elicits pain. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?
A) Doxorubicinrn
B) Bleomycinrn
C) Imatinib
D) Fludarabinern
E) Vincristinern","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Initial Presentation and Diagnosis**: The patient was initially asymptomatic but had laboratory findings significant for a high WBC count (29,500/mm3) with a predominance of small normocytic lymphocytes (92%) on the peripheral blood smear. This, combined with the results from the bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry, led to a diagnosis that was being monitored.

2. **Later Presentation**: Three years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presents with symptoms of lymphadenopathy (swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes), unintentional weight loss, rib pain, and moderate splenomegaly that is painful upon palpation. These symptoms suggest a progression or transformation of the initial condition.

Given the progression of symptoms and the specific findings of lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and systemic symptoms like weight loss, it's suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder that has transformed or progressed. The initial description is consistent with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), which can sometimes transform into a more aggressive lymphoma, such as Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), known as Richter's transformation.

**Treatment Options**:

- **A) Doxorubicin**: An anthracycline antibiotic that is a common chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of various cancers, including lymphomas.
- **B) Bleomycin**: A chemotherapeutic agent used in treating certain types of cancer, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, but less commonly used in non-Hodgkin lymphomas like DLBCL.
- **C) Imatinib**: A tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), not typically used in the treatment of lymphomas.
- **D) Fludarabine**: A purine analog used in the treatment of CLL and some other lymphoproliferative disorders, but not the first choice for transformed or aggressive lymphomas.
- **E) Vincristine**: A vinca alkaloid used in chemotherapy for various cancers, including lymphomas, often as part of a combination regimen.

Given the likely diagnosis of a transformed lymphoma, such as DLBCL (considering the progression from CLL), the best treatment approach would typically involve aggressive chemotherapy. Among the options provided, **Doxorubicin** is a key component of the R-CHOP regimen (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin (Doxorubicin), Oncovin (Vincristine), and Prednisone), which is the standard first-line treatment for DLBCL.

A) Hepatotoxicity
B) Lipodystrophy
C) Megaloblastic anemia
D) Myelosuppression
E) Peripheral neuropathy","To address this question, let's break down the key points and the medications involved.

The patient is HIV-positive and was initially started on a regimen of tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, due to a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, the decision was made to replace abacavir with ritonavir.

Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is often used in combination with other medications to achieve viral suppression. However, like all medications, ritonavir has potential side effects.

Among the options provided, the adverse effects mentioned are:

A) Hepatotoxicity - While ritonavir can cause liver enzyme elevations, this is not the most directly associated adverse effect compared to others listed.

B) Lipodystrophy - This is a condition characterized by abnormal fat distribution in the body and is a known side effect of certain antiretroviral therapies, including protease inhibitors like ritonavir.

C) Megaloblastic anemia - This condition is related to the use of certain medications that affect folate or vitamin B12 metabolism but is not directly associated with ritonavir.

D) Myelosuppression - This is a condition where the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells is decreased. While some antiretroviral drugs can cause myelosuppression, ritonavir is not as commonly associated with this side effect.

E) Peripheral neuropathy - This condition involves damage to the peripheral nerves and can be caused by certain antiretroviral drugs, but it is more commonly associated with the ""d-drugs"" (didanosine, stavudine, zalcitabine) rather than ritonavir.

Given the options, the patient is at greatest risk for lipodystrophy (B) as a result of the change in the medication regimen to include ritonavir, a protease inhibitor known to be associated with this condition.

368,"A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉).

What is the proper next step in the management of this woman?
A) Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum
B) Recommend pregnancy termination
C) Arrange a chorionic villus sampling
D) Recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19
E) Test for rubella virus PCR","Analyzing the situation, the 22-year-old gravida 1 presents with symptoms of a rash, watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain, which could be suggestive of a viral infection. Given her recent contact with her younger sister who was diagnosed with rubella infection, there is a concern for potential rubella infection in the patient. However, the serology results indicate that the patient has a high avidity for rubella IgG, both currently and as measured 1 year ago, with no detectable IgM antibodies. This suggests that the patient has had a past infection or vaccination against rubella and is likely immune.

The presence of a rash and other symptoms could be due to another viral infection, such as parvovirus B19, which can cause similar symptoms. However, the primary concern in this case is the potential risk to the fetus if the patient were indeed infected with rubella. Given the high avidity of the IgG antibodies and the absence of IgM antibodies, the risk of acute rubella infection is low.

Therefore, the proper next step in the management of this woman is to reassure her about the low risk of rubella infection and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum if necessary, to ensure she is protected against future infections.

A) Hyperhomocysteinemia
B) Antithrombin III deficiency
C) Factor V Leiden
D) Protein C deficiency
E) Antiphospholipid syndrome","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 21-year-old man presenting with sudden onset of swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg, which started 2 hours ago. This acute presentation is suggestive of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

2. **Family History**: His father has a history of pulmonary embolism, which is a significant risk factor for the patient, suggesting a possible inherited thrombophilic condition.

3. **Risk Factors**: The patient smokes one pack of cigarettes daily, which is a known risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including DVT and pulmonary embolism.

4. **Physical Examination**: The findings of a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg, with severe pain in the calf upon dorsiflexion of the left foot, are classic for DVT.

5. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has a normal platelet count, normal prothrombin time, slightly elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and positive fibrin split products, which are consistent with a diagnosis of DVT.

6. **Ultrasonography**: The findings confirm the presence of a DVT with incompressibility of the popliteal vein, a hyperechoic mass, and absent blood flow.

Given these points, the patient's symptoms are most likely caused by a DVT. Considering the family history of pulmonary embolism and the patient's young age, an inherited thrombophilic condition is likely. Among the options provided:

- **Hyperhomocysteinemia (A)** is a condition associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, but it is not as directly linked to a family history of pulmonary embolism as some other conditions.
- **Antithrombin III deficiency (B)** is a rare condition that significantly increases the risk of thrombosis, but it is less common than some other inherited thrombophilias.
- **Factor V Leiden (C)** is the most common inherited thrombophilic condition, characterized by a mutation in the factor V gene that makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C. This condition significantly increases the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism, especially in individuals with a family history of these conditions.
- **Protein C deficiency (D)** is another inherited thrombophilic condition, but it is less common than Factor V Leiden.
- **Antiphospholipid syndrome (E)** is an acquired condition characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, but it does not fit as well with the patient's family history.

Given the patient's presentation, family history, and the prevalence of Factor V Leiden in the population, this is the most likely cause of his symptoms.

Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?
A) Elevated TSH
B) High Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score
C) Improved symptoms with carbidopa/levodopa administration
D) Positive anti-CCP antibodies
E) Positive urine toxicology","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and joint pain**: These symptoms can be associated with several conditions, including hypothyroidism, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the combination of these symptoms, particularly weight gain and constipation, suggests a metabolic issue.

2. **Palpitations, increased stool frequency, and hand tremor 6 months ago**: These symptoms are suggestive of hyperthyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.

3. **Current symptoms of slow speech and movement, tenderness to palpation of wrist and ankle joints, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes**: These are classic signs of hypothyroidism. The delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes is particularly indicative of hypothyroidism.

4. **Family history**: While the patient's family history includes Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, these conditions do not directly explain the patient's current symptoms.

5. **Past medical history and social history**: The patient's asthma and past experimentation with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) do not directly relate to her current symptoms.

Given these points, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with hypothyroidism, particularly given the progression from symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism to those of hypothyroidism. This progression can be seen in conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, where an initial hyperthyroid phase can be followed by a hypothyroid phase due to thyroid gland damage.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be an elevated Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level, which is indicative of hypothyroidism.

532,"A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room (ER) by her co-workers after they found her unconscious in her cubicle when they returned from lunch. They tell you that she has diabetes but do not know anything more about her condition. The woman’s vital signs include: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 24/min, temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is breathing heavily and gives irrelevant responses to questions. The skin and mucous membranes appear dry. Examination of the abdomen reveals mild diffuse tenderness to palpation. Deep tendon reflexes in the extremities are 1+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Finger stick glucose 630 mg/dL
Arterial blood gas analysis:

The patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A) Infuse NaHCO3 slowly
B) Switch fluids to 0.45% NaCl
C) Start IV insulin infusion
D) Replace potassium intravenously
E) Start IV 5% dextrose","The patient is presenting with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), as evidenced by the high finger stick glucose level of 630 mg/dL, positive ketones in the urine, and the arterial blood gas analysis showing a pH of 7.1 with low bicarbonate levels. The patient's symptoms, such as unconsciousness, dry skin and mucous membranes, and mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, are also consistent with DKA.

The initial management with a bolus of intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) is aimed at correcting the hypovolemia and improving the patient's hemodynamic status. The next step in the management of DKA involves correcting the hyperglycemia and acidosis.

Starting an IV insulin infusion is crucial in the management of DKA as it helps to lower the blood glucose levels and suppress ketone production. This should be done after the initial fluid bolus, as insulin will help to correct the metabolic derangements.

The other options are not the next best step in management. Infusing NaHCO3 slowly (Option A) may be considered in severe acidosis, but it is not the immediate next step after fluid bolus. Switching fluids to 0.45% NaCl (Option B) may be done later in the management, but not as the next step. Replacing potassium intravenously (Option D) is important, but it should be done after the initial fluid and insulin management, and when the patient's potassium levels are found to be low. Starting IV 5% dextrose (Option E) is not appropriate in the initial management of DKA as it may worsen the hyperglycemia.

603,"A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?
A) Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.
B) Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.
C) Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of progestins.
D) Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of estrogens.
E) Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of progestins.","To address this question, let's break down the key elements. The patient is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis against meningococcal meningitis and is currently using combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician advises additional contraception methods, specifically suggesting that her husband use condoms. This implies that the rifampin may interfere with the effectiveness of the OCPs.

Rifampin is a known inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP3A4. This enzyme system is involved in the metabolism of various drugs, including the hormones in OCPs, such as estrogens and progestins. By inducing CYP3A4, rifampin increases the metabolism of these hormones, potentially reducing their plasma concentrations and, consequently, the effectiveness of the OCPs.

The correct explanation for the need for additional contraception is that rifampin induces the enzymes that metabolize the hormones in OCPs, making them less effective. However, the options provided do not directly mention enzyme induction but rather focus on other potential mechanisms.

Among the given options, none directly states that rifampin induces CYP3A4, which metabolizes both estrogens and progestins, thereby reducing the effectiveness of OCPs. However, option B is the closest to being correct in terms of mentioning the interaction with CYP3A4, but it incorrectly states that rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, whereas it actually induces it.

Given the explanations provided and the mechanisms described, none of the options perfectly matches the correct mechanism of rifampin inducing CYP3A4 and thereby reducing the effectiveness of OCPs. However, based on the closest relationship to the correct mechanism, the answer would be related to the interaction with CYP3A4.

409,"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician after elevated liver function tests were found after a routine screening. He has had occasional headaches over the past year, but otherwise feels well. The patient reports that he was involved in a severe car accident 30 years ago. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He has never used illicit intravenous drugs. He takes no medications and has no known allergies. His father had a history of alcoholism and died of liver cancer. The patient appears thin. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

A liver biopsy is performed and shows mononuclear infiltrates that are limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
A) Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy
B) Tenofovir and velpatasvir therapy
C) Interferon and ribavirin therapy
D) Tenofovir and entecavir therapy
E) Schedule a follow-up in 6 months","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings:

1. **Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** The patient has elevated alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, indicating liver injury or inflammation.
2. **Hepatitis C Antibody Positive and HCV RNA Positive:** These results confirm that the patient is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is a common cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer.
3. **HCV Genotype 1:** Knowing the genotype of HCV is important for guiding treatment decisions, as different genotypes respond differently to various antiviral therapies.
4. **Liver Biopsy Findings:** The biopsy shows mononuclear infiltrates limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis, which is consistent with chronic hepatitis C infection.

Given these points, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate antiviral therapy to treat the hepatitis C infection. The goal of treatment is to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR), which is considered a cure for HCV infection.

Among the treatment options listed:

- **Sofosbuvir and Ledipasvir Therapy (Option A):** This combination is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy that has been shown to be highly effective in treating HCV genotype 1 infection. It is an all-oral regimen that is generally well-tolerated and has a high cure rate.

- **Tenofovir and Velpatasvir Therapy (Option B):** While tenofovir is used in the treatment of hepatitis B and HIV, and velpatasvir is used in combination with sofosbuvir for HCV, this specific combination is not the standard for HCV genotype 1 treatment.

- **Interferon and Ribavirin Therapy (Option C):** This was the traditional treatment for HCV but has largely been replaced by DAA therapies due to their better efficacy and tolerability.

- **Tenofovir and Entecavir Therapy (Option D):** This combination is more commonly used for the treatment of hepatitis B, not HCV.

- **Schedule a Follow-up in 6 Months (Option E):** Given the patient's active HCV infection, waiting 6 months without initiating treatment would not be appropriate.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management, given the patient's HCV genotype 1 infection and the current treatment guidelines, is to initiate treatment with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir.

927,"A 48-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus complicated by peripheral neuropathy presents to the emergency department for a foot wound that he noticed. He denies any pain, fevers, or chills. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 150/80 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 22/min. An ulcer with associated erythema and purulence is noted on his foot. Based on his radiography, he is diagnosed with osteomyelitis and admitted to the hospital for partial amputation of his right foot. He is given appropriate prophylaxis for tetanus and discharged 5 hospital days later on antibiotics. He returns to the emergency department one week later with difficulty breathing. His temperature is 98°F (37°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 27/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air.

What is the next best step in management?
A) Complete blood count, type and screen, and order 1 unit of blood
B) CT angiography of the chest and give oxygen
C) D-dimer and lower extremity Dopper ultrasound
D) Deep wound culture and start piperacillin-tazobactam
E) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and give oxycodone","To approach this question, let's break down the patient's presentation and history. The patient is a 48-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus complicated by peripheral neuropathy, who recently underwent a partial amputation of his right foot due to osteomyelitis. He now presents to the emergency department one week later with difficulty breathing, tachycardia (pulse of 130/min), and decreased oxygen saturation (92% on room air). His amputated foot stump shows signs of possible infection (erythematous and edematous), but it is not tender to palpation, likely due to his peripheral neuropathy.

Given his recent history of surgery and current presentation, the most concerning diagnosis would be a pulmonary embolism (PE), especially considering his immobility and recent surgery, which are risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequently PE. The symptoms of difficulty breathing, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation are consistent with a pulmonary embolism.

The next best step in management would be to investigate for a pulmonary embolism. Among the options provided, the most appropriate initial step would be to order a CT angiography of the chest, which is a standard diagnostic tool for pulmonary embolism, and to give oxygen to help manage his decreased oxygen saturation.

552,"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?
A) Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes
B) Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase
C) Decreased proteolysis
D) Increased lipoprotein lipase activity
E) Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells","Let's break down the scenario step by step to understand the patient's condition and the expected outcome.

The 13-year-old boy presents with confusion, abdominal pain, vomiting, frequent urination, excessive thirst, and significant weight loss over a short period. His vital signs indicate hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypothermia. The physical examination reveals disorientation, deep and labored breathing (Kussmaul breathing), and diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding, which are signs of a severe metabolic disturbance.

The laboratory results show a pH of 7.19, indicating severe acidosis, and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL, which is extremely high. These findings are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus.

DKA occurs when there is a severe deficiency of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates glucose metabolism. In the absence of sufficient insulin, glucose cannot enter cells, leading to hyperglycemia. The body then breaks down fat for energy, producing ketones, which accumulate in the blood and cause acidosis.

Considering the options provided, the most likely expectation in this patient is decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes. Insulin plays a crucial role in facilitating glucose uptake by cells, including adipocytes. In the absence of sufficient insulin, glucose uptake by adipocytes is impaired, leading to hyperglycemia.

25,"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Intubate with mechanical ventilation
B) Perform needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space
C) Perform bronchoscopy
D) Provide helium and oxygen mixture
E) Provide additional dose of methylprednisolone","The child was initially treated for an asthma exacerbation with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium, as well as intravenous methylprednisolone. However, after one hour, the child became limp and lethargic, which is a concerning sign indicating possible respiratory failure. The absence of wheezing on repeat pulmonary examination could be a sign of severe airway obstruction, where the child is not able to generate enough airflow to produce wheezing sounds. Given the child's lethargy and the sudden absence of wheezing, the most likely explanation is that the child is experiencing severe respiratory depression or failure.

In this scenario, the most appropriate next step in management would be to secure the child's airway and provide mechanical ventilation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. This is a critical step to prevent further deterioration and potential cardiac arrest.

1113,"An 18-year-old patient is visiting the pediatrician with her mother for her annual exam before college starts. Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn’t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, “Nobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I’ll end up getting rejected.” Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter’s behavior?
A) Schizotypal personality disorder
B) Generalized anxiety disorder
C) Avoidant personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Dependent personality disorder","To address this question, let's break down the key components of the daughter's behavior and the concerns expressed by her mother.

1. **Social Isolation and Loneliness**: The daughter is described as being socially isolated and feeling lonely, which indicates difficulties in forming and maintaining social relationships.

2. **Sensitivity to Criticism**: She is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family members, which suggests a deep-seated fear of rejection or criticism.

3. **Lack of Participation in Extracurricular Activities**: Despite her interests in art and music, she hasn't participated in any extracurricular activities due to feelings of being untalented and unwanted.

4. **Negative Self-Perception**: Her statements about being ""too lame and ugly"" and fearing rejection indicate a significantly negative self-perception and low self-esteem.

5. **Avoidance Behavior**: She avoids social interactions and opportunities (like inviting friends over or taking a higher-paying job as a cashier) due to fear of rejection or criticism.

Given these observations, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Schizotypal Personality Disorder**: Characterized by eccentric behavior, anomalies of thinking and speech, and deficits in interpersonal relatedness, but not specifically by fear of rejection or criticism.

- **B) Generalized Anxiety Disorder**: Involves excessive worry about various things for at least six months, which can include social situations, but the primary issue here seems more focused on avoidance due to fear of rejection rather than generalized anxiety.

- **C) Avoidant Personality Disorder**: Characterized by pervasive feelings of social inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection, and social inhibition. Individuals with this disorder avoid social interactions due to fear of criticism or rejection, which closely matches the daughter's behavior.

- **D) Paranoid Personality Disorder**: Involves a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others, which doesn't directly align with the daughter's fear of rejection and criticism based on her perceived inadequacy.

- **E) Dependent Personality Disorder**: Characterized by a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation. While there might be some dependency on her mother's reassurance, the primary issue seems to be her avoidance of social interactions due to fear of rejection.

Based on the information provided, the daughter's behavior aligns most closely with the criteria for Avoidant Personality Disorder, given her pervasive feelings of social inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism, and avoidance of social interactions due to fear of rejection.

1126,"A 15-year-old female presents to her pediatrician’s office for severe menstrual cramping. The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being “really heavy” and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes. The patient had normal development throughout childhood, is on the soccer team at school, and is not sexually active. Her father has hypertension and her mother has endometriosis and heavy periods. On exam, the patient is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 pounds (BMI 26.3 kg/m^2). She is well appearing and has no abdominal tenderness. She has Tanner IV breasts and Tanner IV pubic hair, and external genitalia are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient’s menstrual cramps?
A) Von Willebrand factor antigen assay
B) Pelvic ultrasound
C) MRI of the pelvis
D) NSAIDs
E) Increased exercise","To address the patient's severe menstrual cramping, we need to consider both the diagnosis and the management of her symptoms. The patient's history of irregular periods that became regular, along with severe cramping and heavy bleeding, suggests a possible underlying condition such as primary dysmenorrhea, which is common in adolescents and young women. The fact that she has a family history of endometriosis, a condition known to cause severe pelvic pain and heavy menstrual bleeding, also needs to be considered. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not immediately suggest endometriosis or other structural abnormalities.

Given the patient's symptoms of severe menstrual cramping and the absence of any indications of a more serious underlying condition on physical examination, the best initial approach would be to manage her symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea and can significantly reduce menstrual cramps. They work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which is involved in generating menstrual cramps.

While imaging studies like pelvic ultrasound or MRI of the pelvis could be considered if the patient's symptoms do not respond to initial management or if there are suspicions of structural abnormalities, they are not the immediate next step without more specific indications. Similarly, a von Willebrand factor antigen assay would be more relevant if the patient's primary issue was heavy menstrual bleeding that was not manageable with standard measures, suggesting a possible bleeding disorder.

Increased exercise is beneficial for overall health and might have some benefits for menstrual cramps, but it is not a specific treatment for severe menstrual cramping and would not be sufficient as the sole next step.

Therefore, the best next step for managing this patient's menstrual cramps, given the information provided, is to recommend NSAIDs to alleviate her symptoms.

1116,"A 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease becomes acutely anemic in the setting of underlying infection. Her mother denies any previous history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. The patient’s past medical history is significant for a few episodes of acute pain crisis and a need for splenectomy 3 years ago. The vital signs upon arrival include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 106/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min and regular, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and fingernails are pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air and electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia. A blood transfusion is initiated. Shortly after the transfusion has begun, the patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the intravenous (IV) site, and sudden hypotension. What is the name of this reaction, and what is the best treatment?
A) Minor allergic reaction; administer antihistamines
B) Nonhemolytic febrile reaction; administer antihistamines
C) Minor allergic reaction; discontinue transfusion
D) Hemolytic transfusion reaction; administer antihistamines
E) Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements provided:

1. **Patient Background**: A 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease, which is a condition that affects hemoglobin production and can lead to various complications including anemia and increased risk of infections.

2. **Current Situation**: The patient becomes acutely anemic in the setting of an underlying infection, necessitating a blood transfusion.

3. **Reaction to Transfusion**: Shortly after the transfusion begins, the patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the IV site, and sudden hypotension.

Given these symptoms, we need to identify the type of transfusion reaction and the appropriate treatment.

- **Minor Allergic Reaction**: Typically presents with mild symptoms such as urticaria or itching. Treatment usually involves administering antihistamines and possibly continuing the transfusion at a slower rate.

- **Nonhemolytic Febrile Reaction**: Characterized by an increase in temperature during or shortly after the transfusion, often accompanied by chills or rigors. Treatment may involve administering antipyretics and, in some cases, temporarily halting the transfusion.

- **Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction**: A severe reaction that occurs when the transfused blood is incompatible with the recipient's blood type, leading to the destruction of red blood cells. Symptoms can include fever, chills, flank pain, and potentially life-threatening complications. The immediate treatment involves discontinuing the transfusion.

Considering the severity of the symptoms described (fevers, chills, burning sensation at the IV site, and sudden hypotension), the reaction is most consistent with a hemolytic transfusion reaction. The best course of action in such a scenario is to immediately discontinue the transfusion to prevent further complications.

2. **Past Medical History**: The patient has hypertension and rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that can be associated with various systemic complications, including renal involvement.

3. **Medications**: The patient is taking amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker for hypertension), methotrexate (an immunosuppressant for rheumatoid arthritis), and ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID).

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has pallor, periorbital edema, pedal edema, ascites, swan-neck deformities, and nodules on multiple fingers, indicating chronic rheumatoid arthritis and fluid overload.

5. **Laboratory Studies**: Key findings include low hemoglobin, normal prothrombin time, low serum albumin, significant proteinuria, and normal kidney function tests (urea and creatinine). The urine analysis shows proteinuria without hematuria or bacteriuria.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's nephrotic syndrome is related to his rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of developing secondary amyloidosis (AA amyloidosis), where serum amyloid A (SAA) protein deposits in various tissues, including the kidneys, leading to proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.

1270,"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent diarrhea and fatigue for 1 month. She has had up to 12 watery stools per day. Sometimes she awakens at night because she has to defecate. She has abdominal bloating and cramps. She has had a 2-kg weight loss in the past month. She returned from a trip to Costa Rica 7 weeks ago. She has a history of bronchial asthma and bulimia nervosa. She works as a nurse. She does not smoke and drinks 1–2 beers on the weekend. Current medications include fish oil, a multivitamin, and a salbutamol inhaler. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. Abdominal and rectal examinations are unremarkable. Laboratory studies show:

Abdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Colonoscopy shows dark colored mucosa with interspersed white spots. Biopsies of colonic mucosa are obtained and sent for pathological evaluation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?""
A) Celiac disease
B) Carcinoid tumor
C) VIPoma
D) Irritable bowel syndrome
E) Medication abuse","Analyzing the patient's symptoms, the 38-year-old woman is experiencing persistent diarrhea and fatigue for 1 month, with up to 12 watery stools per day, abdominal bloating, cramps, and a 2-kg weight loss. Her recent travel to Costa Rica could suggest an infectious cause, but the duration and severity of symptoms, along with the absence of fever, make this less likely. The colonoscopy findings of dark-colored mucosa with interspersed white spots are suggestive of melanosis coli, a condition associated with long-term use of laxatives. Given her history of bulimia nervosa, a condition often associated with laxative abuse, this becomes a more plausible explanation. The laboratory studies do not indicate any significant electrolyte imbalances that would point towards other causes like a VIPoma or carcinoid tumor. Celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome could present with similar gastrointestinal symptoms but do not typically cause the colonoscopy findings described. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is laxative abuse, which is directly related to her history of bulimia nervosa.

689,"A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and binge drinks alcohol after work and on the weekends. He underwent an appendectomy when he was 14 years old. He is a long-distance truck driver. Neither of his parents had any significant medical history. His temperature is 37.7°C (100°F), blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and BMI is 25 kg/m2. On examination, his right first metatarsophalangeal joint is very tender, swollen, warm, and red in color. Range of motion cannot be assessed due to extreme tenderness.
Laboratory test
Complete blood count:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 16,000/mm3
Platelets 150,000/mm3

Appearance Cloudy, dense yellow
WBC 30,000 cells/µL
Culture Negative
Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?
A) Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion
B) Increased renal reabsorption of urate
C) Lysis of large numbers of cells
D) Deficiency of HGPRT
E) High-purine diet","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient is a 55-year-old man presenting with acute onset of severe pain in his right toe, specifically the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which is tender, swollen, warm, and red. This presentation is classic for gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often the big toe.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The laboratory findings support the diagnosis of gout. The complete blood count shows an elevated leukocyte count, indicating an inflammatory response. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated, which is a nonspecific marker of inflammation. The synovial fluid analysis is crucial; it shows a cloudy, dense yellow appearance with a high white blood cell count and, most importantly, the presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals. These crystals are monosodium urate crystals and are pathognomonic for gout.

Given the diagnosis of gout, let's consider the underlying causes:

- **A) Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion**: This can lead to decreased urate excretion and is a mechanism by which certain medications or substances can contribute to hyperuricemia and gout. However, it's not the most direct link to the patient's lifestyle or presentation.

- **B) Increased renal reabsorption of urate**: While increased reabsorption can contribute to hyperuricemia, there's no specific indication in the patient's history that would make this the most likely cause.

- **C) Lysis of large numbers of cells**: This can occur in conditions such as cancer or during chemotherapy, leading to a rapid release of intracellular contents, including nucleic acids, which are metabolized to uric acid. However, there's no mention of such conditions in the patient's history.

- **D) Deficiency of HGPRT (Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase)**: This enzyme deficiency leads to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe gout, intellectual disability, and self-mutilation. This is not applicable to the patient described.

- **E) High-purine diet**: The patient's lifestyle, including binge drinking alcohol, can contribute to an increased intake of purines, which are metabolized to uric acid. Alcohol, especially beer and liquor, can also decrease urate excretion. Given the patient's history of binge drinking, this is the most likely underlying cause of his gout.

1107,"A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Bipolar I disorder
B) Bipolar II disorder
C) Cyclothymic disorder
D) Persistent depressive disorder
E) Schizoaffective disorder","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Episodes of Depressed Mood:** The patient reports several periods of depressed mood over the past 3 years. These episodes are characterized by depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and poor appetite but do not seem to be triggered by specific life events. They resolve after 4-6 weeks.

2. **Episodes of Elevated Mood:** The patient also experiences occasional episodes of elevated mood, during which she is very productive and requires less sleep than usual. These episodes have been occurring over the past ten years.

3. **Impact on Functioning:** During episodes of both depressed and elevated mood, there is some impact on her functioning, but it is notable that she can sometimes enjoy activities with her family during the depressed episodes.

4. **Duration and Frequency:** The episodes of both depressed and elevated mood have been recurring over several years, but the exact frequency is not specified.

Given these details, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Bipolar I Disorder:** This diagnosis requires at least one manic episode, which is not clearly described in the scenario. While the patient experiences episodes of elevated mood, there is no indication that these episodes meet the full criteria for mania (e.g., marked impairment in social or occupational functioning, need for hospitalization, or presence of psychotic features).

- **B) Bipolar II Disorder:** This diagnosis requires at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. The patient's episodes of elevated mood could be considered hypomanic, but the description of her depressive episodes does not clearly meet the criteria for major depressive episodes, particularly in terms of duration and severity.

- **C) Cyclothymic Disorder:** This diagnosis involves periods of hypomanic symptoms alternating with periods of depressive symptoms that last at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents); however, the symptoms do not meet diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode. The patient's history of episodes of elevated and depressed mood that do not meet the full criteria for hypomania or major depression and have been occurring over several years fits this description.

- **D) Persistent Depressive Disorder:** This diagnosis requires a depressed mood for most of the day, more days than not, for at least 2 years. While the patient experiences episodes of depressed mood, the description also includes episodes of elevated mood, which is not characteristic of persistent depressive disorder.

- **E) Schizoaffective Disorder:** This diagnosis requires a period of at least 2 weeks where there are psychotic symptoms (hallucinations or delusions) in the absence of a major depressive or manic episode. There is no mention of psychotic symptoms in the patient's presentation.

Based on the information provided, the patient's pattern of episodes of elevated and depressed mood that do not meet the full criteria for hypomania or major depression and have been occurring over several years best fits the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder.

A) Reversal of TIPS
B) Paracentesis
C) Administer IV ceftriaxone
D) Administer lactulose
E) Administer vitamin B1","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement a month ago. She presents with increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, irritability, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness over the past week, along with difficulty recalling her husband's name or their address. These symptoms suggest hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease characterized by cognitive disturbances ranging from mild confusion to coma.

The presence of scleral icterus, jaundice, telangiectasias, palmar erythema, and a mildly distended abdomen with shifting dullness are all indicative of advanced liver disease. The flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed, also known as asterixis, is a classic sign of hepatic encephalopathy.

Given the clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step in management is to address the hepatic encephalopathy directly. Administering lactulose is the standard treatment for hepatic encephalopathy as it reduces ammonia production in the gut, which is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.

A) Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption.
B) Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products.
C) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.
D) The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed.
E) This patient has no contraindications for bupropion and may safely use it.","The patient is a 36-year-old man with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who has tried quitting several times using different nicotine replacement products without success. He is interested in trying an antidepressant that he heard can help with smoking cessation, which is likely bupropion. Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant that is also approved for smoking cessation. However, it is essential to consider the patient's medical history before prescribing bupropion.

The patient has a history of head trauma followed by two seizure episodes, but he is not currently on any antiepileptic medication. Bupropion is known to lower the seizure threshold, which means it can increase the risk of seizures, especially in individuals with a history of seizure disorders. Given this information, it is crucial to assess the risk of seizures associated with bupropion in this patient.

Among the provided options, the statement that bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder is accurate. This is a significant concern for the patient, and the physician should carefully weigh the risks and benefits before prescribing bupropion.

508,"A 68-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a cough, dyspnea, and fever for 1 day. The cough is productive of small amounts of green phlegm. He has metastatic colon cancer and has received three cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; his last chemotherapy session was 2.5 months ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years.

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
A) Ceftriaxone and azithromycin
B) Ertapenem
C) Colistin
D) Cefepime and levofloxacin
E) Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 68-year-old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent chemotherapy.
2. **Symptoms**: Presents with cough, dyspnea, fever, and productive green phlegm, indicating a respiratory infection.
3. **Vital Signs**: High fever (39.1°C), tachycardia (112/min), tachypnea (32/min), hypotension (88/69 mm Hg), and low oxygen saturation (88% on room air), suggesting severe infection and potential sepsis.
4. **Pulmonary Examination**: Diffuse crackles and rhonchi, consistent with a lower respiratory tract infection.
5. **Chest X-ray**: Left upper-lobe infiltrate, indicating pneumonia.
6. **Gram Stain**: Shows gram-negative rods from the endotracheal aspirate, pointing towards a gram-negative bacterial infection.
7. **Recent Chemotherapy and COPD History**: Increases the risk for opportunistic infections and may affect the choice of antibiotics due to potential resistance.

Given these points, the patient requires broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for a severe, potentially life-threatening infection, likely caused by gram-negative bacteria. The choice of antibiotics should consider the patient's recent chemotherapy, which may predispose him to certain infections, and his history of COPD, which may affect the type of pathogens involved.

- **Option A (Ceftriaxone and azithromycin)**: This combination is often used for community-acquired pneumonia but may not provide adequate coverage for the gram-negative rods identified, especially considering the patient's recent chemotherapy and potential for resistant organisms.
- **Option B (Ertapenem)**: A carbapenem antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity, including against many gram-negative bacteria. However, it might not be the best choice as a monotherapy in this scenario due to the potential for resistance and the severity of the infection.
- **Option C (Colistin)**: Typically reserved for infections caused by multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteria. While it could be effective, it's not usually the first-line choice due to its potential nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity.
- **Option D (Cefepime and levofloxacin)**: This combination provides broad-spectrum coverage, including against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria, which is important given the patient's immunocompromised state and history of COPD. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with activity against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, and levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that adds additional coverage against gram-negative pathogens.
- **Option E (Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate)**: This combination is more typically used for community-acquired pneumonia in patients without recent chemotherapy or a history of COPD. It may not provide adequate coverage for the gram-negative rods identified in this patient.

Considering the severity of the infection, the patient's immunocompromised state, and the need for broad-spectrum coverage against gram-negative bacteria, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a combination that offers strong coverage against a wide range of pathogens, including potentially resistant organisms.

The physical exam reveals a short, overweight child with nonpitting edema, decreased reflexes, a drop in systolic blood pressure upon standing, papilledema, and bitemporal hemianopsia. These findings are highly suggestive of a pituitary tumor, specifically a craniopharyngioma, which is a common cause of hypopituitarism and can lead to visual disturbances due to its proximity to the optic chiasm. The laboratory results show hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic acidosis, which are consistent with adrenal insufficiency, a common consequence of pituitary dysfunction. Additionally, the low TSH and free T4 levels indicate hypothyroidism, further supporting the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.

Given the presence of a likely pituitary tumor causing hypopituitarism and the patient's significant symptoms, the necessary treatment involves addressing both the tumor and the hormonal deficiencies. Surgical resection is typically the first line of treatment for craniopharyngiomas to relieve pressure on surrounding structures and to remove the tumor. However, considering the patient's significant symptoms and the potential for the tumor to be aggressive or inoperable, a combination of treatments might be necessary.

447,"A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?
A) Headache and tinnitus
B) Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits
C) Dyslipidemia and hypoglycemia unawareness
D) Pedal edema and flushing
E) Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity","To approach this question, let's break down the key components:

1. **Diagnosis of Brugada Syndrome**: This is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. It is often associated with mutations in the genes that encode parts of the cardiac sodium channel.

2. **Prescribed Medication**: The patient is prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which works by blocking sodium channels and thus slowing the phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. This class of drugs is often used in managing arrhythmias in patients with Brugada syndrome.

3. **Side Effects of High Doses**: The question asks about the most likely side effects if the drug is taken in high doses. Given the description of the drug as a sodium channel blocker with additional effects on potassium channels, and having mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity, we can narrow down the options based on known side effects of similar drugs.

Let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Headache and tinnitus**: These could be potential side effects of various medications but are not as directly related to the specific actions described for this drug.

- **B) Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits**: These side effects are associated with amiodarone, a class III anti-arrhythmic drug, which does not match the description given.

- **C) Dyslipidemia and hypoglycemia unawareness**: These are not typical side effects directly associated with the mechanism of action described for the class I anti-arrhythmic drug in question.

- **D) Pedal edema and flushing**: These could be related to the alpha-blocking activity mentioned, as alpha-blockers can cause vasodilation leading to orthostatic hypotension and potentially flushing. However, the specific combination of pedal edema and flushing as primary concerns for high doses of this drug is less clear without more specific information about the drug's pharmacology.

- **E) Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity**: Amiodarone, a different class of anti-arrhythmic drug, is known for causing hypothyroidism and phototoxicity. However, this does not align with the description of the drug provided.

Given the information and focusing on the effects that could be related to the described mechanism of action (sodium channel blockade, potassium channel blockade, anticholinergic effects, and alpha-blocking activity), none of the options perfectly align with common side effects of class I anti-arrhythmic drugs taken in high doses based on the standard pharmacological profiles. However, considering the closest match with the general effects of drugs that might have anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activities, and without a direct match to known side effects of the exact drug class described, the logical deduction process here might not directly lead to a single correct answer without more specific pharmacological details.

However, if we were to choose based on the closest match to potential side effects related to the broad categories of action described (and acknowledging the provided options do not perfectly align with typical side effects of class I anti-arrhythmics), we might lean towards side effects that could plausibly result from anticholinergic or alpha-blocking actions, though none are directly listed as typical for class I anti-arrhythmics.

Given the constraints of the question and the provided options, a direct logical deduction to a single answer isn't fully supported without more specific information about the drug's side effect profile. However, for the purpose of providing an answer within the constraints given:

242,"A 41-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with abdominal pain. He says that the pain “comes and goes” throughout the day and usually lasts 20-30 minutes per episode. He can point to the spot 1-2 inches above the umbilicus where he feels the pain. He denies any feeling of regurgitation or nighttime cough but endorses nausea. He reports that he used to eat three large meals per day but has found that eating more frequently improves his pain. He tried a couple pills of ibuprofen with food over the past couple days and thinks it helped. He has gained four pounds since his past appointment three months ago. The patient denies any diarrhea or change in his stools. He has no past medical history. He drinks 5-6 beers on the weekend and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denies any family history of cancer. On physical exam, he is tender to palpation above the umbilicus. Bowel sounds are present. A stool guaiac test is positive. The patient undergoes endoscopy with biopsy to diagnose his condition.

Which of the following is most likely to be found on histology?
A) Mucosal defect in the stomach
B) Urease-producing organism in the small intestine
C) PAS-positive material in the small intestine
D) Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine
E) Crypt abscesses in the large intestine","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the information provided:

1. **Abdominal pain location and characteristics**: The pain is located 1-2 inches above the umbilicus, which suggests a possible issue related to the stomach or the proximal part of the small intestine (duodenum). The pain is episodic, lasting 20-30 minutes, and improves with eating more frequently.

2. **Symptoms and absence of symptoms**: The patient denies regurgitation or nighttime cough, which are common symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, he endorses nausea. The absence of diarrhea or changes in stools makes conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) less likely.

3. **Improvement with ibuprofen and eating**: The improvement of symptoms with ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID) and eating could suggest a condition that involves inflammation or irritation of the mucosa that is temporarily relieved by these measures.

4. **Positive stool guaiac test**: This indicates the presence of occult blood in the stool, which can be a sign of mucosal bleeding.

5. **Endoscopy with biopsy**: This is a diagnostic procedure that allows for the direct visualization of the upper gastrointestinal tract (including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) and the collection of tissue samples for histological examination.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that causes mucosal defects or ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, leading to pain, nausea, and occult bleeding. The improvement with NSAIDs and eating more frequently could be due to the temporary reduction of acid production or the buffering effect of food, respectively.

Considering the options provided:

- **A) Mucosal defect in the stomach**: This would be consistent with a gastric ulcer, which could explain the patient's symptoms and the positive stool guaiac test.
- **B) Urease-producing organism in the small intestine**: This refers to Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a common cause of peptic ulcers but is not directly described as a mucosal defect.
- **C) PAS-positive material in the small intestine**: This is indicative of Whipple's disease, which is a rare bacterial infection causing malabsorption, not directly related to the symptoms described.
- **D) Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine**: This is characteristic of Crohn's disease, a type of IBD, which typically presents with diarrhea and weight loss, not primarily with the symptoms described here.
- **E) Crypt abscesses in the large intestine**: This is indicative of ulcerative colitis, another type of IBD, primarily affecting the colon and presenting with diarrhea and rectal bleeding, not matching the patient's symptoms.

A) Henoch-Schönlein Purpura
B) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
C) Hemolytic uremic syndrome
D) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
E) Disseminated intravascular coagulation
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 2-year-old boy presents with pallor and increasing lethargy, which followed an episode of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. These symptoms suggest a gastrointestinal infection, which is further supported by the recent travel history to Mexico, a region where such infections are common.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **Hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL** indicates anemia.
   - **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 94 μm^3** is within the normal range, suggesting normocytic anemia.
   - **Leukocyte count of 18,000/mm^3** is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response.
   - **Platelet count of 45,000/mm^3** is significantly low, indicating thrombocytopenia.
   - **Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)** are within normal limits, which does not support a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
   - **Serum urea nitrogen and creatinine are elevated**, indicating renal impairment.
   - **Bilirubin levels** show a predominance of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, which is consistent with hemolysis.
   - **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is significantly elevated**, a marker of hemolysis.
   - **Blood smear shows schistocytes**, which are fragmented red blood cells indicative of mechanical damage to red cells, typically seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

Given these findings, the differential diagnoses can be narrowed down based on the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes, elevated LDH, indirect bilirubin elevation), thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment.

- **Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (A)**: While it can cause abdominal pain and renal impairment, it typically presents with palpable purpura and does not usually cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

- **Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (B)**: Characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, fever, and neurological symptoms. However, the patient's presentation lacks the characteristic neurological symptoms.

- **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (C)**: Typically presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury, often following a diarrheal illness caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. This matches the patient's presentation closely.

- **Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (D)**: Primarily causes isolated thrombocytopenia without microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or renal impairment.

- **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (E)**: Would typically present with prolonged PT and PTT, which are not significantly abnormal in this case.

Based on the analysis, the patient's presentation is most consistent with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), given the combination of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, and the preceding diarrheal illness.

""","The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of intravenous cocaine and heroin use, presenting with fever, chills, and generalized weakness. His physical examination reveals track marks on both cubital fossae, retinal hemorrhages with pale centers, and a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border. Laboratory studies show an elevated leukocyte count, and transthoracic echocardiography reveals multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. These findings are highly suggestive of infective endocarditis, particularly right-sided endocarditis given the patient's history of intravenous drug use.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate antibiotic therapy that covers the most likely pathogens responsible for infective endocarditis in this patient population. Given the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among intravenous drug users, an antibiotic with MRSA coverage is essential.

Among the options provided, intravenous vancomycin therapy is the most appropriate choice because vancomycin has excellent coverage against MRSA and is commonly used as an initial empiric therapy for suspected MRSA infections, including right-sided infective endocarditis.

718,"Two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis, a 63-year-old woman has severe pain in her lower back. The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg.

An x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
A) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C) Elder abuse
D) Pseudohypoparathyroidism
E) Primary hyperparathyroidism","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Severe lower back pain** that radiates down the legs, with an intensity of 8 out of 10, developing two hours after admission for dialysis.
2. **History of chronic kidney disease (CKD)**, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder.
3. **Medications** include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer.
4. **Laboratory findings** show a mild anemia (Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL), normal leukocyte count, slightly low platelet count, elevated serum potassium, and significantly elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, consistent with CKD.
5. **Imaging** reveals a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra.

Given these details, the most likely explanation for the patient's findings is related to her chronic kidney disease. CKD can lead to a complex metabolic disorder affecting bone health, known as renal osteodystrophy. This condition encompasses various skeletal abnormalities, including those caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of CKD.

**Secondary hyperparathyroidism** in CKD is primarily caused by impaired phosphate excretion, decreased calcium levels, and the inability to activate vitamin D, all of which lead to an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Elevated PTH stimulates the release of calcium from bones, potentially leading to bone softening and an increased risk of fractures, such as the wedge compression fracture seen in this patient.

While **tertiary hyperparathyroidism** also involves elevated PTH levels, it typically develops from prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, where the parathyroid glands become autonomously functioning, leading to persistent PTH elevation even after the resolution of the underlying cause. This condition seems less directly related to the patient's acute presentation.

**Primary hyperparathyroidism** involves an intrinsic abnormality of the parathyroid glands (such as an adenoma or hyperplasia) leading to excessive PTH secretion. It is not directly related to CKD.

**Pseudohypoparathyroidism** involves resistance to PTH action, which is not indicated in this scenario.

**Elder abuse** is a critical consideration in cases of unexplained injuries or fractures in elderly patients. However, the clinical context provided does not directly support this as the most likely explanation for the patient's findings, especially given the presence of CKD and related metabolic disturbances.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's findings, considering her history of CKD and the development of a wedge compression fracture, is secondary hyperparathyroidism.

229,"A 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue. He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms “most of the time.” On physical exam, the patient’s temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Chikungunya
B) Dengue fever
C) Epstein-Barr virus
D) Hepatitis A
E) Typhoid fever","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Travel History**: The patient recently returned from a 2-week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia, which puts him at risk for various tropical diseases.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with worsening headache, malaise, pain in his hands and wrists, and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. These symptoms are suggestive of a systemic infection, possibly of a tropical nature given his travel history.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints and the presence of a maculopapular rash are significant. The tourniquet test is negative, which is often used to assess for capillary fragility and is a common finding in certain hemorrhagic fevers, but its negativity does not rule out all tropical infections.

4. **Laboratory Results**: The patient has a low leukocyte count (leukopenia) and a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), which are indicative of bone marrow suppression or a consumptive process. The liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are elevated, suggesting liver involvement.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Chikungunya**: Characterized by severe joint pain and fever, but it typically does not cause significant laboratory abnormalities like leukopenia and thrombocytopenia to the extent seen here.

- **B) Dengue Fever**: Known for causing severe flu-like symptoms, including high fever, joint pain, and a characteristic rash. Laboratory findings often include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, all of which are present in this case.

- **C) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**: While EBV can cause fever, rash, and liver enzyme elevation, it is less likely given the patient's travel history and the specific combination of symptoms and lab findings.

- **D) Hepatitis A**: Primarily causes liver inflammation and would not typically present with the combination of joint pain, rash, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia seen here.

- **E) Typhoid Fever**: Can present with fever, headache, and rash, but the laboratory findings of significant leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, along with the specific travel history and symptoms, make it less likely.

Considering the above analysis, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are most consistent with Dengue fever, given the travel history to regions where Dengue is endemic, the presence of severe joint pain, rash, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

925,"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of left knee pain as well as stiffness upon waking for about 10–15 minutes. The pain is worse after standing a lot at work and when she climbs stairs. There is no history of trauma. She has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Her mother died of metastatic breast cancer 15 years ago, at the age of 65 years. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include atorvastatin, labetalol, and aspirin. Over the past 2 months, she has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed for the joint pain. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31.8 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 114/68 mm Hg. Examination of the left knee shows tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line; there is crepitus and pain with full flexion and extension. Serum uric acid concentration is 8.0 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee?
A) Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray
B) Calcification of synovia and cartilage on ultrasound
C) Diffuse lytic-sclerotic bone lesions on x-ray
D) Joint effusion and pannus on ultrasound
E) Fluid-filled pouch on ultrasound","The patient is a 58-year-old woman presenting with a 3-month history of left knee pain and stiffness, particularly after standing for long periods at work and when climbing stairs. The absence of trauma and the nature of her pain suggest a degenerative condition. Her medical history includes hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, and she has been managing her knee pain with over-the-counter ibuprofen. The physical examination reveals tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line, crepitus, and pain with full flexion and extension of the left knee. These findings are characteristic of osteoarthritis (OA), a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects weight-bearing joints like the knees.

The serum uric acid concentration is within a relatively normal range, which makes gout less likely. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is slightly elevated but not significantly enough to suggest an inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis.

Given these details, the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee would be changes associated with osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints, leading to bone-on-bone contact and the formation of osteophytes (bone spurs) as the body attempts to repair the damage. Joint-space narrowing is a hallmark of OA due to the loss of cartilage.

The answer is [A]."
782,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?
A) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
B) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
C) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
D) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
E) A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.","To detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions, we need to understand the role of blotting techniques in identifying specific molecules. Northern blot is used for RNA detection, Southern blot for DNA detection, and Western blot for protein detection. Given that the researcher aims to detect HIF-1a, which is a protein, the appropriate technique would be Western blot.

In the context of RCC under normoxic conditions, the cells mimic a hypoxic state by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, leading to an accumulation of HIF-1a protein. This means that even though the cells are in a normoxic environment, they behave as if they were in a hypoxic environment by stabilizing HIF-1a and preventing its degradation.

Therefore, when comparing RCC cells under normoxic conditions to normoxic control cells (which do not have the mechanism to inhibit HIF-1a hydroxylation and thus degrade HIF-1a under normoxia), we would expect an increase in HIF-1a protein levels in the RCC cells. This is because the RCC cells are able to stabilize HIF-1a, whereas the control cells are not.

Given this understanding, the statement that a Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control cell is the most accurate description of the expected outcome of the researcher's experiment.

B) Transabdominal ultrasonography
C) Barium enema
D) Anorectal manometry
E) Rectal suction biopsy","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the physical examination findings. The patient is a 3-week-old newborn presenting with poor feeding, irritability, frequent vomiting that is greenish in color and has a strange smell, and a history of constipation (one bowel movement daily). The physical examination reveals small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally, which are suggestive of a congenital condition. The abdomen is distended, and the explosive release of stool following a rectal exam is indicative of a bowel obstruction.

The x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air, which is suggestive of a mechanical obstruction. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel, leading to a functional obstruction.

To confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease, a test that directly assesses the presence or absence of ganglion cells in the rectal mucosa is needed. Among the options provided, the rectal suction biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease as it allows for the direct examination of the rectal mucosa for the presence or absence of ganglion cells.

What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?
A) Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
B) Muellerian agenesis
C) Hyperprolactinemia
D) Turner syndrome
E) Androgen insensitivity","To approach this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Age and Chief Complaint**: The patient is an 18-year-old female who has not menstruated yet. This immediately points towards considering differential diagnoses related to primary amenorrhea.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5 indicates that the patient has undergone normal secondary sexual development, which suggests the presence of estrogen.

3. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - **FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone)**: The FSH level is within the normal range for the follicular phase, indicating that the ovaries are functioning and producing estrogen, as evidenced by the normal estradiol level.
   - **Estradiol**: The estradiol level is within the normal range for the mid-follicular phase, further supporting ovarian function.
   - **Testosterone**: The testosterone level is within the normal range for females.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)**: Typically characterized by elevated FSH levels and decreased estradiol levels, which is not the case here.
- **B) Muellerian Agenesis**: Involves the absence or underdevelopment of the vagina and uterus in individuals with normal ovarian function and normal secondary sexual characteristics. This condition would explain the patient's amenorrhea despite normal hormonal levels and secondary sexual development.
- **C) Hyperprolactinemia**: Can cause amenorrhea but would typically be associated with galactorrhea or other symptoms, and prolactin levels are not provided.
- **D) Turner Syndrome**: Characterized by short stature and ovarian dysgenesis, leading to estrogen deficiency, which does not match the patient's normal secondary sexual development and hormonal profile.
- **E) Androgen Insensitivity**: Typically presents with normal male levels of testosterone, undeveloped female secondary sexual characteristics, and a lack of responsiveness to androgens, which does not fit this patient's presentation.

Considering the patient's normal hormonal profile, secondary sexual development, and the absence of a uterus or vagina that could not be examined due to patient refusal, the most likely diagnosis is Muellerian agenesis. This condition would explain the primary amenorrhea in the context of otherwise normal pubertal development.

The patient's past medical history of a heart murmur, tall stature, and joint hypermobility are suggestive of Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that increases the risk of aortic dissection. The physical exam findings of weak distal pulses and a significant difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower extremities further support this diagnosis. 

Given the association of Marfan syndrome with aortic root dilatation and the increased risk of aortic dissection, the most likely murmur related to this condition would be one that reflects aortic regurgitation due to the involvement of the aortic valve. Aortic regurgitation is typically associated with a diastolic murmur. Among the options provided, a mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is the most consistent with aortic regurgitation, which can be a complication of an aortic dissection in the context of Marfan syndrome.

696,"A 75-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of nausea and vomiting. Over the past 2 days, he has also been feeling weak and tired. When standing up after sitting for a while, he feels dizzy. He says he has to go to the bathroom more often than usual, and that he is urinating “a normal amount” each time. He has not had diarrhea. He has hypertension, for which he has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the past 6 months. He drinks 9 glasses of water per day and takes his medication regularly. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure is 106/54 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min. Physical examination shows whitening of the tongue. Skin that is pinched on the back of the hand retracts after 5 seconds. On mental status examination, his speech is slowed; he is oriented to person, place, and time. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Na+ 150 mEq/L
Cl− 97 mEq/L
K+ 3.6 mEq/L
HCO3− 30 mEq/L
Osmolality 354 mOsm/kg
Hemoglobin A1C 10.5%
Urine
Osmolality 400 mOsm/kg
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
A) Diuretic overdose
B) Osmotic diuresis
C) Gastroinstestinal fluid loss
D) Excess production of aldosterone
E) Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and the patient's symptoms:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has nausea, vomiting, weakness, tiredness, dizziness upon standing, and increased frequency of urination. These symptoms have been ongoing for 7 days.

2. **Medication and Past Medical History**: The patient is taking hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, which is a diuretic that increases urine production. However, he has been on this medication for 6 months, making a recent adjustment or initiation less likely as the cause of his acute symptoms.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has whitening of the tongue, suggesting dehydration, and skin turgor is slightly decreased, as indicated by skin retracting after 5 seconds when pinched.

4. **Laboratory Studies**:
   - **Serum Osmolality**: Elevated at 354 mOsm/kg, indicating hyperosmolar state.
   - **Serum Sodium**: Elevated at 150 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia.
   - **Urine Osmolality**: High at 400 mOsm/kg, suggesting concentrated urine.
   - **Hemoglobin A1C**: Elevated at 10.5%, indicating poorly controlled diabetes.

Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), which is a complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by severe hyperglycemia, dehydration, and an altered mental state. The high urine osmolality indicates that the kidneys are trying to concentrate the urine to conserve water, but the presence of glucose in the urine due to uncontrolled diabetes would lead to osmotic diuresis, where water is lost despite the body's efforts to conserve it.

Osmotic diuresis occurs when substances such as glucose accumulate in the tubules of the kidneys, increasing osmotic pressure and preventing water reabsorption. This results in increased urine production and dehydration, consistent with the patient's symptoms and lab findings.

1240,"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with increasing swelling of his right jaw for the past 2 months. She notes that he has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but that they have not helped. She reports no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. The boy has no significant medical history. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. He is in the 85th percentile for height and weight, and he has been meeting all developmental milestones. His temperature is 37.8℃ (100.0℉). On physical examination, the patient has a prominent 8 × 8 cm mass over the right mandible. The mass has partially distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek. The overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?
A) Babesia microti
B) Bartonella henselae
C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
D) Epstein barr virus (EBV)
E) Yersinia pestis","To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with a 2-month history of increasing swelling of his right jaw. The swelling has not responded to antibiotic treatments, and there's no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. This suggests a chronic process rather than an acute infection.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of a large, firm, immobile, and tender mass over the right mandible that has distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek, along with disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa, points towards a significant pathological process affecting the jaw and surrounding tissues.

3. **Histopathologic Analysis**: Although the specific findings of the histopathologic analysis are not provided, the fact that a biopsy was performed and is relevant to the diagnosis implies that the diagnosis is based on the microscopic examination of the tissue.

4. **Epidemiological Clues**: The patient recently emigrated from Nigeria, which might suggest exposure to certain pathogens more prevalent in that region. However, without specific symptoms or signs of an infectious process (e.g., fever, systemic illness), this might be less relevant.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is related to a chronic process affecting the jaw. Among the options provided, none directly points to a common cause of jaw swelling in children that matches the description. However, considering the chronic nature and the distortion of the jaw, one might think of conditions like Burkitt lymphoma, which is more common in certain regions of Africa and can present with jaw masses.

Burkitt lymphoma is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), especially in endemic cases in Africa. This connection makes EBV a plausible choice given the patient's symptoms and background.

246,"A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Computed tomography shows a small bowel perforation. The patient is prepared for emergent exploratory laparotomy. She is sedated with midazolam, induced with propofol, intubated, and maintained on nitrous oxide and isoflurane for the duration of the surgery. A single perforation in the terminal ileum is diagnosed intraoperatively and successfully repaired. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit. The ventilator is set at an FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 2.5 cm H2O. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 111/50 mm Hg. She is responsive to painful stimuli. Lung examination shows bilateral rales. Abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis shows:
pH 7.44
pO2 54 mm Hg
pCO2 31 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mm Hg
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""
A) Increase the FiO2
B) Extubate
C) Increase the tidal volume
D) Increase PEEP
E) Increase the respiratory rate","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's situation and the provided arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The patient is a 70-year-old woman who underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for a small bowel perforation and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) on mechanical ventilation. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.44, which is slightly alkalotic, a pO2 of 54 mm Hg indicating hypoxemia, a pCO2 of 31 mm Hg, which is slightly low, and an HCO3- of 22 mm Hg, which is within the normal range.

Given the patient's hypoxemia (low pO2) and the presence of bilateral rales on lung examination, the primary concern is to improve her oxygenation. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is currently set at 2.5 cm H2O, which is relatively low. Increasing PEEP can help to improve oxygenation by preventing alveolar collapse and thereby increasing the functional residual capacity of the lungs. This is particularly important in patients with conditions that may lead to atelectasis or those who are at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which could be a concern in a post-surgical patient, especially with a history of bowel perforation and potential for sepsis or systemic inflammatory response.

Increasing the FiO2 (Option A) could also be considered to improve oxygenation, but given the patient's current settings and the fact that she is already on a relatively high FiO2 of 50%, further increases might not be as effective without addressing the underlying lung mechanics. Moreover, high FiO2 levels for prolonged periods can lead to lung toxicity.

Extubation (Option B) is not appropriate at this time, given the patient's hypoxemia and the fact that she is still recovering from surgery and anesthesia.

Increasing the tidal volume (Option C) might not be the best approach, as the patient's current tidal volume is 1000 mL, which is a reasonable setting. Increasing it further could potentially lead to lung injury, especially if the patient's lung compliance is decreased.

Increasing the respiratory rate (Option E) would primarily affect the pCO2 levels by increasing ventilation and could potentially worsen the patient's alkalosis without directly addressing the hypoxemia.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient, given the need to improve oxygenation and considering the potential risks and benefits of the options provided, is to increase the PEEP.

908,"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks. The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
A) Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress
B) Upper endoscopy
C) Coronary angiography
D) Echocardiography at rest
E) Repeat ECG under treadmill stress","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the information provided:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient experiences intermittent painful retrosternal dullness (chest pain), shortness of breath, and palpitations. These symptoms occur with exertion or in cold weather and resolve with rest. This pattern suggests a possible cardiac etiology, particularly angina pectoris, which is characterized by chest pain due to transient myocardial ischemia.

2. **Medical History**: The patient has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of a significant injury (below-knee amputation). Both hypertension and diabetes are risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), which is a common cause of angina.

3. **Current Medications and Lifestyle**: The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol, which reduces the likelihood of certain other conditions but does not rule out CAD.

4. **Physical Examination and Initial Tests**: The cardiac examination is normal, the chest X-ray shows no abnormalities, the ECG is normal, and serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. These findings do not rule out CAD or angina but suggest that there may not be an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) occurring.

Given the patient's symptoms suggestive of angina and the lack of diagnostic findings on the initial tests, the next step is to assess for inducible ischemia, which means testing the heart under stress to see if there is any evidence of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

Considering the patient's mobility issues due to the amputation and the current use of crutches, a treadmill stress test (option E) might be challenging. Therefore, a more appropriate test would be one that does not require physical exertion.

A **myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress** (option A) is a suitable alternative. This test involves using medication to increase heart rate and blood pressure, simulating exercise, while imaging the heart to assess blood flow and detect any areas of reduced perfusion indicative of CAD.

64,"An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?
A) Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder
B) Ultrasound the surgical site
C) Aggressive IV fluids
D) Digital rectal exam
E) Renal ultrasound","To address the patient's situation, let's break down the key points: the patient is an 80-year-old man who underwent hernia surgery 14 hours ago and has not urinated since the surgery. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he mentions discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis. The inability to urinate, also known as urinary retention, is a common postoperative complication, especially in older adults and those who have received certain types of anesthesia or medications that can affect bladder function.

Given the patient's symptoms and the inconclusive bladder scan due to his body habitus, the next best step is to directly assess the patient's bladder for urinary retention. The most straightforward and effective way to do this is by inserting a catheter into the bladder to check for urine and to relieve any potential urinary retention.

Ultrasound of the surgical site (B) might be useful for assessing the surgical site itself but does not directly address the issue of urinary retention. Aggressive IV fluids (C) could be considered if there were concerns about the patient's hydration status, but this does not address the immediate issue of potential urinary retention. A digital rectal exam (D) is useful for assessing certain conditions but is not directly relevant to diagnosing urinary retention. A renal ultrasound (E) could be useful for assessing kidney function and potential issues but is not the immediate next step in addressing the concern of urinary retention.

Therefore, the next best step in the treatment of this patient is to insert a 'straight cath' into the patient's bladder to assess for and potentially relieve urinary retention.

350,"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?
A) Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle
B) This patient has insulin resistance
C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient
D) The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
E) The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction","To address this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Absence of menstruation (amenorrhea)**: The patient has not had her period for 6 months, which indicates a disruption in her menstrual cycle.
2. **Significant weight loss**: She lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb) through dietary restriction and intense exercise.
3. **Physical examination findings**: She has well-developed muscles and decreased adiposity (body fat).
4. **Bone scan results**: Decreased calcium mineral deposits, which can indicate a risk for osteoporosis or weakened bones.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A) **Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle**: While muscle hypertrophy can be associated with hormonal changes, there's no direct indication in the scenario that increased androgen production by muscles is the primary cause of her amenorrhea.

B) **This patient has insulin resistance**: Insulin resistance is more commonly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, not with significant weight loss and decreased adiposity as seen in this patient.

C) **Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient**: This option is plausible because body fat (adiposity) plays a role in the production and regulation of estrogen. Significant weight loss and decreased body fat can lead to lower estrogen levels (hypoestrogenemia), which can disrupt menstrual cycles and lead to amenorrhea.

D) **The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism**: While liver metabolism does affect hormone levels, the scenario does not provide specific information suggesting increased liver metabolism as the cause of decreased estrogen levels.

E) **The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction**: Although hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and menstrual irregularities, the scenario does not provide specific signs or symptoms that would make hyperthyroidism the most likely diagnosis (e.g., no mention of tremors, heat intolerance, etc.).

Considering the information provided, the most accurate statement about this patient's condition is related to the impact of decreased body fat on hormone levels, specifically estrogen.

186,"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?
A) Help the parents to arrange supportive care at home
B) Refer the patient to another oncologist
C) Recommend for parents to take 2 weeks to think about decision
D) Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy
E) Attempt surgical resection of the tumor","In this scenario, the 18-month-old boy is diagnosed with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. The established standard treatment for this condition involves neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. The parents, however, refuse chemotherapy due to concerns about side effects and instead opt for supportive care at home.

The physician's primary responsibility is to act in the best interest of the patient, particularly in cases where the patient is a minor and cannot make decisions for themselves. While it is essential to respect the parents' autonomy and concerns, the physician must also ensure that the child receives the necessary medical treatment to prevent harm.

Refusing chemotherapy and opting for supportive care at home would likely result in significant harm to the child, as it would deny him the opportunity to receive potentially life-saving treatment. The physician has a duty to protect the child's welfare and ensure that he receives the standard of care for his condition.

In this situation, the most appropriate action by the physician would be to seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This would allow the court to review the situation and make a decision in the best interest of the child, taking into account the medical evidence and the potential consequences of not receiving treatment.

833,"Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks’ gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?
A) Apical ballooning of the left ventricle
B) Allergic reaction to anesthetic agent
C) Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins
D) Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space
E) Systemic bacterial infection","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Sudden onset of symptoms**: The patient developed chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension suddenly, 2 hours after admission for rupture of membranes and 1 hour after receiving combined spinal-epidural anesthesia.

2. **Recent medical history**: The patient is at 40 weeks' gestation, had a rupture of membranes, and underwent anesthesia. She also had a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago but received only one dose of intravenous penicillin.

3. **Clinical findings**: The patient shows signs of shock (hypotension, tachycardia, labored breathing, thready pulses) and has low oxygen saturation. Physical examination reveals crackles at both lung bases, indicating pulmonary involvement. The abdomen is nontender, but there is bright red blood in the cervical canal.

4. **Laboratory findings**: The patient has a low hemoglobin concentration and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration, indicating severe coagulopathy.

Given these details, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Apical ballooning of the left ventricle**: This condition, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is a form of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. While it could lead to hypotension and dyspnea, it doesn't fully explain the coagulopathy or the context of recent childbirth.

- **B) Allergic reaction to anesthetic agent**: An allergic reaction could cause hypotension and respiratory distress but would not typically result in the severe coagulopathy seen here.

- **C) Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins**: This option describes amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), a condition where amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, triggering a severe reaction that can lead to coagulopathy, hypotension, and respiratory failure. This condition is consistent with the patient's presentation and the context of recent childbirth.

- **D) Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space**: While complications from anesthesia can occur, they would not typically result in the combination of severe coagulopathy, hypotension, and pulmonary involvement seen in this case.

- **E) Systemic bacterial infection**: While the patient had a positive swab for group B streptococci, the sudden onset of symptoms and the specific combination of findings (severe coagulopathy, hypotension, pulmonary involvement) are more suggestive of an acute event like AFE rather than a systemic infection.

Considering the above analysis, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's current condition is amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins, leading to an amniotic fluid embolism.

288,"A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?
A) Doxycycline
B) Ciprofloxacin
C) Erythromycin
D) Piperacillin
E) Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time","The patient is a 53-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with an exacerbation of his symptoms, including a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum, difficulty breathing, fever, and increased respiratory rate. The presence of greenish-yellow sputum and fever suggests a bacterial infection. In patients with COPD exacerbations, antibiotics are recommended when there is evidence of a bacterial infection, such as purulent sputum.

Given the patient's symptoms and the presence of purulent sputum, antibiotics would be an appropriate treatment option in addition to the oxygen and oral prednisone already started. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by the most likely pathogens responsible for COPD exacerbations, which include Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Among the options provided, doxycycline is a reasonable choice for treating COPD exacerbations due to its activity against these pathogens and its oral formulation, which is convenient for outpatient treatment.

A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?""
A) Escherichia coli infection
B) Parvovirus B19 infection
C) Disseminated intravascular coagulation
D) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
E) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and the patient's presentation:

1. **Pallor and rash for 2 days**: The rash is described as petechiae, which are small spots on the skin that occur as a result of bleeding from small blood vessels.

2. **Recent history of diarrhea and vomiting**: This episode subsided two days ago, which might initially suggest a gastrointestinal infection. However, the current symptoms seem more related to a hematological or systemic issue.

3. **Previous episode of high fever followed by a rash with bright red discoloration over her cheeks**: This description is suggestive of erythema infectiosum, also known as fifth disease, which is caused by Parvovirus B19. However, this episode resolved without treatment, and the current presentation seems different.

4. **Laboratory findings**:
   - **Low hemoglobin (8 g/dL)** and **normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: Indicates anemia.
   - **Elevated leukocyte count (17,000/mm^3)**: Suggests an infectious or inflammatory process.
   - **Low platelet count (49,000/mm^3)**: Thrombocytopenia, which can lead to petechiae.
   - **Normal prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)**: Suggests that the coagulation pathway is not significantly affected.
   - **Elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine**: Indicates renal impairment.
   - **Presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear**: Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells, which are a hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment. The presence of schistocytes and the combination of laboratory results point towards Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) or Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). However, the question does not provide enough information to definitively distinguish between these two conditions based on the classic pentad of TTP (thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, neurological symptoms, and fever) or the typical presentation of HUS (more pronounced renal failure and less neurological involvement).

Considering the options provided:
- **A) Escherichia coli infection**: Could be a cause of HUS, especially if it's a Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, but the question does not specify this.
- **B) Parvovirus B19 infection**: Associated with erythema infectiosum and can cause anemia but does not typically cause the combination of findings seen here.
- **C) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Would typically present with more coagulation abnormalities (e.g., prolonged PT and PTT).
- **D) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**: Primarily involves thrombocytopenia without the microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
- **E) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**: Given the presence of schistocytes, thrombocytopenia, and the lack of clear evidence for HUS or other conditions in the options, TTP seems the most fitting choice based on the information provided.

642,"A 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit. She has had intermittent myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes over the past 10 years that have acutely worsened over the past year. She works as a school teacher but reports that she has had to miss several days of work due to her symptoms. She has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years but does not feel that it is adequately controlling her symptoms. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. She has erythematous, raised plaques with keratotic scaling and follicular plugging on her hands. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone to better control her symptoms. At 2 months of follow-up, she reports that her flares have subsided and she has been able to return to work full-time. If this patient continues this medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing which of the following?
A) Femoral neck fracture
B) Femoral shaft fracture
C) Meniscal tear
D) Osgood-Schlatter disease
E) Proximal phalanx fracture","The patient is a 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who has been experiencing worsening symptoms over the past year. Her rheumatologist decides to trial her on low-dose prednisone, which leads to a subsidence of her flares and allows her to return to work full-time. However, long-term use of prednisone, a corticosteroid, is associated with several potential side effects, including an increased risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by a decrease in bone density and strength, leading to an increased risk of fractures. The most common sites for osteoporotic fractures are the spine, hips, and wrists, but the femoral neck is also a common location. 

Therefore, if this patient continues her medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing a femoral neck fracture due to the potential for prednisone-induced osteoporosis.

127,"An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her son after witnessing the patient fall and hit her head. The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient’s symptoms?
A) Herniation of the uncus
B) Herniation of the cingulate gyrus
C) Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery
D) Occlusion of the basilar artery
E) Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery","Analyzing the situation, the 81-year-old woman experienced a fall and hit her head after complaining of chest palpitations, which suggests a possible cardiac cause leading to a neurological event. Her past medical history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, along with medications such as lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin, indicates a risk for stroke. The physical examination reveals disorientation, difficulty arousing, a non-reactive left pupil, a reactive right pupil, a right-sided visual field defect, and significant weakness on the right side of the body. These findings are indicative of a significant intracranial event affecting the left side of the brain.

Given the symptoms and the findings on the physical examination, the most likely explanation is a space-occupying lesion causing transtentorial herniation, specifically uncal herniation. This condition occurs when the uncus of the temporal lobe herniates through the tentorial notch, compressing the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) and causing ipsilateral pupillary dilation, along with contralateral hemiparesis due to compression of the cerebral peduncle. The presence of a non-reactive left pupil and significant weakness on the right side of the body supports this diagnosis.

544,"A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration. He says this started abruptly about 6 hours ago. He says that he has not noticed that anything that makes his pain better or worse. He also denies any other symptoms. He works as a long-haul truck driver, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?
A) ECG
B) V/Q scan
C) D-dimer
D) Lower extremity venous ultrasound
E) CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast","To approach this question, let's consider the patient's presentation and the most appropriate initial step to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) in a low-risk patient. The patient presents with sharp pain radiating along his right hemithorax that worsens with deep inspiration, which started abruptly about 6 hours ago. This presentation could be suggestive of several conditions, including pulmonary embolism, especially given the patient's risk factors such as smoking, recent long-distance travel, and history of malignancy.

Given that the patient is considered low-risk, the most reasonable first step would be a non-invasive and relatively quick test that can help rule out PE. Among the options provided:

A) ECG - While an ECG can show signs suggestive of PE, such as the S1Q3T3 pattern, sinus tachycardia, or AF, it is not specific or sensitive enough to rule out PE.

B) V/Q scan - This is a useful test, especially in patients for whom CT pulmonary angiography is contraindicated, but it's not typically the first step due to its higher radiation dose and less immediate availability compared to other options.

C) D-dimer - This is a sensitive test for thrombus formation. A negative D-dimer can effectively rule out PE in low-risk patients due to its high negative predictive value.

D) Lower extremity venous ultrasound - While useful for diagnosing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a risk factor for PE, a negative ultrasound does not directly rule out PE.

E) CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast - This is the gold standard for diagnosing PE but involves radiation and contrast exposure. It's typically reserved for when the suspicion of PE remains after initial screening or in high-risk patients.

Considering the need for a rapid, non-invasive initial assessment in a low-risk patient, the D-dimer test stands out as the most reasonable first step to rule out pulmonary embolism.

1173,"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Vaginal exam under anesthesia
B) Report to child protective services
C) Vaginal culture
D) Warm water irrigation of the vagina
E) Reassurance","Analyzing the situation, the four-day-old neonate presents with vaginal discharge that has been present for two days, with the discharge being described as blood-tinged. However, the neonate is otherwise asymptomatic, feeding and voiding well. The mother's prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the first trimester, but both she and her partner were treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate's examination reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes but scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Given the age of the neonate and the characteristics of the discharge, the most likely explanation is the presence of estrogen-withdrawal bleeding, a common condition in newborns due to the drop in estrogen levels after birth. This condition is self-limiting and does not require medical intervention. Therefore, the best next step in management is reassurance to the mother, as there are no indications of infection or trauma that would necessitate further investigation or intervention.

129,"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.7 g/dL
Leukocytes 11,200/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h
Serum
Creatine kinase 212 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L
AST 34 U/L
ALT 35 U/L
Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
A) Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy
B) Inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound
C) Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy
D) Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
E) Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Progressive muscle weakness** for five months, particularly in the shoulders and hips, suggests a myopathic process. The difficulty in getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair further supports muscle weakness, especially in the proximal muscles.

2. **Difficulty swallowing solid foods** but not liquids could indicate involvement of the muscles used for swallowing, suggesting a potential myopathic origin.

3. **Family history** of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is significant. However, DMD is an X-linked recessive disorder primarily affecting males. Given the patient is a female and her age, it's less likely she has DMD. Her mother's Hashimoto's thyroiditis might suggest an autoimmune predisposition in the family.

4. **Laboratory findings** show elevated creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and slightly elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), which can be seen in muscle diseases due to muscle damage releasing these enzymes into the bloodstream.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory muscle disease, considering the progressive muscle weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, and the absence of a clear familial pattern suggestive of a genetic muscular dystrophy like DMD.

**Option C, Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy**, is characteristic of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory muscle disease that presents with muscle weakness and skin manifestations (though skin findings are not explicitly mentioned in the scenario). However, the presence of perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on a muscle biopsy would be a hallmark finding for dermatomyositis or polymyositis, both of which are types of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs).

548,"A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after his wife noticed during breakfast that the left side of his face was drooping. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and shoes before coming to the hospital. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He drinks one glass of wine daily. He is alert and oriented to time, place and person. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 99/min and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows equal and reactive pupils. There is drooping of the left side of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and lower extremities. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left side. Speech is dysarthric. There is a bruit on the right side of the neck. Fundoscopy shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum concentrations of glucose and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) MRI of the brain
B) Lumbar puncture
C) Duplex ultrasonography of the neck
D) Cerebral angiography
E) CT scan of the head","The patient is a 62-year-old man presenting with symptoms of a stroke, including drooping of the left side of his face, difficulty with motor functions such as putting on his shirt and shoes, decreased muscle strength in the left upper and lower extremities, and dysarthric speech. These symptoms, along with his medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and long history of smoking, strongly suggest an acute ischemic stroke, particularly given the sudden onset of symptoms.

The presence of a bruit on the right side of the neck may indicate carotid artery stenosis, which could be a contributing factor to the stroke. Given the acute presentation and the need for immediate intervention to minimize damage and improve outcomes, the most critical step is to quickly and accurately diagnose the type of stroke and its location.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an imaging study that can quickly differentiate between an ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, as their management differs significantly.

A CT scan of the head is typically the first-line imaging study in acute stroke management because it is quick, widely available, and sensitive for detecting acute hemorrhage. Although MRI of the brain provides more detailed information about the brain tissue and is more sensitive for detecting early ischemic changes, it is usually not the first choice in the emergency setting due to its longer scanning time and lesser availability compared to CT.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient, given the acute onset of stroke symptoms and the need for rapid diagnosis to guide treatment, is to perform a CT scan of the head.

281,"A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?
A) Alprazolam
B) Cognitive behavioral therapy
C) Fluoxetine
D) Psychodynamic psychotherapy
E) Zolpidem","The patient is a 32-year-old man who has been experiencing a fear of flying since his teenage years, which was triggered by a turbulent flight and rough landing. This fear has significantly impacted his life, causing him to avoid flying and miss important events, and is now affecting his relationship with his wife and potentially his job. The patient recognizes that his fear is irrational and is seeking help.

Given the patient's symptoms and situation, the best therapy for his condition would be one that addresses his specific phobia and helps him manage his anxiety in a healthy and sustainable way.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that is well-suited for treating specific phobias, including aviophobia (fear of flying). CBT involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with the phobia, and replacing them with more constructive and realistic ones. This approach can help the patient learn to manage his anxiety and eventually become comfortable with flying.

Medications such as Alprazolam (A) may provide temporary relief from anxiety symptoms, but they do not address the underlying phobia and can be habit-forming. Fluoxetine (C) is an antidepressant that may be prescribed for anxiety disorders, but it is not a first-line treatment for specific phobias. Psychodynamic psychotherapy (D) may help the patient explore underlying emotional issues, but it is not as effective for treating specific phobias as CBT. Zolpidem (E) is a sleep aid and is not relevant to treating the patient's fear of flying.

493,"A 38-year-old nursing home worker presents to the clinic with complaints of fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, and productive cough for the past couple of months. His fever is low-grade and sputum is often blood-tinged. He has lost 6.8 kg (15.0 lb) during this period and complains of profound night sweats. A plain radiograph of the patient’s chest shows consolidation in the apical part of the right lung. Baseline investigations show the following:
Complete blood count
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
White blood cells  
Total count 16,000/mm3
Differential count  
Neutrophils 35%
Lymphocytes 54%
Eosinophils 11%
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 84 mm
The physician suspects that the patient is suffering from a chronic lung infection. Which of the following statements best describes the type of lung inflammation in this patient?
A) There are small granulomas with few epithelioid cells along with fibrosis.
B) It has a granuloma with Anitchov cells around a core of fibrinoid collagen necrosis.
C) It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.
D) An ill-defined granuloma with macrophages and epithelioid cells is seen in this type of inflammation.
E) This type of granulomatous inflammation is also seen in histoplasmosis.","To determine the type of lung inflammation in this patient, let's analyze the provided information. The patient presents with symptoms of fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, significant weight loss, and night sweats, which have been ongoing for a couple of months. These symptoms, along with the chest radiograph showing consolidation in the apical part of the right lung, are highly suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), a chronic lung infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The baseline investigations, including a complete blood count with a slightly elevated white blood cell count and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), further support the presence of a chronic infection. The differential count showing a relative lymphocytosis also aligns with TB, as it often involves a cell-mediated immune response.

Given these findings, the type of lung inflammation most likely present in this patient would be characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are aggregates of immune cells, including macrophages and epithelioid cells, that attempt to contain the infection.

Among the provided options, the description that best fits the type of lung inflammation seen in tuberculosis is option C: ""It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells."" Langhans giant cells are a hallmark of TB granulomas, which are typically well-organized and circumscribed.

1174,"A 53-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue and joint and muscle pain. He reports a 6-month history of slowly progressive tiredness associated with dull achy pain in his knees, hips, and shoulders. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina. He takes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, and aspirin. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was homeless in his early 30’s. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a generally well-appearing male without evidence of ascites, peripheral edema, or jaundice. Results from laboratory tests are below:

Hepatitis A IgM: Negative
Hepatitis A IgG: Negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen: Negative
Hepatitis B E antigen: Negative
Hepatitis B core antigen: Negative
Hepatitis B surface IgG: Positive
Hepatitis B E IgG: Negative
Hepatitis B core IgG: Negative
Hepatitis C IgG: Positive
HCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml

This patient should be started on which of the following medications?
A) Sofosbuvir and simeprevir
B) Interferon-alpha
C) Interferon-gamma
D) Ribavirin
E) Lamivudine","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's presentation and laboratory results. The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of fatigue, joint pain, and muscle pain, which have been progressive over 6 months. His past medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, stable angina, a history of intravenous drug use, and a significant smoking history. The laboratory results show that he is negative for hepatitis A and B infections (except for a positive hepatitis B surface IgG, indicating past vaccination or resolved infection) but positive for hepatitis C IgG and has a high HCV RNA viral load.

Given the patient's positive hepatitis C IgG and high HCV RNA levels, the diagnosis is chronic hepatitis C infection. The treatment for chronic hepatitis C has evolved significantly with the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which offer higher cure rates, shorter treatment durations, and fewer side effects compared to the older interferon-based therapies.

Among the provided options, Sofosbuvir and Simeprevir are both direct-acting antivirals used in the treatment of hepatitis C. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of the NS5B polymerase, and Simeprevir is a protease inhibitor that targets the NS3/4A protease. The combination of Sofosbuvir and Simeprevir was one of the first all-oral regimens approved for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1 infection and has been shown to achieve high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates.

Interferon-alpha (option B) and Ribavirin (option D) were previously mainstays of hepatitis C treatment but have largely been replaced by DAAs due to their lower efficacy and higher side effect profiles. Interferon-gamma (option C) is not typically used in the treatment of hepatitis C. Lamivudine (option E) is an antiviral medication used primarily in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis B, not hepatitis C.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for this patient with chronic hepatitis C infection is the combination of Sofosbuvir and Simeprevir.

634,"A 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed last year. He also experienced a head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures. His only medication is daily phenytoin, which was restarted after he had a seizure 3 months ago. His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h
An excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed. The histopathologic analysis is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)
B) Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL)
C) HIV lymphadenopathy
D) Mononucleosis
E) Phenytoin-induced adenopathy","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings:

1. **Painless swelling of the neck for the past week**: This suggests lymphadenopathy, which could be due to various causes including infections, autoimmune diseases, or malignancies.

2. **HIV infection diagnosed last year**: HIV infection can lead to lymphadenopathy due to the infection itself or due to opportunistic infections or malignancies that occur in the setting of immunosuppression.

3. **No recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss**: The absence of systemic symptoms makes an acute infectious process or an aggressive malignancy less likely.

4. **Laboratory studies show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count with a normal differential, and platelet count**: These findings suggest that there is no acute infection, severe inflammation, or bone marrow involvement at this point.

5. **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 40 mm/h**: This is elevated, indicating some level of inflammation or immune activation.

6. **Histopathologic analysis of the lymph node biopsy**: The specific findings are not described, but the options provided give clues about what the diagnosis might be based on the clinical context.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)**: ALL would typically present with more systemic symptoms, abnormalities in the blood counts (such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukocytosis with a predominance of lymphoblasts), and more widespread lymphadenopathy. This option seems less likely.

- **B) Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL)**: HL can present with lymphadenopathy, often in the neck, and can have systemic symptoms (B symptoms) which are not present in this case. However, the diagnosis of HL requires specific histopathological findings (Reed-Sternberg cells), which are not mentioned.

- **C) HIV lymphadenopathy**: HIV infection itself can cause lymphadenopathy, which can be persistent and generalized. However, the lymph nodes in HIV lymphadenopathy are typically smaller and more widespread.

- **D) Mononucleosis**: Caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), mononucleosis can present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. However, the absence of fever, sore throat, and the specific laboratory findings (such as atypical lymphocytes in the blood) makes this diagnosis less likely.

- **E) Phenytoin-induced adenopathy**: This is a rare side effect of phenytoin, characterized by lymphadenopathy, which can mimic lymphoma. Given the patient's recent restart of phenytoin and the lack of systemic symptoms or other findings suggestive of a malignancy or infection, this option becomes more plausible.

Considering the clinical presentation, the lack of systemic symptoms, and the temporal relationship with the restart of phenytoin, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is **Phenytoin-induced adenopathy**.

277,"A 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma on chemotherapy presents to his oncologist for a follow-up visit. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he reports that he recently developed multiple “spots” all over his body. He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient’s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Platelet count: 20,000/mm^3

The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?
A) Interleukin 2
B) Interleukin 8
C) Interleukin 11
D) Erythropoietin
E) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor","To address this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient's Condition**: The patient is a 69-year-old male with metastatic small cell lung carcinoma who has responded well to chemotherapy but recently developed a rash and has a significantly low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).

2. **Lab Results**: The critical lab finding here is the platelet count of 20,000/mm^3, which is substantially below the normal range (typically about 150,000 to 450,000/mm^3). This severe thrombocytopenia poses a risk for bleeding and may limit the continuation of chemotherapy.

3. **Treatment Goal**: The oncologist aims to continue chemotherapy but is concerned about the patient's thrombocytopenia affecting the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. Therefore, the goal is to find a treatment that can help increase the patient's platelet count.

4. **Options Provided**:
   - **A) Interleukin 2 (IL-2)**: Primarily stimulates the growth of T cells, which is not directly relevant to increasing platelet counts.
   - **B) Interleukin 8 (IL-8)**: Mainly involved in neutrophil chemotaxis and does not directly affect platelet production.
   - **C) Interleukin 11 (IL-11)**: Known to stimulate megakaryocyte maturation, leading to an increase in platelet production.
   - **D) Erythropoietin**: Stimulates red blood cell production and is used to treat anemia, not thrombocytopenia.
   - **E) Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)**: Stimulates the production of white blood cells, particularly neutrophils, and is not used to treat thrombocytopenia.

Given the goal of increasing the patient's platelet count to facilitate the continuation of chemotherapy, the most appropriate choice is a recombinant version of Interleukin 11 (IL-11), which is known to promote platelet production.

2. **Blisters on Hands**: The presence of multiple flaccid blisters with hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation on the dorsal hands is suggestive of a bullous dermatosis. The fact that these blisters appeared after a weekend trip to the beach, implying sun exposure, is a crucial clue.

3. **Increased Hair Growth on Malar Cheeks**: This finding is indicative of hypertrichosis, which can be seen in certain conditions, including porphyrias.

4. **Laboratory Results**: The patient's laboratory results show a mild leukocytosis and slightly elevated creatinine but are otherwise unremarkable for diagnosing the specific condition causing the blisters.

Given these clues, the most likely diagnosis is **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)**, a condition characterized by blistering skin lesions that are sensitive to sunlight, leading to scarring and hyperpigmentation. PCT is also associated with hypertrichosis. The condition is often seen in individuals with liver disease or those taking certain medications, but it can also be associated with genetic predispositions.

To confirm the diagnosis of Porphyria Cutanea Tarda, the most appropriate test would be measuring **urine porphyrin levels**. Elevated levels of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxylporphyrin in the urine are diagnostic of PCT.

- **Anti dsDNA titers** (A) are used to monitor SLE activity, not to diagnose porphyrias.
- **C-reactive protein** (B) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and does not help in diagnosing porphyrias.
- **Anti-hemidesmosome titers** (C) are used in diagnosing autoimmune bullous diseases like bullous pemphigoid, not porphyrias.
- **Tzanck smear** (E) is used to diagnose viral infections like herpes simplex and varicella-zoster, showing multinucleated giant cells, and is not specific for porphyrias.

803,"Three patients present to the pediatrician for routine well-child visits. The first child’s mother reports that he seems to be breastfeeding well and voids at least eight times per day. His stools are a yellow color, and he does not seem to be straining. In the office, he can lift his head and chest when in the prone position, and he can track an object with his eyes to the midline. His hands remain fisted 50% of the time.

The second child’s parents report that she is doing well at home and seems to enjoy playing with her older brother. In the office, she can roll from supine to prone and can transfer her rattle from hand to hand. She cannot yet say any words.

The third child’s father reports that he is starting to explore the world around him. He has begun taking independent steps at home. In the office, he seems to recognize the name of several objects, but he cannot follow the direction to “grab the ball.” All three children are assessed as developmentally normal.

Which of the following represents these patient's respective ages?
A) Ages 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months
B) Ages 1 month, 6 months, and 9 months
C) Ages 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months
D) Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 9 months
E) Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months","To determine the ages of the three children based on their developmental milestones, let's analyze each child's abilities and match them with typical age ranges for those skills.

1. The first child can lift his head and chest when in the prone position, track an object with his eyes to the midline, and his hands remain fisted 50% of the time. These skills are consistent with a child around 1-2 months old. At this age, infants begin to develop neck strength to lift their heads while on their stomachs and start to track objects with their eyes, although their hand control is still limited, leading to a fisted position much of the time.

2. The second child can roll from supine to prone and transfer her rattle from hand to hand, but cannot yet say any words. These abilities are typical for a child around 4-6 months old. Rolling over is a skill usually acquired by around 4-6 months, and transferring objects from hand to hand also starts around this age. Language skills at this point are mostly limited to cooing and vowel sounds, with actual words typically appearing a bit later.

3. The third child is taking independent steps and recognizes the names of several objects but cannot follow complex directions like ""grab the ball."" These skills are indicative of a child around 12 months old. Most children start walking independently between 9-14 months, with 12 months being a common benchmark. Recognizing object names also starts around this age, although following complex verbal instructions might still be challenging.

Considering these developmental milestones, the ages of the children are most likely around 2 months for the first child, given the range of skills described (closer to 2 months than 1 month due to the ability to lift the chest and track objects), 6 months for the second child due to rolling and transferring objects, and 12 months for the third child due to independent walking and object recognition.

874,"A 2-hour-old, 3.2 kg (7.0 lb) newborn boy born by cesarean delivery is being evaluated by the resident on-call. The child was born to a gravida 2, para 0 mother with known hepatitis B. The mother made it to all of her prenatal appointments and took the recommended dose of folic acid since conception. She gave up smoking when she discovered she was pregnant. The infant’s heart rate is 150/min, respiratory rate is 48/min, temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), and blood pressure is 80/52 mm Hg. APGAR testing exhibits a score of 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The head is normocephalic. No neural tube defects are present on inspection or palpation of the spine. There is strong flexion in all 4 extremities. Cranial nerves 2–12 are intact. Sensory and deep tendon reflexes are without any abnormalities. Which of the following is the best course of action for the newborn child?
Hepatitis B serology
HBsAg positive
HBeAg positive
IgM HBc negative
Total anti-HBc positive
Anti-HBs negative
Anti-HBc negative
HBV DNA greater than 1 million IU/mL
Alanine transferase normal
A) Administer hepatitis B vaccine
B) Administer hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG)
C) Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG
D) Check hepatitis B serology
E) Check liver enzymes","Given the newborn's mother is known to have hepatitis B, it is crucial to take immediate action to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B to the newborn. The mother's serology results indicate that she is HBsAg positive, HBeAg positive, and has a high HBV DNA level, all of which suggest a high risk of transmitting the virus to her child. Since the newborn's hepatitis B status is not yet known and the mother's status indicates a high risk of transmission, the best course of action is to administer both hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) to the newborn. The hepatitis B vaccine will stimulate the newborn's immune system to produce antibodies against the hepatitis B virus, while HBIG provides immediate, short-term protection against the virus.

285,"An elderly man presents to his physician with complaints of difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling which began 2 months ago. His breathlessness worsens while walking, climbing the stairs, and lying flat on his back. He also finds it difficult to sleep well at night, as he often wakes up to catch his breath. His pulse is 98/min and blood pressure is 114/90 mm Hg. On examination, he has mild respiratory distress, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema is evident on the lower third of his legs. His respiratory rate is 33/min, SpO2 is 93% in room air, and coarse crepitations are heard over the lung bases. On auscultation, the P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex. Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?
A) Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential
B) Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient
C) Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels
D) Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption
E) Reduction in myocardial contractility","To address this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the implications of the medication's effect as depicted by the dashed line post-medication, though the specific graph or image is not provided.

The patient presents with classic symptoms of heart failure, including difficulty breathing (dyspnea), easy fatigability, bilateral leg swelling (edema), and orthopnea (breathlessness while lying flat). The physical examination findings of distended neck veins, bilateral pitting edema, and coarse crepitations over the lung bases further support this diagnosis. The presence of an S3 gallop rhythm, which is often associated with increased fluid volume within the ventricle, also points towards heart failure.

Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that the medication alters cardiac physiology in a way that presumably improves these symptoms, we can infer the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication.

- Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential (A) would affect heart rate but doesn't directly address the symptoms described.
- Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient (B) could refer to the effect of certain medications but isn't directly related to the primary symptoms of heart failure presented.
- Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels (C) would reduce preload and could alleviate symptoms of heart failure by reducing the volume of blood returning to the heart, thus decreasing the heart's workload.
- Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption (D) would lead to diuresis and natriuresis, reducing fluid overload and thus alleviating symptoms of heart failure, such as edema and dyspnea.
- Reduction in myocardial contractility (E) would actually worsen heart failure symptoms.

Considering the patient's symptoms of fluid overload (edema, dyspnea, orthopnea) and the need to reduce the heart's workload, the most likely beneficial mechanism of action of the prescribed medication would be either to reduce fluid overload or to decrease the heart's workload. Between options C and D, which both could potentially alleviate symptoms of heart failure, option D (Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption) directly addresses the issue of fluid overload, which is central to the patient's symptoms.

730,"A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. Vomiting occurs almost immediately after most feeds. Each time, he becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 3300 g (7 lb 4 oz); he currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). He has Down syndrome. His vaccinations are up-to-date. He appears agitated and cries during the examination. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 156/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 100/49 mm Hg. Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?
A) Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray
B) A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration
C) Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
D) Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound
E) Tripple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 6-week-old male infant presenting with a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. This symptomatology is crucial as nonbilious vomiting (vomit that is not green or yellow) often points towards an obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract, proximal to the ampulla of Vater.

2. **Clinical Features**: The infant becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle, indicating discomfort associated with feeding. The presence of an epigastric mass is highly suggestive of a specific condition.

3. **Diagnosis Considerations**:
   - **A) Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray**: This would be more indicative of a lower gastrointestinal tract issue, such as Hirschsprung's disease, which typically presents with bilious vomiting and constipation.
   - **B) A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration**: This is related to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which does not directly correlate with the symptoms of vomiting and an epigastric mass.
   - **C) Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)**: Rotavirus infection could cause gastroenteritis, but it doesn't explain the presence of an epigastric mass.
   - **D) Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound**: This finding is characteristic of pyloric stenosis, a condition where the pylorus muscle thickens, causing gastric outlet obstruction. This matches the clinical presentation of nonbilious vomiting and the finding of an epigastric mass.
   - **E) Triple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray**: This sign is associated with duodenal atresia or stenosis, conditions that typically present with bilious vomiting.

Given the clinical presentation of nonbilious vomiting, the presence of an epigastric mass, and the typical age of presentation, the most likely diagnosis is pyloric stenosis. The diagnostic evaluation most likely to confirm this diagnosis would be an abdominal ultrasound showing an elongated and thickened pylorus.

902,"A 27-year-old G3P1010 makes an appointment with her gynecologist for evaluation of profuse bleeding, which began two days ago. She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?
A) Antibiotics
B) Bed rest and analgesics
C) Magnesium sulfate
D) Methotrexate
E) Dilation and curettage","The patient is a 27-year-old woman who is 13 weeks pregnant and presents with profuse bleeding, dizziness, and weakness. The bleeding started as light spotting but increased significantly, requiring six sanitary pads. Her vital signs indicate hypotension (90/60 mm Hg), tachycardia (125/min), and a normal temperature. The pelvic examination reveals a bloody vagina, an open cervical os, and tenderness on cervical motion and adnexal examination. The ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity without fetal movement or cardiac activity, indicating a non-viable pregnancy. After a couple of hours of rest, a repeat scan shows slight downward migration of the gestational sac with no change in fetal status, suggesting an inevitable abortion or a possible cervical incompetence.

Given the patient's unstable condition, significant bleeding, and the ultrasound findings indicating a non-viable pregnancy, the most appropriate next step in management is to complete the abortion process in a controlled manner to prevent further complications such as infection or severe hemorrhage.

29,"A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?
A) Gram stain positive CSF
B) Peripheral eosinophilia
C) Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis
D) Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count
E) Oligoclonal bands on cerebrospinal fluid analysis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the progression of symptoms.

1. **Initial Presentation**: The 4-year-old boy presents with intermittent vomiting, loose stools, and later develops bloody stools. These symptoms, combined with fever and decreased oral intake, suggest a gastrointestinal infection.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The boy has diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding, hyperactive bowel sounds, and no masses or hepatosplenomegaly. The ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis, which helps rule out appendicitis as a cause of his symptoms.

3. **Development of New Symptoms**: The next day, the boy complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling, with decreased strength (3/5) and diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. This progression of symptoms from gastrointestinal to neurological suggests a condition that affects both systems.

Given the progression from gastrointestinal symptoms to neurological symptoms, including lower extremity weakness and diminished reflexes, the most likely diagnosis is Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disorder that can be triggered by infections, leading to demyelination of the peripheral nerves and resulting in muscle weakness and diminished reflexes.

**Lab Findings Associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome**:
The characteristic lab finding in GBS is an increased protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a normal cell count, which is indicative of a non-inflammatory, demyelinating process affecting the peripheral nerves.

**Answer Choice Analysis**:
- A: Gram stain positive CSF would indicate bacterial meningitis, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.
- B: Peripheral eosinophilia is seen in conditions like parasitic infections or allergic reactions, not typically in GBS.
- C: Xanthochromia on CSF analysis suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is not indicated here.
- D: **Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count** is the hallmark of Guillain-Barré Syndrome.
- E: Oligoclonal bands on CSF analysis are seen in multiple sclerosis, a different demyelinating disease.

A) Inferior vena cava thrombosis
B) Cutaneous xanthomas
C) Butterfly-shaped vertebrae
D) Increased CA 19-9 levels
E) Kayser-Fleischer rings
""","Analyzing the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can identify a pattern consistent with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, generalized itchiness (pruritus), and jaundice are typical of PBC. The laboratory findings of elevated alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, along with the presence of mild hyperbilirubinemia, further support this diagnosis. The negative hepatitis B and C serologies help rule out viral hepatitis as a cause. The ultrasonographic finding of mildly increased echogenicity of the liver is also consistent with PBC.

Given the association of PBC with other autoimmune diseases, it is not surprising that this patient also has symptoms suggestive of Sjögren's syndrome, such as dry eyes and dry mouth (xerostomia). The presence of generalized skin excoriations due to pruritus and the palpable liver edge also aligns with PBC.

Among the provided options, cutaneous xanthomas are a known complication of PBC due to the accumulation of cholesterol in the skin, resulting from chronic cholestasis. This condition leads to the formation of yellowish skin lesions, which are a common finding in patients with PBC.

A) Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
B) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1
C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A
D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B
E) Neurofibromatosis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings:

1. **Symptoms and Signs**: The patient presents with headache, palpitations, episodic diaphoresis, and hypertension, which are classic symptoms of a pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines (like epinephrine). The presence of a diffuse thyroid swelling, pain in the long bones, and the laboratory findings of hypercalcemia and elevated parathormone levels suggest hyperparathyroidism. The elevated calcitonin level points towards medullary thyroid carcinoma.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA (vanillylmandelic acid) and metanephrines confirm the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Hypercalcemia and elevated parathormone levels indicate hyperparathyroidism. Elevated calcitonin is a marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma.

3. **Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Syndromes**: These are hereditary conditions characterized by the occurrence of tumors in multiple endocrine glands. MEN 2A involves medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism, which matches the patient's presentation.

Given the combination of medullary thyroid carcinoma (suggested by elevated calcitonin and thyroid swelling), pheochromocytoma (indicated by symptoms and elevated urinary VMA and metanephrines), and hyperparathyroidism (indicated by hypercalcemia and elevated parathormone), the most likely diagnosis is Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2A.

542,"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?
A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
B) The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.
C) The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.
D) One can not comment, as the p-value is not given.
E) The association is statistically significant, and low education is a risk factor.","To determine the association between young age myocardial infarction (MI) and educational status, the study calculated an odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 with a confidence interval (CI) of 0.9–9.7. The odds ratio suggests that individuals with low educational status have approximately twice the odds of experiencing MI at a young age compared to those with high educational status. However, the confidence interval includes 1 (specifically, the lower bound is 0.9, which is less than 1), indicating that the association is not statistically significant at the conventional 95% confidence level.

Statistical significance is typically determined by whether the confidence interval for the odds ratio includes 1. If the interval does not include 1, the association is considered statistically significant. In this case, because the interval does include 1, we cannot conclude that the observed association is statistically significant.

Therefore, despite the odds ratio suggesting a potential increased risk, the fact that the confidence interval includes 1 means we cannot be confident that the association is not due to chance. Thus, the correct interpretation is that the association is not statistically significant, and we cannot conclusively say that low education is a risk factor based on this study's findings.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings?
A) Gastrointestinal blood loss
B) Adverse drug reaction
C) Dehydration
D) Contrast administration
E) Chronic hypertension
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and the information provided about his current condition.

1. **Patient's History and Initial Presentation**: The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He was hospitalized for acute diverticulitis, confirmed by a CT scan of the abdomen. His initial laboratory results showed a mild elevation in leukocyte count and a normal serum creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL.

2. **Current Condition**: Three days after hospitalization, the patient develops reduced urine output and an elevated serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). The urinalysis shows 2+ proteinuria.

3. **Medications and Interventions**: The patient was started on intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam for the treatment of diverticulitis. He was also placed on bowel rest.

Considering the potential causes for the patient's acute kidney injury:

- **Gastrointestinal Blood Loss (A)**: While possible in the context of diverticulitis, there is no direct evidence provided in the scenario to suggest significant blood loss leading to hypovolemia and AKI.

- **Adverse Drug Reaction (B)**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ketoprofen are known to cause AKI by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which can reduce renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. This is a likely cause given the initiation of ketoprofen in the context of the patient's other risk factors for AKI.

- **Dehydration (C)**: Dehydration could contribute to AKI, especially in the context of bowel rest and potential inadequate fluid resuscitation. However, the scenario does not provide specific information on the patient's fluid status or the adequacy of fluid resuscitation.

- **Contrast Administration (D)**: Contrast-induced nephropathy is a concern after the administration of certain contrast agents, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease. However, the patient's baseline creatinine was only mildly elevated, and there is no mention of the type of contrast used or whether preventive measures for contrast-induced nephropathy were employed.

- **Chronic Hypertension (E)**: While chronic hypertension can contribute to chronic kidney disease, it is less likely to be the direct cause of the acute increase in serum creatinine observed in this scenario.

Given the information provided, the most likely cause of the patient's acute kidney injury is an adverse drug reaction, specifically the effect of ketoprofen on renal function.

185,"A 78-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 5 weeks. He had been living independently but came to live with his daughter temporarily after he complained that he was unable to perform some of his daily activities. He has left the front door wide open and tap water running on multiple occasions. He does not sleep well and wakes up 6–7 times during the night. He does not leave his room and rarely makes conversation with his daughter. He says that he used to enjoy playing the piano but has not played for several months. He has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows orientation to person, place, and time and psychomotor retardation. He has a blunted affect. Short- and long-term memory is impaired. Attention and concentration are impaired. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
A) Donepezil
B) Fluoxetine
C) Aspirin
D) Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
E) Memantine","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the information provided:

1. **Increasing forgetfulness over the past 5 weeks**: This suggests a cognitive decline, which could be due to various causes including dementia, depression, or other medical conditions.

2. **Unable to perform daily activities, leaving the front door wide open, and tap water running**: These indicate significant cognitive and possibly executive function impairments.

3. **Sleep disturbance, social withdrawal, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities**: These are classic symptoms of depression.

4. **Orientation to person, place, and time is intact, but psychomotor retardation, blunted affect, impaired short- and long-term memory, and impaired attention and concentration**: These findings further support the presence of a depressive disorder, which can also present with cognitive symptoms.

5. **Normal vital signs, no focal neurologic findings, and normal serum concentrations of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12**: These help rule out other medical causes for his symptoms.

Given these points, the patient's presentation is most consistent with a depressive disorder, specifically major depressive disorder, which can manifest with significant cognitive symptoms, especially in the elderly. This condition is sometimes referred to as ""pseudodementia"" because the cognitive symptoms can mimic those of dementia but are actually a result of the depressive disorder.

Among the treatment options provided:

- **A) Donepezil**: This is a cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, not typically first-line for this presentation.

492,"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up vaccination 1 week after being bitten by a rodent while camping. She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner. The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?
A) Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.
B) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because her case is uncomplicated and does not require decision-making on his part.
C) Inform the patient that dating her will never be appropriate even once the physician-patient relationship has been terminated.
D) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her, but that she will have to transfer her care to a different physician.
E) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because she no longer requires his service as a physician.
""","The most appropriate reaction for the physician is to inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical. This is because the physician-patient relationship is a professional one, and it is essential to maintain boundaries to ensure the patient receives proper care without any personal biases or conflicts of interest. Dating a current patient can compromise the physician's objectivity and may lead to exploitation of the patient.

The American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical organizations have guidelines that prohibit physicians from engaging in romantic or sexual relationships with current patients. These guidelines are in place to protect patients from potential harm and to maintain the integrity of the physician-patient relationship.

While the patient may no longer require the physician's services after the post-exposure care regimen is complete, it is still essential for the physician to maintain a professional relationship until the patient's care is officially terminated.

238,"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago. The mass is painless and has not increased in size since then. He has also noticed occasional fatigue and has gained 10 pounds in the past 4 months despite no change in his diet or exercise frequency. His past medical history is notable for gout for which he takes allopurinol. He denies any prior thyroid disorder. He runs 4 times per week and eats a balanced diet of mostly fruits and vegetables. He does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine with dinner. His family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 127/72 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, he has a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid. A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?
A) Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles
B) Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate
C) Papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions
D) Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis
E) Stromal amyloid deposition","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Neck Mass**: The patient presents with a firm, painless mass on the anterior aspect of his neck, which has not increased in size over 4 months. This suggests a possible thyroid gland pathology, given its location.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient reports occasional fatigue and a 10-pound weight gain over 4 months without changes in diet or exercise. These symptoms can be associated with hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.

3. **Past Medical History and Lifestyle**: The patient has gout, for which he takes allopurinol, but no prior thyroid disorders. His lifestyle includes regular exercise and a balanced diet, which makes it less likely that his symptoms are due to dietary or lifestyle factors.

4. **Family History**: Notably, the patient has a family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in his maternal uncle. MTC is a type of thyroid cancer that originates from the parafollicular cells, also known as C cells, which produce calcitonin. A significant proportion of MTC cases are familial and associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.

Given these points, the presence of a firm, symmetric thyroid mass, along with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer, raises suspicion for medullary thyroid carcinoma. This type of cancer is known for its characteristic histological feature of stromal amyloid deposition, which is derived from the calcitonin or procalcitonin produced by the tumor cells.

243,"A 5-year-old female presents to the pediatrician for a routine office visit. The patient is in kindergarten and doing well in school. She is learning to read and is able to write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns. The patient’s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient’s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient’s mother is 5’7”, and the patient’s father is 5’10”. The patient’s weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. On physical exam, the patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. Her lungs are clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. The patient’s abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?
A) Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear
B) Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level
C) Elevated serum TSH level
D) Low serum ACTH level
E) Mass in the sella turcica","The patient is a 5-year-old female with a history of moderate persistent asthma and recently diagnosed myopia. Her growth curve shows that her weight is in the 55th percentile, but her height is in the 5th percentile, indicating short stature. The physical examination reveals a low hairline and a broad chest, which are characteristic findings of Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, causing short stature, delayed puberty, and other physical characteristics. The patient's Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair also suggest delayed puberty.

Given these findings, the patient is most likely to have an absent Barr body on a buccal smear. Barr bodies are the inactive X chromosomes that are typically present in female cells. In Turner syndrome, one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially deleted, resulting in the absence of a Barr body.

762,"A 39-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fever, generalized fatigue, and chills for 1 week. She has been having dull right-side abdominal pain during this period. She has nausea. She has no history of travel outside the United States. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include insulin and an oral contraceptive. She appears ill. Her temperature is 40°C (104°F), pulse is 118/min, and blood pressure is 106/70 mm Hg. On examination, the liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin and is tender.

C) Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
D) Administer metronidazole
E) Perform percutaneous drainage
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 39-year-old woman with fever, generalized fatigue, chills, dull right-side abdominal pain, and nausea. These symptoms have been ongoing for 1 week. She also has type 1 diabetes mellitus and is on an oral contraceptive.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: She appears ill, with a high fever (40°C or 104°F), tachycardia (pulse of 118/min), and a palpable, tender liver 2–3 cm below the right costal margin. There are also decreased breath sounds over the right lung base, which could suggest a possible pleural effusion or pulmonary involvement related to the abdominal process.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) with a predominance of segmented neutrophils, indicating a likely bacterial infection. Her liver enzymes are elevated (alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT), suggesting liver involvement or cholestasis.

4. **Imaging**: A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed, but the specific findings are not detailed in the question. However, given the clinical context, it's reasonable to infer that the ultrasound might show evidence of a liver abscess, biliary obstruction, or cholecystitis, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

Given these considerations, the most appropriate next step in management would depend on the specific ultrasound findings. However, for a patient with suspected liver abscess (suggested by the palpable, tender liver and elevated liver enzymes in the context of fever and chills), the best course of action would typically involve drainage of the abscess and administration of antibiotics.

**Options Analysis**:
- **A) Discontinue the oral contraceptive**: While certain conditions like hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, there's no direct indication in this scenario that the oral contraceptive is the cause of her acute presentation.
- **B) Obtain hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan**: This could be useful for diagnosing cholecystitis or biliary obstruction but might not be the immediate next step based on the information provided.
- **C) Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: This would be more appropriate if there were clear indications of biliary obstruction that needed intervention.
- **D) Administer metronidazole**: Starting antibiotics would be appropriate, but metronidazole alone might not be sufficient for coverage, and the choice of antibiotic should be guided by the suspected source of infection and local resistance patterns.
- **E) Perform percutaneous drainage**: Given the likely diagnosis of a liver abscess based on the clinical presentation and the need for immediate intervention to drain the abscess, this option appears to be the most appropriate next step.

606,"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. He was found at a local celebration acting very strangely and was reported by other patrons of the event. The patient is very anxious and initially is hesitant to answer questions. He denies any substance use and states that he was just trying to have a good time. The patient's responses are slightly delayed and he seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts. The patient tells you he feels very anxious and asks for some medication to calm him down. The patient has a past medical history of psoriasis which is treated with topical steroids. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, you note an anxious young man. HEENT exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely intoxication in this patient?
A) Alcohol
B) Benzodiazepines
C) Marijuana
D) Cocaine
E) Phencyclidine","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Behavior and Mental Status**: The patient was acting strangely at a celebration, is anxious, and has slightly delayed responses, indicating an altered mental status. He also seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**:
   - **HEENT Exam**: Dry mouth and conjunctival injection are noted.
   - **Neurological Exam**: Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in the upper and lower extremities.
   - **Cardiac Exam**: Tachycardia is present.
   - **Pulmonary Exam**: Within normal limits.

3. **Vital Signs**: The patient has a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, tachycardia (elevated pulse rate), normal respirations, and normal oxygen saturation.

4. **Substance Use Denial**: The patient denies any substance use.

Given these observations, let's evaluate the options:

- **Alcohol (A)**: Typically presents with slurred speech, ataxia, and more pronounced alterations in mental status, which are not described here.

- **Benzodiazepines (B)**: Would likely cause sedation, confusion, and possibly ataxia, which doesn't fully match the patient's anxious and slightly delayed responses without clear sedation.

- **Marijuana (C)**: Can cause altered perception, mood elevation, and sometimes anxiety, but the physical findings such as dry mouth and conjunctival injection are more consistent with this option. Marijuana use can also lead to tachycardia.

- **Cocaine (D)**: Typically presents with more pronounced sympathetic nervous system activation, including hypertension, tachycardia, and sometimes paranoia or agitation, which is not fully consistent with this patient's presentation.

- **Phencyclidine (E)**: Can cause significant alterations in mental status, including hallucinations and delirium, along with potential aggressive behavior, which is not described in the scenario.

Considering the above analysis, the patient's presentation of anxiety, slightly delayed responses, dry mouth, conjunctival injection, and tachycardia without significant sedation or more severe alterations in mental status is most consistent with marijuana intoxication.

148,"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Administration of lithium
B) Interpersonal therapy
C) Psychodynamic psychotherapy
D) Cognitive behavioral therapy
E) Motivational interviewing","To address this patient's situation, let's break down her symptoms and behaviors. She has been experiencing stress, difficulty relaxing, a mind full of worries, and difficulty concentrating at work. These symptoms are indicative of anxiety. Additionally, she has been working longer shifts and feeling more tired than usual, which could be contributing to her stress levels. Her way of coping with stress is by going shopping and stealing small items, which provides her immediate relief but is followed by feelings of shame and guilt. This behavior suggests an impulse control disorder, specifically kleptomania, which is characterized by recurrent failure to resist urges to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value.

Given these observations, the most appropriate next step in management would be to address both her anxiety and the impulse control disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is effective for treating anxiety disorders by helping individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their anxiety. CBT can also be adapted to address impulse control disorders by helping the patient understand the triggers for her kleptomania and develop strategies to resist the urges to steal.

142,"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:

A) MRI of the adrenal glands
B) MRI of the chest
C) MRI of the pituitary gland
D) Low dose dexamethasone suppression test
E) Inferior petrosal sinus sampling","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 25-year-old woman with progressive fatigue, weakness, and a significant reduction in menstrual periods. She also has hypertension, obesity with a notable pannus, and abdominal striae. These symptoms are suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, a condition caused by excess cortisol levels.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has hyperglycemia (elevated glucose), normal electrolytes, and significantly elevated cortisol levels both in serum (30 µg/mL) and in 24-hour urinary cortisol (470 µg). The serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level is low (<5 pg/mL), which suggests that the excess cortisol production is ACTH-independent.

3. **High-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test**: The patient's serum cortisol levels did not decrease after a 48-hour high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial. This test is used to differentiate between various causes of Cushing's syndrome. The failure to suppress cortisol production with high-dose dexamethasone suggests an adrenal source of the excess cortisol, as pituitary ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease would typically show some suppression.

Given these findings, the next step in management should aim to identify the adrenal source of the excess cortisol production. The best imaging study to visualize the adrenal glands and detect potential adrenal tumors or hyperplasia is an MRI of the adrenal glands.

320,"A 22-year-old man presents to a psychiatrist complaining of mood fluctuations. He is accompanied by his mother who reports that the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy. The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent’s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient’s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Bipolar I disorder
B) Bipolar II disorder
C) Cyclothymic disorder
D) Persistent depressive disorder
E) Schizoaffective disorder","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's history and symptoms:

1. **Episode of Mania/Hypomania:** The patient had a 5-day episode of minimal sleep, unusual levels of energy, and impulsive spending. This episode is suggestive of a manic or hypomanic episode. However, the duration of 5 days leans more towards a hypomanic episode, as manic episodes typically last at least 7 days.

2. **Depressive Episodes:** The patient has a history of multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, increased sleep, loss of interest in hobbies, fatigue, and guilt. These symptoms align with depressive episodes.

3. **Past Psychotic Episode:** The patient had an episode of seeing monkeys in his hospital room during a severe medical illness (meningoencephalitis). While this could suggest a psychotic disorder, it's essential to consider the context of a severe medical condition that could have led to delirium or a transient psychotic episode.

4. **Absence of Suicidal Ideation and Current Distress:** The patient denies suicidal ideation and is not in acute distress at the time of evaluation.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Bipolar I Disorder:** This diagnosis requires at least one manic episode, which typically lasts at least 7 days. The patient's described episode of elevated mood and energy lasted only 5 days, making this diagnosis less likely.

- **B) Bipolar II Disorder:** This diagnosis requires at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. The patient's history of depressive episodes and a 5-day episode of hypomanic symptoms aligns with this diagnosis.

- **C) Cyclothymic Disorder:** This diagnosis involves periods of hypomanic symptoms alternating with periods of mild depression over at least 2 years. However, the patient's described episodes of major depression and a distinct hypomanic episode make this diagnosis less fitting.

- **D) Persistent Depressive Disorder:** This diagnosis involves a depressed mood for most of the day, more days than not, for at least 2 years. While the patient has a history of depressive episodes, the presence of a hypomanic episode suggests a bipolar spectrum disorder.

- **E) Schizoaffective Disorder:** This diagnosis requires a period of at least 2 weeks where there are psychotic symptoms (hallucinations or delusions) in the absence of a major depressive or manic episode. The patient's past episode of seeing monkeys was during a severe medical illness, and there's no clear indication of persistent psychotic symptoms outside of this context.

Considering the above analysis, the patient's symptoms and history best align with a diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder due to the presence of at least one major depressive episode and one hypomanic episode.

338,"A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient’s condition?
A) Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
B) Increase in heart rate
C) Decrease in systemic vascular resistance
D) Increase in cardiac output
E) Increase in blood volume","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of a cardiac murmur since childhood, now presenting with cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur during her pregnancy. The presence of acrocyanosis, fixed splitting of S2, and a grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border are indicative of an atrial septal defect (ASD). The patient's symptoms of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion, which have increased during pregnancy, suggest that the pregnancy has imposed additional physiological demands on her cardiovascular system.

During pregnancy, there are several physiological changes that occur to accommodate the growing fetus and prepare the mother's body for childbirth. These changes include an increase in cardiac output, heart rate, and blood volume. However, in a patient with an ASD, the increase in cardiac output and blood volume can exacerbate the left-to-right shunt, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow and potentially causing symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue.

Among the options provided, the increase in cardiac output is the most likely physiological change causing the change in this patient's condition. As cardiac output increases during pregnancy, the patient's ASD is likely causing an increase in the left-to-right shunt, resulting in increased pulmonary blood flow and oxygen demand, which may lead to symptoms such as dyspnea and fatigue.

864,"A 25-year-old woman presents generalized abdominal pain and vomiting for the past hour. She has also had watery diarrhea for several days with no blood or pus in the stools. She is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, and drinking oral rehydration solution, which has helped a little. Her past medical history shows she was hospitalized 10 years ago for an appendectomy and 4 years ago for a fractured ulna following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs are pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min with shallow breathing, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, pupils are constricted. Extremities are pale and cold. The abdomen is soft but mildly, diffusely tender to palpation with a palpable bladder. No rebound or guarding. Fingerstick blood glucose is 124 mg/dL. Laboratory tests are pending. A urinary catheter is placed, and intravenous fluids are started. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A) Administer naloxone
B) Administer opioid analgesics
C) Scopolamine patch
D) Start dextrose infusion
E) Perform a gastric lavage","The patient presents with generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which initially suggests a gastrointestinal infection. However, her symptoms of shallow breathing, constricted pupils, pale and cold extremities, and a palpable bladder (indicating urinary retention) point towards an opioid overdose, especially considering she has been taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which could potentially contain opioids or opioid-like substances. The absence of abnormalities on abdominal imaging further supports that her symptoms may not be solely due to a gastrointestinal issue.

Given the suspicion of opioid overdose, the next best step in management would be to administer a medication that can counteract opioid effects. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse opioid overdose symptoms, including respiratory depression, which is a critical concern in this patient.

323,"A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife who is concerned about the patient's frequent falls. Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?
A) Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets
B) Atrophy of the caudate nucleus
C) Extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta
D) Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein
E) Intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has a history of frequent falls, slowed movements, and a gait characterized by shuffling of the feet. These symptoms, combined with increased tone in the upper and lower extremities, are highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement.

2. **Family History**: While the patient's family history includes normal pressure hydrocephalus and Alzheimer's dementia, his symptoms most closely align with Parkinson's disease.

3. **Histologic Findings**: Parkinson's disease is characterized by specific histologic findings, including the presence of intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies, which are composed primarily of alpha-synuclein. These inclusions are a hallmark of the disease and are found within the neurons of affected individuals.

Given this information, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets**: This option refers to the structure of amyloid fibrils, which are associated with various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, but not specifically with Parkinson's disease.

- **B) Atrophy of the caudate nucleus**: This finding is more commonly associated with Huntington's disease, a different neurodegenerative disorder.

725,"A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with fever, nausea, and vomiting. The patient states that his symptoms started last night and have persisted to this morning. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his current medications include albuterol and fluticasone. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient seems uncomfortable. He requests that the lights in the room stay turned off during the physical exam. The patient's cardiac exam demonstrates a normal rate and rhythm, and his pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Musculoskeletal exam reveals diminished mobility of the neck in all four directions, with flexion of the neck causing the patient discomfort. Lumbar puncture is performed and results are seen below.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):
Cell count: 175/mm^3
Cl-: 119 mEq/L
Glucose: 49 mg/dL
Pressure: 150 mmH2O
Total protein: 55 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis?
A) Acyclovir
B) Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine
C) Ceftriaxone
D) Ceftriaxone and vancomycin
E) IV fluids and monitoring","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results to determine the most likely diagnosis and then choose the best treatment option.

The patient presents with fever, nausea, vomiting, and discomfort, particularly with neck flexion, which suggests meningismus, a common sign of meningitis. The request to keep the lights off may indicate photophobia, another symptom often associated with meningitis.

The CSF results show:

- Elevated cell count (175/mm^3), which indicates an inflammatory response.
- Normal chloride level (119 mEq/L).
- Glucose level (49 mg/dL) is slightly decreased but not significantly low.
- Elevated pressure (150 mmH2O), which is consistent with meningitis.
- Elevated total protein (55 mg/dL), which also supports the diagnosis of meningitis.

Given these findings, the patient's most likely diagnosis is viral meningitis, as the CSF glucose level is not significantly decreased, and the protein level is only mildly elevated, which is more consistent with viral than bacterial meningitis.

For viral meningitis, the treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on symptom management and hydration, as most cases are caused by viruses that do not require specific antiviral therapy.

1002,"A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A) Testing for serum Ca and PTH
B) Calcium and Vitamin D prescription
C) Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies
D) Testing for serum ferritin
E) Synovial fluid aspiration","The patient presents with a history of progressively worsening back pain, morning stiffness lasting between 30 minutes to an hour, and joint pain in the knees, hands, wrists, and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. The symptoms improve with movement, which is characteristic of inflammatory arthritis. The patient's family history of joint issues and the recent diagnosis of osteoporosis in his mother are also relevant. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings of warm and swollen joints, the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The next best step in management would be to conduct laboratory tests to support the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease. Testing for serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (anti-CCP), would be essential in diagnosing RA and differentiating it from other types of arthritis.

872,"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:
Urine test
Sample White cells Culture
Mid-stream urine Negative Negative
Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
B) Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis
C) Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis
D) Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli
E) Interstitial cystitis","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the results of the investigations.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient has a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. These symptoms have not improved with antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin.

2. **Physical Examination**: The physical examination is unremarkable except for a mildly tender prostate without masses or nodules.

3. **Investigations**: The urine test results show negative white cells and culture in the mid-stream urine but positive white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) with a negative culture.

Given these details, we can rule out certain conditions:

- **Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (C)** and **Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli (D)** are less likely because the EPS culture is negative, and there's no evidence of a bacterial infection that would be expected with these conditions.

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (A)** primarily presents with obstructive urinary symptoms (e.g., hesitancy, weak stream, nocturia) rather than the irritative symptoms and pelvic pain described here.

- **Interstitial cystitis (E)** is a possibility but less likely given the specific findings of a tender prostate and the presence of white cells in the EPS, which points more towards a prostatic issue.

The patient's symptoms of chronic pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and the presence of white cells in the EPS without a positive culture are most consistent with **Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis (B)**. This condition is characterized by chronic inflammation of the prostate without a bacterial infection, which explains the lack of response to antimicrobial therapy. The patient's additional symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability might suggest a broader syndrome such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a functional disorder, but these do not directly relate to the urological diagnosis.

1006,"A 55-year-old man presents with bloody nasal secretions and shortness of breath. He reports he has lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) in the last two months with no changes in his diet. He has also been suffering from mild to moderate joint pain in the left knee for the last year. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vitals include: blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), pulse 70/min, respiratory rate 14/min. Physical examination is significant for nasal ulcers. Diffuse crackles are present over all lobes of the lung bilaterally. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL
Hematocrit 37.7%
Leukocyte count 5500/mm3
Neutrophils 65%
Lymphocytes 30%
Monocytes 5%
Mean corpuscular volume 82.2 μm3
Platelet count 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 35 mm/h
C-reactive protein 14 mg/dL
Creatinine 3.09 mg/dL
The patient is prescribed a corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics but returns in 2 weeks without any clinical improvement. Which of the following would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient?
A) Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies
B) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
C) Anti-histone bodies
D) Anti-Ro
E) Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings. The patient presents with bloody nasal secretions, shortness of breath, significant weight loss over two months, and mild to moderate joint pain in the left knee. The physical examination is notable for nasal ulcers and diffuse crackles over all lobes of the lung bilaterally. Laboratory findings show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating inflammation, and an elevated creatinine level, suggesting renal involvement.

Given the combination of respiratory symptoms (bloody nasal secretions and shortness of breath), renal involvement (elevated creatinine), and systemic inflammation (elevated ESR and CRP), along with the lack of response to corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics, the clinical picture suggests a systemic vasculitis. The presence of nasal ulcers and the involvement of multiple organ systems (respiratory and renal) are particularly suggestive of a specific type of vasculitis.

Among the options provided, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are most closely associated with systemic vasculitides that affect small to medium-sized vessels, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). These conditions can present with a combination of respiratory, renal, and systemic symptoms, along with the presence of nasal ulcers, as seen in this patient.

The other options are less likely to confirm the diagnosis in this patient:
- Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (Anti-CCP) are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which does not fully explain the patient's respiratory and renal symptoms.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and does not provide a specific diagnosis.
- Anti-histone bodies are associated with drug-induced lupus and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which could explain some but not all of the patient's symptoms.
- Anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies are associated with Sjögren's syndrome and SLE, which do not fully match the patient's clinical presentation.

Therefore, the presence of ANCA would most likely confirm the diagnosis of a systemic vasculitis such as GPA or MPA in this patient.

880,"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months. Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15–45 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years. She started having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend about 3 months ago. Six months ago she had a manic episode, which was treated with risperidone. Her mother has PCOS and her father has diabetes mellitus. She is very conscious of her weight and appearance. She is 171 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 27.02 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix.

A) Uterine fibroids
B) Congenital defect of the Mullerian ducts
C) Purging behavior
D) Polycystic ovaries
E) Anovulation","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and the findings:

1. **Age and Menstrual History**: The patient is 15 years old, with a history of irregular menstrual cycles (menstruation occurring at intervals of 15-45 days) and moderate to heavy flow. She has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months.

2. **Sexual Activity**: She started having sexual intercourse about 3 months ago, but a urine pregnancy test is negative, ruling out pregnancy as a cause for her amenorrhea.

3. **Family History**: Her mother has Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), and her father has diabetes mellitus. This family history is relevant because PCOS can be hereditary, and it's a common cause of irregular menstrual cycles and amenorrhea.

4. **Physical Examination**: The patient's BMI is 27.02 kg/m^2, indicating overweight, which is a risk factor for several conditions, including PCOS and insulin resistance.

5. **Laboratory Findings**: The serum hormone studies show normal levels of prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). The progesterone level is low (0.8 ng/mL), which is consistent with anovulation. The testosterone level is within the normal range.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Uterine Fibroids**: Unlikely in a 15-year-old girl and not supported by the pelvic examination findings.
- **B) Congenital Defect of the Mullerian Ducts**: This would likely have been identified earlier, especially if it caused significant menstrual abnormalities or pelvic pain.
- **C) Purging Behavior**: While the patient is conscious of her weight and appearance, there's no direct evidence provided to suggest purging behavior as the cause of her amenorrhea.
- **D) Polycystic Ovaries**: Given the family history of PCOS and the patient's irregular menstrual cycles, this is a plausible cause. However, the normal testosterone level and the absence of other specific findings (like hirsutism or acne) make it less clear-cut.
- **E) Anovulation**: The low progesterone level and the absence of regular menstrual cycles strongly suggest anovulation as the cause of her amenorrhea. Anovulation is common in the first few years after menarche as the menstrual cycle may take time to regulate.

1103,"A 27-year-old college student presents to his physician for constant fatigue. The patient states that for the past several weeks he has felt oddly fatigued and has struggled to complete his work. He is a foreign exchange student and is concerned he will fail out of his academic program. He has experienced some occasional nausea and vomiting which has caused him to lose weight. The patient is a first year college student, drinks alcohol regularly, smokes marijuana, and has unprotected sex with multiple partners. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

The patient refuses an examination of his genitals. Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?
A) CAGE questions
B) Direct influenza antigen
C) Uretheral swab and culture
D) Viral core antibody
E) Viral surface antibody","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings. The patient is a 27-year-old college student with symptoms of constant fatigue, occasional nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. These symptoms are non-specific but can be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infections, metabolic disorders, or substance abuse issues.

The patient's social history is notable for regular alcohol use, smoking marijuana, and unprotected sex with multiple partners. This history raises the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), substance abuse-related health issues, and potentially, viral hepatitis given the liver enzyme elevation (AST: 85 U/L, ALT: 92 U/L).

The laboratory values show mild elevations in liver enzymes, which could be consistent with viral hepatitis, alcohol use, or other liver injuries. The presence of marijuana, amphetamines, and cocaine in the urine suggests significant substance use, which could contribute to the patient's symptoms and liver enzyme elevations.

Given the patient's refusal for a genital examination, which would be crucial for diagnosing STIs, and considering the liver enzyme elevations, the focus should shift towards diagnosing potential causes of liver injury that are not necessarily related to a physical examination. The patient's risk factors for viral hepatitis (elevated liver enzymes and risky behaviors) make testing for hepatitis viruses a reasonable step.

Among the options provided:

A) CAGE questions are used to assess a patient's dependency on alcohol, which might be relevant but does not directly address the elevated liver enzymes or the potential for viral hepatitis.

B) Direct influenza antigen testing is not indicated based on the patient's presentation.

C) Urethral swab and culture would be appropriate for diagnosing STIs but is not feasible given the patient's refusal for a genital examination.

D) Viral core antibody testing is used to diagnose viral hepatitis infections, specifically to identify individuals who have been infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). This test can distinguish between acute and chronic infections.

E) Viral surface antibody testing is also used in the diagnosis of viral hepatitis but is more specific to detecting immunity to HBV.

Given the patient's presentation, risk factors, and the need to diagnose potential liver injury causes without relying on a physical examination, testing for viral hepatitis infections is the most appropriate step. Since the patient's status regarding hepatitis immunity or infection is unknown, and considering the need to identify either acute or chronic infection, testing for viral core antibodies is a comprehensive approach to diagnosing hepatitis B or C infections.

D) Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar
E) Gamma-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci forming green colonies on vancomycin agar","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain, which are indicative of an infection. The vital signs (high fever, elevated pulse, increased respirations, and low blood pressure) suggest sepsis, a severe and potentially life-threatening response to an infection.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line could indicate a coagulopathy or a severe infection affecting the vascular system. The pelvic examination findings of mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness are suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is often caused by bacterial infections.

3. **Laboratory Studies**:
   - **Platelet Count**: Significantly low, which can be seen in conditions like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a complication of severe infections.
   - **Fibrinogen**: Decreased, which also supports the diagnosis of DIC.
   - **D-dimer**: Elevated, further supporting the presence of DIC.

4. **Phenol Test Result**: The identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain when phenol is applied to the patient's blood at 90°C.

Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?
A) This mass will likely require excision
B) This mass will decrease in size if the patient starts oral contraceptives
C) This mass slightly increases this patient’s risk of breast cancer in the future
D) This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time
E) If this mass grows rapidly to greater than 5 cm, radiation and chemotherapy are indicated","The patient is a 16-year-old female presenting with a round lump in her left breast that has been present for 2 months. The lump seems to enlarge and become tender preceding her last 2 menses, but is otherwise painless. Given her age and the characteristics of the lump, the most likely diagnosis is a fibroadenoma, which is a common benign breast tumor in young women. These tumors are often described as firm, mobile, and painless, and can sometimes be tender during the menstrual cycle due to hormonal changes.

Fibroadenomas are not typically associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, and they often decrease in size or disappear over time. The presence of a family history of breast cancer, such as the patient's grandmother being diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, does increase the patient's overall risk of breast cancer, but it does not directly relate to the nature of the current breast lump.

Considering the options provided, the statement that ""This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time"" accurately reflects the expected outcome for a fibroadenoma.

He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Agree to his wish for no further treatment
B) Begin paroxetine therapy
C) Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents
D) Reassure the patient that he will feel better
E) Start outpatient psychotherapy","The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has been experiencing loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks, which are indicative of depressive symptoms. His recent dismissal from the school football team and subsequent avoidance of family and friends suggest a possible trigger for his current state. The mental status examination reveals a constricted affect, and he expresses suicidal ideation, stating that he would be better off dead and intends to use his father's firearm to end his life. This is a critical situation that requires immediate intervention to ensure the patient's safety.

Given the patient's suicidal ideation and refusal to be treated, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure his safety and prevent harm to himself. This cannot be achieved through outpatient treatment or by simply reassuring him that he will feel better. The patient's statement about intending to use his father's firearm to end his life over the weekend when his parents are at church indicates a clear and present danger to himself.

Involuntary hospitalization is necessary to protect the patient from harming himself and to provide a safe environment for further evaluation and treatment. This decision should be made after informing the parents, as they need to be aware of the situation and the steps being taken to ensure their child's safety.

579,"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty discarding items in her home. She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value. She reports that there has been no improvement despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She now feels that her behavior is “taking over” her life. She does not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent; and there are no psychotic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Atomoxetine
B) Fluoxetine
C) Lamotrigine
D) Buspirone
E) Methylphenidate","The patient is a 36-year-old woman who is experiencing difficulty discarding items in her home, which has led to significant clutter and impairment in her daily life. This behavior started in high school and has not improved despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She reports feeling anxious when trying to discard possessions and feeling overwhelmed by her behavior. Her mental status examination reveals a depressed mood, but she is calm, alert, and oriented.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with Hoarding Disorder, a psychiatric condition characterized by persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, leading to cluttered living spaces and significant distress or impairment. Given the patient's lack of response to cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacological treatment may be considered.

Among the options provided, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in treating Hoarding Disorder. Fluoxetine is an SSRI that has been specifically studied in the treatment of Hoarding Disorder and has been found to be effective in reducing symptoms.

The other options are not as appropriate for the treatment of Hoarding Disorder. Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor primarily used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Lamotrigine is a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder and other mood disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic medication used to treat generalized anxiety disorder. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication used to treat ADHD.

1077,"A 78-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. CT demonstrates a mass in the head of the pancreas, and biopsy is planned for the following day. The patient's daughter approaches you outside the room to request that the results of the biopsy not be shared with the patient. She asks that the results instead be shared with her and her brother, who is the patient's documented health care proxy. She explains that she and her brother have discussed the situation and decided that it is best to not inform the patient that she has cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy the next morning confirms the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?
A) Ask the patient's son, the documented health care proxy, how he would like to handle the situation
B) Inquire why the patient's daughter feels her mother should not be informed of the diagnosis
C) Offer to explain the diagnosis to the patient without using the word ""cancer""
D) Order an ethics consult to determine how to address the situation
E) Tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis","In this situation, the patient's daughter is requesting that the biopsy results not be shared with the patient, but instead be shared with her and the patient's documented health care proxy (her brother). However, as a healthcare provider, it is essential to prioritize the patient's autonomy and right to informed consent. The patient has the right to know their diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options.

While it is understandable that the patient's daughter and son may be trying to protect their mother from distressing news, withholding this information from the patient could lead to mistrust and harm the patient-provider relationship. Moreover, the patient may have specific wishes or preferences regarding their care that can only be respected if they are fully informed.

The best approach is to have an open and honest conversation with the patient about their diagnosis, while also being sensitive to their emotional needs. This may involve delivering the news in a compassionate and empathetic manner, providing emotional support, and addressing any concerns or questions the patient may have.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate response is to inform the patient of their diagnosis, as it is their right to know. However, before doing so, it would be helpful to understand the patient's daughter's concerns and reasons for requesting that the information be withheld. This can help the healthcare provider address any misconceptions or worries the family may have and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

570,"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. He was at a college party exhibiting belligerent behavior when he suddenly passed out and fell to the ground. His past medical history is not known. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 107/48 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is covered with emesis and responds incoherently to questions. As the patient begins to wake up he continues vomiting. The patient is started on IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics and begins to feel better. Thirty minutes later the patient presents with muscle rigidity and is no longer responding coherently to questions. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's basic laboratory studies are drawn and he is started on IV fluids, given lorazepam, and placed under a cooling blanket. Despite these initial measures, his symptoms persist. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Acetaminophen
B) Dantrolene
C) Diazepam
D) Intubation
E) Supportive therapy","The patient, a 25-year-old man, was brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious following a college party where he exhibited belligerent behavior before passing out. Initially, he was treated for suspected alcohol intoxication and possible dehydration with IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics, which led to temporary improvement. However, his condition rapidly deteriorated, presenting with muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and a rising temperature, despite initial interventions including lorazepam and a cooling blanket.

Given the progression of symptoms, particularly the development of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia despite benzodiazepine administration (lorazepam), the clinical picture is highly suggestive of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening condition that can be triggered by certain volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants, but also by other stressors in susceptible individuals. However, another condition that needs to be considered given the initial presentation of altered mental status, aggression, and subsequent development of muscle rigidity and hyperthermia is serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), especially if the patient had been using any substances or medications that could lead to these conditions.

Among the options provided, the best next step in management for malignant hyperthermia would be the administration of dantrolene, a specific antidote that acts by inhibiting calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus helping to control the metabolic crisis and hyperthermia associated with MH.

For serotonin syndrome or NMS, the management would typically involve stopping the offending agent, supportive care, and possibly the use of serotonin antagonists like cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome. Benzodiazepines like diazepam or lorazepam can be used for their sedative effects but are not the definitive treatment for MH.

Given the information and the need for a specific intervention beyond supportive care, the correct answer is focused on the treatment for malignant hyperthermia, acknowledging that the exact diagnosis might require further clarification based on the patient's history and response to treatment.

1001,"A 65-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness and a 13.6 kg (30 lb) weight loss. He is a vegetarian. The patient’s family says that he had been high functioning but has had significant behavioral changes over the past year. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. No significant family history. His vital signs include: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg without postural changes, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉). Physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man. He is irritable, paranoid, and delusional but denies any hallucinations. An unstable, wide-based ataxic gait is noted. Laboratory results are significant for the following:
Hb 6.1 g/dL
MCV 109 fL
Platelets 90,0000/mm3
Total count 3,000/mm3
Reticulocyte count 0.8%
A peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
 
A) Hypothyroidism
B) Folate deficiency
C) Vitamin B12 deficiency
D) Parvovirus infection
E) Pernicious anemia","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 65-year-old vegetarian man with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness, and significant weight loss. Additionally, he has had behavioral changes, including irritability, paranoia, and delusions. His physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man with an unstable, wide-based ataxic gait.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has a low hemoglobin level (Hb 6.1 g/dL) with a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV 109 fL), indicating macrocytic anemia. His platelet count is low (90,000/mm^3), and he has a low total white blood cell count (3,000/mm^3) with a low reticulocyte count (0.8%). The peripheral blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils, which is a hallmark of megaloblastic anemia.

3. **Dietary and Lifestyle Factors**: The patient is a vegetarian, which is crucial in narrowing down the cause of his condition.

Given these points, the patient's condition is most likely due to a deficiency that causes megaloblastic anemia. The two main causes of megaloblastic anemia are deficiencies in vitamin B12 and folate.

- **Vitamin B12 Deficiency (Option C)**: This is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, especially in individuals who do not consume animal products (like vegetarians and vegans) because vitamin B12 is found primarily in animal products. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms, such as ataxia, weakness, and behavioral changes, in addition to hematological findings.

- **Folate Deficiency (Option B)**: While folate deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia, it is less likely to cause significant neurological symptoms compared to vitamin B12 deficiency.

- **Pernicious Anemia (Option E)** is a cause of vitamin B12 deficiency due to a lack of intrinsic factor, but the patient's anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are negative, making this less likely.

- **Hypothyroidism (Option A)** and **Parvovirus infection (Option D)** are not directly related to the patient's presentation of megaloblastic anemia.

Therefore, considering the patient's vegetarian diet, the presence of macrocytic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils, and the neurological symptoms, the most likely cause of his condition is a vitamin B12 deficiency.

567,"A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency room with chest pain. He developed severe, crushing, substernal chest pain 10 hours ago while he was hiking in the Adirondack mountains. He was with 2 friends at the time who gave him aspirin before carrying him 5 miles to a town to get phone service, where they then called emergency medical services. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and is an avid hiker. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL. Despite appropriate management, the patient expires. An autopsy is performed demonstrating ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. Which of the following vessels was most likely affected in this patient?
A) Left anterior descending artery
B) Left circumflex artery
C) Left coronary artery
D) Posterior descending artery
E) Right marginal artery","To determine which vessel was most likely affected in this patient, let's analyze the information provided. The patient experienced severe, crushing, substernal chest pain while hiking, which is indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST elevations in leads I and aVL, which suggests that the ischemia is located in the lateral wall of the left ventricle. The autopsy findings confirmed ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle.

The coronary arteries supply blood to different regions of the heart. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery typically supplies the anterior wall of the left ventricle, the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum, and the apex of the heart. The left circumflex artery (LCx) usually supplies the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle, as well as the left atrium. The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies the right ventricle, the posterior one-third of the interventricular septum, and the posterior descending artery (PDA).

Given the location of the ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle, and the ECG findings of ST elevations in leads I and aVL, the most likely affected vessel is the left circumflex artery (LCx). This artery is responsible for supplying blood to the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle, which matches the location of the ischemia found during the autopsy.

239,"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?
A) Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.
B) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.
C) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.
D) The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.
E) The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.","To understand the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates in the context of this study on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), let's first define these terms:

- Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that occur within a specified period among a population at risk.
- Prevalence, on the other hand, is the total number of cases of a disease present in a population at a given time, including both new and existing cases.

Given these definitions, let's examine the statements:

A) Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.
- This statement is incorrect because longer time periods would likely capture more cases (both new and existing), potentially increasing prevalence estimates.

B) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.
- This statement is also incorrect. Incidence rates might appear higher in shorter periods if the period is too short to accurately capture the pattern of disease occurrence, but the actual incidence rate is a characteristic of the disease in the population and doesn't inherently increase in shorter observation periods.

C) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.
- This statement is incorrect because shorter time windows might not capture as many existing cases, potentially underestimating prevalence.

D) The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.
- Attack rates refer to the proportion of individuals exposed to a risk factor who develop a particular disease. Including attack rates in the calculation of incidence over longer periods might provide a more comprehensive view of the disease's occurrence but doesn't inherently increase incidence estimates.

E) The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.
- This statement is also incorrect for similar reasons as D; the inclusion of attack rates doesn't inherently decrease incidence estimates.

However, none of the provided options accurately describe the relationship in a way that aligns with typical epidemiological understanding. The closest correct principle would relate to how prevalence tends to increase with longer observation periods because more cases (both new and existing) are captured. However, this isn't directly stated in the options provided.

Given the options and the need to select the best answer, we must recognize that the statements provided don't accurately reflect standard epidemiological relationships between incidence, prevalence, and the duration of the study period. However, based on the logic that longer periods would capture more cases, we might lean towards a statement that reflects an understanding of how prevalence estimates change over time, but none accurately capture this concept correctly in the context of standard epidemiological principles.

1105,"A 62-year-old man presents with bright red blood in his stool which occurred 2 times this week. He denies fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus or urinary symptoms. Past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and recent appendicitis, status post laparoscopic appendectomy complicated by delirium tremens. His vitals are a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, pulse of 78/min, and respiratory rate of 12/min. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion. In addition, multiple purple spider web-like lesions are present on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied. Fecal occult blood test is negative. On anoscopy, a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion is noted superior to the pectinate line. Which of the following is most likely true about this patient’s current symptoms?
A) This patient has peptic ulcer disease.
B) The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.
C) The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior vena cava.
D) The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior rectal vein.
E) Fecal leukocytes and a stool culture are required for diagnosis.","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Bright red blood in stool**: This symptom is suggestive of a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The fact that it has occurred twice in the same week indicates a possible ongoing issue.

2. **Denial of fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus, or urinary symptoms**: This helps to rule out infections, malignancies, or other systemic conditions that might cause GI bleeding.

3. **Past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and recent appendicitis with laparoscopic appendectomy complicated by delirium tremens**: While GERD could potentially cause upper GI bleeding, the patient's current symptoms of bright red blood in the stool point more towards a lower GI source. The history of appendicitis and its complications might be relevant if considering the overall health status of the patient, but it does not directly relate to the current symptom of GI bleeding.

4. **Physical examination findings of a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion**: This is indicative of ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Ascites can be caused by various conditions, including liver disease.

5. **Multiple purple spider web-like lesions on the chest and arms that blanch when pressure is applied**: These are likely spider nevi (spider angiomas), which are associated with liver disease and cirrhosis.

6. **Fecal occult blood test is negative**: This might seem contradictory to the patient's report of bright red blood in the stool. However, the test might not always detect blood, especially if the bleeding is intermittent.

7. **Anoscopy showing a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion superior to the pectinate line**: This finding is consistent with a hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoids are classified as either internal (above the pectinate line) or external (below the pectinate line). The description given matches an internal hemorrhoid.

Given these points, let's address the options:

- **A) This patient has peptic ulcer disease**: This is unlikely as the patient's symptoms (bright red blood in stool) and the findings on anoscopy point towards a lower GI source of bleeding, not an upper GI source like peptic ulcer disease.

- **B) The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein**: This is correct. Internal hemorrhoids, which are above the pectinate line, drain into the superior rectal vein, which is part of the portal venous system. This is relevant because it can be a source of bleeding in patients with portal hypertension, often due to liver disease.

- **C) The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior vena cava**: This is incorrect. The superior rectal vein, into which internal hemorrhoids drain, is part of the portal venous system and does not directly drain into the inferior vena cava.

- **D) The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior rectal vein**: This would be true for external hemorrhoids, which are below the pectinate line and drain into the inferior rectal vein, then into the systemic circulation via the internal iliac vein and ultimately into the inferior vena cava.

- **E) Fecal leukocytes and a stool culture are required for diagnosis**: This is not necessary for the diagnosis of hemorrhoids but might be considered if there were symptoms or signs suggestive of an infectious cause of the GI bleeding.

43,"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?
A) Duodenal atresia
B) Intestinal malrotation
C) Meconium ileus
D) Necrotizing enterocolitis
E) Pyloric stenosis","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Bilious vomiting in a one-day-old male**: Bilious vomiting in a newborn is concerning and suggests an obstruction below the ampulla of Vater, where the bile duct enters the small intestine.

2. **Has urinated multiple times but has not yet passed meconium**: This indicates that there is likely an issue with the gastrointestinal tract but not with the urinary system.

3. **Pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes**: While gestational diabetes can have implications for the fetus, it's not directly linked to the symptoms described.

4. **Quadruple screen results**: The decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A are markers that can suggest a chromosomal abnormality, such as Down syndrome. However, these markers are not specific and can be seen in other conditions as well.

5. **Ultrasound showing an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm**: This is within the normal range, which doesn't specifically point towards any condition mentioned in the options.

6. **Physical exam findings**: The patient's abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds, indicating a possible bowel obstruction.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Duodenal atresia**: This condition involves a complete obstruction of the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) and is often associated with bilious vomiting. It's also more common in patients with Down syndrome, which could be hinted at by the quadruple screen results.

- **B) Intestinal malrotation**: This condition involves an abnormal rotation of the intestines during fetal development and can cause obstruction. However, it's less directly linked to the specific pattern of bilious vomiting and the prenatal screening results.

- **C) Meconium ileus**: This condition involves an obstruction of the small intestine due to meconium impaction, often associated with cystic fibrosis. The absence of meconium passage could be a clue, but it's less directly linked to the prenatal findings.

- **D) Necrotizing enterocolitis**: This is a condition typically seen in premature infants where portions of the bowel undergo necrosis. The patient was born at 38 weeks, making this less likely.

- **E) Pyloric stenosis**: This condition involves a narrowing of the pylorus (the passage linking the stomach to the small intestine) and typically presents with non-bilious vomiting.

Considering the information provided and the typical presentations of these conditions, the most likely etiology of this fetus's presentation is duodenal atresia, given the bilious vomiting and the potential implications of the quadruple screen results.

130,"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?
A) Decreased acetylcholine release
B) Overactivation of adenylate cyclase
C) Release of interferon-gamma
D) Degradation of phospholipids
E) Inhibition of GABA release","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the potential causes based on the symptoms described.

1. **Sudden onset of blurry vision and diplopia (double vision):** These symptoms suggest an issue affecting the cranial nerves responsible for eye movements, particularly the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve), given the fixed pupillary dilation and difficulty depressing both eyes.

2. **Recent history of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea:** This gastrointestinal symptomatology could be related to food poisoning, considering the patient attributes these symptoms to food consumed at a picnic.

3. **Specific foods mentioned:** While the foods listed (potato salad, hamburger, deviled eggs, and homemade pickles) could be common sources of foodborne illness, none directly point to a specific toxin or pathogen without further context.

4. **A friend who ate at the same picnic developed similar symptoms:** This detail strongly suggests a common source of illness, likely foodborne.

Given these points, the patient's presentation seems to be related to a toxin or pathogen that can cause both gastrointestinal symptoms and neurological effects, particularly affecting cranial nerves.

Among the options provided:

- **A) Decreased acetylcholine release:** This would be more consistent with botulism, a condition caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Botulism can cause blurred vision, difficulty swallowing, and shortness of breath, but the primary mechanism is through blocking acetylcholine release, leading to flaccid paralysis.

- **B) Overactivation of adenylate cyclase:** This is related to the mechanism of cholera toxin, which causes a profound increase in intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes, leading to severe diarrhea. However, cholera toxin does not typically cause the neurological symptoms described.

- **C) Release of interferon-gamma:** This is more related to immune responses and not directly linked to the acute neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms described.

- **D) Degradation of phospholipids:** This could refer to the action of certain toxins, but none directly linked to the symptoms described in a way that fits the scenario.

- **E) Inhibition of GABA release:** This would lead to excitatory neurological symptoms, which do not fit the patient's presentation of cranial nerve palsies and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Considering the sudden onset of symptoms, including cranial nerve involvement and a history suggestive of foodborne illness, the most fitting explanation is related to botulism, which is characterized by decreased acetylcholine release.

2. **Treatment and Response**: Despite aggressive resuscitation with a massive transfusion protocol, securing of an endotracheal airway, large-bore access, an arterial line, and central access, and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion to support blood pressure, the patient's vital signs remain critically unstable (low blood pressure, controlled respirations, and low temperature).

3. **Surgical Findings**: The surgical team reports no active blood loss during the exploratory laparotomy, which suggests that the cause of his ongoing shock is not due to overt, uncontrolled hemorrhage in the abdominal cavity.

4. **ScvO2 and SaO2 Results**: A ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) of 39% is low, indicating inadequate oxygen extraction by tissues or inadequate oxygen delivery. With a SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) of 100% on 100% oxygen, this suggests the issue is not with oxygenation but with perfusion or utilization of oxygen at the tissue level.

5. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient's extremities remain cold despite efforts to warm him, suggesting poor peripheral perfusion.

Given these points, the most likely cause of his presentation is not directly related to the obvious trauma and blood loss, which are being addressed, but rather to a complication that is impairing cardiac function and thus tissue perfusion.

Among the options provided:

- **Cardiac Tamponade (A)** is the most plausible explanation. It is a condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, leading to compression of the heart, impaired filling, and decreased cardiac output. This would explain the patient's persistent hypotension, low ScvO2, and signs of poor peripheral perfusion despite adequate resuscitation efforts and no evidence of ongoing hemorrhage.

- **Cervical Spinal Cord Transection (B)** could cause hypotension due to loss of sympathetic tone, but it would not directly explain the low ScvO2.

- **Occult Hemorrhage (C)** is less likely given the surgical team's report of no active blood loss.

- **Pulmonary Embolism (D)** could cause hypoxia and hypotension, but the patient's SaO2 is 100% on 100% oxygen, making this less likely.

- **Undiagnosed Pneumonia (E)** would not directly explain the patient's hemodynamic instability and low ScvO2 in this context.

979,"A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?
A) Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
B) Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
C) Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
D) Increased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
E) Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume","Analyzing the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is evident that he is suffering from a respiratory condition that has significantly impacted his quality of life. The patient's history of smoking 1 pack per day for 55 years is a significant risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter (barrel chest), and hyperresonance to percussion are classic signs of COPD, particularly of the emphysema subtype.

The breathing pattern with pursed lips is also indicative of COPD, as it is a compensatory mechanism to increase intrathoracic pressure and prevent bronchiole collapse, thereby improving lung volumes and gas exchange.

In COPD, particularly in emphysema, there is destruction of alveolar walls and enlargement of airspaces, leading to air trapping. This results in an increase in residual volume (RV) because the lungs are unable to fully deflate. Additionally, the destruction of lung tissue and airway obstruction lead to a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is a measure of the volume of air that can be forcibly exhaled in the first second of a forced exhalation.

Therefore, the expected findings in this patient would be an increased residual volume (RV) due to air trapping and a decreased FEV1 due to airway obstruction and destruction of lung tissue.

Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics and showing improvement in her infection markers (decreased leukocyte count, improved serum creatinine), she has persistent hypotension. Her thyroid function tests reveal low free T3 levels, which is a common finding in critically ill patients, often referred to as euthyroid sick syndrome or non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). This condition does not typically require thyroid hormone replacement unless there is evidence of hypothyroidism. The primary focus should remain on treating the underlying illness that led to her critical condition. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is to continue addressing the septic shock and its consequences, ensuring that the underlying infection is fully resolved and that supportive care is optimized.

80,"A 25-year-old male involved in a knife fight presents with a penetrating wound to the chest. The patient is unconscious and cannot provide any further history. Vitals show a temperature of 37-0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?
A) Immediate cardiac transplant
B) Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated
C) Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets
D) Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space
E) Surgical adhesive glue","The patient is a 25-year-old male with a penetrating wound to the chest, specifically between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side, resulting in a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall as revealed by transthoracic echocardiography. The patient is hemodynamically unstable with a low blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, tachycardia of 115/min, and decreased oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, indicating the need for immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration.

Given the severity of the injury and the patient's unstable condition, aggressive fluid resuscitation, including blood transfusion, has been initiated. However, for definitive management, surgical intervention is necessary to repair the cardiac injury.

Among the provided options, the best definitive surgical approach for managing a penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall, in the absence of coronary artery involvement, is the use of interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets. This technique is suitable for repairing the right ventricular free wall due to its ability to provide a secure closure of the wound without compromising the function of the right ventricle.

The use of interrupted sutures allows for precise closure of the wound, while the supporting pledgets help to reinforce the suture line, preventing further bleeding or dehiscence. This approach is a well-established technique in cardiac surgery for managing penetrating cardiac injuries.

Therefore, the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient is the use of interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets.

901,"A 38-year-old man presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Past medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2 years ago for which he is not compliant with his medications. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history and occasionally alcohol use. His vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, pulse 98/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

A) Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration
B) ↑ megakaryocytes
C) ↓ hemosiderin stores
D) Ringed sideroblasts
E) Myeloblasts with immature precursors","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's presentation and laboratory findings. The patient is a 38-year-old man with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion, which are common symptoms of anemia. His past medical history includes peptic ulcer disease, for which he is not compliant with his medications, and a 10-pack-year smoking history.

The laboratory findings are significant for a microcytic anemia (low MCV, MCH, and MCHC) with a low hemoglobin and hematocrit. The reticulocyte count is low, indicating a decreased production of red blood cells. The red cell distribution width (RDW) is elevated, suggesting a variation in red blood cell size. The iron studies show a low transferrin saturation and a high total iron binding capacity (TIBC), which are indicative of iron deficiency anemia.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. On a bone marrow biopsy, the expected finding would be a decrease in hemosiderin stores, which are the iron-containing granules in the bone marrow. This decrease is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia.

A) Recipient T-cells in the graft
B) Drug-induced nephrotoxicity
C) Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels
D) Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy
E) Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Timeline and Symptoms**: The patient is 10 days post-cadaveric renal transplant and presents with pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, and decreasing urinary output over the past 2 days. These symptoms suggest a problem with the transplanted kidney.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient's serum creatinine concentration has increased from 2.1 mg/dL to 4.1 mg/dL, indicating a decline in renal function. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration is also elevated at 52 mg/dL, further supporting the presence of renal dysfunction.

3. **Biopsy Results**: A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis, which is inflammation of the renal tubules. This finding is significant in the context of a transplanted kidney, as it often points towards an immune-mediated process.

4. **C4d Staining Negative**: C4d staining is used to detect the presence of complement activation in the kidney, which is often associated with antibody-mediated rejection. The negative result here makes antibody-mediated rejection less likely.

5. **Current Medications**: The patient is on immunosuppressive therapy, including azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone, which are standard treatments to prevent rejection in transplant patients.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Recipient T-cells in the graft**: This option refers to T-cell-mediated rejection, which is a common form of acute rejection in kidney transplant patients. The presence of tubulitis in the biopsy is consistent with T-cell-mediated rejection, making this option the most likely explanation.

- **B) Drug-induced nephrotoxicity**: While cyclosporine can cause nephrotoxicity, the biopsy finding of tubulitis more strongly suggests an immune-mediated process rather than a drug effect.

- **C) Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels**: This option describes a chronic process and does not fit with the acute presentation and biopsy findings.

- **D) Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy**: This is a possible cause of renal dysfunction in transplant patients but would typically present later after transplantation and with different biopsy findings.

- **E) Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies**: This would be more consistent with antibody-mediated rejection, which is less likely given the negative C4d staining.

330,"A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance for dysarthria and left-sided facial droop. She is accompanied by her son, who states that the patient had just returned home an hour ago from walking the dog when suddenly the patient stated she felt “strange.” When her son asked her what was wrong, her speech was slurred and her ""face looked funny.” The son quickly called an ambulance. The paramedic upon arrival noted that the patient had left-sided facial droop. Her medical history includes asthma and sickle cell disease. She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. The patient’s temperature is 97°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination, a left-sided facial droop is appreciated. She has trouble articulating her words, and her speech is garbled. She is put on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Labs are obtained and pending. Which of the following therapies is most likely indicated?
A) Alteplase
B) Exchange transfusion
C) Hydralazine
D) Naloxone
E) Warfarin","The patient presents with sudden onset of dysarthria (difficulty speaking) and left-sided facial droop, which are classic symptoms of a stroke. Given the acute onset of these symptoms, it is crucial to act quickly to minimize damage to the brain. The patient's medical history includes sickle cell disease, but the current symptoms do not suggest a crisis related to this condition. Instead, they point towards an acute vascular event.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate therapy for an acute ischemic stroke, which is likely given the sudden onset of symptoms without mention of hemorrhage, is thrombolysis with alteplase (also known as tissue plasminogen activator or tPA). Alteplase works by dissolving the blood clot that is causing the stroke, thereby restoring blood flow to the affected area of the brain. It is most effective when administered within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset.

The other options are not indicated as the first line of treatment in this scenario. Exchange transfusion might be considered in a sickle cell crisis, but it's not the best choice for acute stroke management. Hydralazine is used to treat hypertension, but blood pressure management in acute stroke is nuanced and not the primary concern here. Naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdose, which is not indicated by the symptoms described. Warfarin is an anticoagulant used for long-term prevention of thromboembolic events, not for acute stroke treatment.

What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?
A) Metformin
B) Oxybutynin
C) Metoprolol
D) Lisinopril
E) Hydrochlorothiazide","To address this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient Profile and Incident**: A 95-year-old woman, resident at a long-term care facility, experienced a fall, leading to a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures.
2. **Symptoms and Findings**: Post-fall, she exhibited severe pain in her right hip and buttock, a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position, and a large swelling in her right buttock. Additionally, she was confused.
3. **Medical History and Medications**: Her past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is on metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin.

Given the patient's confusion and the need to identify a medication most likely associated with this symptom, let's evaluate the options:

- **Metformin (A)**: Primarily used for diabetes management, metformin is not commonly associated with confusion as a side effect.
- **Oxybutynin (B)**: This medication is used to treat overactive bladder and incontinence. It is known for its anticholinergic side effects, which can include confusion, especially in elderly patients.
- **Metoprolol (C)**: A beta-blocker used for heart conditions, metoprolol can have side effects like fatigue and dizziness but is less commonly associated with confusion.
- **Lisinopril (D)**: An ACE inhibitor used for hypertension and heart failure, lisinopril's side effects typically include cough, dizziness, and increased potassium levels, but confusion is not commonly reported.
- **Hydrochlorothiazide (E)**: A diuretic used for hypertension and edema, its side effects can include dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which might indirectly lead to confusion, but it's not the most direct association.

Considering the above analysis, the medication most likely associated with the patient's confusion, especially given her age and the medication's known side effects, is oxybutynin, due to its anticholinergic properties.

640,"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her parents. They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?
A) Alanine
B) Adenosine diphosphate
C) Adenosine monophosphate
D) Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
E) Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate","To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. The infant becomes lethargic and irritated between meals, and frequent small servings help alleviate these symptoms.
2. She was born at 39 weeks and is meeting all developmental milestones.
3. Her mother has a brother who occasionally requires blood transfusions, suggesting a possible familial component to the condition.
4. The infant's physical examination reveals slight jaundice, and her blood work shows normocytic anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin.
5. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are ruled out, the Coombs test is negative, and red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal.

Given these points, the findings suggest a hemolytic anemia that is not due to an autoimmune cause (negative Coombs test) or a problem with the red blood cell membrane (normal osmotic fragility test). The familial component and the specific pattern of anemia point towards an enzyme deficiency affecting glycolysis in red blood cells.

The enzyme deficiency most commonly associated with this presentation is pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme in the glycolytic pathway crucial for the production of ATP in red blood cells. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to reduced ATP production, causing premature destruction of red blood cells and resulting in hemolytic anemia.

Pyruvate kinase is allosterically inhibited by ATP but can also be inhibited by other molecules. Among the options provided, the most relevant allosteric inhibitor related to the context of glycolysis and energy metabolism would be ATP itself or a closely related molecule. However, ATP is not listed among the options.

Considering the options provided:
- Alanine (A) is an amino acid and not directly involved in the allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase.
- Adenosine diphosphate (B) is a product of ATP dephosphorylation and is actually an activator of pyruvate kinase, not an inhibitor.
- Adenosine monophosphate (C) is another product of ATP dephosphorylation and also serves as an activator of several enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, including pyruvate kinase.
- Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (D) is an intermediate in glycolysis and serves as an allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase.
- Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (E) is a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1, another enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, but it is not typically associated with the inhibition of pyruvate kinase.

However, given the context of the question and focusing on the regulation of glycolytic enzymes, the most accurate answer related to the inhibition of pyruvate kinase or similar enzymes in the glycolytic pathway is not explicitly listed as it typically would be ATP or a closely related molecule for other enzymes. But considering the aim is to identify an inhibitor and given the options, none directly inhibit pyruvate kinase in the traditional sense described. The question seems to aim towards understanding the regulation of glycolysis but might have a discrepancy in how it's presented versus the typical regulatory mechanisms discussed.

Given the nature of the question and the typical understanding of glycolytic regulation, there seems to be a misunderstanding in how the question is framed regarding allosteric inhibition of the enzyme in question, especially since the most direct inhibitors or regulatory molecules aren't listed or are described in a manner not typically associated with the condition or the enzyme's regulation.

800,"A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with chest pain. She reports sudden severe and crushing substernal chest pain that started 1 hour ago. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a prior myocardial infarction requiring a coronary artery bypass graft 2 years ago. She takes aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, atorvastatin, and insulin. She is retired and lives a sedentary lifestyle at home. Her temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 109/68 mmHg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 24/min. Before being able to start the physical examination, the patient loses consciousness. Her pulse is palpable but weak. Her blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg and pulse is 130/min. Her skin is pale, cold, and clammy. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6. A medication that primarily stimulates which of the following receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient?
A) Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor
B) Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor
C) Beta-1 adrenergic receptor
D) Beta-2 adrenergic receptor
E) D2 receptor","The patient presents with symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) as evidenced by the sudden onset of severe and crushing substernal chest pain, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes showing ST elevations in multiple leads, and a history of prior myocardial infarction. The patient's rapid deterioration, including loss of consciousness, weak pulse, low blood pressure, and signs of peripheral hypoperfusion (pale, cold, clammy skin), indicates cardiogenic shock. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention to restore adequate circulation and oxygen delivery to vital organs.

In this scenario, the goal is to improve the patient's hemodynamic status by increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Among the options provided, the most appropriate medication would be one that primarily stimulates the beta-1 adrenergic receptor. Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are predominantly found in the heart, where their stimulation leads to increased heart rate (positive chronotropy), increased contractility (positive inotropy), and thus increased cardiac output. This is crucial in the setting of cardiogenic shock, where the heart's ability to pump blood effectively is compromised.

Medications that primarily stimulate beta-1 adrenergic receptors include dobutamine, which is commonly used in the management of cardiogenic shock to increase cardiac output and improve tissue perfusion.

Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors cause vasoconstriction, which can increase blood pressure but may also increase afterload and potentially worsen cardiac output in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors can actually decrease sympathetic outflow and are not the primary target for increasing cardiac output in this scenario. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors cause vasodilation and bronchodilation but are not the primary receptors targeted for increasing cardiac contractility and heart rate. D2 receptors are dopamine receptors that can cause vasodilation and are not the primary target for improving cardiac output in cardiogenic shock.

Therefore, the most appropriate medication to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient would primarily stimulate the beta-1 adrenergic receptor.

Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?
A) Head CT
B) Head MRI
C) Lumbar puncture
D) Post void residual volumes
E) Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors","Analyzing the situation, the 24-year-old female presents with multiple neurological symptoms, including an inability to urinate, past episodes of trouble speaking, changes in vision, and recent extreme facial pain. These symptoms suggest possible central nervous system involvement, particularly affecting the brainstem or spinal cord. The physical exam finding that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward indicates a potential issue with the cranial nerves controlling eye movement, further supporting a neurological cause. Given the complexity and variability of her symptoms, it is crucial to consider a diagnosis that could encompass all these findings, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is known for its relapsing-remitting pattern and optic neuritis causing vision changes.

However, before proceeding with advanced imaging or invasive tests, it's essential to address the patient's chief complaint of inability to urinate, which could be due to a neurological issue affecting bladder control or a more straightforward urinary retention issue. A simple, non-invasive test can help differentiate these causes.

The best initial test for assessing urinary retention and the patient's inability to urinate would be to measure the post-void residual (PVR) volume. This test involves using ultrasound to measure the amount of urine left in the bladder after the patient has urinated. A high PVR volume would indicate urinary retention, which could be due to neurological causes or other issues affecting bladder function.

While domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors (Option E) are crucial for addressing the patient's overall well-being and safety, especially given her history of abuse, this does not directly address the chief complaint of inability to urinate.

Therefore, the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint is to assess the post-void residual volumes.

His vital signs indicate tachycardia (115/min), elevated temperature (37.9°C or 100.2°F), and hypertension (160/89 mm Hg), along with diaphoresis and prolonged capillary refill time. These symptoms collectively suggest a state of acute intoxication or a severe adverse reaction.

Given his history of major depressive disorder and current medications (amitriptyline and diphenhydramine), along with the presence of ethyl glucuronide in the urine toxicology screening (indicating alcohol consumption), it's essential to consider potential interactions or overdoses. However, the key to this scenario lies in recognizing the anticholinergic effects presented by the patient's symptoms.

Anticholinergic toxicity can cause delirium, hallucinations, dry mouth, mydriasis (dilated pupils), tachycardia, urinary retention, and in severe cases, agitation and aggression. The patient's medications, particularly diphenhydramine (an antihistamine with significant anticholinergic properties) and amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant also known for its anticholinergic effects), are likely culprits in this scenario. The alcohol consumption indicated by the presence of ethyl glucuronide may have exacerbated these effects.

While other options like brief psychotic disorder, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intoxication, and synthetic cathinone intoxication could potentially explain some of the patient's symptoms, the overall clinical picture most closely aligns with anticholinergic toxicity, given the combination of the patient's medication regimen and the specific constellation of symptoms presented.

378,"A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. This morning she became drowsy. She returned from a business trip to Sudan 3 weeks ago. She denies eating any seafood while traveling. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her immunizations are up-to-date and she has never received blood products. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. She is oriented to person and place. Examination shows jaundice and mild asterixis. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 22-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL
Prothrombin time 18 sec (INR=2.0)
Serum
Total bilirubin 4.4 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 398 U/L
AST 4,702 U/L
ALT 3,551 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase 3,412 U/L
Anti-nuclear antibody negative
Anti-smooth muscle antibody negative
Anti-CMV antibody negative
Anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody negative
An ELISA for HIV is negative. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
A) HBsAg
B) Anti-HAV IgG
C) HCV RNA
D) Anti-HCV IgG
E) Anti-HEV IgM","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation presenting with lethargy, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and mild asterixis after returning from a business trip to Sudan. These symptoms suggest a liver condition, given the jaundice and asterixis, which are indicative of hepatic encephalopathy.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT in the thousands), an elevated total bilirubin, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), all of which point towards severe liver injury. The prothrombin time is also prolonged, indicating a coagulopathy likely secondary to liver dysfunction.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the acute presentation of severe liver injury, the differential diagnosis includes acute viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and other less common causes. The patient's recent travel history to Sudan, a region where hepatitis E is endemic, is particularly relevant.

4. **Serological Tests**: The patient's negative tests for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-CMV antibody, anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody, and an ELISA for HIV help rule out autoimmune and other infectious causes of liver injury.

Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is acute hepatitis E infection. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is known to cause more severe disease in pregnant women, particularly in the third trimester, but severe cases can occur in the second trimester as well.

1118,"A 68-year-old man presents with difficulty breathing for the last 3 hours. Upon asking about other symptoms, he mentions that he had a cough for the last 4 months which he attributes to his smoking. He says he had frequent nasal stuffiness and headaches over the last 3 months, for which he takes over-the-counter cold medications and analgesics. Over the last 2 months, he often felt that his face was mildly swollen, especially in the morning hours, but he did not consider it to be anything serious. No significant past medical history. He reports a 20-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 96/min, blood pressure is 108/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. A chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. Which of the following clinical signs would most likely be present in this patient?
A) Bilateral pedal edema
B) Distended veins over lower abdomen
C) Papilledema
D) Positive Adson test
E) Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of right forearm and right hand","To approach this question, let's break down the key elements from the patient's presentation and the findings:

1. **Difficulty breathing and cough for 4 months**: These symptoms, especially in a smoker, raise concern for lung cancer or another significant pulmonary condition.
2. **Nasal stuffiness and headaches**: These could be related to a variety of causes, including allergies, infections, or even a tumor causing obstruction or pressure effects.
3. **Mild facial swelling, especially in the morning**: This symptom is particularly interesting as it could suggest superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), a condition where the superior vena cava is obstructed, leading to venous congestion and swelling in the face, neck, and upper extremities. SVCS is often associated with lung cancer or mediastinal masses.
4. **Physical examination findings of rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung**: These findings suggest lung pathology, such as a tumor or infection.
5. **Chest radiograph showing a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung**: This strongly supports the diagnosis of lung cancer, which could explain the patient's symptoms, including the facial swelling if the tumor is causing SVCS.

Given these points, the clinical sign most likely to be present in this patient, related to the facial swelling and the lung mass, would be associated with superior vena cava syndrome. The options provided do not directly mention SVCS symptoms like facial swelling or jugular venous distension, but we can infer which might be related:

- **A) Bilateral pedal edema** is more commonly associated with heart failure or significant venous obstruction in the lower extremities.
- **B) Distended veins over lower abdomen** is not a typical presentation of SVCS.
- **C) Papilledema** is associated with increased intracranial pressure, not directly related to SVCS or lung cancer without brain metastasis.
- **D) Positive Adson test** is related to thoracic outlet syndrome, which could cause venous obstruction in the upper extremity but is not directly related to the patient's presentation.
- **E) Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of right forearm and right hand** could be related to a Pancoast tumor, a type of lung cancer that affects the apices of the lungs and can cause neurological symptoms by invading the brachial plexus. However, this does not directly explain the facial swelling.

However, none of the options directly relate to the expected findings of superior vena cava syndrome, which would typically include jugular venous distension, facial swelling, and possibly cyanosis. Given the closest association with a lung mass causing neurological symptoms by local invasion, option E might be considered, but it's a bit of a stretch without direct evidence of Pancoast tumor symptoms.

213,"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?
A) Lack of a comparison group
B) No prevalence assessment
C) Low number of patients
D) Ascertainment bias
E) Lack of risk calculation","To answer this question, let's break down the key elements of the scenario provided.

First, we need to understand the difference between a cohort study and a case series. A cohort study typically involves following a group of individuals who share a common characteristic or experience over time to observe the development of outcomes or diseases. This type of study often includes a comparison group to assess how the outcomes differ between those with and without the exposure of interest. On the other hand, a case series is a descriptive study that summarizes the characteristics of a group of patients with a particular disease or exposure. It does not compare the outcomes between those with and without the exposure.

Given this context, let's examine the reasons provided in the options:

A) Lack of a comparison group: This is a crucial element for a cohort study. Without a comparison group, it's challenging to assess the effectiveness or outcomes of an intervention compared to those without the intervention.

B) No prevalence assessment: While prevalence assessment is important in epidemiological studies, it's not the primary reason a study would be classified as a case series instead of a cohort study.

C) Low number of patients: While the number of patients (14) might be considered small for some cohort studies, the sample size alone does not dictate the classification of a study as a case series.

D) Ascertainment bias: This refers to a form of selection bias that arises when there is a systematic difference in the accuracy or completeness of the data collected for the study. While this could be a limitation of the study, it's not directly related to the classification as a case series.

E) Lack of risk calculation: Cohort studies often aim to calculate the risk of developing an outcome. However, the lack of risk calculation is not the primary reason for the editor's suggestion.

Considering these points, the most relevant reason the editor suggested submitting the study as a case series instead of a cohort study is the lack of a comparison group. Without a comparison group, the study primarily describes the outcomes of patients who underwent cerclage wiring for femur fractures without comparing these outcomes to those who did not receive this intervention.

444,"A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40℃ (104℉)) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5℃ (99.5℉); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:
Laboratory test
Hemoglobin 11.4 g/d
Mean corpuscular volume 90 µm3
Leukocyte count 4,500/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 70%
Lymphocytes 15%
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Ring-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient’s illness?
A) Babesia babesia
B) Chikungunya virus
C) Dengue virus
D) Leishmania major
E) Tropheryma whipplei","To determine the most likely cause of the patient's illness, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Symptoms and History**: The patient is a 65-year-old woman who recently returned from a trip to Africa, where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her symptoms began with a severe fever (40℃ or 104℉) for 3 days, followed by a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities, painful wrists and fingers, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. After the fever subsided, she developed painful ankles.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has a maculopapular rash over the trunk and limbs, and both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The laboratory findings show a mild anemia (Hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL), a normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 90 µm^3, a slightly low leukocyte count (4,500/mm^3) with a predominance of segmented neutrophils, and a normal platelet count (250,000/mm^3). Ring-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear.

Given these details, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Babesia babesia**: This parasite causes babesiosis, which is characterized by the presence of ring-form trophozoites on the peripheral blood smear, similar to malaria. However, the absence of these forms on the blood smear makes this option less likely.

- **B) Chikungunya virus**: This virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever, severe joint pain (arthralgia), and swelling, particularly in the hands and feet, along with a maculopapular rash. The symptoms and the patient's travel history to Africa, where Chikungunya virus is prevalent, make this a strong candidate.

- **C) Dengue virus**: Also transmitted by mosquitoes, Dengue fever presents with high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash, and mild bleeding. While possible, the emphasis on joint pain and swelling, particularly the ankles in this case, is more suggestive of Chikungunya.

- **D) Leishmania major**: This parasite causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, characterized by skin ulcers or lesions, which does not match the patient's presentation of fever, rash, and joint pain.

- **E) Tropheryma whipplei**: This bacterium causes Whipple's disease, which presents with malabsorption, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, not matching the patient's symptoms.

Considering the symptoms, particularly the severe joint pain and swelling following a fever and maculopapular rash, along with the travel history to Africa, the most likely cause of this patient's illness is the Chikungunya virus.
