789,"A 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1 at 24 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. She has a history of preterm birth. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate 100/min; respiratory rate 13/min; and temperature 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered. Betamethasone stimulates which fetal cells?
Options
A) Type I pneumocytes
B) Goblet cells
C) Bronchial epithelial cells
D) Type II pneumocytes
E) Vascular smooth myocytes","To approach this question, let's break down the information provided and understand the context. The patient is a 26-year-old woman in her 24th week of pregnancy, presenting with symptoms of preterm labor, including mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. Given her history of preterm birth, the goal is to delay delivery to allow for fetal maturation.

The administration of betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is a standard practice in this scenario to promote fetal lung maturity. The key to answering this question lies in understanding the effect of betamethasone on fetal development, specifically on the lungs.

Betamethasone stimulates the production of surfactant in the fetal lungs, which is crucial for reducing surface tension within the alveoli and thereby preventing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. The cells responsible for producing surfactant in the lungs are Type II pneumocytes.

Considering the options provided:

A) Type I pneumocytes are involved in gas exchange but are not responsible for surfactant production.

B) Goblet cells are found in the respiratory and intestinal tracts and produce mucin, not surfactant.

C) Bronchial epithelial cells line the airways but are not the primary source of surfactant.

D) Type II pneumocytes are the correct cells, as they produce surfactant in response to corticosteroid stimulation.

E) Vascular smooth myocytes are involved in blood vessel constriction and dilation, unrelated to surfactant production.

862,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin. One week ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Options
A) Malaria
B) Acute myelogenous leukemia
C) Cholecystitis
D) Renal papillary necrosis
E) Splenic sequestration crisis","The patient is a 3-year-old boy presenting with fatigue, yellow discoloration of his skin, and jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin, indicating splenomegaly. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dl and a mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 39% Hb/cell. The Coombs test is negative, which rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear is not described, but given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, it is likely to show evidence of hemolysis.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production and causes red blood cells to be misshapen and break down prematurely. The patient's recent upper respiratory tract infection may have triggered a hemolytic crisis.

Among the options provided, the patient is at greatest risk for splenic sequestration crisis, which is a complication of SCD. Splenic sequestration crisis occurs when the spleen becomes acutely enlarged and sequesters a large amount of blood, leading to a rapid decrease in hemoglobin level and potentially life-threatening complications.

83,"A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?
Options
A) Desmoplastic
B) Nodular
C) Acral lentiginous
D) Lentigo maligna
E) Superficial spreading","Analyzing the situation, the 44-year-old African-American woman is concerned about cancer due to her uncle's death from metastatic melanoma. However, it's essential to note that melanoma is relatively rare in African-Americans, and when it does occur, it often presents differently than in other populations. The most common type of melanoma in African-Americans is acral lentiginous melanoma, which typically occurs on the palms, soles, or under the nails. This type of melanoma is not related to sun exposure and is more aggressive than other forms of melanoma. Given the patient's African-American background and the fact that she does not have any abnormal moles or warts on her skin, she is at greatest risk of developing acral lentiginous melanoma.

531,"A previously healthy 35-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sudden weakness of her right arm and leg that started 3 hours ago. She returned from a business trip from Europe 3 days ago. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 115/min and regular, and blood pressure is 155/85 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased muscle strength on the entire right side. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ on the right. Babinski sign is present on the right. The left lower leg is swollen, erythematous, and tender to palpation. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?
Options
A) Patent foramen ovale
B) Atrial myxoma
C) Mitral valve vegetation
D) Atrial fibrillation
E) Carotid artery dissection","Analyzing the situation, the 35-year-old woman presents with sudden weakness of her right arm and leg that started 3 hours ago, along with a swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg. These symptoms suggest a possible thromboembolic event. The patient's recent long-distance travel and use of oral contraceptives increase her risk for venous thromboembolism. The presence of a swollen leg is indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and the sudden weakness on one side of the body could be a result of a pulmonary embolism or a paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale (PFO). A PFO is a congenital heart defect that can allow a blood clot to bypass the lungs and travel to the brain, causing a stroke. Given these factors, further evaluation is most likely to show a patent foramen ovale.

Options
A) Inferior vena cava thrombosis
B) Cutaneous xanthomas
C) Butterfly-shaped vertebrae
D) Increased CA 19-9 levels
E) Kayser-Fleischer rings
""","Analyzing the 57-year-old woman's presentation, she has been experiencing fatigue for 3 months, generalized itchiness for 2 months, and yellowing of her eyes for 2 weeks. Physical examination reveals jaundice of the conjunctivae and skin, dry mucous membranes of the mouth, a palpable liver edge, and generalized skin excoriations. Laboratory studies show elevated liver enzymes, high alkaline phosphatase, and direct hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of cholestasis, which is further supported by the mildly increased echogenicity of the liver on ultrasonography.

Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and, ultimately, cirrhosis. One of the characteristic findings in PBC is the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are deposits of copper in the cornea.

Therefore, the additional finding most likely to be found in this patient is Kayser-Fleischer rings.

996,"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Options
A) Polyhydramnios
B) Acute respiratory distress syndrome
C) Caudal regression syndrome
D) Meconium aspiration
E) Placental abruption","This patient is at 42 weeks' gestation, which is considered post-term. The risks associated with post-term pregnancy include complications for the fetus, such as meconium aspiration syndrome. Meconium aspiration occurs when the fetus inhales meconium-stained amniotic fluid into the lungs, which can cause respiratory distress and other complications. This risk is increased in post-term pregnancies due to the decreased amount of amniotic fluid and the increased likelihood of fetal stress.

Considering the patient's history of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries and the current uncomplicated pregnancy, the risk of complications such as polyhydramnios (A), caudal regression syndrome (C), and placental abruption (E) is lower. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (B) is more commonly associated with preterm infants.

Therefore, the patient's child is at greatest risk for meconium aspiration due to the post-term gestation.

830,"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a cough and fatigue. The patient was brought in from a nursing home with documentation stating that he has seemed confused for the past day according to the staff. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. He is currently taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals crackles on pulmonary exam and S4 on cardiac auscultation. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options
A) Azithromycin and admission to the medical floor
B) Azithromycin and discharge
C) Azithromycin, moxifloxacin, and admission to the intensive care unit
D) Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and admission to the intensive care unit
E) Moxifloxacin and admission to the medical floor","Let's break down the patient's presentation and the options provided to determine the next best step in management.

The 66-year-old man presents with a cough, fatigue, and confusion, which have developed over the past day. His past medical history includes diabetes and hypertension, and he is taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. His vital signs show a fever of 102°F (38.9°C), tachycardia with a pulse of 120/min, and normal oxygen saturation on room air. The physical exam reveals crackles on pulmonary exam and an S4 heart sound, indicating possible heart failure or decreased left ventricular compliance.

Given the patient's symptoms, age, and comorbidities, a likely diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The confusion could be attributed to hypoxia, fever, or an underlying infection.

When evaluating the options, it's essential to consider the severity of the patient's condition and the need for hospital admission versus discharge. The patient's age, comorbidities, and confusion suggest a more severe presentation that requires close monitoring and potential intensive care.

Option A, azithromycin and admission to the medical floor, is a reasonable choice but may not provide adequate coverage for a more severe or resistant infection.

Option B, azithromycin and discharge, is not suitable given the patient's severity of symptoms and confusion.

Option C, azithromycin, moxifloxacin, and admission to the intensive care unit, provides broad-spectrum coverage but may be excessive for a typical CAP patient.

Option D, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and admission to the intensive care unit, is the most appropriate choice. Ceftriaxone provides broad-spectrum coverage against typical and atypical pathogens, while azithromycin adds coverage against atypical bacteria and provides synergy against certain pathogens. Admission to the intensive care unit is justified given the patient's severity of symptoms, age, and comorbidities.

Option E, moxifloxacin and admission to the medical floor, is not the best choice as moxifloxacin is typically used for outpatient treatment of CAP and may not provide adequate coverage for a more severe infection.

He is extremely lethargic and is unable to provide an adequate history to his physician. His wife noted that roughly 3 days ago, her husband mentioned that something bit him, but she cannot remember what exactly. The vital signs include blood pressure 85/67 mm Hg, pulse rate 107/min, and respiratory rate 35/min. Upon examination, the man is currently afebrile but is lethargic and pale. His spleen is surgically absent. There are some swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Which of the following bites would be most concerning in this patient?
Options
A) Cat bite
B) Human bite
C) Spider bite
D) Fish bite
E) Dog bite","Let's analyze the situation step by step. The 59-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease presents with fever, night sweats, lethargy, and swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. His vital signs indicate hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which are signs of sepsis. The patient's spleen is surgically absent, which increases his risk for infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated organisms. Among the options provided, the most concerning bite would be one that is prone to causing infections with encapsulated bacteria, such as Capnocytophaga canimorsus, which is commonly found in dog saliva. This bacterium can cause severe infections, especially in individuals with asplenia. Therefore, the most concerning bite in this patient would be a dog bite.

977,"A 25-year-old, G2P2L2 woman presents with a complaint of missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks. Her previous menstrual cycles were regular, occurring every 28–35 days consistently. The patient does not have any other complaints currently. Her past medical history reveals two uncomplicated and normal vaginal deliveries at term. She has a 2-year-old boy and a 6-month-old girl. The patient and her partner use the withdrawal method for contraception. The urine pregnancy test result is positive. The patient returns to the clinic after 1 week expressing her desire to discontinue with the pregnancy and inquires about the possibility of an elective abortion. Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?
Options
A) Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)
B) Oxytocin-induced labor
C) Manual uterine aspiration
D) Dilatation and curettage (D & C) after vacuum evacuation
E) Oral mifepristone + misoprostol","Considering the patient's situation, she is a 25-year-old woman in her 5th week of pregnancy, as indicated by a missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks. She has a history of two uncomplicated and normal vaginal deliveries at term and is now seeking an elective abortion. The most appropriate method for elective termination of pregnancy at this gestational age is a procedure that is safe, effective, and minimally invasive.

Option E, oral mifepristone + misoprostol, is a combination of medications that can be used for medical abortion up to 10 weeks of gestation. Mifepristone blocks the action of progesterone, which is necessary for pregnancy maintenance, while misoprostol causes uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy. This method is non-invasive, can be administered in a clinic or at home, and is highly effective in terminating early pregnancies.

The other options are not as suitable for this patient's situation. Dilatation and evacuation (D&E) and dilatation and curettage (D&C) are surgical procedures that may be used for later gestations or in cases where medical abortion is not feasible. Oxytocin-induced labor is typically used for later gestations and may not be suitable for early termination. Manual uterine aspiration is a procedure that can be used for early abortion but is more invasive than medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol.

734,"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability. Over the past week, she has been projectile vomiting after most feedings. Initially, the vomiting would occur just once or twice a day, but now it occurs after every feed. However, her appetite hasn’t decreased, and she seeks milk right after each episode of vomiting. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is breastfed exclusively. On physical exam, the vital signs include: temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28/min, and heart rate 150/min. On examination, she appears to be mildly dehydrated, listless, and irritable. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?
Options
A) Respiratory alkalosis
B) Metabolic acidosis
C) Metabolic alkalosis
D) Respiratory acidosis
E) Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis","The 1-month-old girl presents with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability, along with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. These symptoms are highly suggestive of pyloric stenosis, a condition characterized by the narrowing of the pyloric canal due to hypertrophy of the surrounding muscle. This narrowing causes gastric outlet obstruction, leading to projectile vomiting after feedings.

The acid-base disturbance most commonly associated with pyloric stenosis is metabolic alkalosis. This occurs due to the loss of hydrogen ions (H+) in the vomit, which leads to a decrease in the hydrogen ion concentration in the blood. As a result, the blood becomes more alkaline. Additionally, the kidneys compensate for the loss of hydrogen ions by retaining more bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), further contributing to the development of metabolic alkalosis.

1195,"A 32-year-old male presents to the emergency department because of fever and diarrhea. He was in his normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when he went abroad on a vacation. During his trip he went kayaking, visited spas, interacted with local animals, and ate local foods. Since returning he has had 3-day history of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He drinks socially and has a 15-pack-year history of smoking. On presentation his temperature is 102.3°F (39.1°C), blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, respirations are 18/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates in both lungs and labs reveal mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?
Options
A) Can form an endospore
B) Has a rabbit reservoir
C) Has no cell wall
D) Is more common in parrot owners
E) Is transmitted by air conditioning","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a 32-year-old male who recently returned from a vacation abroad, where he engaged in various activities such as kayaking, visiting spas, interacting with local animals, and eating local foods. Since his return, he has experienced fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, cough, and diarrhea, along with the chest exam findings of fine crackles and the chest radiograph showing patchy infiltrates in both lungs, suggest a respiratory infection. The mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels also support this diagnosis.

Considering the patient's recent travel history and exposure to various environments and animals, we should consider zoonotic pathogens or waterborne pathogens. Among the options provided, the organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with the characteristic of having a rabbit reservoir.

The organism that fits this description is Francisella tularensis, which is the causative agent of tularemia. However, tularemia typically presents with a skin ulcer and lymphadenopathy, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms.

A more likely candidate is Legionella pneumophila, which is a waterborne pathogen that can cause Legionnaires' disease. However, Legionella pneumophila is typically associated with contaminated water sources, such as air conditioning systems, and not with a rabbit reservoir.

The correct answer is actually associated with the organism Coxiella burnetii, which is the causative agent of Q fever. Coxiella burnetii is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals, including rabbits. Q fever typically presents with flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, and cough, which is consistent with this patient's symptoms.

448,"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for recurrent vomiting that began 5 hours ago. He describes the vomitus as bloody and containing black specks. He drinks 10–12 beers daily and has not seen a physician in 15 years. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 122/min, and blood pressure is 85/59 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?
Options
A) Systemic vascular resistance
B) Fractional tissue oxygen extraction
C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity
D) Pulmonary vascular resistance
E) Cardiac inotropy","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Recurrent vomiting with bloody and black speck content**: This suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemia.
2. **High alcohol consumption**: This is a risk factor for liver disease, which can lead to complications such as portal hypertension and varices, a potential source of upper GI bleeding.
3. **Physical examination findings**:
   - **Pale appearance**: Indicates possible anemia due to blood loss.
   - **Tachycardia (pulse is 122/min)**: A compensatory response to hypovolemia.
   - **Hypotension (blood pressure is 85/59 mm Hg)**: Indicates decreased effective circulating volume.
   - **Decreased radial pulses and delayed capillary refill**: Signs of decreased peripheral perfusion.
   - **Multiple spider angiomata**: Suggestive of liver disease.
   - **Distended abdomen**: Could be indicative of ascites, a complication of liver disease.

Given these findings, the patient is likely experiencing hypovolemic shock due to upper GI bleeding, compounded by potential liver disease.

Now, let's evaluate the options in the context of this condition:

A) **Systemic vascular resistance (SVR)**: In the initial stages of hypovolemic shock, SVR may actually increase as a compensatory mechanism to maintain blood pressure. However, as shock progresses, SVR may decrease due to the release of vasodilatory substances.

B) **Fractional tissue oxygen extraction**: In shock states, tissues extract more oxygen from the blood to compensate for reduced oxygen delivery, so this would likely increase.

C) **Carotid baroreceptor firing activity**: In hypovolemic shock, decreased blood volume leads to decreased stretch on the carotid baroreceptors, which would decrease their firing activity. This is a correct response to the decreased blood pressure, as it triggers compensatory mechanisms to increase blood pressure.

D) **Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)**: PVR might not be directly affected by the systemic hypovolemia and could potentially remain unchanged or be influenced by other factors such as hypoxia or acidosis.

E) **Cardiac inotropy**: In the context of hypovolemic shock, cardiac inotropy (the contractility of the heart) might initially be maintained or even increased as a compensatory response to decreased preload. However, as shock progresses, inotropy can decrease due to ischemia or other factors.

Considering the options, the most likely decreased parameter in response to the patient's current condition is the **carotid baroreceptor firing activity** due to the decreased stretch from hypovolemia, which triggers compensatory responses to try and increase blood pressure.

1034,"A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after losing consciousness at work. On presentation, she is found to be somnolent though she is able to be woken by vocal stimuli. She says that over the last 12 hours, she has been experiencing muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, and hallucinations. She says that the symptoms started after she went on a hike in the woods and foraged from plants along the way. Physical exam reveals dry red skin and enlarged pupils. Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?
Options
A) Atropine
B) Physostigmine
C) Pralidoxime
D) Pyridostigmine
E) Neostigmine","The patient's symptoms, including muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, and an inability to urinate, are suggestive of anticholinergic toxicity. This condition is caused by an excess of anticholinergic substances in the body, which can block the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Given that the patient went on a hike and foraged from plants along the way, it is possible that she ingested a plant containing anticholinergic compounds, such as jimsonweed or deadly nightshade.

To treat anticholinergic toxicity, a drug that can counteract the effects of the toxin is needed. Physostigmine is a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that can increase the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby counteracting the effects of anticholinergic substances. It is the most appropriate choice for treating this patient's symptoms.

Options
A) Administer intravenous hydrocortisone
B) Administer intravenous fludrocortisone
C) Start him on androgen replacement treatment
D) Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy
E) Order an ACTH stimulation test","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 30-year-old man is experiencing excessive fatigue and weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and significant weight loss over a short period. His physical examination reveals a bronze discoloration to his skin, which is indicative of increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. This combination of symptoms is highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency, specifically primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease. The next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis by assessing the body's response to ACTH. Therefore, the next best step is to order an ACTH stimulation test to evaluate the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol in response to ACTH stimulation.

578,"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?
Options
A) Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%
B) Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation
C) Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle
D) Abnormal left ventricular relaxation
E) Decreased right atrial pressure","Analyzing the 63-year-old man's presentation, he has a history of myocardial infarction, which suggests previous damage to the heart muscle. His symptoms of leg swelling, right upper abdominal tenderness, fatigue, and syncope, along with physical examination findings of jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, and ascites, are indicative of heart failure. The presence of a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space suggests involvement of the mitral valve. The decreased S1 and presence of an S3 gallop are also consistent with heart failure.

Given these findings, the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram would be related to the left ventricle's function, as the patient's history and physical examination suggest left-sided heart failure. Among the options provided, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 41% is below the normal range (typically >55%), indicating impaired left ventricular function, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

287,"A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?
Options
A) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
B) Western blot
C) Rapid HIV antibody test
D) Polymerase chain reaction
E) Southern blot","To determine whether the child has been infected with HIV, it is essential to detect the presence of the virus's genetic material. Since the child is only a few days old, antibody tests such as ELISA, Western blot, or Rapid HIV antibody test would not be reliable as they detect antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the infection, which may not be present in significant amounts at this early stage.

The most suitable option for detecting HIV genetic material in the child would be the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. PCR is a molecular test that can detect the presence of HIV RNA or DNA in the blood, making it an effective method for diagnosing HIV infection in infants.

195,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?
Options
A) Conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron
B) Conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane
C) Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen
D) Conversion of homocysteine to methionine
E) Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III","Analyzing the situation, the 3-year-old boy is presenting with symptoms of abdominal pain, constipation, irritability, and developmental delays. The physical examination reveals pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness, suggesting a possible underlying hematological disorder. The peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling, which is indicative of lead poisoning. Lead inhibits several enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway, including aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and ferrochelatase. However, the most specific effect of lead is the inhibition of ALAD, which is responsible for the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen. This impairment leads to the accumulation of aminolevulinic acid and the characteristic basophilic stippling seen in the red blood cells.

1267,"A 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension presents to his primary care physician for an annual check-up. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He takes enalapril and metformin. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. His physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the patient’s regimen. One month later, the patient returns to the physician complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling. Which of the following medications was likely prescribed to this patient?
Options
Options
A) Metoprolol
B) Verapamil
C) Nifedipine
D) Hydrochlorthiazide
E) Spironolactone","To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension. He is already taking enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (for diabetes management).

2. **Initial Presentation**: He presents for an annual check-up feeling well but with elevated blood pressure (155/90 mmHg).

3. **New Medication Added**: The physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to his regimen to better control his blood pressure.

4. **Follow-Up Complaint**: One month later, the patient returns complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling.

Given the patient's complaint of lower extremity swelling after the addition of a new anti-hypertensive medication, we need to consider which class of medications is most likely to cause this side effect.

- **Metoprolol (A)** is a beta-blocker. While beta-blockers can cause various side effects, lower extremity swelling is not typically the most common or concerning side effect associated with this class.

- **Verapamil (B)** is a calcium channel blocker. This class can cause peripheral edema (swelling), but it's more commonly associated with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like verapamil.

- **Nifedipine (C)** is also a calcium channel blocker, specifically a dihydropyridine type. This class is well known for causing peripheral edema due to its vasodilatory effects.

- **Hydrochlorothiazide (D)** is a diuretic. Diuretics are generally used to reduce fluid volume and would be less likely to cause swelling as a side effect.

- **Spironolactone (E)** is a potassium-sparing diuretic and is less likely to cause swelling; instead, it's often used to treat conditions like edema.

Considering the options, the medication most likely to cause lower extremity swelling as a side effect is a calcium channel blocker, specifically the dihydropyridine type. However, between Verapamil and Nifedipine, Nifedipine is more commonly associated with peripheral edema due to its potent vasodilatory effects.

514,"A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Compression fracture
B) Herniated nucleus pulposus
C) Musculoskeletal strain
D) Spinal stenosis
E) Vascular claudication","The patient's presentation of gradually worsening back pain that is exacerbated by certain activities, such as walking, and relieved by others, such as riding a bike or pushing a cart, is suggestive of a condition that affects the spine and its surrounding structures. The patient's symptoms of numbness and weakness in the legs while walking also point towards a condition that affects the spinal cord or nerve roots.

Given the patient's age, past medical history, and physical examination findings, spinal stenosis is a strong consideration. Spinal stenosis is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the spinal canal, which can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots. This condition is often seen in older adults and can be exacerbated by activities that extend the spine, such as walking. However, activities that flex the spine, such as riding a bike or pushing a cart, can relieve the pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots, thereby improving symptoms.

The patient's history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, as well as his smoking history, also increase his risk for developing spinal stenosis.

Radiography of the spine can help confirm the diagnosis of spinal stenosis by showing the narrowing of the spinal canal.

1091,"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother. His mother reports multiple instances over the past month when she walked into his room while he was masturbating. She is worried he may be going through some sort of “problem.” He is currently in 9th grade; his mother says that he is the captain of his high school wrestling team and does reasonably well in school. On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options
A) Advise the patient to stop masturbating
B) Measure serum testosterone level
C) Refer the patient for behavioral therapy
D) Reassure the mother
E) Prescribe sertraline","The 15-year-old boy's situation involves his mother discovering him masturbating on multiple occasions, leading to her concern about a potential ""problem."" However, it's essential to consider the context and the boy's age. Masturbation is a normal part of adolescent development, and it's not uncommon for teenagers to engage in this behavior as they explore their sexuality.

The boy's embarrassment and avoidance of eye contact during the examination are also typical reactions, given the sensitive nature of the topic. The physical examination shows no abnormalities, which suggests that there are no underlying medical issues that need to be addressed.

In this scenario, the most appropriate next step in management is to reassure the mother that her son's behavior is within the normal range for his age group. This approach acknowledges her concerns while also providing her with accurate information about adolescent development. It's essential to prioritize the boy's privacy and avoid making him feel uncomfortable or ashamed about his behavior.

Reassuring the mother can help alleviate her concerns and prevent any potential harm or stigma that might arise from labeling the boy's behavior as a ""problem."" The other options, such as advising the patient to stop masturbating, measuring serum testosterone levels, referring the patient for behavioral therapy, or prescribing sertraline, are not necessary or appropriate in this situation.

1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
Options
A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.","To answer this question, let's first understand what a Type 1 error is. A Type 1 error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. In simpler terms, it means that the study concludes there is a statistically significant effect or difference when, in fact, there isn't one.

Given the context of the study on mepolizumab's effect on asthma exacerbations, if the authors had inadvertently encountered a Type 1 error, it would mean that they concluded mepolizumab had a significant effect on reducing asthma exacerbations when, in reality, it did not.

Looking at the options provided:

A) This statement is incorrect regarding Type 1 error. A study's power to detect a difference is related to Type 2 errors (beta errors), not Type 1 errors.

B) This is the correct definition of a Type 1 error. It occurs when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there is no real effect or difference), but the study concludes there is a statistically significant effect or difference anyway.

C) This describes a Type 2 error, not a Type 1 error. A Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false (i.e., there is a real effect or difference), but the study fails to detect it.

D) This statement is incorrect. A Type 1 error is not the same as a beta (β) error, which is another term for a Type 2 error. The values 0.1 or 0.2 refer to the beta level or the probability of a Type 2 error, not a Type 1 error.

E) While the confidence interval can provide information about the precision of an estimate and the likelihood of a Type 1 error, the Type 1 error itself is not dependent on the confidence interval. It is determined by the alpha level (usually set at 0.05) before the study begins.

301,"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?
Options
A) Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock
B) Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock
C) Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock
D) Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock
E) Inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock","To determine the location of the vaccine injection that caused the patient's symptoms, we need to understand the anatomy of the buttocks and the nerves that run through this area.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the irregular gait and the drooping of the left leg when standing on the right leg, suggest damage to the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is a large nerve that runs from the lower back down to the legs, and it is responsible for controlling many of the muscles in the lower extremities.

The sciatic nerve is most commonly injured when injections are given in the buttocks, specifically in the inferolateral quadrant. This is because the sciatic nerve runs through this area, and injections given here can cause damage to the nerve.

Given the patient's symptoms, it is likely that the vaccine was injected into the inferolateral quadrant of the buttock on the opposite side of the affected leg. This is because the sciatic nerve runs down the back of the leg, and damage to the nerve on one side would affect the opposite leg.

Therefore, the vaccine was most likely injected into the inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock, which would affect the right leg.

He has brought his lab reports which he had recently got done on the suggestions of his family doctor. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and a chest X-ray are found. Which of the following is the next step in this patient’s management?
Options
A) Angiography
B) Computed Tomography (CT)
C) Echocardiogram
D) Stress test
E) Cardiac biopsy","The patient presents with symptoms of orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying down) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up from sleep with difficulty breathing), which are classic signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's history of a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack) 5 years ago and continued alcohol consumption despite medical advice also support the diagnosis of CHF. The patient's lab reports, ECG, and chest X-ray are likely to show signs of heart failure, such as cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) and pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs).

To further evaluate the patient's heart function and guide management, the next step would be to perform an echocardiogram. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to produce images of the heart, allowing for the assessment of heart function, including the measurement of ejection fraction (EF), which is a key indicator of heart failure severity.

Options
A) Chocolate cysts
B) Corpus luteum cysts
C) Yolk sac tumor
D) Luteoma of pregnancy
E) Theca leutein cysts","Analyzing the ultrasound findings, the presence of an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid suggests a molar pregnancy, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease. The ovarian findings of enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content are characteristic of theca lutein cysts. These cysts are often associated with conditions that stimulate excessive production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), such as molar pregnancies. The high levels of hCG stimulate the ovaries, leading to the formation of multiple cysts.

The other options are not directly related to the ovarian findings in the context of a molar pregnancy. Chocolate cysts (A) are endometriomas, corpus luteum cysts (B) are related to ovulation, yolk sac tumor (C) is a type of germ cell tumor, and luteoma of pregnancy (D) is a rare condition associated with hyperreactio luteinalis.

A photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is shown. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow?
Options
A) Immunoglobulin E
B) Platelet activating factor
C) Interferon-gamma
D) Interleukin-10
E) Leukotriene D4","The patient in this case is a 75-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of a productive cough and shortness of breath, and was diagnosed with an infection caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite receiving appropriate therapy, the patient unfortunately passed away. The photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy shows the presence of a specific cell type indicated by the arrow.

The cell type indicated by the arrow is likely a neutrophil, which is a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the body's defense against bacterial infections. Neutrophils are typically recruited to the site of infection through the action of various chemical mediators.

Among the options provided, the mediator that is most likely responsible for the presence of neutrophils is leukotriene D4. Leukotriene D4 is a type of eicosanoid that is produced by the body in response to infection or inflammation. It has potent chemotactic properties, meaning that it can attract neutrophils and other white blood cells to the site of infection.

Leukotriene D4 is a product of the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, and it plays a key role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs in response to bacterial infections such as pneumonia.

In contrast, the other options are not as likely to be responsible for the presence of neutrophils in this case. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody that is involved in allergic reactions, and it is not typically associated with bacterial infections. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid that can activate platelets and other cells, but it is not a primary mediator of neutrophil recruitment. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a cytokine that is involved in the immune response to viral infections, and it is not typically associated with bacterial infections. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that has anti-inflammatory properties, and it is not typically associated with the recruitment of neutrophils.

The patient's current symptoms of chest pain and discomfort in his left shoulder are similar to his initial presentation. Given that the patient's ECG is difficult to interpret, laboratory tests can provide valuable diagnostic information.

Among the options provided, troponin T is a highly specific marker for myocardial damage. Elevated troponin T levels can indicate myocardial infarction, including re-infarction or extension of the initial infarct. Given the patient's history of recent myocardial infarction and current symptoms, an abnormal troponin T result would have significant diagnostic utility in determining whether the patient is experiencing a new or ongoing cardiac event.

E) Refuse to treat the patient as he will die without a blood transfusion","In this situation, the patient's life is at risk due to significant blood loss, and a blood transfusion is necessary to save his life. However, the patient has explicitly stated in his medical chart that he does not want to receive any blood transfusions for religious reasons. 

As a medical professional, it is essential to respect the patient's autonomy and their right to make decisions about their own medical care, even if those decisions may result in harm to themselves. In this case, the patient's written instructions take precedence over any other considerations.

Administering a blood transfusion against the patient's wishes would be a violation of their autonomy and could lead to legal and ethical consequences. Calling the ethics board or trying to convince the wife to override the patient's decision would not be appropriate, as the patient's wishes are clear.

Refusing to treat the patient is also not an option, as this would be abandoning the patient in their time of need. Instead, the medical team should respect the patient's decision and explore alternative treatments that do not involve blood transfusions, even if these alternatives are not as effective.

Options
A) LOD Score < 1
B) LOD Score < 3
C) LOD Score < 2
D) LOD Score > 3
E) LOD Score = 0","To determine if two loci have a high probability of being closely linked, researchers use the LOD (logarithm of odds) score. The LOD score is a statistical measure that estimates the likelihood of two loci being linked based on the recombination frequency between them.

A high LOD score indicates a high probability of linkage, while a low LOD score suggests a low probability of linkage. In general, a LOD score of 3 or higher is considered significant and suggests that the two loci are closely linked.

Let's analyze the options:

A) LOD Score < 1: This suggests a low probability of linkage, which is not what we are looking for.

B) LOD Score < 3: This includes LOD scores that are less than 3, which may not be significant enough to suggest a high probability of linkage.

C) LOD Score < 2: This is even less likely to suggest a high probability of linkage.

D) LOD Score > 3: This suggests a high probability of linkage, which is what we are looking for.

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Acyclovir
B) Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine
C) Ceftriaxone
D) Ceftriaxone and vancomycin
E) IV fluids and monitoring","To approach this question, let's analyze the information provided. The patient is a 32-year-old man presenting with fever, nausea, and vomiting, which started the previous night. His past medical history of asthma is noted, but his current symptoms do not seem directly related to asthma. The physical examination findings of diminished mobility of the neck in all four directions, with flexion of the neck causing discomfort, are highly suggestive of meningismus, which is indicative of meningitis.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is crucial in diagnosing meningitis. The results show an elevated cell count of 175/mm^3, which indicates a significant inflammatory response. The low glucose level of 49 mg/dL and elevated total protein of 55 mg/dL further support the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, as bacterial infections typically cause a decrease in glucose and an increase in protein levels in the CSF.

Given these findings, the best treatment for bacterial meningitis would involve antibiotics that cover the most common pathogens responsible for community-acquired bacterial meningitis, which include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae.

Among the options provided:

A) Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat viral infections, including herpes simplex virus encephalitis, but it is not the first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis.

B) Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine are antifungal medications used to treat fungal infections, including cryptococcal meningitis, but they are not indicated for bacterial meningitis.

C) Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic effective against many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including those that cause bacterial meningitis. However, using a single antibiotic may not provide adequate coverage for all potential pathogens.

D) Ceftriaxone and vancomycin is a combination that provides broad-spectrum coverage for bacterial meningitis, including against S. pneumoniae, which may be resistant to some cephalosporins. Vancomycin is effective against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and is often used in combination with a cephalosporin for empirical treatment of bacterial meningitis.

E) IV fluids and monitoring are supportive measures but do not address the underlying infection.

Therefore, the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is a combination of antibiotics that provides broad-spectrum coverage.

His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:
Platelet count 330,000/mm3
Bleeding time 6 mins
Prothrombin time 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec
Factor VIII activity decreased
Ristocetin cofactor assay decreased
He is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?
Options
A) Factor IX
B) Gp Ib
C) Factor XI
D) Vitamin K
E) Antithrombin III","The patient presents with bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth, which has worsened over time. The laboratory results show a normal platelet count, prolonged bleeding time, normal prothrombin time, and slightly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Additionally, the factor VIII activity and Ristocetin cofactor assay are decreased. These findings are indicative of von Willebrand disease (VWD), a common inherited bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF plays a critical role in the coagulation cascade by facilitating platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall and serving as a carrier protein for factor VIII. The Ristocetin cofactor assay measures the ability of VWF to bind to platelets, and its decrease in this patient further supports the diagnosis of VWD.

Given the role of VWF in the coagulation cascade, the aspect of coagulation most likely affected is the interaction between VWF and platelets, specifically the glycoprotein Ib (Gp Ib) receptor on platelets. VWF binds to Gp Ib, which is essential for platelet adhesion and aggregation at the site of injury.

D) NADPH oxidase deficiency
E) Defect in BTK gene","The patient's symptoms of failure to gain weight, chronic diarrhea, and multiple bacterial and viral infections since birth suggest a severe immunodeficiency disorder. The absence of a thymic shadow and the lack of germinal centers in the lymph node biopsy further support this diagnosis. The thymus plays a crucial role in the development of T cells, and the absence of a thymic shadow suggests a problem with T cell development. The absence of germinal centers in the lymph node biopsy indicates a defect in B cell development and function.

Among the options provided, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that affects both T and B cell development. ADA is an enzyme that is necessary for the breakdown of toxic molecules in lymphocytes. A deficiency in ADA leads to the accumulation of these toxic molecules, which damages lymphocytes and impairs immune function.

The other options are also immunodeficiency disorders, but they do not fit the patient's symptoms as well as ADA deficiency. A defect in the WASP gene causes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. A defect in the ATM gene causes ataxia-telangiectasia, which is characterized by ataxia, telangiectasias, and recurrent infections. NADPH oxidase deficiency causes chronic granulomatous disease, which is characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. A defect in the BTK gene causes X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which is characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins and recurrent infections.

The patient’s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors. Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation. Which of the following most likely transmitted the organism responsible for this patient’s illness?
Options
A) Ixodes scapularis
B) Tsetse fly
C) Culicidae
D) Dermacentor variabilis
E) Anopheles","The patient's symptoms of sudden drooping of the right side of her face with drooling and excessive tearing, along with the physical examination findings of facial muscle asymmetry and decreased taste sensation, are indicative of Lyme disease, specifically Lyme meningitis or Lyme encephalitis, which can cause cranial nerve palsies, including facial nerve palsy. The presence of a circular red rash with central clearing on the trunk further supports this diagnosis, as it is a characteristic sign of Lyme disease, known as erythema migrans. Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. The patient's recent trip to northern Maine and outdoor activities increase the likelihood of tick exposure. Among the options provided, Ixodes scapularis, also known as the blacklegged tick, is the primary vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern United States, including Maine. Therefore, the most likely transmitter of the organism responsible for this patient's illness is the Ixodes scapularis tick.

Red cell distribution width 18% (N = 13%–15%)
Leukocyte count 7,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?""
Options
A) Regular blood transfusions
B) Fluoxetine
C) Methylphenidate
D) Iron supplementation
E) Allogenic stem cell transplantation","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The 16-year-old boy presents with fatigue, low energy, and a decline in academic performance. He also exhibits physical signs such as conjunctival pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), and concavity of the fingernails (koilonychia). These findings are suggestive of iron deficiency anemia.

Laboratory results support this diagnosis, showing a low hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL, a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 μm3 (indicating microcytic anemia), and an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) of 18%. The RDW is a measure of the variation in red blood cell size, and an elevated value indicates a larger variation in size, which is consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

Given the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to address the underlying cause of the anemia, which is iron deficiency.

1132,"A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?
Options
A) Left frontal lobe
B) Left internal capsule
C) Left temporal lobe
D) Right frontal lobe
E) Right temporal lobe","The patient's symptoms of sudden onset speech changes, characterized by distorted and disconnected words that make no sense, along with physical frustration, suggest a condition known as expressive aphasia or Broca's aphasia. This type of aphasia is typically associated with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, particularly the frontal lobe, which is responsible for speech production and articulation.

Additionally, the patient's weakness in the right arm suggests that the damage is likely localized to the left hemisphere of the brain, as the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body. 

Considering these factors, the location that would best explain the patient's symptoms is the left frontal lobe, specifically Broca's area, which is responsible for speech production and articulation.

The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and fetal weight is estimated to be at the 90th percentile for gestational age. During delivery, there is an arrest in the second stage of labor, and a vacuum-assisted delivery is performed. Postpartum examination shows a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following complications?
Options
A) Urge incontinence
B) Vesicovaginal fistula
C) Fecal incontinence
D) Small bowel obstruction
E) Stress incontinence","The patient is a 27-year-old woman who underwent a vacuum-assisted delivery due to an arrest in the second stage of labor. Postpartum examination revealed a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position. This type of laceration involves the external anal sphincter and/or the internal anal sphincter, which can lead to complications related to anal sphincter function.

Considering the location and severity of the laceration, the patient is most likely to experience fecal incontinence. This is because the external anal sphincter plays a crucial role in maintaining continence, and damage to this muscle can lead to impaired anal function.

While stress incontinence (option E) is a possible complication of childbirth, it is more commonly associated with damage to the urethral sphincter or pelvic floor muscles, rather than a third-degree laceration extending into the perineum.

Urge incontinence (option A) is typically associated with overactive bladder or neurological disorders, rather than a direct result of a third-degree laceration.

Vesicovaginal fistula (option B) is a possible complication of childbirth, but it is more commonly associated with prolonged obstructed labor or severe vaginal trauma, rather than a third-degree laceration.

Small bowel obstruction (option D) is not a direct complication of a third-degree laceration and is more commonly associated with adhesions or other abdominal pathologies.

The renal biopsy demonstrates hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. What is the most likely cause?
Options
A) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)
B) Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
C) Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
D) Minimal change disease
E) Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN)","To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, let's break down the key findings:

1. **Hemoglobin level of 8.6 gm/dL**: This indicates anemia, which can be seen in various kidney diseases due to decreased erythropoietin production.

2. **Serum creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL**: This is significantly elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.

3. **Negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA)**: This makes autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) less likely.

4. **Positive for C3 nephritic factor**: This is a specific autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative complement pathway, leading to continuous activation and consumption of complement, which is often seen in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).

5. **Urinalysis showing 3+ proteinuria**: This indicates significant kidney damage leading to protein loss in the urine.

6. **Renal biopsy demonstrating hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane**: This is characteristic of MPGN, which involves the proliferation of cells within the glomerulus and the deposition of immune complexes.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is **Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)**. This condition is characterized by changes in the glomeruli that lead to kidney dysfunction and is often associated with the presence of C3 nephritic factor.

128,"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?
Options
A) CD8+ T lymphocytes
B) Bone marrow-derived macrophages
C) CD4+ T lymphocytes
D) Natural killer cells
E) Band neutrophils","To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy and monoclonal gammopathy, which is characterized by the presence of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation.

Given this description, we are looking for a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill abnormal cells, such as cancer cells or virus-infected cells, without prior activation. This is a key feature of innate immunity, which provides immediate defense against infection and other forms of cellular stress.

Among the options provided, natural killer (NK) cells are the best fit for this description. NK cells are a type of lymphocyte that can recognize and kill abnormal cells, including cancer cells and virus-infected cells, without prior activation. They do not require opsonization, priming, or prior activation to recognize and kill their targets.

NK cells are also known to play a key role in the surveillance and elimination of cancer cells, including multiple myeloma, which is a type of cancer characterized by the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids is begun. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?
Options
A) Pulmonary hypertension
B) Lower extremity gangrene
C) Palpable purpura
D) Posterior uveitis
E) Thoracic aortic aneurysm","The patient's symptoms, including frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, myalgias, pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye, along with the laboratory results showing an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are indicative of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). The temporal artery biopsy showing transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina further confirms this diagnosis. GCA is a form of large vessel vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, with a predilection for the branches of the external carotid artery, particularly the temporal artery. One of the most significant complications of GCA is visual loss, which can occur due to ischemia of the optic nerve or retina. However, the question asks about the complication that the patient is at greatest risk of developing, given her condition. Among the options provided, posterior uveitis is a known complication of GCA, and given the patient's symptoms of double vision and inward deviation of the left eye, there is already some indication of ocular involvement. Therefore, the patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing posterior uveitis.

The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?
Options
A) Gram stain positive CSF
B) Peripheral eosinophilia
C) Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis
D) Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count
E) Oligoclonal bands on cerebrospinal fluid analysis","The 4-year-old boy initially presents with symptoms of gastroenteritis, including vomiting, loose stools, and bloody stools, which have led to dehydration and decreased oral intake. The development of lower extremity weakness and tingling, along with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes, suggests a neurological complication. Given the patient's symptoms and the progression of the illness, a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is likely. GBS is an autoimmune disorder that can be triggered by infections, including gastrointestinal infections. The classic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) finding in GBS is an increased protein level with a normal cell count, which is indicative of albuminocytologic dissociation. This occurs due to the breakdown of the blood-nerve barrier, leading to increased protein leakage into the CSF without a significant inflammatory response.

Options
A) Renal papillary necrosis
B) Allergic interstitial nephritis
C) Cholesterol embolization
D) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
E) Polyarteritis nodosa","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 61-year-old man who underwent an emergency cardiac catheterization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris two weeks prior to the current presentation. He now presents with decreased urinary output and malaise. He also has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips.

2. **Medications**: Prior to admission, his medications included insulin and naproxen. Post-cardiac intervention, he was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: Notable findings include a fever (38°C or 100.4°F), tachycardia (93/min), and mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet.

4. **Laboratory Findings**: Key findings include leukocytosis (16,400/mm3) with a mild increase in eosinophils (11%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (68 mm/h), and significant renal impairment (serum urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, creatinine 4.2 mg/dL).

5. **Renal Biopsy**: Shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles.

Given these findings, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed down based on the presence of renal impairment, the specific findings on renal biopsy, and the clinical context.

- **Renal Papillary Necrosis (A)**: This condition is associated with analgesic abuse, diabetes, and sickle cell disease. While the patient has diabetes, the renal biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.

- **Allergic Interstitial Nephritis (B)**: This condition is a common cause of acute kidney injury and can be associated with medications, including NSAIDs and beta-lactam antibiotics. However, the renal biopsy findings and the presence of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles do not support this diagnosis.

- **Cholesterol Embolization (C)**: This condition occurs when cholesterol crystals break loose from atherosclerotic plaques, typically after vascular procedures like cardiac catheterization. The clinical presentation, including the skin findings (mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet) and the renal biopsy showing intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles (consistent with cholesterol crystals), strongly supports this diagnosis.

- **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (D)** and **Polyarteritis Nodosa (E)**: These are both vasculitides that can present with renal involvement, but the specific findings in this case, particularly the renal biopsy, do not support these diagnoses.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cholesterol embolization, which is a known complication of vascular procedures like cardiac catheterization.

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Scarlet fever
B) Scalded skin syndrome
C) Impetigo
D) Erysipela
E) Pyoderma","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Age and Symptoms**: The patient is a 7-day-old newborn boy presenting with fever, irritability, and generalized erythema, which progressed to blisters around the buttocks, hands, and feet.

2. **Initial Management and Progression**: The parents initially tried to manage the symptoms with acetaminophen, but the condition worsened.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has a high fever (39.0°C or 102.3°F), tachycardia (130/min), and tachypnea (45/min). The skin shows diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters, with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. The ears, nose, and oral mucosa are spared.

4. **Nikolsky’s Sign**: This is a critical finding. A positive Nikolsky’s sign indicates that the skin slips away from the underlying tissues when gentle pressure is applied, which is characteristic of certain skin conditions where there is intraepidermal or subepidermal cleavage.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Scarlet Fever**: Typically presents with a sandpapery rash, fever, and pharyngitis, but it does not usually cause blisters or a positive Nikolsky’s sign.

- **B) Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSS)**: This condition, caused by staphylococcal toxins, presents with tender erythematous skin that progresses to bullae and peels, often with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. It is more common in infants and young children.

- **C) Impetigo**: A superficial skin infection that can cause blisters, but it usually does not have a positive Nikolsky’s sign and is not typically associated with systemic symptoms like fever.

- **D) Erysipela**: A type of cellulitis that presents with a well-defined area of redness and swelling, but it does not typically cause blisters or a positive Nikolsky’s sign.

- **E) Pyoderma**: A general term for bacterial skin infections, which can include impetigo but does not specifically match the presentation described.

Considering the age of the patient, the progression of symptoms, and especially the presence of a positive Nikolsky’s sign, the most likely diagnosis is Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS).

1011,"A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider for evaluation of a ""painful mass in my left groin."" She says that her symptoms began 4 days ago as a painful mass that slowly enlarged, ruptured, and ulcerated. However, she denies fever, chills, dysuria, or hematuria. Three weeks prior to her current symptoms she noted a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days. She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while she was traveling in Southeast Asia. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 139/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 18/min.

Options
A) Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain
B) Gram-negative rods in school of fish formation on Gram stain
C) PCR positive for Chlamydia trachomatis
D) Positive RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS
E) Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells","To approach this question, let's break down the patient's symptoms and history. The patient presents with a painful mass in her left groin that began 4 days ago, slowly enlarged, ruptured, and ulcerated. She also mentions a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days, three weeks prior to her current symptoms. Additionally, she admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while traveling in Southeast Asia.

The patient's physical examination reveals left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration. Given her symptoms and history, we need to consider possible causes of lymphadenopathy and ulcerative lesions.

Option A, Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain, is characteristic of granuloma inguinale, a bacterial infection caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. This condition typically presents with painless, ulcerative lesions, which is not consistent with the patient's painful mass.

Option B, Gram-negative rods in school of fish formation on Gram stain, is typical of Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid. Chancroid is characterized by painful, ulcerative lesions, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Option C, PCR positive for Chlamydia trachomatis, would suggest a diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a sexually transmitted infection caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis. LGV typically presents with painful lymphadenopathy, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Option D, Positive RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS, would suggest a diagnosis of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum. While syphilis can cause lymphadenopathy, the patient's symptoms are not typical of syphilis.

Option E, Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells, is characteristic of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which typically presents with painful, vesicular lesions, not ulcerative lymph nodes.

Considering the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The patient's painful, ulcerative lymph nodes are consistent with LGV, and her history of unprotected sex in Southeast Asia increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

683,"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?
Options
A) Isoniazid
B) Fluconazole
C) Caspofungin
D) Prednisone
E) Surgical resection of the infiltrates","Analyzing the situation, the 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma presents with worsening shortness of breath, steadily deteriorating lung function, and episodes of pneumonia, coughing, and wheezing. The symptoms of greenish sputum with specks of red, fever, malaise, and expectoration of brown mucous plugs, along with the physical exam findings of inspiratory crackles and coarse breath sounds, are indicative of a chronic and severe respiratory infection. The chest radiograph showing atelectasis and ""glove-finger shadows"" suggests bronchiectasis, a condition characterized by the irreversible dilatation of the bronchial tree. The elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels further support the presence of an allergic component.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a condition that occurs in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis and is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus. The treatment for ABPA typically involves the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent further lung damage.

Among the options provided, prednisone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat ABPA. Isoniazid is an antitubercular medication, fluconazole is an antifungal medication, caspofungin is an antifungal medication, and surgical resection of the infiltrates is not typically indicated for ABPA.

500,"A 30-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of infertility. He and his wife have been trying to get pregnant for the past two years. They have used fertility monitors and other aids without success. A hysterosalpingogram in his wife was normal. The patient has a history of cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child. He was briefly hospitalized for severe pneumonia when he was 9-years-old. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs. Notably, cardiac auscultation is silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This patient most likely has a mutation in which of the following classes of proteins?
Options
A) Microtubule monomeric protein
B) Lysosomal trafficking regulator protein
C) Transmembrane ion channel protein
D) Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein
E) Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein","The patient's presentation of infertility, combined with a history of cleft lip, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and severe pneumonia, along with the finding of a silent left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line on cardiac auscultation, suggests a condition that affects multiple systems. The patient's symptoms are consistent with Kartagener syndrome, a primary ciliary dyskinesia characterized by situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. This condition is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in ciliary structure and function, specifically the dynein arm of cilia, which is responsible for ciliary motility. The dynein arm is composed of microtubule monomeric proteins that form the axoneme of cilia. Therefore, the patient most likely has a mutation in a microtubule monomeric protein.

667,"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
Options
A) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis
B) Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate
C) Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal
D) Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus
E) Primary germ cell neoplasia of the testicle","The patient presents with a painless right-sided scrotal swelling that is soft, cystic, and nontender. The swelling transilluminates, which indicates that it is filled with fluid. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass, suggesting that it is not a hernia. Additionally, there are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position, which further supports that it is not a hernia.

Given these characteristics, the most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which is a layer of tissue that surrounds the testis. This imbalance can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the scrotum, resulting in a hydrocele. A hydrocele is a common condition that can cause a painless scrotal swelling, and it is often diagnosed based on the presence of a transilluminating mass.

129,"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.7 g/dL
Leukocytes 11,200/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h
Serum
Creatine kinase 212 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
Options
A) Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy
B) Inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound
C) Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy
D) Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
E) Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.

1. **Progressive muscle weakness** over five months, particularly affecting the muscles in the shoulders and hips, with difficulty in activities such as getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. This pattern of weakness suggests a proximal muscle involvement.
2. **Difficulty with swallowing solid foods** but no trouble with liquids, indicating dysphagia, which can be associated with various neuromuscular conditions.
3. **Family history** of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, primarily affecting males. However, female carriers can be symptomatic, though typically less severely than males.
4. **Laboratory findings** show elevated muscle enzymes (Creatine kinase, Lactate dehydrogenase, AST, and ALT), which indicate muscle damage.

Given these points, the differential diagnoses could include muscular dystrophies, inflammatory myopathies, and other neuromuscular disorders. However, the key to narrowing down the diagnosis lies in the specific pattern of muscle weakness, the presence of elevated muscle enzymes, and the family history of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.

**Options Analysis:**

- **A) Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy:** This finding is more typical of conditions like polymyositis, where there is inflammation within the muscle fascicles.
- **B) Inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound:** This would be more indicative of rheumatologic conditions affecting the joints, such as rheumatoid arthritis.
- **C) Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy:** This is characteristic of dermatomyositis, another type of inflammatory myopathy, but the clinical presentation does not strongly suggest dermatomyositis.
- **D) Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies:** These antibodies are associated with myasthenia gravis, a condition characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue, especially affecting the ocular and bulbar muscles initially, which does not match this patient's presentation.
- **E) Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis:** Given the family history of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and the patient's symptoms of progressive muscle weakness, particularly affecting proximal muscles, this option is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis. Female carriers of the dystrophin gene mutation can exhibit a range of symptoms from mild to severe, including the pattern of weakness described in this patient.

392,"A 34-year-old patient is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. An EKG shows sinus tachycardia and chest radiograph reveals an enlarged cardiac silhouette. While observing sinus tachycardia on the patient's telemetry, you note that the radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration. What should be the next step in management of this patient?
Options
A) IV Heparin
B) Pericardiocentesis
C) Chest CT scan
D) Pericardial window
E) Insert chest tube","The patient's presentation of sinus tachycardia and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiograph, along with the absence of a palpable radial pulse during inspiration, is highly suggestive of cardiac tamponade. This is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, compressing the heart and impeding its ability to fill and pump blood effectively. The pulsus paradoxus, indicated by the absence of a palpable radial pulse during inspiration, is a classic sign of cardiac tamponade.

Given the urgency of this condition, the next step in management should be to relieve the pressure on the heart by removing the fluid from the pericardial space. Among the provided options, pericardiocentesis is the procedure that involves the insertion of a needle or catheter into the pericardial space to aspirate the fluid. This is the most appropriate immediate intervention to stabilize the patient by improving cardiac output and blood pressure.

1163,"A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?
Options
A) Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
B) Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation
C) Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
D) Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
E) Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation","To determine the most likely lymphatic route for ovarian cancer metastasis to the brain, we need to consider the lymphatic drainage pathways of the ovaries and how cancer cells can spread to distant sites, including the brain.

The ovaries primarily drain into the lymph nodes along the ovarian vessels, which then drain into the lumbar trunks. From the lumbar trunks, the lymphatic fluid flows into the cisterna chyli, a dilated lymphatic sac located anterior to the second lumbar vertebra. The cisterna chyli then drains into the thoracic duct, which is the main lymphatic vessel that drains lymph from the lower and left upper body into the bloodstream via the left subclavian vein.

For ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain, the cancer cells would need to enter the systemic circulation. Given the anatomy of the lymphatic system, the most likely route would involve the cancer cells spreading from the sentinel nodes (the first lymph nodes to receive drainage from the ovaries) to the left lumbar trunk, then to the cisterna chyli, followed by the thoracic duct, and finally into the left subclavian vein, where they can enter the systemic circulation and potentially reach the brain.

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is produced by cells located in which region of the histology slide shown in figure A?
Options
A) A
B) B
C) C
D) D
E) E","The patient's symptoms of episodic headaches, palpitations, sweating, and high blood pressure are suggestive of a condition known as pheochromocytoma. This condition is caused by a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. The histology slide in figure A is likely a section of the adrenal gland, and the region where the cells producing the patient's symptoms are located would be the medulla.

The adrenal medulla is the inner part of the adrenal gland, and it is responsible for producing catecholamines. The cells in this region are called chromaffin cells, and they are the ones that are affected in pheochromocytoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is the region that corresponds to the adrenal medulla.

918,"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

C) Primary adrenal insufficiency
D) Conversion disorder
E) Factitious disorder imposed on another
""","Let's analyze the situation step by step. The 5-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department due to a sudden loss of consciousness. He has a history of asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. The boy's initial symptoms of somnolence and diaphoresis, along with a serum glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L, suggest hypoglycemia. The administration of a dextrose infusion resulted in the normalization of his glucose concentration and improvement of his symptoms. However, he experienced another episode of decreased consciousness overnight, with serum studies showing a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (which is elevated), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (which is low). The elevated insulin concentration during a hypoglycemic episode is indicative of exogenous insulin administration, as endogenous insulin production would be suppressed during hypoglycemia. The low C-peptide concentration further supports this, as C-peptide is a byproduct of endogenous insulin production. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is that someone, likely the mother, is administering insulin to the child, which is a form of factitious disorder imposed on another, also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

187,"A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?
Options
A) The ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine
B) The ribosome will recognize the inappropriately inserted valine residue and terminate protein translation
C) The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine
D) The mischarged tRNA will be degraded by the proteasome
E) The mischarged tRNA will be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase","To answer this question, let's break down the process of protein synthesis and the role of the ribosome in recognizing and incorporating amino acids.

During protein synthesis, the ribosome reads the sequence of codons on the mRNA and matches them to the corresponding amino acids carried by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The tRNA molecules are charged with the correct amino acid by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which ensure that the correct amino acid is attached to the tRNA corresponding to a specific codon.

In this experiment, the researchers have biochemically charged a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine. This means that the tRNA molecule that normally carries lysine is now carrying valine. They then insert this mischarged tRNA into the cell and design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine.

The ribosome is responsible for recognizing the codons on the mRNA and incorporating the corresponding amino acids into the growing peptide chain. However, the ribosome does not have a proofreading mechanism to recognize mischarged tRNA molecules. Instead, it relies on the accuracy of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to ensure that the correct amino acid is attached to the tRNA.

Given this, the most likely outcome is that the mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated into the codons that specify for lysine. The ribosome will recognize the tRNA molecule as a Lys-tRNA and incorporate the valine into the growing peptide chain, even though it is the wrong amino acid.

C) Bacterial lymphatic infection of the epidermis
D) Infestation with bloodsucking parasites
E) Brown recluse spider envenomation","The patient is a 70-year-old woman presenting with a burning pain in her upper right back and chest, accompanied by a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which initially causes chickenpox and then remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia. The reactivation of the virus leads to the characteristic rash and pain.

The patient's age and the presence of a rash with clear vesicles and crusty lesions are consistent with herpes zoster. The fact that she volunteers at an animal shelter and has no prior history of back pain or recent injury makes other causes less likely. The presence of a rash and pain in a dermatomal distribution (i.e., following the path of a nerve) is a hallmark of herpes zoster.

Considering the options provided, the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease is the viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia, which is the characteristic mechanism of herpes zoster.

Which of the following ligaments must be cut in order to access this space?
Options
A) Phrenoesophageal ligament
B) Gastrohepatic ligament
C) Phrenicocolic ligament
D) Ligamentum venosum
E) Falciform ligament
""","To access the space posterior to the stomach and reach the pancreatic tumor during a laparoscopic enucleation, the surgeon needs to navigate through the lesser sac (also known as the omental bursa), which is located behind the stomach and the liver. The lesser sac is separated from the greater sac (the main peritoneal cavity) by the lesser omentum, which includes the gastrohepatic ligament.

The gastrohepatic ligament is a part of the lesser omentum that connects the stomach to the liver. It contains the left gastric artery and vein, as well as lymphatic vessels and nerves. To access the space behind the stomach and reach the pancreas, the surgeon typically needs to incise or cut the gastrohepatic ligament to enter the lesser sac.

Menses have occurred at regular 28-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years and last for 5 to 6 days. She is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options
A) Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin
B) Ascending infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or surrounding tissue
C) Fluid-filled sac within the ovary
D) Pregnancy
E) Hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor of the myometrium","To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the patient's presentation. The 15-year-old girl experiences episodic pelvic pain that radiates to her back and thighs, starting a few hours before her menstrual period and lasting for 2 days. This timing is crucial, as it suggests that the pain is related to her menstrual cycle. Additionally, she has been taking ibuprofen, which has provided some relief, indicating that the pain may be responsive to anti-inflammatory or analgesic medication.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

A) Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin: This option describes the process involved in primary dysmenorrhea, which is the most common cause of menstrual cramps. The pain is caused by uterine contractions that are mediated by prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances produced by the uterus. This condition is typically characterized by crampy pain in the lower abdomen that begins just before or at the onset of menses and lasts for 1-3 days.

B) Ascending infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or surrounding tissue: This option describes pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is usually associated with symptoms such as fever, vaginal discharge, and pelvic pain. However, the patient's presentation does not suggest an infectious process.

C) Fluid-filled sac within the ovary: This option describes an ovarian cyst, which can cause pelvic pain, but the pain is usually more constant and not necessarily related to the menstrual cycle.

D) Pregnancy: While pregnancy can cause pelvic pain, the patient's regular menstrual cycles and the nature of the pain make this option less likely.

E) Hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor of the myometrium: This option describes a uterine leiomyoma (fibroid), which can cause pelvic pain, but the pain is usually more constant and not necessarily related to the menstrual cycle.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the timing of the pain in relation to her menstrual cycle, the most likely cause of her symptoms is primary dysmenorrhea, which is described in option A.

618,"A microbiologist has isolated several colonies of Escherichia coli on an agar plate. The microbiologist exposes the agar plate to ciprofloxacin, which destroys all of the bacteria except for one surviving colony. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony?
Options
A) Replacement of D-alanine
B) Mutation of DNA gyrase
C) Inactivation by bacterial transferase
D) Production of β-lactamase
E) Modification of surface binding proteins","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The microbiologist has isolated several colonies of Escherichia coli on an agar plate. After exposing the plate to ciprofloxacin, all bacteria are destroyed except for one surviving colony. This indicates that the surviving colony has developed resistance to ciprofloxacin.

2. **Understanding Ciprofloxacin**: Ciprofloxacin is a type of antibiotic known as a fluoroquinolone. It works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes critical for DNA replication and transcription. By inhibiting these enzymes, ciprofloxacin prevents the bacteria from replicating and ultimately leads to their death.

3. **Mechanisms of Resistance**: Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics through several mechanisms. For fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, common resistance mechanisms include mutations in the target enzymes (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV), efflux pumps that remove the antibiotic from the cell, and modifications that protect the target enzymes from the antibiotic.

4. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A) Replacement of D-alanine**: This is a mechanism of resistance to vancomycin, not fluoroquinolones.
   - **B) Mutation of DNA gyrase**: This is a direct mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin, as mutations in DNA gyrase can reduce the antibiotic's ability to bind and inhibit the enzyme.
   - **C) Inactivation by bacterial transferase**: This is a mechanism of resistance to certain antibiotics, but it's more commonly associated with aminoglycosides.
   - **D) Production of β-lactamase**: This is a mechanism of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, not fluoroquinolones.
   - **E) Modification of surface binding proteins**: While modifications in surface proteins can affect antibiotic binding, this is not a primary mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the information and analysis, the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony of Escherichia coli is a mutation of DNA gyrase, which directly affects the target of ciprofloxacin.

1129,"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care ward due to progressive dyspnea, cough with pink sputum, and diaphoresis. He had 2 myocardial infarctions at the age of 66 and 69 years and suffers from chronic heart failure. At the time of presentation, his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 29/min, and temperature 35.5°C (95.9°F). On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?

597,"Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?
Options
A) Increase in concentration of serum myoglobin
B) Closure of the ductus arteriosus
C) Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+
D) Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
E) Allosteric alteration of heme groups","The newborn boy was initially evaluated for tachypnea and was found to have increased work of breathing, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and was started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, which led to immediate improvement. However, three hours later, the newborn became tachypneic again and developed blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes, indicating cyanosis.

The inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP is likely nitric oxide (NO), which is commonly used to treat pulmonary hypertension in newborns. However, NO can also cause methemoglobinemia, a condition characterized by the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in hemoglobin, leading to a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues.

The blue-grey discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes is consistent with methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than normal hemoglobin, but it is unable to release oxygen to tissues, leading to tissue hypoxia.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis is the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, which is consistent with methemoglobinemia.

256,"The Kozak sequence for the Beta-globin gene has a known mutation which decreases, though does not abolish, translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. What would the blood smear be expected to show in a patient positive for this mutation?
Options
A) Macrocytic red blood cells
B) Hyperchromic red blood cells
C) Microcytic red blood cells
D) Bite cells
E) Ringed sideroblasts","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

Thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The Kozak sequence is a region of the gene that plays a crucial role in the initiation of translation, the process by which the cell reads the genetic code in the mRNA to build a protein.

In this case, the mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene decreases, but does not abolish, the translation of the Beta-globin mRNA. This means that the cell is still able to produce some Beta-globin protein, but not as much as it would normally.

Thalassemia intermedia is a form of thalassemia that is characterized by a decrease in the production of Beta-globin protein, but not a complete absence of it. This leads to a range of symptoms, including anemia, fatigue, and other complications.

Now, let's consider what the blood smear would be expected to show in a patient with this mutation.

A blood smear is a test that involves spreading a sample of blood onto a slide and staining it with a dye to visualize the different components of the blood. In the case of thalassemia intermedia, the blood smear would be expected to show red blood cells that are smaller than normal, a condition known as microcytosis.

This is because the decrease in Beta-globin protein production leads to a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells, which in turn leads to a decrease in the size of the cells.

Therefore, the expected finding on a blood smear in a patient with this mutation would be microcytic red blood cells.

1122,"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?
Options
A) Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus
B) Compressive tumor of the pons
C) Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency
D) Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit
E) Infarction of the brainstem","The patient's symptoms of periodic painful double vision that occur only when looking sideways, along with the presence of an adduction deficit in one eye and nystagmus in the other eye when looking in the direction of the adduction deficit, are highly suggestive of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is characterized by impaired adduction of the eye on the side of the lesion, often accompanied by nystagmus of the abducting eye. The bilateral disc hyperemia is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Considering the patient's recent history of a fall and a CT scan of the head showing no abnormalities, it is likely that the patient has a demyelinating lesion affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is a common cause of INO. The MLF is a group of fibers that connects the cranial nerve nuclei controlling eye movements and is often affected in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Among the options provided, choice A describes demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which is the most likely cause of this patient's findings.

Partial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec
Mixing study (PTT) 89 sec
What is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?
Options
A) Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
B) Antibodies directed against phospholipids
C) Antibodies directed against endothelial cells
D) Vitamin K deficiency
E) Disseminated intravascular coagulation","To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, let's analyze the information provided.

The patient is a 29-year-old female presenting with aching pain in her left leg, which has progressively worsened over several days. She recently experienced a sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs, but an X-ray after the event was negative for fracture. Her past medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a history of one spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation.

The physical examination reveals a pink and slightly swollen left leg, and Homan's sign is positive, indicating a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A Doppler ultrasound confirms a thrombus in the left popliteal vein.

Laboratory results show a normal platelet count, a slightly elevated prothrombin time (PT), a significantly elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and a mixing study (PTT) that remains elevated at 89 seconds.

Considering the patient's history of SLE and spontaneous abortion, along with the laboratory findings, the most likely cause of her condition is related to an autoimmune disorder. The elevated PTT and failure of the mixing study to correct the prolongation suggest the presence of an inhibitor, which is often seen in autoimmune conditions.

Among the options provided, choice B describes antibodies directed against phospholipids, which is characteristic of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is a known complication of SLE and can cause venous thrombosis, such as DVT, as well as recurrent spontaneous abortions.

Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?
Options
A) Acts as an important opsonin  
B) Plays a role in angioedema
C) Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor
D) Creates pores in the cell membrane
E) Induces the alternative complement pathway","To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's presentation and medical history. The patient is a 25-year-old woman who previously presented with symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), confirmed by the presence of diplococci on Gram stain and growth on Thayer-Martin agar, which is indicative of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. However, the patient reports using safe sex practices, which might suggest that the infection is not solely due to sexual transmission. Additionally, the patient has a history of meningitis and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, which suggests an underlying immune system defect.

The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Given the patient's history of infections with encapsulated bacteria (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae), the most likely component of the innate immune system that is deficient in this patient is the complement system.

The complement system is a group of proteins that play a crucial role in the innate immune system by helping to eliminate pathogens from the body. One of the key functions of the complement system is to act as an opsonin, which helps to mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells.

Considering the options provided, the best answer is the one that describes the component that acts as an important opsonin.

1236,"A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?
Options
A) 9/100
B) 1/10
C) 18/100
D) 81/100
E) 9/10","To determine the chance that the child will have the disease of interest, we first need to identify the disease. Based on the symptoms described, such as recurrent upper respiratory infections, the need for antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, the disease in question is likely Cystic Fibrosis (CF).

Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, meaning that an individual must inherit two defective copies of the gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. Carriers of the disease have one normal and one defective copy of the gene and typically do not display symptoms but can pass the defective gene to their offspring.

Given that the 21-year-old female has Cystic Fibrosis, she is homozygous recessive for the defective gene (let's denote the defective gene as ""r"" and the normal gene as ""R""). Her genotype is rr.

Her husband does not have the disease phenotype, but since he is from a population where the prevalence of the disease is 1/100, we can assume the carrier frequency in this population is higher. For an autosomal recessive disease, the carrier frequency is typically twice the square root of the disease frequency. However, for simplicity, let's proceed with understanding that he could be either RR (homozygous dominant, not a carrier) or Rr (heterozygous, a carrier), but we don't know which.

The chance that their child will have the disease (rr genotype) depends on the genotype of the father. If the father is RR, none of the children will have the disease. If the father is Rr, there's a 50% chance each child will inherit the defective gene from the mother and the normal gene from the father (Rr genotype), making them a carrier but not affected, and a 50% chance they will inherit the defective gene from both parents (rr genotype), making them affected.

Since we don't know the father's genotype but know the prevalence of the disease in his population, we can estimate the probability he is a carrier. The carrier frequency can be estimated as approximately 2 times the square root of the disease frequency for an autosomal recessive disease. However, given the options and the need for a straightforward calculation, we'll simplify our approach based on the provided choices.

If the father is a carrier (Rr), the chance that any child will have the disease (rr) is 50% because the child must inherit the ""r"" allele from both parents. However, since we're considering the probability the father is a carrier in the first place, we need to incorporate the population prevalence.

The disease prevalence is 1/100, suggesting a carrier frequency that is significantly higher but not directly calculable from the information given without making assumptions about the population genetics. However, the question seems to simplify towards understanding the risk based on the father's potential carrier status without requiring a detailed population genetics calculation.

Given the options and simplifying our approach:

- If the father is not a carrier (RR), the risk to the children is 0%.
- If the father is a carrier (Rr), the risk to each child of being affected (rr) is 50%.

Since we're looking for a probability and the exact carrier frequency in the father's population isn't directly calculable from the given data without further assumptions, the question appears to aim towards understanding the basic genetic principles rather than precise population genetics calculations.

Therefore, considering the simplified scenario where the father's carrier status is a critical factor and acknowledging the question's structure, the best answer reflecting a basic understanding of genetic risk would be based on the assumption of the father being a carrier and the child having a 50% chance of inheriting the disease if the father is indeed a carrier. However, since this is a simplified explanation and the actual calculation of risk involves understanding the father's genotype and the population prevalence, the precise answer provided in the options might reflect a more straightforward genetic counseling scenario.

1121,"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician’s office with concerns about a recent pregnancy. She and her boyfriend had intercourse for the first time a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago she missed her menstrual period. She took several over the counter pregnancy tests that confirmed her pregnancy. She is tearful about the pregnancy and is very concerned. After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?
Options
A) Megestrol
B) Tamoxifen
C) Terbutaline
D) Mifepristone
E) Copper intrauterine device","To determine the best course of action for this patient, let's consider her situation and the options provided. The patient is seeking a medical abortion for her 6-week pregnancy. Medical abortion involves the use of medications to terminate a pregnancy. The most common regimen for medical abortion includes a combination of two medications: mifepristone and misoprostol.

Mifepristone is an antiprogestin that works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy. By blocking progesterone, mifepristone causes the uterine lining to break down, making it impossible for the embryo to implant and grow.

Let's examine the options provided:

A) Megestrol is a progestin, which is the opposite of what is needed for a medical abortion. It is used to treat various conditions, including hormone-sensitive cancers and certain infections, but it is not used for abortion.

B) Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen medication used primarily to treat breast cancer. It is not used for medical abortion.

C) Terbutaline is a bronchodilator used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions. It is not used for medical abortion.

D) Mifepristone is the correct answer. As explained, mifepristone is an antiprogestin that blocks the action of progesterone, making it an essential medication for medical abortion.

E) Copper intrauterine device (IUD) is a form of contraception that can be used for emergency contraception if inserted within a certain timeframe after unprotected sex. However, it is not a medication and is not used for medical abortion after a pregnancy has been confirmed.

Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?
Options
A) Broad ligament
B) Round ligament of the uterus
C) Ovarian ligament
D) Cardinal ligament
E) Infundibulopelvic ligament","The patient, a 36-year-old woman, presents with sudden-onset, severe right flank pain that began during her aerobics class without any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts and regular menstrual cycles. The abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding, indicating peritoneal irritation. The pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary, and Doppler studies detect right ovarian artery flow but no flow in the right ovarian vein. This suggests that the ovarian vein is likely thrombosed or obstructed, leading to ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion typically involves the infundibulopelvic ligament, which contains the ovarian vessels and nerves. When this ligament twists, it can cut off the blood supply to the ovary, leading to severe pain and potential ovarian necrosis. Therefore, the infundibulopelvic ligament is most likely to have been involved in this patient's condition.

188,"A 65-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer has been experiencing severe, unremitting pain. He has required escalating doses of oral morphine, but is now having dose limiting side-effects. His pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce his opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor. Which of the following was the most likely recommended agent?
Options
A) Propofol
B) Ketamine
C) Fentanyl
D) Ketorolac
E) Midazolam","To address the patient's severe, unremitting pain and reduce his opioid need, the pain management team is looking for an alternative that can interact with the NMDA-receptor. The NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor is a type of glutamate receptor that plays a role in pain perception and opioid tolerance. Among the provided options, the agent that is known for its interaction with the NMDA-receptor and is often used to reduce opioid requirements is ketamine.

Ketamine is an anesthetic agent that also has analgesic properties. It works by blocking the NMDA receptors in the brain, which can help reduce pain perception and decrease opioid tolerance. This makes it a useful adjunct in pain management, especially in cases where opioids are not providing sufficient relief or are causing unacceptable side effects.

The other options are not primarily used for their interaction with the NMDA-receptor in the context of reducing opioid need:

- Propofol (A) is a sedative-hypnotic agent used for anesthesia and sedation but does not have a significant role in NMDA-receptor interaction for pain management.
- Fentanyl (C) is a potent opioid, which would not reduce opioid need but rather increase it.
- Ketorolac (D) is an NSAID used for pain management but does not interact with the NMDA-receptor in a way that would reduce opioid requirements.
- Midazolam (E) is a benzodiazepine used for sedation and anxiolysis, not specifically for pain management through NMDA-receptor interaction.

Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes."" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:
Options
A) Metabolic alkalosis
B) Anion gap metabolic acidosis
C) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
D) Respiratory acidosis
E) Respiratory alkalosis","Let's think step by step. The 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presented with intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. The presence of abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate in the urine microscopy that looked like “folded envelopes"" suggests ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol is a common component of antifreeze and is sometimes ingested by individuals with a history of alcoholism. Ethylene glycol poisoning leads to an increased production of oxalic acid, which combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals. The metabolism of ethylene glycol also results in the production of glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which are both acidic metabolites that contribute to the development of metabolic acidosis. Specifically, the increase in acidic metabolites without a corresponding increase in chloride ions leads to an increase in the anion gap. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is an anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Options
A) Spironolactone therapy
B) Gonadectomy
C) Testosterone therapy
D) Vaginal dilatory therapy
E) Prednisolone therapy","The patient is a 15-year-old girl who has not had a menstrual period, and the examination reveals a blind-ended vaginal pouch, bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses, and ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. These findings are consistent with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a condition where an individual with a 46,XY karyotype is resistant to androgens, resulting in the development of female external genitalia despite the presence of testes. The bilateral inguinal masses are likely undescended testes.

Given the diagnosis of AIS, the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is gonadectomy, which is the surgical removal of the gonads (testes). This is recommended because the undescended testes have a high risk of developing malignancies, and removing them can reduce this risk. Additionally, gonadectomy can also reduce the risk of testicular cancer and eliminate the need for lifelong surveillance.

This exotoxin acts via ADP ribosylation, which inhibits protein synthesis in host cells, leading to the symptoms and complications of diphtheria. Therefore, the organism responsible for this patient's disease is best described as a Gram-positive bacterium producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation.

496,"A 55-year-old woman is found to have an abnormal mass on routine mammography. The mass is biopsied and cytology results are diagnostic for invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. The patient is started on chemotherapy and ultimately has the mass resected. She is taking tamoxifen and has regular outpatient follow up appointments to monitor for any recurrence of cancer. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, obesity, and a uterine leimyoma which was definitively treated last year. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 47. The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?
Options
A) Deep venous thrombosis
B) Endometrial cancer
C) Eruption of seborrheic keratoses
D) Increased bleeding
E) Osteoporosis","Considering the 55-year-old woman's diagnosis of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma and her treatment with tamoxifen, it is essential to evaluate potential complications associated with this medication. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. While it has beneficial effects on breast tissue, it can have adverse effects on other parts of the body. Among the options provided, one of the potential complications of tamoxifen therapy is an increased risk of endometrial cancer due to its estrogenic effects on the uterus. The patient's history of a uterine leiomyoma, which was definitively treated last year, does not directly influence this risk. However, her age and the fact that she is postmenopausal (last menstrual period at age 47) are relevant factors to consider when assessing the risk of endometrial cancer associated with tamoxifen use. Therefore, the potential complication that could occur in this patient is endometrial cancer.

595,"A 38-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with the complaint of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain for the past 2 hours. She states that she has experienced similar pain in the past. These episodes occur mostly after meals and often subside several hours after she finishes eating. Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg. A physical abdominal exam is unremarkable, including examination of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Duodenal peptic ulcer
B) Choledocholithiasis
C) Pancreatitis
D) Gastric peptic ulcer
E) Gallbladder cancer","The patient's symptoms of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain that occur mostly after meals and often subside several hours after eating are suggestive of a gastrointestinal issue. The fact that she has experienced similar pain in the past and has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months indicates a chronic condition. The patient's history of smoking and occasional alcohol consumption are risk factors for peptic ulcer disease. The physical abdominal exam being unremarkable does not rule out the possibility of a peptic ulcer. 

Between the options of duodenal peptic ulcer (A) and gastric peptic ulcer (D), the symptoms described are more consistent with a gastric peptic ulcer. Gastric peptic ulcers are more likely to cause pain after eating, whereas duodenal peptic ulcers tend to cause pain when the stomach is empty, often at night. 

Choledocholithiasis (B) would likely present with jaundice and right upper quadrant pain, pancreatitis (C) would present with severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, and gallbladder cancer (E) would be less likely given the patient's age and symptoms.

377,"A 3-month-old girl is brought to the physician because of a productive cough for 5 days. Over the past month, she has had several episodes of watery stools. She is exclusively breastfed every 3–4 hours for 15–20 minutes. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not yet been evaluated by a physician. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. The mother had no prenatal care. The infant is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. The infant has not received any immunizations. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Oral examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate. Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Options
A) Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes
B) DNA test for CFTR mutation
C) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test
D) Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes
E) T-cell receptor excision circle analysis","The 3-month-old girl presents with a productive cough, episodes of watery stools, and failure to gain weight. She is exclusively breastfed and has not received any immunizations. The infant's physical examination reveals white plaques covering the tongue and palate, rales heard bilaterally, and cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy. The presence of oral thrush (white plaques) and the overall clinical presentation suggest an immunocompromised state. Given the infant's age and lack of immunizations, a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a possible diagnosis. SCID is a group of rare disorders caused by mutations in different genes involved in the development and function of the immune system. T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis is a screening test used to detect SCID by measuring the presence of TRECs, which are circular DNA molecules formed during T-cell development. The absence or low levels of TRECs indicate a severe T-cell deficiency, which is characteristic of SCID. Therefore, T-cell receptor excision circle analysis is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis.

388,"A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to a pediatrician’s office for persistent fever. His temperature has ranged from 38.6°C–39.5°C (101.5°F–103.1°F) over the past week. He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient’s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?
Options
A) Staphylococcus
B) Pseudomonas
C) Burkholderia
D) Influenza
E) Candida","The patient is a 6-year-old boy with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections, and he is currently struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. The pediatrician mentions that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree, which increases the patient's chances of future infections.

Given the patient's symptoms and the mention of a gene defect on chromosome 7, it is likely that the patient has Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems, and is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7. The disease is characterized by the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and traps bacteria, leading to recurrent respiratory infections.

In adulthood, patients with CF are often colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium that is commonly found in the environment. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in CF patients, and can cause chronic lung infections and exacerbations. The bacterium is able to form biofilms in the airways, which makes it difficult to eradicate with antibiotics.

Therefore, the pathogen that will most likely infect this patient in adulthood is Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?
Options
A) Duloxetine
B) Trazodone
C) Bupropion
D) Mirtazapine
E) Citalopram","Analyzing the situation, the 32-year-old woman is presenting with symptoms of depression, including feeling depressed, difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, low concentration, low energy, and loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed. She also has a history of binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a history of bulimia nervosa. Given her history, it is essential to consider medications that may be contraindicated or require caution in patients with a history of eating disorders.

Among the options provided, Bupropion is a medication that should be used with caution in patients with a history of eating disorders, particularly those with a history of bulimia nervosa. Bupropion can increase the risk of seizures, and patients with a history of eating disorders may be at higher risk for seizures due to electrolyte imbalances. Furthermore, Bupropion can also increase the risk of weight loss, which may be a concern in patients with a history of eating disorders.

Therefore, considering the patient's history of bulimia nervosa, treatment with Bupropion should be avoided.

Options
A) Transplacental passage of thyroglobulin antibodies
B) Transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies
C) Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies
D) Transplacental viral infection
E) Opiate use in the mother","The 3-week-old male newborn presents with poor weight gain since birth, despite latching on and breastfeeding well. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy. The patient's symptoms, including irritability, diaphoresis, and a paucity of subcutaneous fat, suggest hyperthyroidism. The swelling of the neck at the midline may indicate a goiter. Given the mother's history of Graves' disease, it is likely that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies were transferred to the fetus through the placenta, causing neonatal hyperthyroidism. These antibodies can stimulate the thyroid gland, leading to excessive thyroid hormone production. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.

1255,"A 60-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Squamous cell hyperplasia
B) Lichen sclerosus
C) Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva
D) Lichen planus
E) Atrophic vaginitis","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Severe vulvar itching**: This symptom is present and has been worsening over the past year.
2. **Lack of relief with lubricants**: This suggests that the issue is not simply related to dryness or lubrication.
3. **Medical history**: The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, but these are not directly related to her current symptoms.
4. **Postmenopausal**: The patient is postmenopausal, which can lead to changes in the vulvar and vaginal areas due to decreased estrogen levels.
5. **Painful intercourse**: This symptom, combined with the physical findings, points towards a condition affecting the vulvar and possibly vaginal tissues.
6. **Physical examination findings**: The presence of dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area, atrophy of the labia minora, a retracted clitoris, and pale, wrinkled perianal skin are critical for the diagnosis.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Squamous cell hyperplasia**: This condition can cause thickening of the skin, but it doesn't typically present with the specific constellation of symptoms and findings described.
- **B) Lichen sclerosus**: This is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can affect the vulva, leading to itching, thinning of the skin, and the formation of white patches. It matches the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings closely.
- **C) Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva**: While this is a serious condition, it typically presents with a mass or ulceration rather than the diffuse changes described.
- **D) Lichen planus**: This can affect the mucous membranes and skin, causing lesions and itching, but it doesn't typically cause the specific vulvar changes described.
- **E) Atrophic vaginitis**: This condition is related to decreased estrogen levels and can cause vaginal dryness and itching, but it doesn't account for the specific vulvar changes observed.

""","Let's think step by step. The patient is a 38-year-old man who was brought to the emergency room by his father due to altered mental status. The patient was unable to get out of bed and became increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed that the patient's apartment was very cold because all of the windows were left open overnight. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and he takes medication for these conditions. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug.

The patient's vital signs show a low rectal temperature of 32°C (89.6°F), bradycardia with a pulse of 54/min, decreased respirations at 8/min, and normal blood pressure. The physical examination reveals weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes, and the pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing.

Given the patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, hypothermia, bradycardia, and dilated pupils, it is likely that he is experiencing a side effect of a medication. The patient's attempt to remove his clothing may indicate a disrobing behavior, which is sometimes associated with certain medications.

Among the options provided, the most likely cause of these findings is a medication that can cause hypothermia, bradycardia, and altered mental status. The medication that fits this profile is an antipsychotic medication, specifically Fluphenazine.

Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic medication that can cause hypothermia, bradycardia, and altered mental status as side effects. It is also known to cause disrobing behavior in some patients.

976,"A 28-year-old man reports to his physician that he is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife ever since they relocated to a new city. He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace. When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men. The man’s actions are most consistent with which of the following psychological defense mechanisms?
Options
A) Displacement
B) Dissociation
C) Projection
D) Reaction formation
E) Repression","To answer this question, let's break down the scenario and the psychological defense mechanisms provided as options.

The 28-year-old man is experiencing feelings of incompatibility with his wife and is noticing himself flirting with other women. Instead of acknowledging his own feelings and actions, he accuses his wife of flirting with another man and questions her fidelity. This behavior indicates that he is attributing his own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else.

Let's examine the options:

A) Displacement: This defense mechanism involves redirecting emotional feelings about one thing to another, less threatening thing. While the man is redirecting his feelings, it's not exactly about displacing emotions from one target to another less threatening one; it's more about attributing his own feelings to someone else.

B) Dissociation: This involves separating one's thoughts or feelings from the rest of one's psyche. The man's actions don't indicate a separation of his thoughts or feelings from his consciousness; rather, he's actively engaging with his feelings by accusing his wife.

C) Projection: This defense mechanism involves attributing unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives to another. The man's behavior fits this description well, as he's accusing his wife of having feelings or intentions that actually align with his own unacknowledged feelings.

D) Reaction formation: This involves expressing an opposite feeling to the one you truly have to hide your true feelings. While the man is expressing jealousy, which could be seen as an opposite feeling to his own desires, his primary action is attributing his feelings to his wife, not expressing an opposite feeling to hide his true ones.

E) Repression: This involves pushing uncomfortable thoughts or memories into the unconscious mind. The man's actions don't indicate repression; he's actively engaging with his feelings by expressing them, albeit in a distorted manner.

Given the above analysis, the man's actions are most consistent with attributing his own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else, which is characteristic of projection.

D) Low dose dexamethasone suppression test
E) Inferior petrosal sinus sampling","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 25-year-old woman has a four-month history of fatigue, weakness, and oligomenorrhea, along with physical examination findings of abdominal striae and obesity. Laboratory results show hyperglycemia, mild hypokalemia, and elevated serum cortisol levels that do not decrease with a high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial. Additionally, the low ACTH level suggests that the cortisol production is ACTH-independent. These findings are highly suggestive of Cushing's syndrome due to an adrenal cause, such as an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.

Given the evidence of ACTH-independent cortisol production, the best next step in management is to directly visualize the adrenal glands to identify any potential masses or abnormalities. Therefore, the best next step is to perform an MRI of the adrenal glands.

She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?
Options
A) Elevated serum homocysteine
B) Thrombin inhibitor deficiency
C) Deficiency in protein C
D) Auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids
E) Resistance to clotting factor degradation","The patient presents with a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), with a thrombus in the left popliteal vein on the current presentation and a similar episode in the right femoral vein one year ago. This pattern of recurrent DVT at a relatively young age suggests an underlying inherited condition that predisposes her to thrombosis.

The genetic workup is crucial in identifying the specific pathophysiology. Among the options provided:

A) Elevated serum homocysteine is associated with homocystinuria, a condition that increases the risk of thrombosis. However, this is not the most common inherited condition leading to recurrent DVT.

B) Thrombin inhibitor deficiency could refer to conditions such as antithrombin deficiency, but this is not the most common inherited cause of recurrent DVT.

C) Deficiency in protein C is a known inherited condition that increases the risk of thrombosis. Protein C is an anticoagulant protein that helps regulate the coagulation cascade. A deficiency in protein C can lead to an increased risk of developing DVT.

D) Auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause thrombosis. However, this is an acquired condition rather than an inherited one.

E) Resistance to clotting factor degradation is associated with factor V Leiden, a common inherited condition that increases the risk of thrombosis. Factor V Leiden is a mutation in the factor V gene that makes it resistant to degradation by activated protein C, leading to an increased risk of developing DVT.

Given the patient's presentation and the genetic workup, the most likely pathophysiology is resistance to clotting factor degradation, which is associated with factor V Leiden.

267,"A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough. He reports having shortness of breath over the last 6 months, but he has felt worse since he contracted a cold that has been traveling around his office. Today, he reports body aches, headache, and fever along with this chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for prediabetes, which he controls with exercise and diet. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?
Options
A) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
B) Primary respiratory acidosis
C) Primary respiratory alkalosis
D) Compensatory respiratory acidosis
E) Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 60-year-old man has a history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough, shortness of breath over the last 6 months, and a recent exacerbation of symptoms after contracting a cold. His past medical history of prediabetes, 30-pack-year smoking history, and physical examination findings of diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips are indicative of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The chest X-ray showing a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation further supports this diagnosis. Pulmonary function testing revealing an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% is also consistent with COPD, as it indicates airway obstruction.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and diagnosis of COPD, the arterial blood gases (ABG) are most likely to reveal a primary respiratory acidosis. This is because COPD patients often have impaired gas exchange and hypoventilation, leading to an accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood. This results in a decrease in pH, indicating acidosis. The body may attempt to compensate for this acidosis by increasing bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels, but in the case of primary respiratory acidosis, the acid-base disturbance is primarily driven by the respiratory system's inability to adequately expel CO2.

C) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
D) Goodpasture syndrome
E) Menetrier disease","The patient's presentation of abdominal pain and constipation, along with a history of poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and a significant smoking history, points towards a possible gastrointestinal issue. The patient's colonoscopy results from 1 year ago revealed multiple small, pedunculated polyps and multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, which are indicative of diverticulosis. Diverticulosis is a condition characterized by the formation of diverticula, which are small, bulging pouches in the wall of the colon. The patient's symptoms of steady right lower quadrant pain and constipation are consistent with diverticulitis, which is an inflammation of the diverticula.

Among the options provided, diverticulitis is most strongly associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized by fragile skin, joints, and blood vessels, and individuals with this condition are at increased risk of developing diverticulitis due to the weakened connective tissue in the colon wall.

Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?
Options
A) Immediate cardiac transplant
B) Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated
C) Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets
D) Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space
E) Surgical adhesive glue","The patient is a 25-year-old male who presents with a penetrating wound to the chest, specifically between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side. The patient is hemodynamically unstable with a low blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, a high pulse of 115/min, and a low oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall, which indicates a serious cardiac injury.

Given the severity of the injury and the patient's unstable condition, immediate surgical intervention is necessary to repair the cardiac injury. The best definitive surgical approach would be to use interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets to repair the right ventricular free wall. This technique is commonly used in cardiac surgery to repair defects in the ventricular wall and is suitable for this type of injury.

The use of interrupted sutures allows for precise closure of the wound, while the supporting pledgets provide additional strength to the repair. This approach is more effective than other options, such as watchful waiting or the use of surgical adhesive glue, which may not provide adequate closure of the wound.

The other options are not suitable for this patient's condition. Immediate cardiac transplant is not a viable option in this acute setting, and needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space is not indicated for a cardiac injury.

E) Decreased A-a gradient","Considering the 76-year-old woman's age, it is expected that she will experience changes in respiratory function compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman. With aging, there are several changes in the respiratory system, including a decrease in lung elasticity, an increase in chest wall stiffness, and a decrease in the strength of respiratory muscles. These changes lead to a decrease in lung volumes, particularly vital capacity and forced expiratory volume. However, one change that is commonly seen with aging is an increase in residual volume, which is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. This is due to the loss of lung elasticity and the inability of the lungs to deflate completely. Therefore, the correct answer is not C) Decreased residual volume, but rather the opposite, which is not listed. However, among the options provided, the most likely change in respiratory function that is present in this patient is not listed, but we can eliminate options based on the expected changes with aging. Option A) Increased lung compliance is incorrect because lung compliance decreases with age. Option B) Increased vital capacity is incorrect because vital capacity decreases with age. Option D) Increased chest wall compliance is incorrect because chest wall compliance decreases with age. Option E) Decreased A-a gradient is incorrect because the A-a gradient increases with age due to the decreased efficiency of gas exchange.

565,"A 35-year-old man visits your office for his annual health checkup. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram. He comments that his symptoms have improved since initiating the prescribed therapy; however, in the past 2 months, he has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to weak tumescence and low libido. His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?
Options
A) Lowering citalopram dose
B) Addition of bupropion
C) Switch to fluoxetine
D) Addition of sildenafil
E) Switch to selegiline","The patient has been experiencing symptoms of sexual dysfunction, including weak tumescence and low libido, which have developed since starting citalopram for generalized anxiety disorder. This is a common side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. The appropriate management of this patient would involve addressing the sexual dysfunction while also considering the effectiveness of the current treatment for his anxiety disorder.

Lowering the dose of citalopram (option A) may help alleviate the sexual side effects but could also compromise the effectiveness of the treatment for his anxiety. Switching to fluoxetine (option C) is unlikely to resolve the issue, as fluoxetine is also an SSRI and may cause similar side effects. Switching to selegiline (option E) is not a suitable option, as selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and may have different side effects and interactions.

Adding bupropion (option B) is a suitable option, as bupropion is an antidepressant that can help alleviate sexual dysfunction caused by SSRIs. Bupropion has a different mechanism of action and is less likely to cause sexual side effects. Adding sildenafil (option D) may help with erectile dysfunction but does not address the underlying issue of low libido.

Therefore, the most appropriate step in the management of this patient is to add bupropion to his current treatment regimen.

Options
A) Strong HLA class II gene makeup
B) Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition
C) Pancreatic islet cell leukocyte infiltration
D) Auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens
E) Unrelated to his abdominal obesity","Let's break down the patient's presentation and the options provided.

The patient is a 63-year-old man who has experienced a slow and steady weight gain of 6 pounds over the past 6 months, despite attempts to control his diet and increase his level of exercise. His medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. On exam, his vital signs are stable, but he is obese (BMI 32), and his waist circumference is 43 inches. His physician is concerned about an abnormal fasting blood glucose and dyslipidemia. On further work-up with an oral glucose tolerance test, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes.

Given the patient's age, obesity, and lack of symptoms suggestive of an autoimmune process, the most likely form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is strongly associated with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, which are often linked to obesity, particularly central obesity.

Among the options provided, the association that is most consistent with T2DM is pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition. This is because T2DM is characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the pancreatic islets, which contributes to the progressive decline in beta-cell function and insulin secretion.

483,"Patients with the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia make a specific type of hemoglobin known as HgbS. This mutation results in the sickling of their red blood cells when exposed to inciting factors such as hypoxic conditions. Patients are often treated with hydroxyurea, which has which of the following direct effects on their hemoglobin physiology?
Options
A) Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
B) Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)
D) Decreases levels of HgbS
E) Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)","Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used to manage sickle cell anemia. It works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF), which is a type of hemoglobin that is less prone to sickling than the abnormal hemoglobin (HgbS) produced by patients with sickle cell anemia. By increasing the levels of HgbF, hydroxyurea helps to reduce the frequency and severity of sickle cell crises.

Hydroxyurea does not directly affect the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin, nor does it decrease the levels of HgbS or HgbF. Instead, it promotes the production of HgbF, which is a beneficial effect in patients with sickle cell anemia.

441,"A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of persistent bleeding from his nose over the past hour. The bleeding started spontaneously. He has no history of a similar episode. He takes no medications. There is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family. His vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, he is pressing a gauze against his left nostril while hyperextending his head. The gauze is stained with blood and upon withdrawal of the gauze blood slowly drips out of his left nostrils. There is no bleeding from the right nostril. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy?
Options
A) Anterior packing and topical antibiotics
B) Oxymetazoline nasal spray
C) Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril
D) Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel and surrounding vessels
E) Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated","To approach this question, let's analyze the scenario presented. A 12-year-old boy is experiencing persistent bleeding from his nose that started spontaneously, and he has no history of similar episodes or abnormal bleeding in the family. His vital signs are within normal limits, and the physical examination shows no abnormalities other than the nasal bleeding.

The management of epistaxis (nosebleed) depends on the severity and the source of the bleeding. Given that the bleeding is confined to one nostril and is not severe enough to cause hemodynamic instability, initial management should focus on controlling the bleeding with minimal intervention.

Option E, squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated, is often the first line of treatment for anterior epistaxis, which is the most common type of nosebleed. This method is non-invasive and can effectively control bleeding in many cases by compressing the nasal septum and reducing blood flow to the area.

While options A, B, C, and D represent potential treatments for epistaxis, they are typically considered if initial measures like manual compression fail to control the bleeding or if the bleeding is more severe.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient is manual compression of the nostrils.

He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months. Synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3. What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient’s most likely condition?
Options
A) Metabolic inhibitor
B) Cell wall inhibitor
C) Neutrophil migration inhibitor
D) Prostaglandin inhibitor
E) Uric acid synthesis inhibitor","The patient is a 23-year-old man presenting with swelling of the left knee, which he noticed a day ago while preparing for a college basketball game. He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months, which increases his risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3, indicating a significant inflammatory response. Given the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely condition is septic arthritis, which is often caused by bacterial infections such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, especially in sexually active young adults.

The mechanism of action of the drug indicated for the treatment of septic arthritis, particularly when caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, involves inhibiting the bacterial cell wall synthesis. This is typically achieved through the use of antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, which is a cephalosporin antibiotic that works by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, resulting in the disruption of the bacterial cell wall synthesis and ultimately leading to the death of the bacterial cells.

Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug indicated for the treatment of this patient's most likely condition is a cell wall inhibitor.

859,"A 27-year-old female presents to her physician with a palpable thyroid nodule. Iodine uptake testing shows that the nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared with the rest of the thyroid gland. A fine-needle aspiration is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a neoplasm of the thyroid. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?
Options
A) Papillary carcinoma
B) Medullary carcinoma
C) Follicular carcinoma
D) Anaplastic carcinoma
E) Hurthle cell carcinoma","To approach this question, let's consider the key pieces of information provided:

1. **Palpable thyroid nodule**: This indicates a physical abnormality in the thyroid gland that can be felt during a physical examination.
2. **Decreased iodine uptake**: Iodine uptake tests measure how much iodine the thyroid gland takes up. A nodule with decreased iodine uptake compared to the rest of the thyroid gland suggests that the nodule is not functioning normally, which can be indicative of a neoplasm.
3. **Fine-needle aspiration showing a neoplasm**: This is a diagnostic procedure where a small sample of cells is taken from the nodule for examination. The result indicating a neoplasm means that the cells are abnormal and could be cancerous.

Given these points, we need to consider the types of thyroid cancers and their characteristics:

- **Papillary carcinoma (A)**: This is the most common type of thyroid cancer, but it usually has a normal or slightly decreased iodine uptake.
- **Medullary carcinoma (B)**: This type originates from the parafollicular cells (also known as C cells) and does not take up iodine. However, it's less common and often associated with genetic syndromes.
- **Follicular carcinoma (C)**: This type of cancer often presents with decreased iodine uptake because it does not function normally. It's the second most common type of thyroid cancer.
- **Anaplastic carcinoma (D)**: This is a very aggressive and rare form of thyroid cancer. While it might have decreased iodine uptake, it's typically associated with a much more rapid growth and more severe symptoms.
- **Hurthle cell carcinoma (E)**: This is a variant of follicular carcinoma but is less common. It also might have decreased iodine uptake.

Considering the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is **Follicular carcinoma (C)**, as it is a type of thyroid neoplasm that often presents with decreased iodine uptake and is consistent with the fine-needle aspiration findings.

His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 87/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. He is diagnosed with acute appendicitis and is taken to the operating room for an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. The appendix is gangrenous and perforated with purulent fluid in the pelvis. Just after the appendiceal base is ligated, the patient shows muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 146/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The end-tidal CO2 is 85 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?
Options
A) Propranolol
B) Dantrolene
C) Bromocriptine
D) Cyproheptadine
E) Surgical embolectomy","The patient is a 15-year-old boy who underwent an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy due to acute appendicitis. During the surgery, shortly after the appendiceal base was ligated, the patient developed muscle rigidity, profuse diaphoresis, a high fever of 39.1°C (102.4°F), an elevated pulse of 130/min, and elevated blood pressure of 146/70 mm Hg. The end-tidal CO2 was significantly elevated at 85 mm Hg. These symptoms, particularly the muscle rigidity, high fever, and elevated end-tidal CO2, are indicative of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening medical emergency that can occur during general anesthesia.

Malignant hyperthermia is typically triggered by volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. The treatment of choice for malignant hyperthermia is immediate discontinuation of the triggering agent and administration of dantrolene, a muscle relaxant that helps to reduce muscle rigidity and hypermetabolism.

Considering the options provided, the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is dantrolene. Dantrolene works by inhibiting calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus reducing muscle rigidity and heat production.

D) Verrucous carcinoma
E) Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)","The patient's symptoms of postcoital vaginal bleeding and intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge, along with the presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina, raise suspicion for a malignant tumor. The patient's history of being exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero is a significant risk factor for clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. DES is a synthetic estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage and other pregnancy complications. However, it was later found to be associated with an increased risk of clear cell adenocarcinoma in female offspring. The patient's age and lack of family history of malignancies or inherited disorders also support this diagnosis.

C) Levofloxacin
D) Cephalexin
E) No treatment is necessary","Analyzing the situation, the 78-year-old woman presents with difficulty locating objects, and her medical history is significant for Alzheimer’s dementia, among other conditions. The presence of leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and WBCs in the urinalysis suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI). Given her age and medical history, it is essential to treat the UTI to prevent further complications.

Considering the options provided, Nitrofurantoin is commonly used to treat uncomplicated UTIs, especially in elderly patients. However, it is essential to note that Nitrofurantoin is not suitable for patients with severe renal impairment or those who are unable to take the medication as directed. TMP-SMX is another option, but it may not be the best choice due to the potential risk of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal impairment. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but it may not be necessary for an uncomplicated UTI. Cephalexin is also an option, but it may not be the best choice due to the potential risk of Clostridioides difficile infection.

In this case, considering the patient's age, medical history, and the presence of Enterobacter in the urine culture, Nitrofurantoin may not be the best option. Enterobacter can be resistant to Nitrofurantoin. TMP-SMX or Levofloxacin may be more suitable options. However, considering the potential risks associated with TMP-SMX and the broad-spectrum activity of Levofloxacin, the most appropriate next step would be to choose Levofloxacin, but with caution and careful monitoring of the patient's renal function and potential side effects.

The child’s corneas appear irritated and erythematous. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?
Options
A) Nucleotide excision repair
B) Non-homologous end joining
C) Homologous recombination
D) Mismatch repair
E) Base excision repair","The 7-month-old male infant's symptoms of severe sunburns despite sunscreen application, along with reddened skin primarily in sun-exposed areas and irritated corneas, suggest a condition that affects the body's ability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. The most likely condition is Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP), a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV light. XP is caused by mutations in genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), a process that repairs DNA damage caused by UV light. The impaired NER pathway in XP patients leads to the accumulation of DNA damage, resulting in severe sunburns, skin discoloration, and an increased risk of skin cancers. Therefore, the process likely impaired in this patient is nucleotide excision repair.

The patient is a 3-day-old boy presenting with somnolence, poor feeding, and vomiting. His serum glucose concentration is within normal limits, but he has a significantly elevated serum ammonia concentration, which is a critical finding. The presence of hyperammonemia in a newborn is a medical emergency and suggests a disorder of the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing excess ammonia from the body.

The urinalysis showing an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio is also a key finding. Orotic acid is a precursor in the synthesis of pyrimidines, and its elevation in the urine can indicate a block in the urea cycle, specifically at the level of the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline.

Given this information, let's examine the options:

A) Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline - This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), which is part of the urea cycle. A deficiency in OTC would lead to the accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is then shunted into the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, resulting in the increased production of orotic acid.

B) Orotic acid to uridine monophosphate - This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, which is involved in pyrimidine synthesis. While a deficiency in this enzyme could lead to orotic aciduria, it does not directly explain the hyperammonemia.

C) Pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A - This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is involved in the metabolism of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. A deficiency in this enzyme would not directly explain the findings of hyperammonemia and orotic aciduria.

D) Glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A to N-acetylglutamate - This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme N-acetylglutamate synthase, which is involved in the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, a key activator of the urea cycle. However, a deficiency in this enzyme would not directly explain the specific findings of orotic aciduria.

E) Arginine to urea and ornithine - This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme arginase, which is involved in the final step of the urea cycle. A deficiency in arginase would lead to hyperargininemia, but not the specific findings of orotic aciduria and hyperammonemia described in this case.

Based on the analysis, the most likely enzyme deficiency is ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), which catalyzes the reaction of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline.

390,"A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?
Options
A) Anterior cord lesion
B) Posterior cord lesion
C) Right cord hemisection
D) Left cord hemisection
E) Complete cord transection","To determine the type of spinal cord lesion that would result in the described syndrome, let's analyze the patient's symptoms:

1. **Weakness in the left leg**: This indicates a motor deficit affecting the left lower extremity, which could be due to damage to the motor pathways (lateral corticospinal tract) on the left side of the spinal cord.

2. **Deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity**: These sensations are carried by the posterior columns (fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus) of the spinal cord. A deficit in these sensations on the left side suggests damage to the posterior columns on the left.

3. **Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity**: These sensations are carried by the spinothalamic tract, which crosses over at the level of entry into the spinal cord. Therefore, a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side indicates damage to the spinothalamic tract on the left side of the spinal cord.

Considering these findings:

- **Anterior cord lesion (A)** would primarily affect the motor pathways and the spinothalamic tracts, leading to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion, which does not match the patient's presentation.

- **Posterior cord lesion (B)** would affect the posterior columns, leading to a loss of vibration sense, light touch, and proprioception below the level of the lesion, but this would be bilateral, not unilateral as in the patient's case.

- **Right cord hemisection (C)** would result in a loss of motor function, vibration sense, and light touch on the right side, and a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side, which is the opposite of the patient's symptoms.

- **Left cord hemisection (D)** would result in a loss of motor function, vibration sense, and light touch on the left side, and a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side, matching the patient's symptoms.

- **Complete cord transection (E)** would result in a complete loss of all sensory and motor functions below the level of the lesion, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

498,"A 29-year-old woman presents to the physician with a blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days. She has pain around her right eye during eye movement. She takes no medications. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?
Options
A) Dry eyes
B) High-risk sexual behaviour
C) Oral ulcers
D) Sensory loss
E) Late preterm birth","Analyzing the patient's symptoms, the 29-year-old woman presents with blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days, pain around her right eye during eye movement, and specific findings on physical examination that indicate a potential issue with the optic nerve. The presence of optic disk swelling in the right eye and decreased perception in the color vision test are particularly concerning for optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is often associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Given this potential association, specific additional history should be obtained regarding symptoms that could be indicative of MS or other autoimmune conditions.

Among the provided options, oral ulcers (option C) are a common symptom of several autoimmune conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Behçet's disease, but are not as directly related to the primary symptoms as other options might be. However, the most relevant history to obtain in this context, considering the potential for an underlying condition like MS, would be related to other neurological symptoms or signs that could suggest demyelinating disease.

However, the options provided do not directly mention a history of neurological symptoms or signs suggestive of demyelinating diseases like MS. Among the options given, the one that might be most indirectly related to autoimmune conditions or could hint at a broader autoimmune issue is oral ulcers, but this is a bit of a stretch given the direct implications of the patient's symptoms.

Given the direct implications of the symptoms and the provided options, a better fit for the specific additional history to be obtained, considering a common and relevant condition, would ideally relate to sensory loss or other neurological deficits that could be indicative of conditions like MS. However, since ""sensory loss"" (option D) is the closest in relevance to neurological conditions that might present with optic neuritis, it would be the most appropriate choice from the given options, despite not being a perfect fit.

34,"An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss during this time. Physical examination shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. An endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus. Biopsy shows parietal cell atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?
Options
A) Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor
B) Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells
C) Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue
D) Excessive somatostatin secretion
E) Ectopic secretion of gastrin","To determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, let's consider the information provided. The patient is experiencing upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss, which have been ongoing for 6 months. The physical examination reveals bilateral pitting pedal edema, and the endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus, along with parietal cell atrophy on biopsy.

The presence of parietal cell atrophy is a key finding, as it suggests a decrease in gastric acid production. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and weight loss, which can be caused by malabsorption of nutrients due to inadequate gastric acid.

Considering the options provided:

A) Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor - This would more likely cause increased gastric acid production, not decreased.

B) Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells - While this could potentially cause some of the patient's symptoms, it is not directly related to parietal cell atrophy.

C) Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue - This could potentially cause some of the patient's symptoms, but it is not directly related to parietal cell atrophy.

D) Excessive somatostatin secretion - Somatostatin is a hormone that inhibits the secretion of other hormones, including gastrin, which stimulates gastric acid production. Excessive somatostatin secretion could lead to decreased gastric acid production, consistent with the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.

E) Ectopic secretion of gastrin - This would more likely cause increased gastric acid production, not decreased.

Based on the information provided, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is excessive somatostatin secretion, which is inhibiting gastrin secretion and leading to decreased gastric acid production.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options
A) Agree to his wish for no further treatment
B) Begin paroxetine therapy
C) Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents
D) Reassure the patient that he will feel better
E) Start outpatient psychotherapy","The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has been experiencing symptoms of depression, including loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He has also been avoiding social interactions and has expressed feelings of loneliness. The mental status examination reveals a constricted affect and intact cognition, but he expresses suicidal ideation, stating that he would be better off dead and wants to use his father's licensed firearm to end his life. This is a critical situation that requires immediate attention and intervention.

Given the patient's suicidal ideation and access to a firearm, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure his safety and prevent harm to himself. This can be achieved through involuntary hospitalization, which would provide a safe and supportive environment for the patient to receive treatment and counseling. Informing the parents about the situation is also crucial, as they need to be aware of their son's condition and the necessary steps being taken to ensure his safety.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to proceed with involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents.

452,"A 63-year-old man is aiming to improve his health by eating a well balanced diet, walking daily, and quitting smoking following a 45-year smoking history. While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?
Options
A) Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor
B) Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor
C) Thromboxane synthase inhibitor
D) Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor
E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor","To address the patient's symptoms of intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease, cilostazol is prescribed. Cilostazol is a medication that works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3), an enzyme involved in the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets and the vascular endothelium. By inhibiting PDE3, cilostazol increases the levels of cAMP, leading to several beneficial effects, including:

1. Inhibition of platelet aggregation: This reduces the formation of blood clots that can worsen peripheral artery disease.
2. Vasodilation: The increased cAMP levels cause relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow to the affected areas.
3. Anti-inflammatory effects: Cilostazol has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce inflammation in the affected blood vessels.

Overall, the mechanism of action of cilostazol involves the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 3, leading to increased cAMP levels, which in turn cause vasodilation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and anti-inflammatory effects.

""","To approach this patient's condition, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with fever, generalized fatigue, chills, dull right-side abdominal pain, and nausea. These symptoms have been ongoing for 1 week.

2. **Medical History**: She has type 1 diabetes mellitus and is on insulin and an oral contraceptive.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient appears ill, with a high temperature (40°C or 104°F), tachycardia (118/min), and a palpable, tender liver 2–3 cm below the right costal margin. There are also decreased breath sounds over the right lung base.

4. **Laboratory Studies**: Key findings include leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) with a predominance of segmented neutrophils, mildly elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), and elevated alkaline phosphatase.

5. **Imaging**: A right upper quadrant ultrasound is mentioned, but the findings are not described. However, given the clinical context, it's reasonable to infer that the ultrasound might show evidence of a liver abscess or another form of liver pathology.

Given these details, the patient's presentation is most consistent with a liver abscess, which is a collection of pus in the liver tissue. Liver abscesses can be caused by bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infections. The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings (such as leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes), and the presence of a palpable, tender liver all support this diagnosis.

**Management of a Liver Abscess**:
- The management of a liver abscess typically involves drainage of the abscess, either percutaneously (through the skin) under imaging guidance or surgically, depending on the size, location, and number of abscesses, as well as the patient's overall condition.
- Antibiotics are also a crucial part of treatment to cover for the underlying infection.

Considering the options provided:
- **A)** Discontinuing the oral contraceptive might be considered due to the potential risk of thromboembolic events, but it is not the most immediate step in managing the liver abscess.
- **B)** A hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan could be useful in evaluating the biliary system but is not the next best step in managing a liver abscess.
- **C)** Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) might be considered if there is suspicion of a biliary source for the abscess, but it is not the initial step in management.
- **D)** Administering metronidazole might be part of the antibiotic regimen, but the question asks for the most appropriate next step, which involves addressing the abscess directly.
- **E)** Performing percutaneous drainage is the most appropriate next step in managing a liver abscess, as it allows for direct drainage of the abscess and can be done under imaging guidance.

350,"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?
Options
A) Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle
B) This patient has insulin resistance
C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient
D) The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
E) The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction","Let's think step by step. The patient is a 16-year-old girl who has not had her period for 6 months. She has a history of restricting her diet and exercising intensively, resulting in significant weight loss. Her physical examination reveals good muscle development but decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits, which is indicative of osteopenia or osteoporosis.

Considering her symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of her amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) is related to her significant weight loss and decreased body fat. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in the production of estrogen, and a decrease in body fat can lead to decreased estrogen levels. Estrogen is essential for the regulation of the menstrual cycle, and low levels can disrupt ovulation and menstruation.

Among the options provided, the statement that decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia (low estrogen levels) in this patient is correct. This is because adipose tissue is involved in the production of estrogen, and a decrease in body fat can lead to decreased estrogen levels, which can disrupt the menstrual cycle.

873,"An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department trauma bay with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The patient undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, during which, it is discovered that his splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. The surgeon ligates the splenic artery at its origin. Which of the following arteries will now be hypoperfused as a result?
Options
A) Left gastric artery
B) Gastroduodenal artery
C) Right gastroepiploic artery
D) Left gastroepiploic artery
E) Common hepatic artery","To answer this question, we need to understand the anatomy of the arterial supply to the abdominal organs. The celiac trunk is a major artery that arises from the abdominal aorta and gives off three main branches: the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery, and the splenic artery.

The splenic artery, which was damaged and ligated in this patient, primarily supplies blood to the spleen. However, it also gives off branches that supply the pancreas and the stomach. One of the branches of the splenic artery is the left gastroepiploic artery, which runs along the greater curvature of the stomach and supplies blood to the stomach.

Since the splenic artery was ligated at its origin, the blood flow to the spleen, pancreas, and stomach (via the left gastroepiploic artery) will be compromised. Therefore, the artery that will now be hypoperfused as a result is the left gastroepiploic artery.

300,"A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?
Options
A) 64
B) 16
C) 8
D) 4
E) 32","To determine the factor by which resistance to blood flow has increased in the left circumflex artery, we can use the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which relates the resistance of a tube to its radius. The equation is R = 8ηL/πr^4, where R is the resistance, η is the viscosity of the fluid, L is the length of the tube, and r is the radius of the tube.

Given that the diameter of the left circumflex artery has been reduced by 50%, the radius has also been reduced by 50%. Since the radius is reduced by half, the new radius is r/2.

We can calculate the new resistance (R_new) relative to the original resistance (R_original) by substituting the new radius into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:

R_new = 8ηL/π(r/2)^4
R_new = 8ηL/π(r^4/16)
R_new = 16 * 8ηL/πr^4
R_new = 16 * R_original

Therefore, the resistance to blood flow in the left circumflex artery has increased by a factor of 16 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.

449,"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 
Options
A) Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound
B) Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months
C) Elective endovascular repair
D) Elective open surgical repair
E) Emergency open surgical repair","To determine the best course of treatment for this patient, let's analyze the information provided.

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and a significant smoking history, which are all risk factors for the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He presents with abdominal pain and bruising on his feet, which are symptoms that can be associated with an AAA, especially if it is expanding or leaking. However, the key piece of information is the size of the AAA, which is 4.1 cm in diameter, as revealed by the contrast CT scan.

The management of AAA is generally based on the size of the aneurysm. For small AAAs (less than 4 cm in diameter), the risk of rupture is low, and the standard approach is clinical surveillance with regular ultrasound monitoring. For larger AAAs (greater than 5.5 cm in diameter), the risk of rupture is higher, and surgical repair is usually recommended. For AAAs between 4 and 5.5 cm in diameter, the decision to repair is often based on the individual patient's risk factors and the rate of aneurysm growth.

Given that this patient's AAA is 4.1 cm in diameter, which falls into the small to moderate size category, the best course of treatment would be clinical surveillance with regular ultrasound monitoring. However, the frequency of ultrasound monitoring can vary based on the size of the aneurysm and the patient's risk factors.

Considering the options provided, the best answer would be to discharge the patient with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months. This approach balances the need for monitoring the aneurysm's size and growth with the risks and benefits of more frequent or less frequent monitoring.

93,"Six days after undergoing surgical repair of a hip fracture, a previously healthy 79-year-old woman is agitated and confused. She is unarousable during the day, but then is awake and impulsive during the night, requiring frequent reorientation. Her husband says that she usually drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?
Options
A) Dementia
B) Alcohol withdrawal
C) Opioid intoxication
D) Delirium
E) Urinary tract infection","To determine the cause of the 79-year-old woman's agitation, confusion, and altered mental status, let's consider the key points from her history and physical examination. She underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture six days ago, which is a significant stressor that can precipitate delirium, especially in elderly patients. Her symptoms include being unarousable during the day but awake and impulsive at night, requiring frequent reorientation, which indicates a disturbance in her sleep-wake cycle and fluctuating levels of consciousness. These are hallmarks of delirium.

The patient's husband reports that she usually drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly, which makes alcohol withdrawal less likely given the low quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. Her current medication is oxycodone for pain, but opioid intoxication would typically present with sedation rather than agitation and confusion.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, which makes an acute infection or other medical emergency less likely. The urine dipstick is normal, which decreases the likelihood of a urinary tract infection as the cause of her symptoms. The neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits, further supporting the diagnosis of delirium.

Considering these points, the most likely cause of her current condition is delirium, which is a common complication in elderly patients after surgery, especially those with hip fractures. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of fluctuating consciousness, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness.

Options
A) Synovial fluid analysis
B) Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody
C) Rheumatoid factor
D) CT scan
E) X-ray of cervical spine","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation:

1. **Recurrent wrist and neck pain**: The patient reports experiencing pain in her wrists and neck for the last 2 months, with stiffness in her fingers that improves as the day progresses. This pattern of morning stiffness improving with activity is characteristic of inflammatory arthritis.

2. **Absence of trauma or inciting events**: The patient denies any recent trauma or events that could trigger her symptoms, suggesting a non-traumatic cause.

3. **Family history of fibromyalgia**: While fibromyalgia is in her family history, the patient's symptoms of joint erythema and tenderness, along with morning stiffness, are more suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis rather than fibromyalgia, which is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain without specific joint inflammation.

4. **Physical examination findings**: The presence of erythematous and tender metacarpophalangeal joints is indicative of an inflammatory process affecting these joints.

Considering these points, the most helpful diagnostic tool would be one that can identify specific antibodies associated with inflammatory arthritis. Among the options provided:

- **A) Synovial fluid analysis** can provide information on the nature of the joint inflammation but is more invasive and may not directly point to a specific diagnosis without further analysis.

- **B) Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody** is highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory arthritis that commonly affects the metacarpophalangeal joints and is characterized by morning stiffness and joint inflammation.

- **C) Rheumatoid factor** can also be present in RA but is less specific than anti-CCP antibodies.

- **D) CT scan** and **E) X-ray of cervical spine** might be useful in evaluating the extent of joint damage or other structural issues but are not as directly helpful in diagnosing the underlying condition as identifying specific antibodies.

Therefore, the most helpful diagnostic tool for this patient's condition would be the identification of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, which is highly suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis.

Total serum bilirubin: 1.0 mg/dL
Serum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL

Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria and fatty casts. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
B) Membranous nephropathy
C) Minimal change disease
D) Amyloidosis
E) Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis","Let's break down the information provided to determine the most likely diagnosis.

The patient is a 25-year-old female with Hodgkin's lymphoma, presenting with a several-day history of edema. Edema can be caused by various conditions, but in the context of lymphoma, it's essential to consider nephrotic syndrome as a potential cause.

Lab studies show:

- Normal serum sodium (140 mmol/L) and potassium (3.5 mmol/L) levels.
- Low serum albumin (1.9 g/dL), which is a key indicator of nephrotic syndrome. Albumin is a protein that helps keep fluid in your bloodstream so that it doesn’t leak into other tissues. Low albumin levels can lead to edema.
- Normal total serum bilirubin (1.0 mg/dL), indicating no significant liver dysfunction.
- Slightly elevated serum creatinine (1.2 mg/dL), which may suggest some renal impairment but is not significantly elevated.

Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria, indicating a significant loss of protein in the urine, and fatty casts, which are also characteristic of nephrotic syndrome.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that causes nephrotic syndrome. Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children but can also occur in adults, especially in the context of lymphoma. MCD is characterized by the loss of foot processes of podocytes as seen on electron microscopy, but it typically presents with normal light microscopy findings, hence the name ""minimal change.""

Other options like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis can also cause nephrotic syndrome but are less likely in this context. Amyloidosis is another possibility but would typically require more specific diagnostic tests to confirm.

1234,"A 30-year-old Japanese woman is brought to the emergency department after fainting at work. She says she was only unconscious for a moment and recovered quickly. She reports increasing fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and her temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, the patient is fully conscious. Her radial pulse is absent at her right wrist and 1+ at her left wrist. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL
Hematocrit: 34.7%
Leukocyte count: 5,500/mm3
Neutrophils: 65%
Lymphocytes: 30%
Monocytes: 5%
Mean corpuscular volume: 78.2 μm3
Platelet count: 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 56 mm/h
What complications is this patient at risk for?
Options
A) Amaurosis fugax
B) Myocardial infarction
C) Tongue infarction
D) Palpable purpura
E) Polyneuropathy","This patient's presentation, including increasing fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months, along with the absence of a radial pulse at her right wrist and significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggests a systemic condition that affects the blood vessels. The low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels indicate anemia, which could contribute to her fatigue. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Takayasu arteritis, a form of large vessel vasculitis that predominantly affects the aorta and its major branches. It is more common in young women, especially those of Asian descent.

Given the nature of Takayasu arteritis, this patient is at risk for complications related to the narrowing or occlusion of major arteries. Among the options provided, Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular blindness) is a possible complication due to the involvement of the carotid arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the eyes. Myocardial infarction is also a risk due to the potential involvement of the coronary arteries. However, the most directly related option to the symptoms and findings of Takayasu arteritis is Amaurosis fugax.

55,"A 61-year-old man with schizophrenia in a locked inpatient psychiatry unit was observed making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?
Options
A) Akathisia
B) Tardive dyskinesia
C) Acute dystonia
D) Pseudoparkinsonism
E) Palsy","Analyzing the 61-year-old man's symptoms, which include making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively, it is essential to consider his history of schizophrenia and treatment with haloperidol. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. The symptoms described are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia, a condition that can occur in patients taking long-term antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. Tardive dyskinesia is marked by involuntary, repetitive body movements, often affecting the face, lips, and tongue. The key distinguishing factor between tardive dyskinesia and other movement disorders is the prolonged use of antipsychotic medications. Given the patient's history of schizophrenia and treatment with haloperidol, along with the symptoms presented, the most accurate description is tardive dyskinesia.

255,"A 62-year-old man presents to the physician because of incomplete healing of a chest wound. He recently had a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 25 years. Clinical examination shows the presence of wound dehiscence in the lower 3rd of the sternal region. The wound surface shows the presence of dead necrotic tissue with pus. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient?
Options
A) Surgical debridement
B) Negative pressure wound management
C) Sternal dressings
D) Sternal wiring
E) Sternal fixation","Analyzing the situation, the 62-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presents with incomplete healing of a chest wound after a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. The clinical examination reveals wound dehiscence in the lower 3rd of the sternal region, with dead necrotic tissue and pus present. The CT of the thorax shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues, indicating an infection. In this scenario, the most appropriate next step in management would be to address the infection and promote wound healing. Surgical debridement is the process of removing dead, damaged, or infected tissue to improve the healing potential of the remaining healthy tissue. Given the presence of necrotic tissue and pus, surgical debridement is the most appropriate next step to manage the patient's wound and prevent further complications.

387,"A 28-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician with increased menstrual bleeding over the past three months. She also notes easy bruising and bleeding from her gums when brushing her teeth. She is sexually active with multiple partners and has no history of intravenous drug use. Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?
Options
A) Serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity
B) Vitamin B12 and folate levels
C) Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity
D) HIV and HCV testing
E) Bone marrow aspiration","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient presents with increased menstrual bleeding, easy bruising, and bleeding from her gums, which are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The physical exam findings of petechiae and scattered ecchymoses further support this. Laboratory results show a normal hemoglobin level, normal white blood cell count, and a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). The prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are within normal limits, which suggests that the coagulation cascade is intact. The peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities.

Given these findings, the differential diagnosis includes immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease or hemophilia A. However, the patient's normal aPTT and PT make bleeding disorders less likely.

The patient's age, sex, and lack of significant past medical history make ITP a more likely diagnosis. ITP is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of antibodies against platelets, leading to their destruction and thrombocytopenia.

To confirm the diagnosis of ITP, further testing is not necessary. However, to rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia, such as HIV or HCV infection, which can also cause ITP, testing for these infections is warranted.

Therefore, the next diagnostic study that should be performed is HIV and HCV testing.

1242,"An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman is found to have T-score of -2.6 SD on routine bone mineral density screening. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche started at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and PAP smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment is begun with a drug that prevents further bone resorption and reduces her risk of developing breast cancer. This drug puts her at an increased risk of which of the following adverse effects?
Options
A) Mandibular osteonecrosis
B) Skin infections
C) Osteosarcoma
D) Hypercholesterolemia
E) Deep vein thrombosis
""","To answer this question, let's consider the patient's profile and the treatment initiated. The patient is a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman with a T-score of -2.6 SD, indicating osteoporosis. She has a history of hypertension and esophageal stricture, and her mother died of breast cancer at age 45. Given her profile, the treatment likely aims to address both osteoporosis and the risk of breast cancer.

The treatment that fits this description and is known to prevent further bone resorption and reduce the risk of developing breast cancer is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), such as raloxifene or tamoxifen. However, given the context of osteoporosis treatment and the side effect profile, raloxifene is more likely the drug in question. Raloxifene is known for its ability to prevent bone loss and reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer.

Considering the potential side effects of raloxifene, the most relevant option provided is an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Raloxifene, like other SERMs, can increase the risk of venous thromboembolic events, including DVT and pulmonary embolism.

1180,"A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. He has a past medical history of asthma, depression, and anxiety. He is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Cervical spine fracture
B) Intracranial hemorrhage
C) Syringomyelia
D) Brachial plexopathy
E) Conversion disorder","Considering the patient's presentation, the 17-year-old male was involved in a motor vehicle accident 4 months prior and initially had no significant fractures or injuries found. However, he now presents with weakness in his upper extremities (1/5 strength) and reduced sensation, while his lower extremities have normal strength (5/5) and intact sensation. This pattern of weakness and sensory deficit is highly suggestive of a peripheral nerve injury, specifically affecting the nerves of the upper limbs. Given the history of a motor vehicle accident, the most likely diagnosis is brachial plexopathy, which is an injury to the brachial plexus, a network of nerves that originates in the spinal cord and controls the muscles and sensation of the upper limbs. This type of injury can occur due to trauma, such as a motor vehicle accident, and may not always be immediately apparent. The other options, such as cervical spine fracture, intracranial hemorrhage, syringomyelia, and conversion disorder, do not fit as well with the patient's presentation and history.

246,"A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Computed tomography shows a small bowel perforation. The patient is prepared for emergent exploratory laparotomy. She is sedated with midazolam, induced with propofol, intubated, and maintained on nitrous oxide and isoflurane for the duration of the surgery. A single perforation in the terminal ileum is diagnosed intraoperatively and successfully repaired. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit. The ventilator is set at an FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 2.5 cm H2O. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 111/50 mm Hg. She is responsive to painful stimuli. Lung examination shows bilateral rales. Abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis shows:
pH 7.44
pO2 54 mm Hg
pCO2 31 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mm Hg
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""
Options
A) Increase the FiO2
B) Extubate
C) Increase the tidal volume
D) Increase PEEP
E) Increase the respiratory rate","To determine the best next step in the management of this patient, let's analyze the provided information. The patient, a 70-year-old woman, underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for a small bowel perforation and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) on mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings include an FiO2 of 50%, a tidal volume of 1000 mL, a respiratory rate of 12/min, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2.5 cm H2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.44, a pO2 of 54 mm Hg, a pCO2 of 31 mm Hg, and an HCO3- of 22 mm Hg.

The patient's oxygenation is a concern, as evidenced by the low pO2 of 54 mm Hg, despite being on a relatively high FiO2 of 50%. This suggests that the patient is experiencing hypoxemia. The presence of bilateral rales on lung examination further supports the presence of respiratory issues.

Given the patient's hypoxemia, the best next step would be to improve oxygenation. Increasing the FiO2 (Option A) might provide temporary relief but does not address the underlying issue of inadequate oxygenation. Extubation (Option B) is not appropriate at this time, as the patient is still in a critical postoperative state and may not be able to maintain adequate oxygenation on her own. Increasing the tidal volume (Option C) or respiratory rate (Option E) might not directly address the issue of hypoxemia and could potentially lead to other complications such as barotrauma or respiratory alkalosis.

Increasing PEEP (Option D) is the most appropriate next step. PEEP helps to recruit alveoli and improve oxygenation by increasing the functional residual capacity of the lungs. In a patient with hypoxemia and bilateral rales, increasing PEEP can help to improve oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing.

759,"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, and mild intermittent abdominal pain that is not affected by eating. He reports that over the last 6 months he slept a lot more than usual and lost 14.9 kg (33 lbs) without trying to lose weight. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that is worse when he is working and in the yard. There is no significant family history. His long-standing male partner passed away 2 years ago in a fatal car accident. His blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 23/min, and the temperature is 38°C (100.5°F). On physical examination, he has pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. There is a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border. His head bobs with each heartbeat. There are small, painless, red macules on both palms. His spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. His laboratory results are shown below.

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings?
Options
A) Viridans streptococci
B) Treponema pallidum
C) Malignant colonic neoplasm
D) Collagen vascular disease
E) Group D streptococci","The patient presents with a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, mild intermittent abdominal pain, and significant weight loss over the past 6 months. Additionally, he experiences chest pain and shortness of breath, particularly when exerting himself. The physical examination reveals pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae on his lower extremities, a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur, and a palpable spleen. The laboratory results show anemia (low hemoglobin), thrombocytosis (high platelet count), and low serum ferritin and iron levels.

The patient's cardiac findings, specifically the new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur, are most likely related to the presence of a neoplastic growth in the descending colon, as revealed by colonoscopy with biopsy. The most common cause of this type of murmur is aortic regurgitation, which can be associated with non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). NBTE is a known complication of malignancies, particularly adenocarcinomas, and is characterized by the formation of sterile vegetations on the heart valves.

Given the patient's diagnosis of a malignant colonic neoplasm, the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings is the development of NBTE, leading to aortic regurgitation and the characteristic diastolic murmur.

A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?
Options
A) Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles
B) Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate
C) Papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions
D) Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis
E) Stromal amyloid deposition","Analyzing the 65-year-old man's presentation, he has a painless, firm neck mass on the anterior aspect of his neck that has not increased in size over 4 months, accompanied by occasional fatigue and weight gain. His past medical history of gout and family history of medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle are notable. The physical examination reveals a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). MTC is often associated with a family history, particularly in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. The characteristic histological feature of MTC is the presence of stromal amyloid deposition, which is composed of calcitonin or calcitonin-related peptide. This feature distinguishes MTC from other types of thyroid cancer. Therefore, a biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate stromal amyloid deposition.

Options
A) Wood lamp examination
B) Skin culture
C) Potassium hydroxide preparation
D) Skin biopsy
E) Antinuclear antibody testing
""","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 21-year-old man's condition, let's consider the key points from the case presentation:

1. **Symptoms and History**: The patient presents with pruritus (itching) and a hypopigmented rash on his upper body that started after returning from a trip to the Bahamas. The rash initially began as a single lesion on his upper back and then spread to his shoulders.

2. **Medical and Social History**: He has type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with an insulin pump, works as an office manager, and has no known exposure to melanocytotoxic chemicals. He has been sexually active with multiple partners and uses condoms inconsistently.

3. **Physical Examination**: The patient's vital signs are normal, and a photograph of the rash is mentioned but not described in detail.

Considering these points, the differential diagnosis could include conditions such as pityriasis versicolor, vitiligo, or even a fungal infection given the history of travel and outdoor activities. However, the specific mention of a hypopigmented rash that started as a single lesion and spread, along with the patient's symptoms of pruritus, suggests a fungal infection like pityriasis versicolor as a strong possibility.

**Pityriasis Versicolor** is a common skin condition characterized by patches of discoloration on the skin, typically on the chest, back, shoulders, and neck. It's caused by a yeast infection and is more common in warm, humid climates, which fits with the patient's recent travel to the Bahamas.

**Diagnostic Confirmation**: The best way to confirm the diagnosis of a fungal infection like pityriasis versicolor is through a **Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Preparation**. This involves taking a skin scraping from the affected area, treating it with KOH, and examining it under a microscope for the presence of fungal elements such as hyphae and spores.

1241,"A 3-year-old male was brought to the pediatrician with severe lip lacerations, with a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, as well as missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?
Options
A) X-linked recessive
B) X-linked dominant
C) Autosomal dominant
D) Autosomal recessvie
E) Maternally inherited mitochondrial defect","This patient's presentation of severe lip lacerations, tongue biting, and missing portions of fingers, along with a family history of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side, is highly suggestive of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which is involved in the purine metabolism pathway. This deficiency leads to an overproduction of uric acid, as seen in the patient's urinalysis. The disorder is characterized by self-mutilating behaviors, such as biting and scratching, as well as developmental delays and intellectual disability.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome and primarily affects males. Females can be carriers of the disorder but usually do not exhibit symptoms themselves. The presence of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side supports this mode of inheritance, as the mothers of these affected males would be carriers of the mutated gene.

She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a “heavy feeling” in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes.

Options
A) Rectouterine septum nodularity
B) Globular 10-week sized uterus
C) Adnexal mass
D) Irregular 14-week sized uterus
E) No remarkable physical exam finding","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of increasingly heavy periods, irregular cycles, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and mild dyspareunia. These symptoms, along with the patient's age and obstetric history, suggest that she may be experiencing symptoms related to uterine fibroids or adenomyosis. However, the physical exam finding that is most likely to be present in this patient would be related to the uterine fibroids, given the symptoms of heavy bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and a ""heavy feeling"" in the pelvis.

Among the options provided, the finding of an irregularly shaped uterus is most consistent with the presence of uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids can cause the uterus to become enlarged and irregular in shape, which can be palpated during a physical exam. The size of the uterus can vary depending on the size and number of fibroids present.

The option of a ""globular 10-week sized uterus"" (B) might be seen in cases of adenomyosis or a uniformly enlarged uterus, but it does not account for the irregular shape that is often associated with fibroids. The ""rectouterine septum nodularity"" (A) might be seen in cases of endometriosis, but it does not directly relate to the patient's symptoms of heavy bleeding and uterine enlargement. The ""adnexal mass"" (C) might be seen in cases of ovarian cysts or tumors, but it does not account for the patient's symptoms of heavy bleeding and uterine enlargement. The option of ""no remarkable physical exam finding"" (E) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms.

399,"A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department from his home complaining of dyspnea. He is alert and oriented. The following arterial blood gas readings are drawn: pH: 7.33 (Normal: 7.35-7.45), pCO2: 70 mmHg (Normal: 35-45 mmHg), HCO3 33 (Normal: 21-26 mEq/L) Which of the following is most likely to have produced this patient’s condition?
Options
A) Panic attack
B) Mechanical ventilation
C) Diabetic ketoacidosis
D) Pulmonary embolus
E) Chronic obstructive bronchitis","To approach this question, let's analyze the arterial blood gas (ABG) readings provided for the 65-year-old male presenting with dyspnea.

1. **pH**: The patient's pH is 7.33, which is slightly acidic but still within the normal range (7.35-7.45). This indicates a mild acidosis or a compensation for an underlying condition.

2. **pCO2**: The pCO2 level is elevated at 70 mmHg (normal range: 35-45 mmHg). An elevated pCO2 level typically indicates hypoventilation, as the body is not adequately expelling CO2 through respiration.

3. **HCO3**: The bicarbonate (HCO3) level is elevated at 33 mEq/L (normal range: 21-26 mEq/L). An elevated HCO3 level can indicate a metabolic alkalosis or a compensatory response to a respiratory acidosis.

Given these ABG results, the patient's condition is most consistent with a **respiratory acidosis** (elevated pCO2) with a compensatory metabolic alkalosis (elevated HCO3). This pattern suggests that the patient is hypoventilating, leading to an accumulation of CO2 in the blood, and the kidneys are compensating by retaining more bicarbonate to buffer the acidosis.

Among the provided options, the condition most likely to produce this patient's ABG profile is **E) Chronic obstructive bronchitis**. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis, is characterized by airflow limitation and can lead to hypoventilation, especially during exacerbations. This hypoventilation results in elevated pCO2 levels and can trigger compensatory mechanisms, such as increased bicarbonate retention, leading to the observed ABG profile.

Which of the following is the underlying cause of this patient's vomiting?""
Options
A) Inflammation and edema
B) Abnormal gastric rotation
C) Neoplastic growth
D) Scarring and fibrosis
E) Walled-off pancreatic fluid collection","The patient's symptoms of nonbilious emesis with undigested food, early satiety, severe episodic epigastric pain, and dyspepsia that worsen at night and several hours after eating are indicative of gastric outlet obstruction. The presence of a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium, succussion splash, and reduced bowel sounds support this diagnosis. The patient's history of progressive severe episodic epigastric pain and dyspepsia, partially relieved with food or antacids, suggests peptic ulcer disease as the underlying cause. The most likely cause of gastric outlet obstruction in this patient is scarring and fibrosis resulting from chronic peptic ulcer disease. This is supported by the patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption, which are risk factors for peptic ulcer disease. The presence of occult blood in the stool also suggests a bleeding peptic ulcer.

254,"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
Options
A) Patent processus vaginalis
B) Dilation of the pampiniform plexus
C) Twisting of the spermatic cord
D) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis
E) Impaired lymphatic drainage","The patient presents with a painless right-sided scrotal swelling that is soft, cystic, nontender, and transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. These characteristics are highly suggestive of a hydrocele, which is an accumulation of fluid in the tunica vaginalis, a potential space around the testis. The most likely cause of a hydrocele is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis. This can be due to various factors such as inflammation, trauma, or tumors, but in many cases, the exact cause is unknown.

982,"A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies. She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?
Options
A) Alpha-adrenergic antagonism
B) Beta-adrenergic antagonism
C) Muscarinic antagonism
D) Relative lipophobicity
E) Serotonergic antagonism","To address the question, let's consider the characteristics of the medications in question, specifically focusing on why fexofenadine is less sedating than diphenhydramine.

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine known for its sedative effects. This sedation is largely due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and act on the central nervous system. In contrast, fexofenadine, a second-generation antihistamine, is less sedating. The key characteristic that allows fexofenadine to be less sedating is its relative lipophobicity.

Lipophobicity refers to a compound's inability or reduced ability to dissolve in fats, oils, and non-polar solvents. In the context of drugs, lipophobicity affects a compound's ability to cross biological membranes, including the blood-brain barrier. Since the blood-brain barrier is lipid-rich, drugs that are lipophilic (fat-soluble) can more easily cross this barrier, leading to central nervous system effects, including sedation.

Fexofenadine, being relatively lipophobic compared to diphenhydramine, has a harder time crossing the blood-brain barrier. This reduced ability to penetrate the central nervous system results in fewer sedative effects, making fexofenadine a preferable option for patients who want to avoid the drowsiness associated with first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine.

432,"A 24-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate. She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?
Options
A) Head CT
B) Head MRI
C) Lumbar puncture
D) Post void residual volumes
E) Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors","The patient presents with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate, along with a history of previous symptoms such as trouble speaking, changes in vision, and extreme pain in her face. These symptoms, combined with the physical exam finding of leftward gaze resulting in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward, suggest a possible neurological condition, specifically multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, causing a wide range of symptoms including vision problems, muscle weakness, and bladder dysfunction.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the best initial test to evaluate her chief complaint of urinary retention would be to assess her post-void residual (PVR) volumes. This test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination and can help determine if the patient has a urinary retention issue. The PVR test is a non-invasive and relatively simple procedure that can provide valuable information about the patient's urinary function.

While the other options may be relevant to the patient's overall diagnosis and treatment, they are not the best initial test for her chief complaint of urinary retention. A head CT or MRI may be useful in evaluating the patient's neurological symptoms, but they are not directly related to her urinary retention issue. A lumbar puncture may be considered if there is suspicion of a neurological condition such as MS, but it is not the best initial test for urinary retention. Domestic abuse screening and exploring the patient's life stressors is important given her history of abuse, but it is not directly related to her chief complaint of urinary retention.

47,"A medical research study is evaluating an investigational novel drug (medication 1) compared with standard therapy (medication 2) in patients presenting to the emergency department with myocardial infarction (MI). The study enrolled a total of 3,000 subjects, 1,500 in each study arm. Follow-up was conducted at 45 days post-MI. The following are the results of the trial:
Endpoints Medication 1 Medication 2 P-Value
Primary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03
Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)
Options
A) 5
B) 16
C) 20
D) 30
E) 50","To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes, we first need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the two treatment groups.

First, let's calculate the event rates for each group:

Event rate for Medication 1 = Number of deaths from cardiac causes / Total number of patients
= 134 / 1500
= 0.0893 or 8.93%

Event rate for Medication 2 = Number of deaths from cardiac causes / Total number of patients
= 210 / 1500
= 0.14 or 14%

Next, we calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR):

ARR = Event rate for Medication 2 - Event rate for Medication 1
= 0.14 - 0.0893
= 0.0507 or 5.07%

Now, we can calculate the NNT:

NNT = 1 / ARR
= 1 / 0.0507
≈ 19.7

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the NNT is approximately 20.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""
Options
A) Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder
B) Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury
C) Trauma to the bile duct
D) Adverse effect of anesthetic
E) Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream","To determine the underlying cause of this patient's condition, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which are non-specific symptoms but suggest an acute process.

2. **Recent Medical History**: The patient underwent an emergency appendectomy two weeks ago and received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. This history is crucial because it indicates potential exposure to bloodborne pathogens.

3. **Physical Examination**: The patient shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly, indicating liver involvement.

4. **Laboratory Studies**: 
   - Elevated alkaline phosphatase and significantly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels suggest liver injury.
   - The bilirubin levels are elevated, with a predominance of direct (conjugated) bilirubin, which is consistent with a direct liver injury.
   - The serological tests for hepatitis A (anti-HAV IgG positive, anti-HAV IgM negative) indicate past exposure but not acute infection. The patient is also immune to hepatitis B (anti-HBs positive, HBsAg negative) and does not have hepatitis C (anti-HCV antibodies negative).

5. **Imaging and Biopsy**: The abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver, and the liver biopsy reveals massive centrilobular necrosis, indicating severe liver damage.

Given these findings, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is not directly related to the surgical procedure itself (e.g., trauma to the bile duct or acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder) but rather to an adverse effect related to the blood transfusion or the anesthesia used during surgery.

Among the options provided:
- **Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder** and **Trauma to the bile duct** are less likely given the lack of specific evidence pointing to these conditions.
- **Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury** is unlikely given the serological results.
- **Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream** could cause sepsis but does not directly explain the liver findings.
- **Adverse effect of anesthetic** is a possibility, but the information provided does not specifically support this as the most likely cause.

However, considering the recent blood transfusion and the severe liver injury without clear evidence of viral hepatitis or other causes, another potential cause not explicitly listed but related to the transfusion could be considered, such as a transfusion-related acute liver injury. Yet, given the options and focusing on the most direct information provided:

872,"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:
Urine test
Sample White cells Culture
Mid-stream urine Negative Negative
Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
B) Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis
C) Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis
D) Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli
E) Interstitial cystitis","The patient presents with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. Despite multiple evaluations and antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, there has been no improvement, leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are crucial in determining the diagnosis. The presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) with a negative culture suggests an inflammatory process without a bacterial infection. This, combined with the patient's chronic symptoms and lack of response to antimicrobial therapy, points towards a diagnosis of chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), is a condition characterized by chronic pain and discomfort in the pelvic region, often accompanied by urinary symptoms and painful ejaculation. The exact cause of CPPS is unknown, but it is thought to be related to inflammation, immune system dysfunction, and possibly psychological factors.

In contrast, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition characterized by an enlarged prostate, which can cause urinary symptoms, but it is not typically associated with pelvic pain or painful ejaculation. Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis or chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli would likely present with positive cultures and respond to antimicrobial therapy. Interstitial cystitis is a condition characterized by chronic bladder pain and urinary symptoms, but it is not typically associated with prostatic tenderness or painful ejaculation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

1271,"A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2–3 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2–3 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?
Options
A) Trial of diphenhydramine
B) Complete caffeine cessation
C) Stop evening exercise
D) Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime
E) Scheduled afternoon naps","To address the patient's concerns, let's break down the key points from the scenario:

1. **Daytime fatigue and sleepiness**: The patient experiences excessive daytime fatigue and sleepiness, which is affecting his daily life and academic performance.
2. **Difficulty falling asleep**: He has trouble falling asleep at night, often taking 2-3 hours to do so, and wakes up feeling extremely drowsy.
3. **Napping habits**: He naps frequently during the afternoon, sometimes for more than an hour.
4. **Caffeine consumption**: He consumes 2-3 cups of coffee daily to try to overcome his fatigue.
5. **Previous attempts**: He has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success.

Considering these points, the most appropriate recommendation would focus on addressing the underlying sleep issues and establishing a healthier sleep routine.

- **Option A (Trial of diphenhydramine)**: While diphenhydramine can help with sleep, it's not the best long-term solution due to potential side effects and the risk of dependence.
- **Option B (Complete caffeine cessation)**: This could be beneficial, as caffeine can disrupt sleep patterns, especially when consumed in large amounts or too close to bedtime.
- **Option C (Stop evening exercise)**: Exercise can actually help improve sleep quality, so stopping it altogether might not be the best approach.
- **Option D (Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime)**: Consuming alcohol before bed can negatively impact sleep quality and is not a recommended solution.
- **Option E (Scheduled afternoon naps)**: While napping can help with fatigue, scheduling them might not address the underlying sleep issues and could potentially interfere with nighttime sleep.

Given the patient's situation, the most appropriate recommendation would be to **stop or significantly reduce caffeine consumption**, as it can exacerbate sleep problems and daytime fatigue. This approach addresses a potential contributor to his sleep issues without introducing new substances or significantly altering his routine.

617,"A 31-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with fevers, chills, and night sweats. After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?
Options
A) Rapidly progresive glomerulonephritis
B) Amyloidosis
C) Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
D) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
E) Minimal change disease","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the findings from the lymph node biopsy.

1. **Initial Presentation**: The patient presents with fevers, chills, and night sweats, which are systemic symptoms often associated with infections, autoimmune diseases, or malignancies.

2. **Lymph Node Biopsy**: Although the specific findings from the lymph node biopsy (Image A) are not described, the fact that the patient underwent a biopsy suggests that there was a concern for lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), which could be due to infection, inflammation, or malignancy.

3. **Development of Renal Symptoms**: Three days later, the patient develops generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. This indicates the onset of nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by significant proteinuria (protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low albumin in the blood), hyperlipidemia (elevated lipids in the blood), and edema (swelling).

Given the rapid progression from systemic symptoms to nephrotic syndrome, we need to consider conditions that could cause both lymphadenopathy and renal involvement.

- **A) Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)**: This condition is characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function, often accompanied by severe oliguria (decreased urine production) and signs of nephritic syndrome (hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and edema). While RPGN can present with systemic symptoms, the primary renal biopsy findings would typically show crescentic glomerulonephritis, which is not directly implied here.

- **B) Amyloidosis**: Amyloidosis involves the deposition of amyloid, an abnormal protein, in various tissues, including the kidneys. It can cause nephrotic syndrome and is often associated with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy. However, the development of amyloidosis typically occurs over a longer period.

- **C) Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)**: MPGN can cause nephrotic syndrome and is sometimes associated with systemic diseases, including infections and autoimmune conditions. However, it is less likely to be directly linked to the acute onset of systemic symptoms followed by nephrotic syndrome.

- **D) Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)**: FSGS is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, but it is less likely to be directly associated with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy.

- **E) Minimal Change Disease (MCD)**: MCD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children but can also occur in adults. It is characterized by the loss of foot processes of podocytes as seen on electron microscopy but appears normal on light microscopy. MCD can be associated with Hodgkin lymphoma and other lymphoproliferative disorders, which could explain the lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms.

Given the patient's presentation with systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and the rapid development of nephrotic syndrome, the most likely diagnosis that could link these findings is minimal change disease associated with a lymphoproliferative disorder.

The x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra, which is a common complication of osteoporosis. However, in the context of chronic kidney disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism is a more likely explanation for the bone disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid glands are stimulated to produce excess PTH in response to low calcium levels, often seen in chronic kidney disease. This excess PTH can lead to bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and an increased risk of fractures.

Considering the patient's medical history and laboratory findings, the most likely explanation for the wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra is secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a complication of chronic kidney disease.

370,"A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness?
Options
A) 1st pharyngeal arch
B) 2nd pharyngeal arch
C) 3rd pharyngeal arch
D) 4th pharyngeal arch
E) 6th pharyngeal arch","The patient's symptoms of a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking following a thyroidectomy suggest damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is responsible for innervating the muscles of the larynx involved in speech and voice production. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve, which is derived from the 4th and 6th pharyngeal arches. However, the motor fibers of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which are responsible for the innervation of the laryngeal muscles, originate from the 6th pharyngeal arch. Therefore, the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness is the 6th pharyngeal arch.

1032,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician after discovering a painless mass in the left testicle. Results from tumor markers and a biopsy are as follows:
AFP 350 ng/mL (normal value < 10 ng/mL)
hCG 0.4 IU/L (normal value < 0.5 IU/L)
Biopsy: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Classic seminoma
B) Choriocarcinoma
C) Teratoma
D) Embryonal carcinoma
E) Yolk sac tumor","The patient is a 10-year-old boy presenting with a painless mass in the left testicle. The tumor markers show an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 350 ng/mL, which is significantly above the normal value of < 10 ng/mL. In contrast, the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level is within the normal range at 0.4 IU/L. The biopsy results reveal the presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.

Elevated AFP levels are commonly associated with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, particularly yolk sac tumors. The biopsy findings, which describe glomeruli-like structures (also known as Schiller-Duval bodies), are characteristic of yolk sac tumors. These structures are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors and are formed by the germ cells lining the mesodermal core, which contains a central capillary.

Given the elevated AFP levels and the distinctive biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is a yolk sac tumor.

A) Gingival swelling, erythema, and pus drainage
B) Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques
C) Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution
D) Photophobia and phonophobia
E) Rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis","Analyzing the situation, the 36-year-old woman is experiencing intermittent stabbing face pain that occurs in waves, is bilateral but rarely simultaneous, and is triggered by touching her face or brushing her teeth. This presentation is highly suggestive of Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN), a condition characterized by sudden, severe, and stabbing pain in parts of the face. Additionally, the patient has a history of an episode of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week, and her neurological examination reveals decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally, muscle weakness in the left upper extremity, and spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. These findings indicate a possible demyelinating disorder affecting the central nervous system.

Given these factors, the most likely finding that further evaluation will reveal is the presence of multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques, which are characteristic of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic and often disabling autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. MS is known to cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including weakness, spasticity, and sensory disturbances, and can also be associated with TN. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

964,"A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?
Options
A) 30%
B) 15%
C) 35%
D) 25%
E) 20%","To determine the ejection fraction (EF) in this patient, we first need to understand what ejection fraction is and how it is calculated. Ejection fraction is the percentage of the blood that is pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. It is calculated by dividing the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each beat) by the end-diastolic volume (the amount of blood in the left ventricle at the end of diastole), and then multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage.

The formula for ejection fraction is: EF = (Stroke Volume / End-Diastolic Volume) * 100

However, we are given the end-systolic volume (the amount of blood left in the left ventricle after contraction) instead of the end-diastolic volume. We can still estimate the ejection fraction if we know the relationship between these volumes and the stroke volume.

Given that the end-systolic volume is 80 mL, and knowing that the stroke volume is the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume, we can infer that the stroke volume would be a portion of the total volume that is being pumped out. However, without the exact end-diastolic volume, we cannot directly calculate the ejection fraction using the given formula.

But, we can estimate the ejection fraction based on the given systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and the fact that the patient's condition suggests a possible state of cardiogenic shock or severe heart failure, indicated by the low blood pressure and high pulse rate.

In clinical practice, an ejection fraction of less than 30% is generally considered to indicate severe left ventricular dysfunction. Given the patient's symptoms and the provided hemodynamic parameters, an ejection fraction of 30% or lower would be consistent with the clinical presentation.

Among the provided options, the best estimate based on the clinical scenario and the implications of the given data would be an ejection fraction of 30% or lower, but since we cannot precisely calculate it without the end-diastolic volume, and considering the patient's severe condition, we might lean towards a lower ejection fraction among the given choices.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Asbestosis
B) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
C) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
D) Bronchiectasis
E) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Let's break down the information provided to determine the most likely diagnosis.

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He has a significant smoking history of 36 pack-years, which is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Additionally, his occupation as a former construction worker and his work in a steel mill during high school may expose him to dust and chemicals that could contribute to lung disease. However, there is no specific mention of asbestos exposure, which would be a key factor in asbestosis.

The patient's physical examination and vital signs show a mildly prolonged expiratory phase without wheezing or crackles, which can be indicative of obstructive lung disease. The pulmonary function test (PFT) results provide more specific information:

- The FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% indicates an obstructive pattern, as the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is decreased compared to the forced vital capacity (FVC).
- The FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value indicates significant airflow limitation.
- The total lung capacity (TLC) of 110% of predicted value and residual volume (RV) of 115% of predicted value suggest air trapping, which is consistent with obstructive lung disease.
- The diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 60% of predicted value can be seen in various lung conditions, including emphysema, a component of COPD.

Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which encompasses conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, particularly given the patient's significant smoking history and the obstructive pattern on the PFT.

Options
A) ERCP
B) Close monitoring
C) MRCP
D) Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram
E) CT abdomen","Let's break down the scenario step by step.

The patient is a 55-year-old man presenting with altered mental status, acute distress, and disorientation. His vital signs indicate a high fever (38.7°C or 101.6°F), low blood pressure (80/50 mm Hg), tachycardia (103/min), and tachypnea (22/min). The patient's sclera and skin are icteric, suggesting jaundice. The abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the right upper quadrant.

Laboratory tests show an elevated leukocyte count (16,500/mm3), indicating an infection or inflammation. The liver function tests reveal elevated total bilirubin (2.8 mg/dL), AST (50 U/L), ALT (65 U/L), and ALP (180 U/L), suggesting liver dysfunction or bile duct obstruction.

The patient is treated with intravenous fluids, dopamine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which improves his blood pressure. The ultrasound of the abdomen shows a dilated common bile duct, indicating a possible obstruction.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is ascending cholangitis, a bacterial infection of the bile duct. The dilated common bile duct on ultrasound suggests an obstruction, which is a common cause of ascending cholangitis.

The best next step in the management of this patient is to relieve the obstruction and clear the infection. Among the options provided, ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) is the most appropriate next step. ERCP allows for the visualization of the bile duct, removal of any obstruction, and collection of samples for culture. It is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed urgently to address the patient's life-threatening condition.

C) Hemoglobin F
D) Hemoglobin SC
E) HbC","The patient is a 6-year-old African American boy presenting with jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain. He has a history of several episodes of mild bone pain in the past. On physical examination, the child is icteric with nonspecific pain in his hands, and his hands are swollen, tender, and warm. Laboratory results show elevated total bilirubin, a low hemoglobin level, a normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and a high reticulocyte count. The peripheral blood smear shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnant. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a diagnostic test that separates different types of hemoglobin in the blood, and the result is not explicitly described but is implied to be abnormal.

Considering the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and implied abnormal hemoglobin electrophoresis, the most likely cause of his condition is a hemoglobinopathy, specifically sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production, causing red blood cells to be misshapen (sickle-shaped), leading to anemia, jaundice, and episodes of pain due to vaso-occlusive crises. The presence of elongated and curved cells on the peripheral blood smear supports this diagnosis, as these are characteristic of sickled red blood cells.

Sickle cell trait (A) is a carrier state for the disease and typically does not cause significant symptoms. Hemoglobin F (C) is a normal fetal hemoglobin, and its presence does not explain the patient's symptoms. Hemoglobin SC (D) is another type of hemoglobinopathy, but it is less severe than sickle cell disease and does not fully account for the patient's presentation. HbC (E) is a hemoglobin variant that can cause hemolytic anemia but does not typically present with the same severity of symptoms as sickle cell disease.

1085,"Thirty minutes after delivery, a 3600-g (7-lb 15-oz) newborn has noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation and required bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Her mother has noticed the bluish lip discoloration worsen when she fed and improve when she cried. The patient's pulse is 163/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?
Options
A) Diffuse reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray
B) Boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray
C) Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible
D) Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible
E) Scaphoid abdomen","The newborn's symptoms of noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress that worsen with feeding and improve with crying suggest an upper airway obstruction. The fact that the lungs are clear to auscultation when the infant cries implies that the obstruction is likely located above the level of the vocal cords. The most common congenital anomaly that causes upper airway obstruction in newborns is esophageal atresia (EA) with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). In EA, the esophagus is not fully formed, and the upper esophageal pouch ends blindly, while in TEF, there is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. The inability to pass a gastric catheter through the mouth would indicate that the esophagus is not fully formed, which is consistent with EA.

241,"A 46-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of a cough for 6 months. He has been taking over-the-counter cough medications, but they have not helped much. He adds that he expectorated bloody sputum the previous night. He denies breathlessness but mentions that he frequently experiences fatigue after little physical exertion. There is no past history of any specific medical disorder. His father died of lung cancer at the age of 54 years. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse rate is 82/min, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 18/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. Further diagnostic evaluation confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. If his blood were to be sent for laboratory evaluation, which of the following proteins is most likely to be elevated in his serum?
Options
A) Bence-Jones protein
B) Calcitonin
C) CA 15-3
D) Lactate dehydrogenase
E) Neuron-specific enolase","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient's Symptoms and History**: The patient has a 6-month history of cough, recent episode of bloody sputum, and fatigue after minimal physical exertion. There's no specific past medical history, but his father died of lung cancer at age 54.

2. **Clinical Findings**: The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but chest auscultation reveals localized rhonchi over the interscapular region, suggesting a respiratory issue localized to that area.

3. **Diagnostic Findings**: A chest radiograph shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung, which, combined with further diagnostic evaluation, confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung.

Given the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung, we need to consider which of the listed proteins is most likely to be elevated in the patient's serum. Small cell carcinoma of the lung is known for its aggressive behavior and rapid growth, often associated with paraneoplastic syndromes due to the secretion of various hormones and peptides.

- **A) Bence-Jones protein**: This is typically associated with multiple myeloma and not directly linked to small cell carcinoma of the lung.

- **B) Calcitonin**: While calcitonin can be elevated in certain types of cancer, it's more commonly associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma.

- **C) CA 15-3**: This is a tumor marker more commonly associated with breast cancer.

- **D) Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: Elevated LDH levels can be seen in various conditions, including cancer, but it's not as specific for small cell carcinoma of the lung as another option.

- **E) Neuron-specific enolase (NSE)**: NSE is an enzyme found primarily in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. Small cell carcinoma of the lung, being a neuroendocrine tumor, can secrete NSE, making it a useful tumor marker for this condition.

1223,"A 53-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up appointment three days after being prescribed a selective alpha-1 agonist. He reports improvement in his symptoms and has not experienced any adverse effects. This drug was most likely prescribed for which of the following conditions?
Options
A) Bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma
B) Bilateral hand tremors of indeterminate etiology
C) Urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia
D) Nasal congestion due to a viral infection
E) Blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision","To determine the condition for which the selective alpha-1 agonist was prescribed, let's consider the effects of such a medication. Alpha-1 agonists cause vasoconstriction, which can be beneficial in conditions where vasodilation is a problem. They also have a relaxing effect on the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, making them useful in treating urinary retention.

Option A, bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma, is unlikely because alpha-1 agonists are not typically used to treat asthma; instead, bronchodilators like beta-2 agonists are preferred.

Option B, bilateral hand tremors of indeterminate etiology, is also unlikely because alpha-1 agonists are not typically used to treat tremors; beta blockers or other medications are more commonly used.

Option C, urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is a strong candidate because alpha-1 agonists can relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing symptoms of BPH.

Option D, nasal congestion due to a viral infection, might seem plausible because alpha-1 agonists can cause vasoconstriction, which could theoretically reduce nasal congestion. However, they are not typically prescribed for this purpose due to potential side effects and the availability of more targeted treatments.

Option E, blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision, is unlikely because alpha-1 agonists are not typically used to manage blood pressure in this context; instead, medications like phenoxybenzamine are preferred.

Considering the above, the most likely condition for which the selective alpha-1 agonist was prescribed is urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

906,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
Options
A) Measurement bias
B) Recall bias
C) Lead-time bias
D) Selection bias
E) Length-time bias","The conclusion that initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, may be due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound. This would exemplify lead-time bias, which occurs when a screening test appears to prolong survival or improve outcomes simply because it detects the disease earlier, rather than actually changing the natural course of the disease.

Lead-time bias can make it seem like a screening test is more effective than it actually is, because it can make it appear as though patients are living longer or having better outcomes when, in reality, the disease was simply detected earlier. In this case, the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound may make it seem like the outcomes are better, when in fact, the disease was simply detected earlier.

359,"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient’s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?
Options
A) Immobilization
B) Moderate flexion then hyperpronation
C) Open reduction
D) Radiograph
E) Supination then maximal extension","This patient's presentation, including the mechanism of injury, localized pain to the lateral aspect of the elbow, and limited supination, is highly suggestive of a radial head subluxation, also known as a ""nursemaid's elbow."" This condition occurs when the radial head is partially dislocated, typically due to a sudden pull on the extended arm.

Given the clinical presentation, the next step in management would be to attempt a reduction of the subluxation. The most commonly used method for reducing a radial head subluxation is the ""hyperpronation"" technique, where the forearm is hyperpronated to help the radial head slip back into place. This method is often successful in reducing the subluxation and relieving the patient's symptoms.

28,"A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?
Options
A) Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone
B) Induction of CYP2A6 by rifampin leading to increased inactivation of ethinylestradiol
C) Induction of CYP2E1 by isoniazid leading to decreased serum levels of progesterone
D) Interference with the intestinal absorption of the oral contraceptive by pyrazinamide
E) Increased renal elimination of the progesterone component of the oral contraceptive by ethambutol","The patient's oral contraceptives failed due to an interaction with her anti-tuberculosis (TB) medication regimen. Rifampin, a key component of the anti-TB regimen, is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP3A4. This induction increases the metabolism of various drugs, including the hormones in oral contraceptives, such as ethinylestradiol and progesterone. As a result, the serum levels of these hormones decrease, reducing the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive and leading to an increased risk of pregnancy.

966,"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This pain started acutely, and she describes the pain as sharp. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. She takes a number of medications but does not remember what they are. On physical exam, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. After resolution of this acute episode, the patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia. Which of the following describes the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case?
Options
A) Antibody to soluble factor
B) Inhibitor of microtubule polymerization
C) Inhibitor of proximal tubule reabsorption
D) Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase
E) Recombinant enzyme","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the treatment outcome.

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient presents with acute, severe pain in her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, which is warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. This presentation is classic for gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe.

2. **Medical History**: The patient's history of obesity, hypertension, and alcohol use are risk factors for gout. While her inflammatory bowel disease and medications could also play a role in her condition, the acute presentation of joint pain is most suggestive of gout.

3. **Treatment Outcome**: After the acute episode resolves, the patient is started on a medication to prevent recurrence. However, she develops pancytopenia, a condition where there is a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets.

4. **Mechanism of the Drug**: Given the development of pancytopenia, we need to identify a drug used to prevent gout recurrence that could cause such a side effect. The options provided describe different mechanisms of action for various drugs.

- **A) Antibody to soluble factor**: This refers to biologic agents that target specific proteins involved in inflammation. While used in treating various conditions, this is not typically associated with the treatment of gout or the side effect of pancytopenia.

- **B) Inhibitor of microtubule polymerization**: This describes a mechanism of action for certain chemotherapy agents and is not directly related to gout treatment.

- **C) Inhibitor of proximal tubule reabsorption**: This refers to a mechanism of action for certain diuretics and is not relevant to gout treatment or the development of pancytopenia.

- **D) Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase**: This describes the mechanism of action for allopurinol, a drug commonly used to prevent gout attacks by reducing uric acid production. However, allopurinol can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to pancytopenia, especially in patients with renal impairment or when used at high doses.

- **E) Recombinant enzyme**: This refers to uricase, an enzyme that breaks down uric acid. While used in treating severe gout, this option does not fit the side effect profile described.

Given the patient's presentation and the development of pancytopenia, the most likely drug prescribed is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, which is used to prevent gout recurrence but can cause bone marrow suppression.

840,"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of thrombophlebitis. Physical examination shows multiple bruises on her limbs. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?
Options
A) Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation
B) Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin
C) Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis
D) Inhibition of stem cell differentiation
E) Restoration of the body's iron stores","The patient's symptoms of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising, along with laboratory results showing a high platelet count, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid levels, are indicative of a myeloproliferative disorder, specifically essential thrombocythemia. The treatment with a medication also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease is likely hydroxyurea. In the context of sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin, which reduces the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin and the resulting red blood cell sickling. This is the mechanism most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?
Options
A) Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin
B) Increased phosphorylation of myosin
C) Increased production of nitric oxide
D) Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
E) Decreased concentration of bradykinin","To answer this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the possible explanations for the decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells.

The patient is a 56-year-old man who underwent a temporal artery biopsy to evaluate symptoms of headache and blurry vision. The biopsy results show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Arginine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator that helps to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow.

The patient has a 12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors work by blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. By inhibiting this conversion, ACE inhibitors help to relax blood vessels and reduce blood pressure.

Given the patient's history of hypertension and the results of the biopsy, the most likely explanation for the decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells is related to the production of nitric oxide.

Let's examine the options:

A) Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin: This option is not directly related to the production of nitric oxide or the decreased concentrations of arginine.

B) Increased phosphorylation of myosin: This option is also not directly related to the production of nitric oxide or the decreased concentrations of arginine.

C) Increased production of nitric oxide: This option is the most likely explanation for the decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. The production of nitric oxide requires arginine as a substrate, and increased production of nitric oxide would lead to decreased concentrations of arginine.

D) Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate: This option is not directly related to the production of nitric oxide or the decreased concentrations of arginine.

E) Decreased concentration of bradykinin: This option is not directly related to the production of nitric oxide or the decreased concentrations of arginine.

She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?
Options
A) Alpha-adrenergic agonist
B) Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors
C) Disruption of disulfide bonds
D) Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5
E) Short acting beta-2 agonist","The patient is a 26-year-old woman who is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises regularly and eats a plant-based diet. However, she reports recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. These symptoms are characteristic of allergic rhinitis, a common condition where the nasal passages and sinuses become inflamed due to an allergic reaction.

Given the symptoms and the fact that the patient is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed, the likely medication is an antihistamine. Antihistamines work by competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors, which are responsible for the allergic response. By blocking these receptors, antihistamines can help to alleviate symptoms such as sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes.

Options
A) Hyperplasia
B) Hypertrophy
C) Atrophy
D) Metaplasia
E) Dysplasia","To answer this question, let's break down the key terms and concepts involved.

The researcher observed an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation in the breast tissue of pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. This change is likely due to the hormonal fluctuations that occur during pregnancy, particularly the increase in estrogen and progesterone levels.

Now, let's examine the options provided:

A) Hyperplasia: This refers to an increase in the number of cells in a tissue or organ, often leading to an increase in the size of the affected area. In the context of the study, the increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation in the breast tissue of pregnant women is a classic example of hyperplasia.

B) Hypertrophy: This refers to an increase in the size of cells in a tissue or organ, often leading to an increase in the size of the affected area. While hypertrophy can occur in response to hormonal changes, it is not the best fit for the observed changes in this study.

C) Atrophy: This refers to a decrease in the size of cells, tissues, or organs, often due to disuse, disease, or injury. This is the opposite of what was observed in the study.

D) Metaplasia: This refers to the replacement of one type of cell or tissue with another type, often in response to chronic irritation or injury. This is not relevant to the observed changes in this study.

E) Dysplasia: This refers to the disordered or abnormal growth of cells, tissues, or organs, often a precursor to cancer. This is not relevant to the observed changes in this study.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the process that involves an increase in the number of cells in a tissue or organ.

26,"A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?
Options
A) Lymphocytes
B) Immunoglobulin class switching
C) Superoxide dismutase
D) Myeloperoxidase
E) Respiratory burst","The patient is a 5-year-old female who suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The fact that she is prone to these infections suggests a problem with her immune system, specifically with her neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections.

The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is a laboratory test used to assess the function of neutrophils. In this test, neutrophils are exposed to NBT, which is a yellow dye that is reduced to a blue formazan product when the neutrophils produce superoxide anions. The patient's neutrophils fail to react during the NBT test, indicating that they are unable to produce superoxide anions.

The production of superoxide anions is a critical step in the respiratory burst, which is a process by which neutrophils generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill ingested microorganisms. The respiratory burst is mediated by the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which is responsible for producing superoxide anions.

Given the patient's symptoms and the results of the NBT test, it is likely that the patient has a dysfunction in the respiratory burst, specifically in the production of superoxide anions. This is consistent with a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare genetic disorder that affects the NADPH oxidase system and impairs the ability of neutrophils to kill certain bacteria and fungi.

E) Stromal cells","To determine the origin of the adnexal mass, let's consider the patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the mass. The patient is experiencing dragging pelvic pain, weight loss, and irregular menses, which are common symptoms associated with various gynecologic conditions. The presence of a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass on ultrasonography suggests a possible ovarian tumor or cyst.

Given the patient's age and the characteristics of the mass, we can narrow down the possible cell types of origin. Ovarian epithelial cells are the most common origin of ovarian tumors, including benign and malignant types. Germ cells are another possible origin, but they are more commonly associated with tumors such as dysgerminomas, which are typically seen in younger women. Chorionic epithelial cells are not a common origin of adnexal masses, as they are typically associated with pregnancy-related conditions. Endometrial cells can be a source of adnexal masses, particularly in cases of endometriosis, but the symptoms and ultrasonography findings do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. Stromal cells are a less common origin of ovarian tumors, and the symptoms and findings do not strongly suggest this diagnosis either.

Considering the patient's age, symptoms, and ultrasonography findings, the most likely origin of the adnexal mass is ovarian epithelial cells.

94,"A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient’s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient’s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition?
Options
A) Cerebral palsy
B) Diabetes mellitus
C) Down syndrome
D) Hypertension
E) Rheumatoid arthritis","To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings to determine the underlying condition. The patient presents with a sudden change in behavior, ataxic gait, and decreased responsiveness, which suggests a neurological condition. The physical examination findings of spasticity, 3+ reflexes, and a positive Babinski sign further support a neurological diagnosis.

The musculoskeletal examination findings of symmetric swelling and deformities of the hands bilaterally are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the presence of a ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine is suggestive of atlantoaxial subluxation, a known complication of rheumatoid arthritis.

Given these findings, the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can cause joint deformities and swelling, as well as neurological complications such as atlantoaxial subluxation.

576,"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent pain in her neck, right shoulder, and arm, as well as a tingling sensation in her right hand. She first noticed her symptoms after she got off a rollercoaster ride 2 months ago. Physical examination shows weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. An MRI of the head and neck is shown. This patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from which of the following embryologic layers?
Options
A) Endoderm
B) Neural crest
C) Notochord
D) Neural tube
E) Surface ectoderm","The patient is experiencing intermittent pain in her neck, right shoulder, and arm, as well as a tingling sensation in her right hand, which began after a rollercoaster ride 2 months ago. The physical examination shows weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. These symptoms are suggestive of nerve root compression, which can be caused by a herniated intervertebral disc. The intervertebral discs are derived from the notochord, which is an embryologic structure that forms during the development of the vertebral column. The notochord gives rise to the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. Therefore, the patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from the notochord.

277,"A 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma on chemotherapy presents to his oncologist for a follow-up visit. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he reports that he recently developed multiple “spots” all over his body. He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient’s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Options
A) Interleukin 2
B) Interleukin 8
C) Interleukin 11
D) Erythropoietin
E) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma who has been undergoing chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin. He has developed a rash and his complete blood count results show a low platelet count of 20,000/mm^3, which is a significant concern for the oncologist as it may limit the optimal dose and frequency of the chemotherapy regimen. The low platelet count, also known as thrombocytopenia, increases the risk of bleeding and may require dose adjustments or interruptions in chemotherapy.

Among the options provided, the recombinant version of interleukin 11 (IL-11) is most appropriate in this patient. IL-11 is a thrombopoietic growth factor that stimulates the production of platelets, making it a suitable treatment option for patients with thrombocytopenia. Oprelvekin is a recombinant form of IL-11 that has been approved for the prevention of severe thrombocytopenia and to reduce the need for platelet transfusions following myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

492,"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up vaccination 1 week after being bitten by a rodent while camping. She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner. The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?
Options
A) Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.
B) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because her case is uncomplicated and does not require decision-making on his part.
C) Inform the patient that dating her will never be appropriate even once the physician-patient relationship has been terminated.
D) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her, but that she will have to transfer her care to a different physician.
E) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because she no longer requires his service as a physician.
""","Let's think step by step. The physician is currently managing the patient's post-exposure care regimen and has administered the third dose of the rabies vaccine. The patient has asked the physician to join her for a movie and dinner, which implies a romantic interest. However, the physician-patient relationship is a professional one, and engaging in a romantic relationship with a current patient is considered unethical. This is because the physician has a position of power and influence over the patient, which can create a power imbalance and potentially compromise the patient's autonomy and well-being.

The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics states that ""sexual or romantic relationships between physicians and their current patients are unethical."" This is because such relationships can blur the boundaries of the professional relationship, create conflicts of interest, and potentially harm the patient.

Therefore, the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation is to inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.

987,"A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options
A) Hypersensitivity reaction
B) Asbestos inhalation
C) Neoplastic transformation
D) Opportunistic colonization
E) Abscess formation","Considering the 60-year-old man's 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood, and his history of pulmonary tuberculosis, it is essential to evaluate for potential complications or sequelae of tuberculosis. The presence of a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning, as seen on the chest x-ray, is suggestive of a pulmonary aspergilloma. This condition, also known as a fungus ball, typically occurs in pre-existing cavities, such as those caused by tuberculosis. The lack of growth of acid-fast bacteria in the sputum sample rules out active tuberculosis. Among the provided options, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is opportunistic colonization by Aspergillus, which is a common pathogen in pulmonary aspergilloma.

722,"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?
Options
A) Arachnoid villi
B) Interventricular foramen
C) Median aperture
D) Lateral apertures
E) Cerebral aqueduct","To approach this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze the possible causes for the patient's symptoms and the findings on the MRI.

The patient is experiencing episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, which have not been relieved by over-the-counter pain medications. These symptoms could be indicative of increased intracranial pressure or a space-occupying lesion within the brain.

The MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This finding suggests that there is an obstruction to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at some point in the ventricular system.

Let's consider the options provided:

A) Arachnoid villi: These are structures involved in the reabsorption of CSF into the venous system. Blockade of arachnoid villi would lead to increased intracranial pressure, but it would not cause isolated dilation of one lateral ventricle.

B) Interventricular foramen: This is the opening that connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle. Blockade of the interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro) would indeed cause dilation of the lateral ventricle on the affected side, as CSF would be unable to flow from the lateral ventricle into the third ventricle.

C) Median aperture: This is the opening in the fourth ventricle that allows CSF to flow into the subarachnoid space. Blockade of the median aperture would affect the flow of CSF from the fourth ventricle but would not cause isolated dilation of one lateral ventricle.

D) Lateral apertures: These are openings in the fourth ventricle that allow CSF to flow into the subarachnoid space. Similar to the median aperture, blockade of the lateral apertures would affect the flow of CSF from the fourth ventricle but would not cause isolated dilation of one lateral ventricle.

E) Cerebral aqueduct: This is the narrow tube that connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Blockade of the cerebral aqueduct would cause dilation of both lateral ventricles and the third ventricle, as CSF would be unable to flow from the third ventricle into the fourth ventricle.

Based on the information provided and the analysis of the possible causes, the most likely structure responsible for the isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle is the interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro).

Current medications include levothyroxine and metformin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix. The uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm. Endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options
A) Total hysterectomy
B) Estrogen vaginal cream
C) Reassurance and follow-up
D) Progestin therapy
E) Surgical endometrial ablation","Considering the 55-year-old nulligravid woman's presentation of heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than 5 pads per day, despite being postmenopausal, along with the endometrial biopsy showing non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia, it is essential to address the endometrial hyperplasia to prevent progression to atypia or carcinoma. The patient's history of hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus, along with her smoking history, does not directly influence the management of this condition. Given the absence of atypia, the most appropriate next step in management would be to treat the endometrial hyperplasia with progestin therapy to reduce the endometrial thickness and prevent further proliferation.

1209,"Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?
Options
A) A 15-month-old girl who has had repeated otitis media, pneumonia, and progressive clumsiness since beginning to walk in the past three months
B) A 10-month-old boy who has had recurrent viral infections as well as hypocalcemia during neonatal period
C) A 4-year-old girl who has had repeated oral candidasis in the past nine months
D) A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months
E) A 7-month-old boy who has had recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, eczema, and easy bruising in the past four months","To approach this question, let's break down the key features of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia and compare them to the patient presentations provided.

Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the BTK gene, leading to a deficiency in B cells and, consequently, a lack of immunoglobulins (antibodies). This condition primarily affects males and typically presents with recurrent bacterial infections, particularly of the respiratory tract, starting after 6 months of age when maternal antibodies wane. Patients often have a history of recurrent otitis media, pneumonia, and sinusitis.

Now, let's evaluate the patient presentations:

A) A 15-month-old girl with repeated otitis media, pneumonia, and progressive clumsiness since beginning to walk. This presentation is not typical for Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, as it affects a female and includes progressive clumsiness, which is not a characteristic symptom.

B) A 10-month-old boy with recurrent viral infections and hypocalcemia during the neonatal period. While the patient is male, the presence of viral infections and hypocalcemia does not align well with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, which is characterized by bacterial infections.

C) A 4-year-old girl with repeated oral candidiasis. This presentation is not consistent with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, as it involves a fungal infection and affects a female.

D) A 9-month-old boy with recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia. This presentation matches the typical symptoms of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, including the age of onset, male gender, and types of infections.

E) A 7-month-old boy with recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, eczema, and easy bruising. While this patient is male and has pneumococcal pneumonia, the presence of eczema and easy bruising suggests a different condition, such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

1272,"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Social anxiety disorder
B) Avoidant personality disorder
C) Schizotypal personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Schizophrenia","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Behavioral Changes and Social Withdrawal**: The 19-year-old man has been exhibiting behavioral changes over the past three years, including dressing in all black and wearing a long black coat regardless of the weather. He has difficulties fitting in, lacks friends, and spends most of his time isolated in his room playing online games.

2. **Anxiety and Academic Performance**: He experiences anxiety in social settings, such as college, which affects his academic performance. Instead of focusing on his coursework, he is preoccupied with reading about paranormal phenomena, especially demons.

3. **Beliefs and Perceptions**: He believes in the presence of demons, interpreting certain events (like a breeze in an enclosed room) as signs of their presence, though he claims not to have seen any demons.

4. **Mental Status Examination**: The examination reveals laborious speech and avoidance of eye contact.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Social Anxiety Disorder**: While the patient does exhibit anxiety in social situations, his overall behavior and beliefs suggest a more complex issue than social anxiety alone.

- **B) Avoidant Personality Disorder**: This condition involves pervasive feelings of social inadequacy and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection. While the patient does avoid social interactions, his behavior and beliefs about demons suggest a different primary issue.

- **C) Schizotypal Personality Disorder**: This disorder is characterized by acute discomfort in close relationships, reduced ability to close relationships, and by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior. The patient's beliefs about demons, his social withdrawal, and his eccentric behavior (dressing in all black) align closely with this diagnosis.

- **D) Paranoid Personality Disorder**: This condition involves a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others. While the patient has unusual beliefs, there's no clear indication of pervasive distrust or suspiciousness towards others.

- **E) Schizophrenia**: This is a more severe disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms. While the patient has unusual beliefs, there's no clear evidence of hallucinations, disorganized thinking, or negative symptoms that are severe enough to meet the criteria for schizophrenia.

Options
A) HbA1c measurement
B) No tests required
C) Urinalysis
D) Oral glucose tolerance test
E) Random plasma glucose","The patient is a 22-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation who performed a dipstick test at home that showed 1+ glucose. She is concerned about this result, but her liquid consumption and urination frequency are not significantly different from before. The patient's pregnancy has been unremarkable, and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2, and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. Her vital signs are normal, and the physical examination is unremarkable. The laboratory tests show normal fasting glucose, liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and plasma creatinine.

Given the patient's normal fasting glucose level and the absence of any symptoms or significant medical history, the 1+ glucose on the dipstick test may be a false positive or a transient finding. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. Since the patient is only at 16 weeks gestation, it is not yet time for the routine screening for GDM.

Considering the patient's normal fasting glucose and the lack of any symptoms or risk factors, no further testing is required at this time. The patient should be reassured and continue with routine prenatal care.

E) Aortic valve stenosis","The patient is a 75-year-old man presenting with progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month. He has difficulty climbing more than one flight of stairs without experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness. His medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and he has a significant smoking history of one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. His physical examination shows weak peripheral pulses, which is a key finding.

Considering his age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic valve stenosis. Aortic valve stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve opening, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. The weak peripheral pulses are consistent with this diagnosis, as the narrowed valve opening can reduce blood flow to the peripheral arteries.

Other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings. Aortic valve regurgitation (option A) typically presents with signs of volume overload, such as a widened pulse pressure, which is not present in this patient. Tricuspid valve stenosis (option B) is a rare condition that typically presents with signs of right-sided heart failure, such as jugular venous distension and peripheral edema, which are not present in this patient. Mitral valve prolapse (option C) is a condition that typically presents with a mid-systolic click and a late systolic murmur, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.
