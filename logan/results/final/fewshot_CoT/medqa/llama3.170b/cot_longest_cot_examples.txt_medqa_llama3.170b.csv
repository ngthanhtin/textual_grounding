A medical student is examining the table in the abstract. She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?""
""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

A) It indicates an increased likelihood of bias
B) It indicates decreased external validity
C) It indicates a lack of statistical significance
D) It reflects a smaller sample size
E) It indicates more narrow confidence intervals","The increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is likely due to the smaller sample size in this group compared to the other two groups. As shown in the text, the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group had 202 participants at 12-month follow-up, whereas the pulmharkimab 75 mg/day group had 388 participants and the placebo group had 395 participants. A smaller sample size typically results in larger standard errors, as there is less data to estimate the population parameter. This is because standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size.

A) Pearson correlation analysis
B) Chi-square test
C) Analysis of variance
D) Meta-analysis
E) Kaplan-Meier analysis","To determine if the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up are statistically significant, we need to consider the type of data and the number of groups being compared.

In this case, we have quantitative data (changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores) and three groups (pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, and placebo). We want to compare the means of these groups to determine if there are any significant differences.

The most appropriate statistical method for this scenario is Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is a statistical technique used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if there are any significant differences between them. It is commonly used in randomized controlled trials, like the one described in the study, to compare the outcomes of different treatment groups.

ANOVA will allow the researcher to determine if there are any significant differences in the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores between the three groups, while controlling for any potential confounding variables.

1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.","To answer this question, we need to understand what a type 1 error is and how it relates to the study.

A type 1 error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected in error. In other words, it is the probability of obtaining a false positive result. This type of error is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (α) and is typically set at 0.05, meaning that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

Given this definition, let's examine the options:

A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups. - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is related to the rejection of a true null hypothesis, not the power of the study.

B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. - This statement is correct. A type 1 error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected, which is exactly what this option states.

C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. - This statement is incorrect. This describes a type 2 error, not a type 1 error.

D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. - This statement is incorrect. A type 1 error is related to the alpha (α) level, not the beta (β) level.

E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study. - This statement is incorrect. While confidence intervals are related to hypothesis testing, a type 1 error is specifically related to the rejection of a true null hypothesis.

Answer: {B}"
906,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
A) Measurement bias
B) Recall bias
C) Lead-time bias
D) Selection bias
E) Length-time bias","To answer this question, let's first define the types of biases mentioned in the options:

A) Measurement bias: This occurs when there is an error in the measurement or classification of the study participants, which can lead to incorrect conclusions.

B) Recall bias: This type of bias occurs when participants' memories of past events influence their responses to survey questions, potentially leading to inaccurate information.

C) Lead-time bias: This bias arises when a screening test appears to prolong survival or improve outcomes simply because it detects the disease earlier, rather than actually changing the natural course of the disease.

D) Selection bias: This type of bias occurs when the sample collected is not representative of the population intended to be analyzed, often due to the selection process.

E) Length-time bias: This bias occurs when a screening test is more likely to detect slow-growing or less aggressive diseases, making it seem more effective than it actually is.

Given the scenario, if the conclusion stated above was due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, it would exemplify lead-time bias. This is because the apparent benefit of earlier detection using point-of-care ultrasound might simply be due to the detection of the disease at an earlier stage, rather than actually changing the outcome or improving the prognosis.

1172,"A 67-year-old man is brought to the hospital by his relatives. He complains of early satiety, abdominal discomfort after food intake, and abdominal bloating. These symptoms have been present since the patient was 52, but they were milder at that time so he paid little attention to them since. Tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities began a few months ago. His relatives also note that he has become excessively somnolent and forgetful. The patient’s medical history is significant for acute hepatitis B 20 years ago. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. His weight is 61 kg (134.5 lb), height is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in), and BMI is 18.6 kg/m2. His vital signs include: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F). The patient’s skin is pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic. Lymph nodes and the thyroid gland are not enlarged. Lung and heart examinations are within normal limits for his age. The patient’s tongue is bright red with atrophic papillae. The abdomen is distended and tender to palpation in the epigastric area. Neurological examination shows symmetrical bilateral distal hypoesthesia for all sensations and decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities. On a mini-mental status examination, the patient scores 25. The patient’s blood test results are as follows:
Erythrocytes 2.8 x 109/mm3
Hb 8.6 g/dL
Ht 37%
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin  49.9 pg/cell (3.1 fmol/cell)
Mean corpuscular volume 142 µm3 (142 fL)
Reticulocyte count 0.3%
Total leukocyte count 3,070/mm3
Neutrophils 54%
Lymphocyte 32%
Eosinophil 3%
Monocyte 11%
Basophil 0%

Amylase 32 U/L
Total bilirubin 32 µmol/L (1.87 mg/dL)
Conjugated bilirubin 8 µmol/L (0.4677 mg/L)
Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?
A) Chronic bilirubin toxicity
B) Chronic hyperglycemia
C) Chronic acetaldehyde influence
D) Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids
E) Influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters","The patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including somnolence, forgetfulness, distal hypoesthesia, and decreased muscle strength, are likely related to his malabsorption and malnutrition issues. The patient's history of abdominal discomfort, bloating, and early satiety, along with his low BMI and pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic skin, suggests a chronic gastrointestinal issue. The patient's laboratory results show macrocytic anemia, with a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and low reticulocyte count, indicating impaired erythropoiesis.

Given these findings, the patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms are most likely due to impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids, which is a consequence of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the synthesis of myelin, the fatty substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to demyelination and impaired nerve function, resulting in neurological and psychiatric symptoms.

The patient's history of acute hepatitis B 20 years ago and his current symptoms suggest that he may have developed liver cirrhosis, which can lead to impaired vitamin B12 absorption. Additionally, the patient's low HbA1C and fasting plasma glucose levels rule out chronic hyperglycemia as a cause of his symptoms.

658,"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm.

Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?
A) Begin aspirin therapy
B) Begin clopidogrel
C) Carotid endarterectomy
D) Begin warfarin and heparin
E) Begin warfarin","To determine the most appropriate intervention to prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient, we need to consider his medical history and current presentation. The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, which was treated with intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). He has also been experiencing episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks, with the most recent episode lasting 2 days. His physical examination and noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan show no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction.

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) is not provided, but based on the description of the cardiac examination showing a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm, it is likely that the patient has atrial fibrillation (AF). Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke, particularly in patients with a history of ischemic stroke.

Given the patient's history of ischemic stroke and new-onset atrial fibrillation, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs is to begin anticoagulation therapy. Among the options provided, beginning warfarin (option E) is the most appropriate choice. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Aspirin (option A) and clopidogrel (option B) are antiplatelet agents that may be used to prevent stroke in certain patients, but they are not as effective as anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. Carotid endarterectomy (option C) is a surgical procedure that may be used to prevent stroke in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis, but it is not indicated in this patient. Beginning warfarin and heparin (option D) may be considered in certain patients, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case.

73,"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.

Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?
A) Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen
B) Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen
C) Liver transplantation
D) Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone
E) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting","Analyzing the situation, the 56-year-old man presents with worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain, accompanied by a history of alcohol use disorder, acute pancreatitis, and cirrhosis. His physical examination reveals scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness, which are indicative of liver disease. The ascitic fluid analysis shows a high polymorphonuclear cell count and a culture positive for Escherichia coli, suggesting spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is treated with intravenous cefotaxime and albumin, which is appropriate for SBP.

However, on hospital day 2, the patient becomes oliguric, and laboratory testing reveals an elevated creatinine level and a low urine sodium level. These findings suggest the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a type of kidney dysfunction that can occur in patients with advanced liver disease.

Considering the treatment options for HRS, liver transplantation is the most effective treatment, as it addresses the underlying liver disease causing the kidney dysfunction. The other options are not directly addressing the HRS or are not suitable for this patient's condition.

E) Due to mutations in dynein, the ciliary epithelium fails to provide appropriate mucociliary clearance.","The 4-month-old boy presents with fever, dyspnea, and cough, which he developed 3 days ago, along with poor weight gain despite a good appetite and frequent stools with an unpleasant smell over the past 2 months. The patient's clinical presentation, including the respiratory symptoms and the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture, is suggestive of a chronic respiratory infection. The elevated chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L in the sweat test is a key diagnostic finding, as it is indicative of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a chloride channel. The abnormal CFTR protein disrupts the normal functioning of chloride transport across epithelial membranes, leading to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and traps bacteria, resulting in recurrent respiratory infections. The symptoms and laboratory findings in this patient are consistent with the pathogenesis of Cystic Fibrosis, which involves the abnormal CFTR protein.

E) Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles","To determine the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Characteristics of the Headache**: The headache is described as intermittent, throbbing, bilateral, and ""band-like,"" extending to the neck. It's not accompanied by typical migraine features such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. The pain is worsened by coughing or laughing but not by movement, which suggests a possible link to increased intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation.

2. **Temporal Relationship with Other Symptoms**: The headache started approximately 3 weeks ago, around the same time the patient experienced a runny nose and a temperature elevation, suggesting a possible link to an acute illness. However, the description does not strongly support a direct connection between the headache and a paranasal sinus issue, given the absence of pain on palpation of the paranasal sinuses.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The accentuation of S2 heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border might indicate some degree of pulmonary hypertension or a cardiac issue, but it does not directly relate to the headache mechanism. The absence of focal neurological symptoms, pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, or meningeal symptoms helps to rule out certain specific causes like a chronic subdural hematoma or an intracranial neoplasm.

4. **Medications and Medical History**: The patient's medications include aspirin, rosuvastatin, lisinopril, and isosorbide mononitrate, which are used for managing hypertension and stable angina. None of these medications are commonly associated with causing headaches as a side effect in a manner that matches the patient's presentation.

Considering these points, the description of the headache as being worse with coughing or laughing and its onset following an acute illness, without strong evidence supporting other mechanisms like meningitis, neoplasm, or vascular dissection, suggests that the most plausible explanation is related to increased intracranial pressure or meningeal irritation. However, the specific options provided do not perfectly match the analysis, but the closest explanation related to increased intracranial pressure or irritation without direct evidence of blood products, neoplasm, or vascular dissection would be related to the dilation of intracerebral arterioles, which can be a response to various stimuli including possibly the patient's acute illness or other factors not directly identified in the scenario.

449,"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 
A) Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound
B) Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months
C) Elective endovascular repair
D) Elective open surgical repair
E) Emergency open surgical repair","To determine the best course of treatment for this patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), it's essential to consider the size of the aneurysm, the patient's symptoms, and their overall health status. The patient presents with a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm) and is experiencing symptoms such as abdominal pain and bruising on his feet, which could be indicative of embolic events. However, the absence of severe abdominal pain or signs of rupture suggests that the aneurysm is not currently acutely unstable.

For small AAAs (less than 4 cm in diameter), the general recommendation is surveillance with regular ultrasound checks. However, given that this patient's aneurysm is just above the 4 cm threshold and the patient is symptomatic, a more aggressive approach may be warranted.

Option A (discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound) and Option B (discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months) are typically reserved for smaller aneurysms without symptoms. Given the patient's symptoms and the size of the aneurysm, these options might not be the most appropriate.

Option E (emergency open surgical repair) is generally reserved for ruptured AAAs or those that are imminently about to rupture, which does not seem to be the case here based on the provided information.

Between Options C (elective endovascular repair) and D (elective open surgical repair), endovascular repair is often preferred for its lower immediate morbidity and mortality rates compared to open repair, especially in patients with significant comorbidities. However, the decision between these two options should be based on the patient's anatomy, overall health, and the expertise available.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the size of the aneurysm, and in the absence of information that would necessitate immediate open repair or contraindicate endovascular repair, the best course of treatment seems to be elective endovascular repair.

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?
A) Yeasts metabolize glucogenic amino acids which are filtered in the urine into glucose
B) There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules
C) Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules
D) There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules
E) Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate","To determine the cause of the patient's glucosuria, let's break down the information provided and analyze the possible causes.

The patient has a history of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss in both eyes, along with a physical examination that shows dry skin, a pustular rash, and an accentuated second heart sound. The fundoscopic examination reveals small red dots in the superficial retinal layers suggestive of microaneurysms. The HbA1c is 9%, which is elevated, indicating poor glucose control.

The urinalysis shows glucosuria (glucose in the urine) with a concentration of 199 mg/dl. The presence of glucose in the urine is typically associated with diabetes mellitus, as the body is unable to properly regulate blood glucose levels.

Now, let's evaluate the possible causes of glucosuria:

A) Yeasts metabolize glucogenic amino acids which are filtered in the urine into glucose: This option is not directly related to the patient's diabetes mellitus and is not a common cause of glucosuria.

B) There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules: Primary active transport is not the primary mechanism for glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules.

C) Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules: This option is the most likely cause of glucosuria in this patient. In diabetes mellitus, the high blood glucose levels overwhelm the secondary active transporters in the renal tubules, leading to incomplete reabsorption of glucose and resulting in glucosuria.

D) There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules: Passive transport is not the primary mechanism for glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules.

E) Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate: While an increased glomerular filtration rate can contribute to glucosuria, it is not the primary cause in this patient.

549,"A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm × 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?
A) Stop antiretroviral therapy and continue antitubercular therapy
B) Change antiretroviral therapy to darunavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine
C) Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin
D) Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-ethambutol-streptomycin
E) Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change","The patient is a 24-year-old man with a history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss, diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He is also HIV-positive with a low CD4+ T cell count and high HIV RNA. He was started on a 4-drug antitubercular regimen and later added antiretroviral therapy. However, after initiating antiretroviral therapy, the patient presents with fever, increased cough, generalized lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

The clinical presentation and laboratory findings, particularly the significant increase in CD4+ T cell count and decrease in HIV RNA, suggest an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is a common complication in HIV-infected individuals who start antiretroviral therapy, especially those with a low CD4+ T cell count. It is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response to a previously acquired opportunistic infection, in this case, tuberculosis.

The most appropriate initial step in treatment is to continue both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change. Stopping or changing antiretroviral therapy is not recommended, as it may lead to further immunosuppression and worsening of the condition. Similarly, changing antitubercular therapy is not necessary, as the patient was previously responding well to the treatment. Instead, the focus should be on managing the symptoms of IRIS, such as fever and cough, and monitoring the patient closely for any signs of improvement or deterioration.

304,"A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Hypothalamic amenorrhea
B) Hyperprolactinemia
C) Imperforate hymen
D) Vaginal septum
E) Normal development","Let's break down the information provided to arrive at the most likely diagnosis.

The patient is a 16-year-old female who has never experienced menstruation but has undergone normal breast development (Tanner IV) and has Tanner IV axillary and pubic hair growth. She is a competitive ice skater, which might initially suggest a diagnosis of hypothalamic amenorrhea due to intense exercise. However, her body mass index (BMI) is within the normal range (23.8 kg/m^2), which does not strongly support this diagnosis.

The patient's mother and sister have a history of migraine headaches and bipolar disorder, respectively, but these conditions do not directly influence the patient's menstrual status. The patient's own history of headaches with photosensitivity and nausea relieved by ibuprofen might suggest migraines, but this is not directly relevant to her amenorrhea.

Laboratory studies show normal electrolytes, urea nitrogen, glucose, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, AST, and ALT levels. Importantly, her FSH and estrogen levels are within normal ranges, indicating that her ovaries are functioning and producing estrogen, which is consistent with her normal breast and pubic hair development.

The abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries, which rules out anatomical abnormalities such as a vaginal septum or imperforate hymen that could cause amenorrhea.

Given the normal laboratory findings, normal ultrasound results, and the absence of any clear secondary cause for her amenorrhea (such as polycystic ovary syndrome, thyroid dysfunction, or hyperprolactinemia), the most likely diagnosis is that the patient is simply experiencing a delay in menarche. Her family history of late menarche (mother and sister both started menstruating at age 15) supports this possibility.

400,"A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, and profuse sweating. He also complains of a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months. He is a bodybuilding competitor and has a competition coming up in 1 week. The man reports that his symptoms appeared suddenly, 30 minutes after he took 2 foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills instead of the 1 he usually takes. His blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 137/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, and temperature is 39.9°C (103.8°F). Physical examination reveals a reddish maculopapular rash over the patient’s trunk, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in his abdomen, and rotational bilateral nystagmus with an alternating gaze-dependent fast component. Ophthalmologic examination shows bilateral cataracts. The patient’s total blood count is as follows:
Erythrocytes 4.4 x 109/mm3
Hb 12 g/dL
Total leukocyte count  3750/mm3
Neutrophils 57%

Which of the following statements best describes the pathogenesis of this patient’s condition?
A) The patient’s symptoms are caused by an increased concentration of epinephrine released by the adrenal glands in response to the consumed substance.
B) The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.
C) The patient has a pyretic reaction due to bacterial contamination of the pills.
D) The patient’s condition is due to a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction triggered by the drug.
E) The drug has stimulated the hypothalamic temperature center to produce hyperthermia.","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and lab results:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, profuse sweating, and a gradual decrease in vision. These symptoms appeared suddenly after taking foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: Notable findings include a reddish maculopapular rash, diminished lung and heart sounds, abdominal tenderness, rotational bilateral nystagmus, and bilateral cataracts.

3. **Lab Results**: The patient has a normal erythrocyte count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count but a slightly low total leukocyte count with a relatively normal differential count.

Given these details, the patient's condition seems to be related to the ingestion of the fat-burning pills. The sudden onset of systemic symptoms, including fever, tachypnea, and a rash, along with the specific findings of bilateral cataracts and nystagmus, points towards a toxic or metabolic cause rather than an infectious or allergic reaction.

The key to this question is understanding the pathogenesis related to the consumption of certain substances that can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. The description of the patient's symptoms and the specific findings are consistent with a condition caused by a substance that can uncouple oxidative phosphorylation from the electron transport chain. This process leads to an increase in heat production without generating ATP, resulting in the systemic symptoms observed.

Considering the options provided:

- **A** refers to an increased concentration of epinephrine, which could explain some symptoms but not the full spectrum or the specific findings like cataracts and nystagmus.
- **B** describes the uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, which aligns with the systemic symptoms and specific findings like cataracts and is consistent with the ingestion of certain substances known to cause this effect.
- **C** suggests a pyretic reaction due to bacterial contamination, which does not fit with the sudden onset after ingestion of a specific substance or the specific physical examination findings.
- **D** mentions a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, which would typically present with different symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, and possibly anaphylaxis.
- **E** proposes stimulation of the hypothalamic temperature center, which is a possible mechanism for hyperthermia but does not account for the full spectrum of symptoms or the specific findings.

1266,"A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to her primary care doctor by her son who is concerned about the patient's ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Alzheimer dementia
B) Delirium
C) Lewy body dementia
D) Normal pressure hydrocephalus
E) Pseudodementia","To determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient, let's analyze the key points from the history and physical examination:

1. **History of gradual decline in managing activities of daily living**: The patient has shown a decline in managing her daily activities, such as keeping her house organized and participating in social activities. This suggests a progressive condition.

2. **Cognitive decline**: The patient is disoriented to place and situation, does not recognize her doctor, and has poor short-term memory (recalling 0/3 words after 5 minutes). These are indicators of cognitive impairment.

3. **Urinary urgency and incontinence**: The patient has experienced increased urinary urgency and episodes of incontinence, which could be indicative of a neurological condition affecting bladder control.

4. **Gait disturbance**: The patient feels like her balance is getting worse, although she has not fallen. This suggests a problem with motor control or balance.

5. **Low-frequency tremor**: The presence of a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that worsens with deliberate movement could indicate a neurological disorder.

Considering these points, the patient's symptoms seem to align most closely with **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)**. NPH is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, dementia (or cognitive decline), and urinary incontinence, which matches the patient's presentation. NPH is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure, but without the typical signs of elevated pressure.

While Alzheimer's dementia (A) and Lewy body dementia (C) could explain some cognitive decline, they do not fully account for the gait disturbance and urinary incontinence. Delirium (B) is typically an acute condition with fluctuating symptoms, which doesn't fit the patient's gradual decline. Pseudodementia (E) is a condition where depression mimics dementia, but the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a neurological condition.

265,"A 45-year-old man arrives by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a very severe construction accident. The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?
A) Diffuse alveolar damage
B) Ventricular septal defect
C) Myocardial free wall rupture
D) Papillary muscle rupture
E) Myocardial reinfarction","The patient's presentation with oxygen desaturation to 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen, along with the presence of crackles on auscultation and a chest x-ray showing findings consistent with pulmonary edema, suggests Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, the key findings that point towards the direct cause of death are the hemodynamic readings from the Swan-Ganz catheter, which show a low central venous pressure (CVP) and a high right ventricular pressure (RVP) and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) with a low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). These findings are indicative of acute right ventricular failure, which can occur due to various causes including pulmonary embolism or acute cor pulmonale. However, given the patient's recent severe trauma, surgery, and the development of ARDS, the most likely direct cause of death is acute right ventricular failure secondary to ARDS, which is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage.

B) Hepatitis C virus antibodies
C) JAK-2 mutation
D) Peripheral blood flow cytometry
E) Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 65-year-old man with a history of HIV, non-compliance with antiretroviral medication, and a 20-pack-year smoking history, presents with painless swelling of the neck, intermittent fevers, severe night sweats, and unintentional weight loss. Physical examination reveals multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes, axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Laboratory studies show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase.

Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory findings, a lymphoproliferative disorder is suspected. The excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node confirms the diagnosis, but the specific type of lymphoma needs to be determined.

Peripheral blood flow cytometry (D) is a crucial diagnostic step in the workup of lymphoproliferative disorders, as it helps to identify the specific type of lymphoma by analyzing the immunophenotype of the lymphocytes. This information is essential for guiding treatment decisions and predicting prognosis.

The other options are not directly relevant to the diagnosis of lymphoma:

A) Antinuclear antibody is used to diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.

B) Hepatitis C virus antibodies are used to diagnose hepatitis C infection, which can be associated with lymphoma, but is not directly relevant to the diagnosis of lymphoma.

C) JAK-2 mutation is used to diagnose myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as polycythemia vera.

E) Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is used to diagnose hairy cell leukemia, a specific type of lymphoma, but is not a general diagnostic step for lymphoproliferative disorders.

He describes himself as being “generally healthy” before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 12.9 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 9,300/mm3
Platelet count 167,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm/hr
Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine Positive
Acid-fast stain Negative
 Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Histoplasmosis
B) Mycetoma
C) Blastomycosis
D) Valley fever
E) Chromomycosis","Analyzing the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can narrow down the diagnosis. The patient presents with chronic cough, aching joints, and malaise, which are non-specific symptoms that could be indicative of various conditions. However, the key findings in this case are the results of the lung biopsy and laboratory tests.

The lung biopsy reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues. These findings are characteristic of a fungal infection. The laboratory tests also support this diagnosis, with positive results for Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine stains, which are used to detect fungal elements.

Given the patient's history of a hiking trip in the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, and the presence of spherules with endospores in the lung biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is Valley fever (also known as coccidioidomycosis). Valley fever is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii, which are commonly found in the soil of the southwestern United States.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* Histoplasmosis (A) typically presents with smaller, budding yeast forms, not spherules with endospores.
* Mycetoma (B) is a chronic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, not typically involving the lungs.
* Blastomycosis (C) typically presents with broad-based budding yeast forms, not spherules with endospores.
* Chromomycosis (E) is a superficial fungal infection of the skin, not typically involving the lungs.

747,"A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely inciting factor for this patient’s condition?
A) Decreased carbohydrate intake
B) Increased tryptophan intake
C) Medication change
D) Surreptitious diuretic abuse
E) Surreptitious opiate abuse","The patient's presentation of fever, worsening malaise, diaphoresis, increased reflexes, clonus, and increased muscle tone suggests serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive levels of serotonin in the body. The patient's medication history reveals that she has been taking citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), for 6 months. However, the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is not the citalopram itself, but rather the recent addition of an amino acid supplement, which may contain tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted into serotonin in the body. The combination of citalopram and tryptophan can lead to excessive serotonin levels, causing serotonin syndrome.

867,"An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient’s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?
A) Child abuse
B) Insufficient production of procollagen type 1
C) Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1
D) Defective collagen type 3
E) Dysfunctional structure of laminins","The 11-month-old male infant's presentation of an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis after a minor trauma, along with blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities, is highly suggestive of a genetic disorder affecting collagen production. Among the options provided, choice B describes insufficient production of procollagen type 1, which is characteristic of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). OI is a genetic disorder that affects the production of collagen, leading to fragile bones, blue sclerae, and joint hypermobility. The patient's symptoms and X-ray findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

159,"A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Na+ 138 mEq/L
K+ 4.2 mEq/L
Cl- 102 mEq/L
HCO3- 25 mEq/L
Mg2+ 1.7 mEq/L

Aspartate aminotransferase, serum 15 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase, serum 42 U/L
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?""
A) Obtain abdominal CT
B) Observation only
C) Begin rehydration therapy
D) Administer calcium gluconate
E) Supplementation with vitamin D","The patient presents with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea, which are nonspecific symptoms that could be related to various conditions. However, the presence of progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping, along with the observation of hand spasm during blood pressure measurement, suggests a specific diagnosis. The patient's recent history of total thyroidectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery is also relevant.

The laboratory results show a low magnesium level (1.7 mEq/L), which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of muscle cramping and numbness. Hypomagnesemia can cause neuromuscular excitability, leading to muscle cramps, spasms, and numbness.

Given the patient's recent surgeries, hypomagnesemia is likely due to malabsorption or inadequate supplementation. The patient's serum phosphorus level is also slightly elevated, which can be seen in hypomagnesemia.

The most appropriate initial step in managing this patient is to correct the hypomagnesemia. Administering calcium gluconate would not address the underlying issue and could potentially worsen the patient's condition. Rehydration therapy may be helpful, but it is not the primary concern. Observation only is not appropriate, given the patient's symptoms. Supplementation with vitamin D may be necessary, but it is not the immediate priority.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient is to administer magnesium to correct the hypomagnesemia.

683,"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?
A) Isoniazid
B) Fluconazole
C) Caspofungin
D) Prednisone
E) Surgical resection of the infiltrates","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma who presents with worsening shortness of breath, lung function deterioration, and recurrent episodes of pneumonia. She experiences coughing and wheezing episodes with greenish sputum containing specks of red, fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. Physical examination reveals inspiratory crackles, coarse breath sounds, and atelectasis in the right lung base with ""glove-finger shadows"" on chest radiograph. Elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are also noted.

Considering the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and radiographic features, the most likely diagnosis is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus species. ABPA is a known complication in patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis.

The ""glove-finger shadows"" on the chest radiograph are characteristic of ABPA, representing bronchiectasis with impacted mucus and fungal elements. The elevated IgE levels further support this diagnosis.

Given the diagnosis of ABPA, the most appropriate therapy would be to reduce inflammation and manage the allergic response. Among the options provided, prednisone, a corticosteroid, is the most suitable choice for managing ABPA. Corticosteroids are effective in reducing inflammation, improving symptoms, and preventing further lung damage.

510,"An 81-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his son to be evaluated for memory issues. The patient’s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Alzheimer's disease
B) Frontotemporal dementia
C) Lewy body dementia
D) Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
E) Vascular dementia","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Progressive memory issues**: The patient's son reports that the patient has difficulty remembering recent events and names, which have progressively worsened over several years. This suggests a chronic condition affecting cognitive function.

2. **Acute worsening**: There was an acute worsening of symptoms, which might indicate a new or superimposed condition.

3. **Visual disturbance**: The patient reported an inability to see out of his right eye, which resolved within a day. This transient visual disturbance could be indicative of a vascular event.

4. **Lack of insight**: The patient seems to have no insight into his problem, which is common in various forms of dementia.

5. **Medical history**: Significant for diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago, and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. This history of cerebrovascular events is crucial.

6. **Physical examination findings**: The patient has hemiparesis (muscle weakness on one side of the body), reduced tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side, consistent with his history of a right middle cerebral artery infarction.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is **vascular dementia**. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often as a result of a series of small strokes or changes in the brain's blood supply. The patient's history of cerebrovascular events (a left basal ganglia hemorrhage and a right middle cerebral artery infarction) supports this diagnosis. The acute worsening of symptoms could be due to another vascular event.

The other options are less likely:
- **Alzheimer's disease** typically presents with a more gradual decline in cognitive function without the clear history of vascular events.
- **Frontotemporal dementia** often presents with significant changes in personality, behavior, or language, which are not highlighted in this case.
- **Lewy body dementia** is characterized by visual hallucinations, fluctuations in cognitive function, and Parkinsonian motor symptoms, which are not described.
- **Normal-pressure hydrocephalus** presents with the triad of dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence, which does not fit this patient's profile.

460,"A 14-year-old obese boy presents with severe right hip and knee pain. The patient says that he has been limping with mild pain for the past three weeks, but the pain acutely worsened today. He describes the pain as severe, non-radiating, sharp and aching in character, and localized to the right hip and knee joints. The patient denies recent illness, travel, trauma, or similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history and no current medications. The patient is not sexually active and denies any alcohol, smoking or drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The right leg is externally rotated, and there is a limited range of motion in the right hip. Strength is 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. There is no tenderness to palpation. No joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?
A) Reassess in 3 months
B) Immobilize the right knee with conservative treatment (i.e. rest, ice)
C) Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint
D) Pavlik harness
E) Surgical pinning of the right hip","Considering the 14-year-old obese boy's presentation with severe right hip and knee pain that acutely worsened, along with physical examination findings of an externally rotated right leg, limited range of motion in the right hip, and strength of 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint, the diagnosis is highly suggestive of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). This condition is more common in obese adolescents and is characterized by displacement of the femoral head from the femoral neck. The plain radiographs of the right hip joint showing displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck confirm this diagnosis. Given the severity of the displacement and the potential for complications such as avascular necrosis, the most appropriate course of treatment is surgical intervention to stabilize the femoral head and prevent further complications. Therefore, the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient is surgical pinning of the right hip.

578,"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?
A) Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%
B) Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation
C) Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle
D) Abnormal left ventricular relaxation
E) Decreased right atrial pressure","The patient's presentation of leg swelling, right upper abdominal tenderness, fatigue, and syncope, along with a history of myocardial infarction, suggests that he may be experiencing heart failure. The physical examination findings of jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, and ascites further support this diagnosis. The cardiac auscultation findings of a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space are also consistent with heart failure.

Given these findings, the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram would be a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 41%, which is below the normal range of 55-70%. This would indicate that the patient has systolic heart failure, which is characterized by a reduced ability of the left ventricle to pump blood effectively.

C) Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
D) Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
E) Percutaneous cholecystostomy","Considering the patient's worsening condition, despite initial treatment with intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, the most likely cause of her symptoms is an obstructive jaundice due to gallstones. The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder support this diagnosis. The patient's clinical deterioration, including a high fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, suggests a possible ascending cholangitis, which is a serious infection that requires prompt intervention.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is a procedure that allows for the visualization of the bile ducts and the removal of any obstruction, such as gallstones, that may be causing the patient's symptoms. It is also a therapeutic option that can be performed urgently, which is necessary given the patient's critical condition.

He mentions that he has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain at the same location over the last 3 months and that these episodes usually occur after a heavy meal and subside within 1 or 2 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. On examination of the abdomen, tenderness is present over the right upper quadrant; palpation over the area produces an inspiratory pause. An urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct stone, but no stone in the common bile duct or in the gallbladder. Laboratory results show the following:

D) Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ECRP)
E) Cholecystotomy","The patient presents with symptoms of biliary colic and signs of inflammation, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and localized tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The presence of a dilated common bile duct without a visible stone suggests that the stone may have passed into the intestine or is currently impacted in the ampulla of Vater. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results are consistent with ascending cholangitis, a serious infection that requires prompt treatment.

Given the patient's severe symptoms and signs of infection, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to clear the bile duct of any remaining stones and to ensure that the bile duct is patent. This procedure will help to alleviate the obstruction and allow for the resolution of the infection.

Medical management, including antibiotics and supportive care, should be initiated concurrently with the ERCP to address the infection and manage the patient's symptoms. Elective cholecystectomy may be considered after the patient has recovered from the acute episode, but it is not the immediate priority.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is urgent ERCP.

1246,"A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 2-month history of a non-productive cough and fatigue. During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?""
A) Bronchial adenocarcinoma
B) Mesothelioma
C) Nephrotic syndrome
D) Tuberculosis
E) Congestive heart failure","The patient presents with a 2-month history of non-productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath. The chest x-ray shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. The analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows an exudative effusion, as indicated by the high protein level and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level.

The patient's history of smoking and working as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years increases her risk for lung cancer and mesothelioma, respectively. However, the presence of nodular pleural lesions and an exudative effusion with high LDH levels is more suggestive of mesothelioma.

Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, abdomen, or heart. It is often associated with asbestos exposure, which is common in textile factories. The patient's symptoms and pleural fluid analysis are consistent with mesothelioma.

Bronchial adenocarcinoma (A) is a type of lung cancer, but it is less likely to cause nodular pleural lesions and an exudative effusion with high LDH levels. Nephrotic syndrome (C) is a kidney disorder that can cause a transudative effusion, which is not consistent with the patient's pleural fluid analysis. Tuberculosis (D) can cause a pleural effusion, but it is typically associated with a lymphocytic predominant pleural fluid and a lower LDH level. Congestive heart failure (E) can cause a transudative effusion, but it is not consistent with the patient's pleural fluid analysis.

389,"An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

E) Switch to hydrolyzed formula","The patient is an 8-week-old male who has been experiencing regurgitation of breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds, which seems to be causing his mother concern about his nutritional requirements. However, the patient's growth percentiles have only slightly decreased, and he appears to be developing normally, as evidenced by his ability to lift his head and shoulders off the examination table and smile reciprocally with his mother. The patient's symptoms are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), which is a common condition in infants. The fact that limiting the volume of each feed has reduced the frequency of the regurgitation suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to feeding volume.

In this case, the best next step in management would be to provide reassurance and counseling on positioning to the patient's mother. This can include recommendations such as keeping the patient upright after feeds, avoiding overfeeding, and using a wedge pillow to elevate the head of the bed. These measures can help to reduce the frequency and severity of the regurgitation episodes.

Additionally, it is essential to educate the patient's mother on the difference between gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GER is a normal condition in infants, whereas GERD is a more severe condition that requires medical attention. The patient's symptoms do not appear to be severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of GERD, and therefore, initiation of proton pump inhibitors or other medications is not necessary at this time.

The other options are not the best next step in management. Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound (option B) is not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with GER, and there is no indication of any underlying anatomical abnormalities. Recommending modification of the mother's diet (option D) is also not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are related to feeding volume and not to any specific food allergens. Switching to hydrolyzed formula (option E) is also not necessary, as the patient is tolerating breastmilk and does not appear to have any signs of a food allergy.

759,"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, and mild intermittent abdominal pain that is not affected by eating. He reports that over the last 6 months he slept a lot more than usual and lost 14.9 kg (33 lbs) without trying to lose weight. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that is worse when he is working and in the yard. There is no significant family history. His long-standing male partner passed away 2 years ago in a fatal car accident. His blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 23/min, and the temperature is 38°C (100.5°F). On physical examination, he has pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. There is a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border. His head bobs with each heartbeat. There are small, painless, red macules on both palms. His spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. His laboratory results are shown below.
Hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 72 µm3
Platelet count 400,000/mm3
Leukocytes 6,000/mm3

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings?
A) Viridans streptococci
B) Treponema pallidum
C) Malignant colonic neoplasm
D) Collagen vascular disease
E) Group D streptococci","The patient presents with a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, mild intermittent abdominal pain, and significant weight loss, which are all indicative of a chronic illness. The presence of pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities, along with the laboratory results showing a low hemoglobin level, low mean corpuscular volume, and low serum iron and ferritin levels, suggest iron deficiency anemia. The high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, which is further supported by the head bobbing with each heartbeat, also known as De Musset's sign.

The most likely explanation for his cardiac findings is related to the underlying cause of his chronic illness and iron deficiency anemia. The presence of a neoplastic growth in the descending colon, as shown by colonoscopy with biopsy, suggests that the patient has colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer can cause iron deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss, and it can also increase the risk of developing non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), a condition characterized by the formation of sterile vegetations on the heart valves. These vegetations can cause valve dysfunction, including aortic regurgitation.

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is often associated with malignancies, including colorectal cancer. The small, painless, red macules on both palms, known as Janeway lesions, are also a common finding in NBTE.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings is the presence of a malignant colonic neoplasm, which has led to the development of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and subsequent aortic regurgitation.

The pain is partially relieved with food or over-the-counter antacids but worsens at night and several hours after eating. Additionally, he has a weight gain of 2 kg (4.4 lbs) during this period.

The physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, mild tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant, a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium, and a succussion splash heard with a stethoscope when the patient is rocked back and forth at the hips. These findings suggest gastric outlet obstruction.

The laboratory results show a positive test for occult blood in the stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as his family history of colon cancer, increase his risk for gastrointestinal malignancies.

Considering the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the underlying cause of his vomiting is most likely a neoplastic growth, specifically gastric cancer, which is causing gastric outlet obstruction.

Abdominal ultrasound shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""
A) Chronic inflammatory bowel disease
B) Obesity
C) Ibuprofen
D) History of abdominal surgery
E) Alcohol","To determine the most likely cause of this patient's condition, let's analyze the provided information. The patient is a 54-year-old man presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting, along with a history of not passing flatus since the day before his last bowel movement. He has a history of appendectomy, psoriasis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic back pain. He is also taking several medications, including ibuprofen daily.

The abdominal examination reveals a distended abdomen with frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds, and a digital rectal examination shows an empty rectum. Laboratory studies are mostly within normal limits, but the abdominal ultrasound shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel, which suggests an obstruction.

Considering the patient's history of abdominal surgery (appendectomy), the presence of well-healed laparoscopic scars, and the symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is related to his surgical history.

Adhesions from previous surgeries can cause small bowel obstruction, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings. Adhesions are bands of fibrous tissue that can form between organs or between an organ and the abdominal wall, potentially causing bowel obstruction.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is his history of abdominal surgery.

629,"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician to establish care. He recently moved to the area and has not been to a primary care physician for over 5 years. He has no history of serious illness, but has intermittent bilateral knee pain for which he takes 650 mg acetaminophen every other day. He is married with three children and is sexually active with his wife. During the past 10 years, he has unsuccessfully tried to lose weight. He has smoked one half pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. About 2–3 times per week he has 1–2 glasses of wine with dinner.

Transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these liver abnormalities?""
A) Autoimmune liver damage
B) Congestive hepatopathy
C) Insulin resistance
D) Acetaminophen use
E) Alcohol use","The patient is a 42-year-old man who presents with intermittent bilateral knee pain and has been taking 650 mg acetaminophen every other day. He has a history of unsuccessful weight loss attempts and has a BMI of 36.3 kg/m2, indicating obesity. His liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 92 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 144 U/L. The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin, and transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver.

The patient's laboratory results and imaging studies suggest a diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a condition characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver of individuals who consume little or no alcohol. It is often associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome.

The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hyperechoic liver on ultrasonography are consistent with NAFLD. The patient's obesity and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.3% also support this diagnosis. The patient's negative hepatitis B and C antibodies and normal antinuclear antibody titers make autoimmune liver damage less likely.

The patient's acetaminophen use is unlikely to be the cause of his liver abnormalities, as his liver enzymes are not significantly elevated to a level that would suggest acetaminophen toxicity. Additionally, the patient's alcohol use is not excessive, and his liver enzymes are not consistent with alcoholic liver disease.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's liver abnormalities is insulin resistance, which is a key feature of NAFLD.

423,"A 49-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and cough which she developed approx. 8 hours ago. 2 weeks ago she had a prophylactic ovariectomy because of a family history of ovarian cancer. She is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1 hypertension, but she does not take her antihypertensives because she is not concerned about her blood pressure. Also, she has a history of opioid abuse. She takes metformin 1000 mg and aspirin 81 mg. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 155/80 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 31/min, and temperature 37.9℃ (100.2℉). Blood saturation on room air is 89%. On examination, the patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral rales over the lower lobes. A cardiac examination is significant for S2 accentuation best heard in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border and S3 presence. There is no leg edema. Neurological examination is within normal limits. Arterial blood gases analysis shows the following results:
pH 7.49
PaO2 58 mm Hg
PaCO2 30 mm Hg
HCO3-  22 mEq/L
Based on the given data, which of the following could cause respiratory failure in this patient?
A) Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli
B) Ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons
C) Alveolar fibrosis
D) Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation
E) Decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction","To determine the cause of respiratory failure in this patient, let's analyze the provided information. The patient is a 49-year-old woman who underwent a prophylactic ovariectomy 2 weeks ago and has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 1 hypertension, and opioid abuse. She presents with progressive dyspnea and cough, which started approximately 8 hours ago. Her vital signs indicate tachypnea (respiratory rate 31/min), tachycardia (heart rate 101/min), and hypoxemia (blood saturation 89% on room air). The arterial blood gases analysis shows hypoxemia (PaO2 58 mm Hg), hypocapnia (PaCO2 30 mm Hg), and alkalosis (pH 7.49).

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest respiratory alkalosis, which can be caused by hyperventilation. The presence of S2 accentuation and S3 heart sound indicates pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli. This is consistent with option A, which states that increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli could cause respiratory failure in this patient.

Additionally, the patient's history of smoking (1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years) and recent surgery increase her risk for pulmonary embolism, which can also cause increased alveolar dead space.

Option B is unlikely, as there is no indication of neurological deficits or ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons. Option C is also unlikely, as there is no evidence of alveolar fibrosis. Option D is possible, given the patient's history of opioid abuse, but the timing of the symptoms and the absence of other signs of opioid overdose make it less likely. Option E is unlikely, as there is no evidence of bronchial obstruction.

914,"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?
A) Affinity maturation
B) Random assortment
C) Random nucleotide addition
D) VDJ recombination
E) Isotype switching","To approach this question, let's first identify the protein in question based on the clinical scenario and the experiment described. The patient presents with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including fever, dyspnea, productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain, along with focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe on chest radiograph. This presentation is suggestive of pneumonia.

Given the context of an immune response to lung infections and the involvement of neutrophils and macrophages, the protein of interest is likely related to the innate immune response or the early stages of the adaptive immune response. The experiment involves isolating a protein from the patient's serum, identifying its amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus, and then demonstrating its binding to a protein isolated from the cell surface of neutrophils and macrophages.

The process that the sequence typically undergoes in immunocompetent individuals can be inferred from the context of immune responses and the specific details of the experiment. The options provided relate to different aspects of the immune response, particularly antibody production and the development of immune cells.

- Affinity maturation (A) refers to the process by which activated B cells undergo rapid proliferation and differentiation in the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, leading to the selection of B cells with higher affinity for the antigen. This process involves somatic hypermutation and is crucial for the maturation of the immune response.

- Random assortment (B) is not a recognized term in the context of immunology or molecular biology as related to this scenario.

- Random nucleotide addition (C) is a process involved in the generation of antibody diversity, particularly in the junctional diversity of V(D)J recombination.

- VDJ recombination (D) is the process by which the V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged to form a functional variable region of an antibody or T-cell receptor. This process is crucial for generating the diversity of the immune system.

- Isotype switching (E) refers to the process by which activated B cells can change the class (or isotype) of the antibodies they produce. This allows for a more tailored immune response to different types of pathogens.

Considering the context of the experiment and the immune response to infection, the most relevant process among the options provided is VDJ recombination (D), as it is directly involved in the generation of the immune receptors (antibodies and T-cell receptors) that recognize pathogens.

608,"A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following?
A) The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population
B) The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group
C) The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population
D) The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths
E) The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year","To determine the primary measure used in this study, let's break down the information provided and the options available.

The study conducted by the Italian researchers aimed to investigate mortality rates among patients with psychiatric diagnoses managed in a community-based setting. They calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare the mortality rates of their study population to that of the general population.

Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) are a statistical measure used in epidemiology to compare the mortality rates of different populations. The SMR is calculated by dividing the number of deaths that actually occurred in a population (observed deaths) by the number of deaths that would have been expected, based on a standard or reference population (expected deaths).

Given this definition, let's examine the options:

A) The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population - This describes a crude death rate, not an SMR.

B) The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group - This is a description of an age-specific death rate, not an SMR.

C) The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population - This option is close but is actually the inverse of how SMR is calculated.

D) The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths - This accurately describes the calculation of a standardized mortality ratio (SMR), which is the primary measure used in the study to compare the mortality rates of psychiatric patients to the general population.

E) The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year - This describes a proportionate mortality ratio, not an SMR.

He is treated with IV fluids, norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder for pelvic instability. After receiving a blood transfusion and hydromorphone, the patient suddenly develops respiratory distress with bilateral wheezing, indicating a possible allergic reaction.

Given the patient's symptoms and treatment, the most likely cause of the allergic reaction is an adverse response to the blood transfusion. The patient's history of asthma may also contribute to the severity of the reaction. Among the options provided, the presence of anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum would be indicative of an adverse reaction to the blood transfusion due to ABO incompatibility. This is a critical consideration in patients receiving blood transfusions, and the presence of these antibodies would explain the patient's sudden onset of respiratory distress.

A) Adverse effect of anesthetic
B) Gram negative bacteria in the bloodstream
C) Trauma to the bile duct
D) Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder
E) Excessive lysis of red blood cells","The patient developed symptoms of low-grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain five days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia. The presence of jaundice, abdominal tenderness over the liver, and laboratory results showing elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase of 760 U/L) and bilirubin levels (total 3.8 mg/dL, direct 3.1 mg/dL) indicate liver dysfunction. The liver biopsy showing massive centrilobular necrosis further supports liver damage. Given the recent surgery and anesthesia, one possible cause of liver damage is an adverse effect of the anesthetic. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not strongly suggest a typical anesthetic-related liver injury. The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells during surgery, which increases the risk of transfusion-related complications. The patient's eosinophilia (13% eosinophils) is a significant finding, as it can be associated with hemolytic reactions. The presence of hemolysis would lead to excessive lysis of red blood cells, which can cause liver dysfunction and jaundice due to the increased bilirubin load. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is excessive lysis of red blood cells, possibly due to a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

769,"An unresponsive 92-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance and is quickly followed by his grand-daughter. Approx. 1 month ago, he had a radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and several rounds of chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer in Nicaragua and was discharged from the hospital with a suprapelvic catheter and a plan for more chemotherapy. He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?
A) Renal biopsy
B) Ultrasound
C) Abdominal-pelvic CT scan
D) Blood analysis
E) Urine analysis","The patient in this scenario is an unresponsive 92-year-old man with a history of radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer. He presents with altered mental status, cachexia, tachycardia, and a swollen cystotomy incision site. The patient's suprapelvic catheter produces no urine over 24 hours, and only thick green-white pus can be expressed, indicating a possible urinary tract obstruction.

Given the patient's complex medical history and the need for a non-invasive and rapid assessment of the urinary tract, ultrasound is the best initial method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction. Ultrasound is a widely available, non-invasive, and relatively quick imaging modality that can provide valuable information about the urinary tract, including the presence of obstruction, hydronephrosis, or other abnormalities.

Renal biopsy (A) is an invasive procedure that carries risks and is not typically used as an initial diagnostic tool for urinary tract obstruction. Abdominal-pelvic CT scan (C) may provide more detailed information, but it involves radiation and contrast dye, which may be contraindicated in patients with certain medical conditions. Blood analysis (D) and urine analysis (E) can provide information about the patient's overall health and possible infection, but they are not directly useful for evaluating urinary tract obstruction.

She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:
Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL

Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?
A) Ofloxacin
B) Cefepime
C) Cefotaxime
D) Amoxicillin
E) Cephalexin","To determine the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient, we need to consider the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The patient presents with symptoms of vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in her left ear, along with a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of suppurative labyrinthitis, which is a serious infection of the inner ear.

Given the severity of the infection and the potential for complications, it is essential to choose an antibiotic that is effective against a broad range of pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are common causes of suppurative labyrinthitis.

Among the options provided, Cefotaxime (C) is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that has broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including the pathogens mentioned above. It is also effective against beta-lactamase-producing organisms, which can be a concern in cases of suppurative labyrinthitis.

In contrast, Ofloxacin (A) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against a broad range of bacteria, but it is not typically the first choice for treating suppurative labyrinthitis.

Cefepime (B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that has broad-spectrum activity, but it is typically reserved for use in cases of severe, life-threatening infections or in patients with severe renal impairment.

Amoxicillin (D) is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a narrow range of bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it is not as effective against other common pathogens.

Cephalexin (E) is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a narrow range of bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it is not as effective against other common pathogens.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient is Cefotaxime.

919,"A 66-year-old woman presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region. She reports that she has not urinated for the past 2 days and that the urine leakage occurs during both day and night and is not associated with physical exertion. The medical history is significant for arterial hypertension and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and depression for 3 years. She is prescribed amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin, metformin, and amitriptyline. Her weight is 75 kg (165 lb) and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 40 in). Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.4℃ (97.5℉). The physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness with a distended urinary bladder that is palpated in the suprapubic region. The neurological examination shows decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally, and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation. On gynecologic examination, the cervix was normally positioned, mobile, and without any visible lesions. Bulging of the posterior vaginal wall was noted. The adnexa were not palpable. An ultrasound examination showed an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities. Which of the following is  the next step in managing this patient?
A) Installing a vaginal pessary
B) Bladder catheterization
C) Cystostomy
D) Prescribing bethanechol
E) Prescribing prostaglandin E2","To address this patient's condition, it's essential to consider her symptoms and the findings from the physical examination and ultrasound. The patient presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region, along with a history of not urinating for the past 2 days. The physical examination reveals a distended urinary bladder palpated in the suprapubic region, indicating urinary retention. The ultrasound examination confirms an overdistended urinary bladder without structural abnormalities.

Given these findings, the immediate goal is to relieve the urinary retention and prevent further complications such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage. Among the provided options, bladder catheterization is the most appropriate next step. This procedure will allow for the immediate drainage of the bladder, providing relief from the discomfort and preventing potential complications.

Installing a vaginal pessary (A) might be considered for managing pelvic organ prolapse, which is suggested by the bulging of the posterior vaginal wall, but it does not address the immediate issue of urinary retention. Cystostomy (C) is a more invasive procedure that involves creating a stoma for urinary diversion and is typically reserved for cases where less invasive measures are not feasible or have failed. Prescribing bethanechol (D) or prostaglandin E2 (E) might be considered for managing urinary retention in certain contexts, but these pharmacological interventions would not provide the immediate relief that bladder catheterization offers.

1005,"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?
A) Amoxicillin
B) Cefazolin
C) Ceftriaxone
D) Levofloxacin
E) Penicillin","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a productive cough with yellow-green sputum, worsening shortness of breath, and a fever of 102°F (38.9°C). These symptoms are indicative of an acute exacerbation of COPD, which is often triggered by a respiratory infection. The patient's physical exam shows signs of respiratory distress, including difficulty speaking, asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration, and wheezing on pulmonary auscultation.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the addition of antibiotics to the treatment regimen is necessary to cover for a potential bacterial infection. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by the severity of the exacerbation, the presence of comorbidities, and the patient's recent history of antibiotic use.

Among the options provided, Levofloxacin (D) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those commonly responsible for respiratory infections in patients with COPD. It is also a reasonable choice given the patient's age, comorbidities, and lack of recent travel history.

The other options are not as suitable for this patient. Amoxicillin (A) is a narrower-spectrum antibiotic that may not be effective against some of the bacteria responsible for respiratory infections in patients with COPD. Cefazolin (B) is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is often used for skin and soft tissue infections, but it may not be the best choice for a respiratory infection. Ceftriaxone (C) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but it is often reserved for more severe infections or those that are resistant to other antibiotics. Penicillin (E) is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that is not effective against many of the bacteria responsible for respiratory infections in patients with COPD.

""","To approach this question, we need to understand the management of RhD-negative pregnant women, particularly those who have received a blood transfusion in the past.

The patient is a 23-year-old woman who is RhD-negative and has a history of a blood transfusion after a car accident. Her current pregnancy is at 20 weeks, and routine prenatal labs show a negative anti-D antibody screen.

The main concern in RhD-negative pregnant women is the risk of alloimmunization, which occurs when the mother's immune system is sensitized to RhD-positive blood, either through a blood transfusion or during a previous pregnancy with an RhD-positive fetus. If the mother becomes sensitized, she will produce anti-D antibodies, which can cross the placenta and cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in future RhD-positive pregnancies.

Given the patient's history of a blood transfusion, it is essential to determine whether she has been sensitized to RhD-positive blood. The negative anti-D antibody screen at 20 weeks suggests that she has not been sensitized yet. However, it is crucial to repeat the antibody screening at 28 weeks to ensure that she has not become sensitized during the pregnancy.

If the patient is still negative for anti-D antibodies at 28 weeks, she should receive anti-D immunoglobulin (RhIg) at that time to prevent sensitization during the remainder of the pregnancy. Additionally, she should receive another dose of RhIg after delivery if the newborn is RhD-positive.

Considering the options provided, the best next step in management is to repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks and administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks. If the newborn is RhD-positive, another dose of RhIg should be administered after delivery.

1140,"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A) Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments
B) Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host
C) Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan
D) Associated with longstanding hypertension
E) Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein","This patient's symptoms, including rapidly progressive memory changes, myoclonus, ataxia, and psychiatric disturbances such as paranoia and hallucinations, are highly suggestive of a prion disease, specifically Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Prion diseases are a group of rare, fatal brain diseases that affect both humans and animals. They are caused by an abnormally folded protein called a prion, which can induce normal proteins in the brain to also misfold, leading to brain damage and the characteristic symptoms of the disease.

Prions are unique in that they can be transmitted through contact with infected tissue, even after standard sterilization procedures such as autoclaving. This is because prions do not contain nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) and therefore are not affected by the usual methods of inactivating viruses or bacteria.

Given these characteristics, let's evaluate the options:

A) Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments - This is true for prions, as they can survive standard sterilization procedures.

B) Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host - This is incorrect for prions, as they do not contain genetic material.

C) Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan - This is incorrect for prions, as they are proteins and do not have a cell wall.

D) Associated with longstanding hypertension - This is not directly related to the cause of this patient's symptoms.

E) Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein - This is more characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, not prion diseases.

506,"A 42-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with decreased consciousness and convulsions. His wife reports that 30 min following the onset of her husband’s condition, which started approximately 6 hours ago, he treated his garden bed with pesticides against mice. He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications. His blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 104/min, respiratory rate is 10/min, and the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient’s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?
A) Fumarate
B) Citrate
C) Isocitrate
D) Malate
E) Succinate","To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and understand the mechanism of how sodium fluoroacetate acts in the body.

Sodium fluoroacetate is a pesticide that forms fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Fluorocitrate is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase, which is part of the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). The citric acid cycle is a key process by which cells generate energy.

In the citric acid cycle, citrate is converted into isocitrate by the enzyme aconitase. When fluorocitrate inhibits aconitase, citrate cannot be converted into isocitrate, leading to an accumulation of citrate in the cells.

Given this information, let's look at the options:

A) Fumarate - This is not the direct result of aconitase inhibition.
B) Citrate - This is the correct answer. Citrate will accumulate in the patient's cells because fluorocitrate inhibits aconitase, preventing citrate from being converted into isocitrate.
C) Isocitrate - This is the product of the reaction that is inhibited by fluorocitrate, so it will not accumulate.
D) Malate - This is not directly related to the inhibition of aconitase by fluorocitrate.
E) Succinate - This is also not directly related to the inhibition of aconitase by fluorocitrate.

580,"A 59-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining of diffuse bodily aches. She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 141 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L

A radiograph of this patient’s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?
A) Expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins
B) Irregular blastic lesion
C) Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone
D) Poorly marginated lesion extending into adjacent soft tissue
E) Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis","The patient is a 59-year-old woman presenting with diffuse bodily aches, particularly worsening pain in her shoulders and hips over a 3-month period. Her medical history includes hypertension and recurrent renal stones, for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She has also experienced a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture in the past. Her laboratory results show elevated serum calcium (11.2 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (120 U/L), with low phosphate (2.3 mg/dL) and magnesium (1.9 mg/dL) levels.

The combination of these laboratory findings, particularly the elevated calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels, along with the patient's symptoms of diffuse bodily aches and pain in her shoulders and hips, is suggestive of hyperparathyroidism or a parathyroid hormone-related condition. However, the presence of a vertebral compression fracture and the specific pattern of laboratory abnormalities also raises the possibility of a condition that affects bone metabolism.

Considering the options provided, the radiographic findings most consistent with the patient's presentation would be an expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins. This type of lesion is characteristic of brown tumors, which are a manifestation of osteitis fibrosa cystica, a condition associated with hyperparathyroidism or an excess of parathyroid hormone. Brown tumors are typically seen in the setting of chronic hyperparathyroidism and can cause bone pain and fractures.

A) Pancreatic fluid leakage
B) Aseptic peritoneal inflammation
C) Neoplastic growth
D) Bacterial translocation
E) Perforated viscus","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 51-year-old man has a history of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion, which are indicative of a severe infection. His past medical history includes hepatitis C, which increases his risk for liver disease, and acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic fluid leakage. However, the presence of ascitic fluid with a high leukocyte count (1900/mm3) and a high percentage of neutrophils (60%) suggests an infectious process. The serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is high, indicating portal hypertension, which is consistent with liver disease. The ascitic fluid glucose concentration is not significantly low, which makes pancreatic fluid leakage less likely. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are most consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a complication of cirrhosis characterized by bacterial translocation from the gut into the ascitic fluid. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is bacterial translocation.

713,"A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?
A) Pedunculated cervical growth
B) Inflammation of the cervix
C) Cervical trauma
D) Fetal vessels overlying cervical os
E) Premature separation of the placenta","To approach this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Patient Profile**: A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation presents with vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain.

2. **Pregnancy History**: The current pregnancy was achieved through in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner, and the prenatal course has been uncomplicated.

3. **Symptoms**: The patient reports vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. A speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os.

5. **Fetal Status**: Fetal heart rate is 166/min, and the cardiotocography (CTG) shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing.

6. **Ultrasound Findings**: A uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding can be deduced by considering the following:

- The presence of a tender, bruised cervix with a closed cervical os points towards a cervical issue rather than a placental abruption (premature separation of the placenta), which would typically present with uterine tenderness and possibly an open cervical os.
- The ultrasound findings of a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall do not suggest placenta previa, where the placenta would be found covering or proximate to the cervical os.
- The absence of uterine tenderness and the reassuring fetal heart rate tracing also make conditions like placental abruption less likely.
- The patient's recent resumption of sexual activity at week 22 of gestation could be relevant, as it increases the risk of cervical trauma.

Considering these points, the most plausible explanation for the patient's antepartum bleeding is cervical trauma, likely resulting from recent sexual activity.

1112,"A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient’s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient’s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient’s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3℃ (97.3℉). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient’s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?
A) Granulomas in the submucous tissue
B) Crypt abscesses
C) Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy
D) Mucosal eosinophilia
E) Villous hyperplasia","The patient's symptoms of episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash, along with the presence of a papulovesicular rash and aphthous ulcers, are highly suggestive of celiac disease. The patient's mother tried withdrawing dairy products from the diet, which did not help, indicating that lactose intolerance is unlikely to be the cause. The positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies further support the diagnosis of celiac disease. 

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to react to gluten, leading to inflammation and damage in the small intestine. The characteristic histopathological changes in the small intestine of patients with celiac disease include villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy. Villous atrophy refers to the flattening of the villi, which are the finger-like projections on the surface of the small intestine that help to absorb nutrients. Crypt hypertrophy refers to the deepening of the crypts, which are the glands in the small intestine that produce digestive enzymes. 

Therefore, the expected change on intestinal biopsy in this patient would be villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy.

1033,"An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago.

A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A) High-dose IV dexamethasone
B) Immediate debridement
C) Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics
D) Biopsy of wound
E) Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen","The patient is an 80-year-old man presenting with severe pain of the right lower extremity, which began acutely while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation. His medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The physical examination reveals a severely tender area with warmth, crepitus, and a foul-smelling discharge. These findings are highly suggestive of necrotizing fasciitis, a severe and potentially life-threatening infection of the soft tissues.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt and aggressive treatment to prevent further tissue damage and mortality. The next best step in management is immediate debridement of the affected area to remove the infected tissue and prevent further spread of the infection. Additionally, empiric IV antibiotics should be started to cover for the most likely pathogens, which include Streptococcus and Clostridium species.

Therefore, the correct answer is {C} Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics.

Note: Immediate debridement is crucial in the management of necrotizing fasciitis, as it can help to prevent further tissue damage and reduce the risk of mortality. Empiric IV antibiotics should also be started to cover for the most likely pathogens, but the specific choice of antibiotics may need to be adjusted based on the results of cultures and sensitivity testing."

According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Acute stress response
B) Antisocial personality disorder
C) Borderline personality disorder
D) Normal grief response
E) Post-traumatic stress disorder","Analyzing the situation, the 22-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge at 10 weeks pregnant, which is indicative of a spontaneous abortion. Her initial reaction to the news is one of gratitude, but upon hearing the news of the miscarriage, she becomes angry and aggressive, directing her emotions towards the medical staff. This shift in behavior, along with the new lacerations on her wrists and the broken medical equipment, suggests a pattern of emotional dysregulation and impulsivity.

Considering the patient's past medical history of anxiety and substance abuse, along with her extreme emotional response to the news of her miscarriage, it is likely that she has an underlying personality disorder. Among the options provided, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pattern of emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and unstable relationships, which aligns with the patient's behavior in response to the news of her miscarriage.

The other options do not fully capture the complexity of the patient's behavior. Acute stress response (A) and post-traumatic stress disorder (E) may be possible diagnoses, but they do not fully explain the patient's impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Antisocial personality disorder (B) is characterized by a lack of empathy and impulsivity, but it does not typically involve the same level of emotional dysregulation as BPD. Normal grief response (D) is not a diagnosis and does not capture the severity of the patient's emotional response.

963,"A 19-year-old female presents to the emergency room with 6 days of lower abdominal pain. She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well. She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5°C (38.1°F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient’s condition?
A) Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline with outpatient follow-up
B) Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission
C) Oral vancomycin with outpatient follow-up
D) Methotrexate with outpatient follow-up
E) Exploratory laparotomy","The patient is a 19-year-old female presenting with 6 days of lower abdominal pain, fever, nonbloody diarrhea, and nausea. She has a history of recent ciprofloxacin treatment for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection and irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. Her symptoms and physical examination findings, including marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, voluntary guarding, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side, are highly suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Given the severity of her symptoms, the presence of a tender adnexal mass, and the need for prompt and effective treatment to prevent long-term complications, inpatient admission for intravenous antibiotics is the best course of action. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hospitalization for patients with severe PID, including those with high fever, severe abdominal pain, or signs of peritonitis.

Among the options provided, intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline is a recommended regimen for the treatment of PID, covering a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, the best next step in treating this patient's condition is inpatient admission with intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline.

D) High LDL-cholesterol
E) Serum glucose level","The patient's laboratory results show several abnormalities that could be indicative of potential health risks. However, when evaluating the need for treatment, it is essential to consider the severity and clinical significance of each abnormality.

Option A, the blood pressure reading of 130/90 mm Hg, is considered elevated but not necessarily an indication for immediate treatment. According to current guidelines, lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise are recommended as the first line of treatment for stage 1 hypertension.

Option B, the patient's weight, is a significant concern due to the presence of obesity. However, weight loss is typically managed through lifestyle modifications rather than pharmacological treatment.

Option C, high triglyceride levels of 170 mg/dL, is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the primary approach to managing elevated triglycerides is through lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise.

Option D, high LDL-cholesterol of 186 mg/dL, is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. According to current guidelines, an LDL-cholesterol level above 190 mg/dL or a level of 160 mg/dL or higher in patients with other risk factors is an indication for statin therapy.

Option E, serum glucose level of 105 mg/dL, is considered impaired fasting glucose, but it is not an indication for pharmacological treatment. Lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, are typically recommended as the first line of treatment.

Considering the patient's laboratory results and the presence of other risk factors, including a family history of cardiovascular disease and obesity, the high LDL-cholesterol level is the most significant indication for treatment.

71,"A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife due to abdominal distension and persistent somnolence for the past 2 weeks. The patient’s wife says that he has been sleeping much more than usual for the past 5 days. His bowel and bladder habit have not changed. His past medical history is significant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. His vital signs include: pulse 76/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F) and blood pressure 122/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is altered and not responsive to commands. Oriented x 0. The abdomen is significantly distended. Shifting dullness is present and a positive fluid wave can be elicited. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are noted. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?
A) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
B) Metabolic alkalosis
C) Variceal gastrointestinal bleeding
D) Portal vein thrombosis
E) Hypoglycemia","To determine the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient's condition, we need to analyze the provided information. The patient, a 66-year-old man with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, presents with abdominal distension, persistent somnolence, and altered mental status. The physical examination reveals significant abdominal distension, shifting dullness, and a positive fluid wave, indicating ascites. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are also noted, which are signs of hepatic encephalopathy. The laboratory findings show elevated ammonia levels, which is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's condition is most likely precipitated by a factor that increases ammonia production or decreases its clearance. Among the options provided, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a known precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. SBP can lead to an increase in ammonia production by bacteria in the gut, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and crosses the blood-brain barrier, contributing to the development of hepatic encephalopathy.

The other options are less likely to be the precipitating factor. Metabolic alkalosis (option B) can occur in patients with cirrhosis, but it is not a direct precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy. Variceal gastrointestinal bleeding (option C) can also precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, but the upper GI endoscopy did not show any signs of active bleeding. Portal vein thrombosis (option D) can occur in patients with cirrhosis, but it is not a direct precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy. Hypoglycemia (option E) can occur in patients with cirrhosis, but the patient's glucose level is normal.

Therefore, the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient's condition is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

During these episodes, she has had nausea and vomiting. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria and is asymptomatic between episodes. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Seven years ago, she underwent resection of the terminal ileum because of severe Crohn's disease. She is 155 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (175 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/95 mm Hg. There is mild scleral icterus. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows a normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?""
A) Acute hepatitis A
B) Choledocholithiasis
C) Autoimmune hepatitis
D) Cholecystitis
E) Pancreatitis
""","The patient is a 38-year-old woman who presents with severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and Crohn's disease, for which she underwent resection of the terminal ileum seven years ago. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, as well as a mildly elevated total bilirubin level. The abdominal ultrasonography reveals a normal liver, a dilated common bile duct, and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones.

Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of these findings is choledocholithiasis, which is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct. The patient's history of gallstones and the dilated common bile duct caliber of 10 mm, as seen on ultrasonography, support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with choledocholithiasis, which can cause intermittent obstruction of the common bile duct, leading to these symptoms.

Additionally, the patient's laboratory results, including elevated liver enzymes and a mildly elevated total bilirubin level, are consistent with choledocholithiasis. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level is particularly suggestive of choledocholithiasis, as it is often elevated in patients with bile duct obstruction.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. Acute hepatitis A (option A) typically presents with a more acute onset of symptoms, including fever, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Autoimmune hepatitis (option C) is a chronic condition that typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms, including fatigue, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. Cholecystitis (option D) is inflammation of the gallbladder, which can cause similar symptoms to choledocholithiasis, but the patient's ultrasonography does not show wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, which are typical findings in cholecystitis. Pancreatitis (option E) is inflammation of the pancreas, which can cause abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes, but the patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?
A) Staphylococcus aureus
B) Streptococcus pyogene
C) Streptococcus pneumoniae
D) Neisseria meningitidis
E) Non-typeable H. influenzae","The patient presented with severe symptoms of fever, diarrhea, dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse, ultimately leading to death despite aggressive treatment.

A) Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
B) Prednisone
C) Botulism antitoxin
D) Intravenous acyclovir
E) Gabapentin","Let's think step by step. The 10-year-old boy presents with acute onset of severe weakness in both lower extremities, mild sensory loss of the hands and feet, and absent knee and ankle jerk reflexes. The patient's history of a recent fever, dry cough, and sore throat, followed by a persistent cough, suggests a possible post-infectious complication. The laboratory studies show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is slightly elevated. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis reveals a high protein concentration with normal glucose and leukocyte count, which is indicative of an inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, specifically Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disorder that often follows a viral or bacterial infection, leading to demyelination and axonal damage in the peripheral nerves. The most appropriate next step in treatment is to administer intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of GBS by modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation.

A) Lumbar puncture
B) Intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy
C) Surgical debridement
D) Oral indomethacin therapy
E) Bone scintigraphy
""","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the results of the investigations.

1. **Patient's Presentation**: The patient is a 45-year-old homeless man with progressive neck pain, headaches, numbness in both hands, and a history of intermittent lower back pain that improves with movement. He also has a history of gout and is a known user of intravenous heroin.

2. **Vital Signs and Physical Examination**: The patient appears acutely ill with a fever of 39°C (102.2°F), tachycardia (110/min), and elevated blood pressure (140/85 mm Hg). There are signs of track marks on both forearms, warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion in the neck, along with severe pain upon palpation over the midcervical spinal processes.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has anemia (Hemoglobin 11 g/dL), leukocytosis (14,200/mm^3) with a predominance of segmented neutrophils, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (54 mm/h).

4. **Imaging and Biopsy**: The x-ray of the cervical spine shows no abnormalities, but the MRI of the spine indicates signs of inflammation. A bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis.

Given these findings, the patient's presentation is most consistent with **osteomyelitis** of the cervical spine, likely due to an infectious process. Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone and can be caused by bacteria or fungi. The patient's history of intravenous heroin use increases his risk for developing osteomyelitis due to the potential for introducing bacteria into the bloodstream.

Considering the confirmed diagnosis of osteomyelitis and the need for appropriate management:

- **Lumbar puncture (A)** is not the best next step as it does not directly address the confirmed diagnosis of osteomyelitis and could potentially lead to complications.
- **Intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy (B)** is a reasonable approach as these antibiotics have broad-spectrum coverage and are effective against common pathogens causing osteomyelitis, including Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
- **Surgical debridement (C)** might be necessary in some cases of osteomyelitis, especially if there is significant bone destruction or if the infection does not respond to antibiotic therapy. However, it is not typically the first line of treatment.
- **Oral indomethacin therapy (D)** is used for the treatment of gout and would not address the osteomyelitis.
- **Bone scintigraphy (E)** is a diagnostic tool that might be used to evaluate the extent of bone infection but is not a management step.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management, given the confirmed diagnosis of osteomyelitis, is to initiate antibiotic therapy.

181,"A 4-month-old infant is brought to the office by his parents due to sudden nose bleeding without trauma of any kind. He has a 1-month history of multiple bruising that measures 1 cm in diameter each in the hands and feet, and tiny red spots that appeared in the upper and lower extremities without any trauma either. He has no prior bleeding history nor any relevant family history. The vital signs include: heart rate 190/min, respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 99/42 mm Hg, and temperature 36.6 °C (97.9 °F).

A) Von Willebrand disease
B) Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia
C) Aspirin
D) Bernard-Soulier disease
E) Scurvy","To approach this question, let's analyze the key findings from the patient's presentation and laboratory results.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 4-month-old infant presents with sudden nose bleeding without trauma, a 1-month history of multiple bruising, and tiny red spots (petechiae) in the upper and lower extremities. These symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder.

2. **Vital Signs**: The infant's vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate, which could be a response to the bleeding or stress.

3. **Physical Exam**: The presence of petechiae and ecchymosis (bruising) indicates a problem with the body's ability to form proper blood clots.

4. **Laboratory Results**:
   - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: The hemoglobin and hematocrit are slightly low, indicating some degree of anemia, likely due to the bleeding. The platelet count is elevated, which can sometimes be seen in response to bleeding or inflammation.
   - **Coagulation Tests**: The partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR) are essentially normal, suggesting that the coagulation cascade is intact.
   - **Blood Smear**: Shows hypochromia (red blood cells with less hemoglobin than normal), poikilocytosis (variation in red blood cell shape), and large platelets.
   - **Platelet Aggregation Test with Ristocetin**: Normal, which helps to rule out certain platelet function disorders.

5. **Increased Bleeding Time**: This suggests a problem with the body's ability to form a proper platelet plug at the site of injury.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a disorder that affects platelet function or structure. Among the options provided:

- **Von Willebrand Disease (A)**: Involves a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, which affects platelet adhesion and aggregation. However, the normal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin makes this less likely.
- **Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia (B)**: Characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex on platelets, leading to impaired platelet aggregation. However, the normal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin does not support this diagnosis.
- **Aspirin (C)**: Affects platelet aggregation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, but there's no indication of aspirin use in the provided history.
- **Bernard-Soulier Disease (D)**: Characterized by large platelets and a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complex, leading to impaired platelet adhesion and aggregation. The presence of large platelets on the blood smear and the increased bleeding time support this diagnosis.
- **Scurvy (E)**: Caused by vitamin C deficiency, leading to impaired collagen synthesis and bleeding gums, among other symptoms. The clinical presentation does not strongly support scurvy.

B) Haloperidol depot
C) Clozapine
D) Urine toxicology
E) ANA and anti-dsDNA levels","This patient presents with a complex and multifaceted clinical picture, including a history of psychiatric illness (depression, anxiety), non-compliance with medication, and recent aggressive behavior. The physical examination reveals signs suggestive of poor health and possible nutritional deficiencies (odd body odor, multiple ulcers in the oropharynx). The laboratory values indicate mild anemia (Hemoglobin 10 g/dL, Hematocrit 35%), slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

Given the patient's history of psychiatric illness and recent aggressive behavior, it is essential to consider the possibility of an underlying psychiatric condition, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. However, the patient's current mental status, as described, does not provide clear evidence for a specific psychiatric diagnosis.

Among the provided options, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a urine toxicology screen (Option D). This test can help identify potential substance use or abuse, which could be contributing to the patient's behavior and overall clinical presentation. Additionally, it can provide valuable information for guiding further treatment and management decisions.

Other options, such as administering antipsychotic medications (Options A, B, and C), may be premature without a clear diagnosis and may pose risks, especially considering the patient's history of medication non-compliance. Similarly, ordering ANA and anti-dsDNA levels (Option E) may not be directly relevant to the patient's current presentation and would not provide immediate guidance for management.

A) Rathke cleft cyst
B) Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome
C) Craniopharyngioma
D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia
E) Pituitary adenoma","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 8-year-old boy, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Short stature and lack of growth**: The boy's clothing and shoe size have not changed over the past year, indicating a lack of growth. He is at the 5th percentile for both height and weight.

2. **Frequent thirst and urination**: These symptoms could suggest diabetes insipidus, a condition affecting the regulation of body fluids. However, his laboratory results do not directly support this diagnosis.

3. **Headaches and bumping into obstacles**: These symptoms could be indicative of a visual field defect, which is sometimes associated with pituitary or hypothalamic tumors.

4. **Family history**: The boy's mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and had precocious puberty. While this family history is notable, it doesn't directly point to the boy's condition.

5. **Laboratory findings**: The boy's glucose level is slightly elevated but not indicative of diabetes mellitus. His thyroid function tests are within normal limits, ruling out primary thyroid disorders. The most significant abnormality is the low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels, which are indicative of growth hormone deficiency.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that affects growth hormone production or secretion. Among the options provided:

- **A) Rathke cleft cyst**: This is a type of cyst that can affect the pituitary gland but is less commonly associated with the symptoms described.

- **B) Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome**: This condition involves autoimmune destruction of endocrine glands, which doesn't directly fit the boy's presentation of isolated growth hormone deficiency.

- **C) Craniopharyngioma**: This is a type of brain tumor that can affect the pituitary gland and is known to cause growth hormone deficiency, along with visual disturbances and other symptoms. It is a strong candidate for the boy's condition.

- **D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia**: This condition involves tumors in multiple endocrine glands, which doesn't fit the isolated growth hormone deficiency seen in the boy.

- **E) Pituitary adenoma**: While a pituitary adenoma could cause growth hormone deficiency, it is less likely to present with the specific constellation of symptoms and findings seen in this boy.

E) Intubation and mechanical ventilation","The patient, a 36-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing chemotherapy, presents to the emergency department after a high-speed motor-vehicle collision. His vital signs are stable, but he shows signs of significant trauma, including multiple bruises, a laceration on his right cheek, and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. He is also unresponsive to commands but reacts to painful stimuli, indicating a decreased level of consciousness. Given his clinical presentation, the most immediate concern is ensuring a patent airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs).

Among the options provided, the most appropriate next step in management is securing his airway due to his decreased level of consciousness and potential for respiratory compromise. This is especially critical in a patient with a history of acute myeloid leukemia undergoing chemotherapy, as his immune system is likely compromised, making him more susceptible to infections and complications.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is intubation and mechanical ventilation to ensure a secure airway and adequate oxygenation.

308,"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?
A) Follow the daughter’s wishes to withhold the operation
B) Refer this case to the court
C) Contact another family member for consent
D) Perform the surgery without consent
E) Report the daughter to the police","In this scenario, the patient's daughter is refusing to consent to a life-saving operation for her father, citing past abuse and neglect. However, as a healthcare provider, the primary concern is the patient's well-being and best interests. 

In the absence of a written advanced directive, the healthcare provider should not solely rely on the daughter's wishes, especially if it means withholding life-saving treatment. 

Referring the case to the court (option B) would be an appropriate course of action, as it would allow for an objective third-party evaluation of the situation and ensure that the patient's rights and interests are protected. 

Contacting another family member for consent (option C) may not be feasible or appropriate, as it may lead to further conflict and delay in providing necessary treatment. 

Performing the surgery without consent (option D) would be unethical and potentially illegal, as it would violate the patient's autonomy and rights. 

Reporting the daughter to the police (option E) is not relevant to the situation at hand and would not address the patient's immediate medical needs.

E) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
""","Let's break down the information provided to determine the most likely diagnosis.

The patient is a 35-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation, presenting with fever, persistent headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and gum bleeding for 1 week. She recently returned from a camping trip to Sri Lanka, which is an area endemic for certain diseases.

The patient's vital signs show a high temperature (39.3°C or 102.8°F), elevated pulse (104/min), and increased respirations (24/min). Physical examination reveals pallor, mild scleral icterus, scattered petechiae over the trunk and back, and no lymphadenopathy.

Laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin level (8.2 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 18,000/mm3), normal INR, negative Coomb's test, and negative fibrin split products. The serum urea and creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and the total and direct bilirubin levels are elevated. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is significantly elevated (900 U/L).

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and recent travel history to Sri Lanka suggest a diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). DHF is a severe form of dengue infection, characterized by hemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of plasma leakage.

The patient's low platelet count, elevated LDH level, and presence of petechiae support the diagnosis of DHF. Additionally, the patient's recent travel history to Sri Lanka, an area endemic for dengue fever, further supports this diagnosis.

Other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* HELLP syndrome is a condition that occurs during pregnancy, characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. However, the patient's liver enzymes are not significantly elevated, and the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome is less likely.
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a condition characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms. However, the patient's renal function is not significantly impaired, and the diagnosis of TTP is less likely.
* Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. However, the patient's kidney function is not significantly impaired, and the diagnosis of HUS is less likely.
* Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia, elevated indirect bilirubin, and a positive Coomb's test. However, the patient's Coomb's test is negative, and the diagnosis of AIHA is less likely.

E) Acute small bowel hemorrhage","Let's analyze the situation step by step. The 26-year-old nurse presents with a 2-month history of fatigue, lower abdominal pain, and a strong conviction that she has cancer. She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy despite the absence of any clear indications for it. Her physical examination reveals pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, and numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins, which are indicative of needle marks. Her laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, a normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 89 μm3, and an elevated reticulocyte count of 13.3%, suggesting anemia with a possible underlying cause of blood loss or hemolysis. However, the test for occult blood in the stool is negative, and abdominal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, making gastrointestinal bleeding less likely.

Considering the patient's profession as a nurse, her access to medical equipment, and the presence of needle marks on her arm, it is likely that she is inducing her own anemia through self-inflicted blood draws. This behavior is characteristic of factitious disorder, a condition in which a person intentionally creates or fakes symptoms of a disease or illness in order to gain attention, sympathy, or reassurance.

E) Blockage of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors","The patient, a 75-year-old man, presents with symptoms of a racing heart and lightheadedness that have persisted for 3 hours, which is longer than his previous episodes. He has a history of myocardial infarction and is currently taking captopril, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. The irregular heart rhythm and absence of P-waves with an irregular RR complex on the ECG are indicative of atrial fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia that increases the risk of thromboembolic events.

Given the patient's symptoms have subsided, and he is being discharged with an additional anticoagulation drug, the mechanism of action of this new medication is likely related to preventing future thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation.

Among the provided options, the most appropriate mechanism of action for an anticoagulation drug in this context is the inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. This class of drugs includes warfarin, which works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), thereby reducing the risk of thromboembolic events.

Her history of hypertension and major depressive disorder, along with her current medications, including prophylactic unfractionated heparin, are relevant to her current condition. The presence of multiple hematomas on the upper extremities around the peripheral intravenous access sites and the tender, erythematous, and swollen right calf suggest a bleeding disorder.

Laboratory studies show a significantly low platelet count of 48,000/mm3, which is indicative of thrombocytopenia. The prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are also elevated, suggesting a coagulopathy. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a serious complication that can occur in patients receiving heparin therapy.

HIT is caused by the formation of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex, leading to platelet activation and aggregation. This results in a prothrombotic state, which can cause both thrombosis and bleeding. The patient's symptoms, including the bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters and the severe right leg pain, are consistent with thrombosis.

The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is the formation of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex, leading to platelet activation and aggregation. This is consistent with option E) Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation.

961,"A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a “nagging” headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient’s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Hemoglobin: 20 g/dL
Hematocrit: 60%
Leukocyte count: 10,050 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 350,000/mm^3

Which of the following underlies the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
A) Medication side effect
B) Myeloproliferative neoplasm
C) Neuronal hyperexcitability
D) Toxic exposure
E) Viral infection","The patient presents with a headache and dizziness that began about 4 weeks ago, which he initially attributed to a cold. He tried over-the-counter ibuprofen, but it only provided mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. His medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma, and he has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 20 g/dL, a hematocrit of 60%, a leukocyte count of 10,050 cells/mm^3 with a normal differential, and a platelet count of 350,000/mm^3. These results are indicative of polycythemia, a condition characterized by an increased concentration of red blood cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that he is experiencing altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS). AMS occurs when the body cannot adapt to high altitudes, resulting in a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood. The patient's recent move to his upstate cabin, which is likely at a higher elevation, is the underlying cause of his symptoms.

The patient's polycythemia is a response to the decreased oxygen levels in his blood, as his body attempts to compensate by producing more red blood cells. The increased red blood cell count helps to increase oxygen delivery to the body's tissues.

Therefore, the underlying cause of the patient's most likely diagnosis is toxic exposure, specifically the decreased oxygen levels at high altitudes.

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?
A) Overflow proteinuria
B) Transient (functional) proteinuria
C) Tubular proteinuria
D) Orthostatic proteinuria
E) Isolated proteinuria","The patient presents with complaints of increased fatigue and back pain that have progressively worsened over the past year. The symptoms are non-specific but indicate a possible underlying systemic issue. The physical examination reveals mild tenderness over the lumbar region and an absence of paraspinal muscle tenderness, with a negative straight leg raise test. The skin and conjunctiva appear pale, which could indicate anemia.

The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, which supports the suspicion of anemia. The total leukocyte count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils are within normal limits. The platelet count is also within the normal range. The basic metabolic panel shows elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function. The uric acid level is within normal limits, and the calcium level is elevated at 12.1 mg/dL.

The urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. Given the elevated calcium level and impaired renal function, the proteinuria is likely due to an overflow mechanism. Overflow proteinuria occurs when the kidneys are unable to reabsorb excess proteins, often due to an underlying systemic condition.

In this case, the patient's elevated calcium level and impaired renal function suggest an underlying condition such as multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that can cause an overproduction of light chains, leading to an overflow of proteins in the urine.

609,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child’s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents’ death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
A) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway
B) Aminolevulinic acid synthetase of the heme metabolism pathway
C) Adenosine deaminase of the purine metabolism pathway
D) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway
E) Thymidylate synthetase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided and analyze the symptoms and potential causes.

1. **Symptoms and Presentation:**
   - The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been violent and trying to hurt himself.
   - He exhibits facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements.
   - He has no teeth, a condition that has been present since he was 2 years old.
   - He was taking allopurinol, a medication typically used to treat gout or high levels of uric acid.

2. **Medication Clue:**
   - Allopurinol is used to reduce uric acid production in the body. It is often prescribed for conditions like gout but can also be used in the management of certain genetic disorders that affect purine metabolism.

3. **Possible Diagnosis:**
   - The symptoms of self-mutilation (e.g., no teeth due to self-extraction), along with the administration of allopurinol, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which plays a crucial role in the purine metabolism pathway.

4. **Biochemical Pathway Abnormality:**
   - The deficiency of HGPRT leads to an accumulation of uric acid in the body, resulting in various symptoms including severe gout, kidney disease, and neurological dysfunction characterized by self-mutilation and involuntary movements.

Given the information and analysis, the most likely cause of this patient’s condition is related to an abnormality in the purine metabolism pathway, specifically the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.

310,"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. The patient’s vitals are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 39/min, and temperature 37.1°C (98.8℉). On physical examination, the patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15 and is cyanotic. There are open fractures of the left femur and left tibia, a likely shoulder dislocation, multiple contusions on the limbs and thorax, and a puncture wound on the left side of his chest. There are no breath sounds on the left side and there is hyperresonance to percussion on the left. Preparations are made for an emergency needle thoracostomy to be performed to treat this patient’s likely tension pneumothorax. Which one of the following is the best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure?
A) The patient’s closest relatives (spouse, child or parent), who must be brought to the hospital as fast as possible
B) One of the witnesses at the scene of the car accident, who should be brought to the hospital as fast as possible
C) The hospital ethics committee
D) Informed consent is not needed in this case
E) The hospital lawyer should immediately give temporary medical power of attorney to a member of the hospital ethics committee who will make all the medical decisions for the patient only until the patient is conscious again.","In emergency situations where a patient's life is at risk, informed consent may not be required. The doctrine of ""implied consent"" applies, assuming that any reasonable person would want to receive life-saving treatment if they were unable to give consent themselves. In this scenario, the patient is unconscious and has a life-threatening condition (tension pneumothorax) that requires immediate treatment. Delaying treatment to obtain consent from relatives or others could result in serious harm or death. Therefore, informed consent is not needed in this case, and the medical team should proceed with the emergency needle thoracostomy.

706,"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?
A) Diabetic polyuria
B) Overactive detrusor muscle
C) Primary polydipsia
D) Urethral hypermobility
E) Vescicovaginal fistula","The patient is a 35-year-old woman who has been experiencing progressive urinary leakage for the past year, initially only during athletic exercise but now also during activities like laughing or coughing. She has tried to manage this by going to the bathroom more frequently and wakes up once a night to urinate. The patient denies any symptoms of urinary tract infection, such as dysuria or hematuria, and the urinalysis results are within normal limits. The pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable, but urine leakage is observed when the patient is asked to Valsalva.

Given these symptoms and findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is urethral hypermobility. Urethral hypermobility is a condition where the urethra is not properly supported and can move excessively, leading to stress urinary incontinence. This condition is common in women, especially those who have had vaginal deliveries, as the patient in this case had. The fact that the patient's symptoms worsen with activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as laughing or coughing, and that urine leakage is observed with Valsalva maneuver, supports this diagnosis.

Other options can be ruled out based on the information provided. Diabetic polyuria (A) is unlikely as there is no mention of the patient having diabetes, and the urinalysis results are normal. Overactive detrusor muscle (B) typically presents with symptoms of urgency and frequency, which are not the primary complaints of this patient. Primary polydipsia (C) is also unlikely as the patient's fluid intake is not excessive, and the specific gravity of the urine is within normal limits. Vescicovaginal fistula (E) is a rare condition that would typically present with continuous urine leakage, which is not the case in this patient.

B) Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity
C) Hyperpigmentation of the liver
D) Increased consumption of beta-carotene
E) Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT","Let's analyze the situation step by step.

The patient presents with a change in skin color, described as yellow/orange, which suggests jaundice or carotenemia. The laboratory results show elevated bilirubin levels, with a total bilirubin of 11.3 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin of 7.8 mg/dL. This indicates a liver or biliary system issue.

However, the liver enzymes, such as AST and ALT, are not provided, so we cannot directly assess liver damage. The patient's history of IV drug use and marijuana use could be related to liver disease, but the provided information does not directly support this.

The patient's skin color change is more likely related to carotenemia, a condition caused by excessive consumption of beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A found in yellow and orange fruits and vegetables. This condition is benign and reversible.

Considering the options provided:

A) A pathology responsive to sofosbuvir: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used to treat hepatitis C, which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

B) Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity: This enzyme is involved in the conjugation of bilirubin, and decreased activity can lead to elevated bilirubin levels. However, this is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

C) Hyperpigmentation of the liver: This is a characteristic of hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder that leads to iron overload. However, this is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

D) Increased consumption of beta-carotene: This is the most likely explanation for the patient's yellow/orange skin color, as excessive consumption of beta-carotene can cause carotenemia.

E) Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT: This is indicative of liver damage, but the provided information does not support this.

160,"A 9-year-old boy is brought to a physician by his mother for evaluation of generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst. The mother mentions that her boy is always tired, and seems to be getting worse. He prefers watching television rather than going out and playing with other kids. Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian.

What is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Renal artery stenosis
B) Primary hyperaldosteronism
C) Bartter's syndrome
D) Pheochromocytoma
E) Gitelman's syndrome","The patient is a 9-year-old boy presenting with generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst. He also has a history of frequent episodes of constipation since birth and has been experiencing frequent cravings for salty foods. His laboratory results show elevated urinary calcium excretion, low potassium levels (hypokalemia), and elevated plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration.

Considering the boy's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Bartter's syndrome. Bartter's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the ion transport mechanism in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidneys. This defect leads to excessive urinary loss of sodium, potassium, and calcium, resulting in hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated urinary calcium excretion.

The elevated plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration are secondary to the hypokalemia and volume contraction, which stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The boy's symptoms of generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst are consistent with the hypokalemia and volume contraction seen in Bartter's syndrome.

The other options are less likely:

A) Renal artery stenosis typically presents with hypertension, which is not present in this case.

B) Primary hyperaldosteronism typically presents with hypertension and hypokalemia, but the plasma renin activity is usually low, not elevated.

D) Pheochromocytoma typically presents with hypertension, tachycardia, and symptoms of catecholamine excess, which are not present in this case.

The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient’s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted.

A) Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum
B) Recommend pregnancy termination
C) Arrange a chorionic villus sampling
D) Recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19
E) Test for rubella virus PCR","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Patient's Symptoms and Concerns**: The patient is a 22-year-old pregnant woman (15 weeks gestation) presenting with a rash, watery nasal discharge, and mild knee pain. Her symptoms started about 5 days ago, and she is concerned for the baby due to potential exposure to rubella from her younger sister.

2. **Vaccination History**: The patient cannot confirm her vaccination history against rubella.

3. **Physical Examination**: The examination reveals a maculopapular lacy rash over the trunk, extremities, and face, but no lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted.

4. **Serology Results**:
   - **Previous Serology (1 year ago)**: Rubella IgM negative, Rubella IgG 1:128, and high Rubella IgG avidity.
   - **Current Serology**: Rubella IgM negative, Rubella IgG 1:64, and high Rubella IgG avidity.

Given these points, let's analyze the situation:

- The presence of a rash and the patient's exposure to someone with rubella could initially suggest a concern for rubella infection. However, the serology results are crucial for understanding the patient's immune status and the risk to the fetus.

- The patient's previous and current serology results show the presence of Rubella IgG antibodies, which indicates immunity to rubella. The high avidity of these antibodies further supports that this immunity is due to past infection or vaccination rather than a recent infection.

- The decrease in Rubella IgG titer from 1:128 to 1:64 over the past year is not indicative of a recent infection but rather a natural decline in antibody levels over time, which is common in individuals who are immune.

- The absence of Rubella IgM antibodies in both the previous and current serology results suggests that there is no recent or acute rubella infection.

Considering these points, the patient is immune to rubella, and there is no evidence of a recent infection. Therefore, the risk of rubella to the fetus is minimal, and the patient can be reassured. The proper next step in management would be to reassure the patient and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum, as is standard practice for women who are found to be non-immune during pregnancy but does not apply here. However, given the options and the context that the patient is already immune, the closest appropriate action related to vaccination would be to reassure and note the importance of postpartum vaccinations in general, though not specifically needed for rubella in this case.

868,"A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room with swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg that started 2 hours ago. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
A) Hyperhomocysteinemia
B) Antithrombin III deficiency
C) Factor V Leiden
D) Protein C deficiency
E) Antiphospholipid syndrome","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the information provided:

1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is a 21-year-old man presenting with acute onset of swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg. This presentation is suggestive of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

2. **Family History**: The patient's father has a history of pulmonary embolism, which could indicate a familial predisposition to thrombotic events.

3. **Risk Factors**: The patient smokes and has a BMI of 30.7 kg/m2, indicating obesity. Both smoking and obesity are risk factors for DVT.

4. **Laboratory Studies**: The patient has a normal platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) initially. However, the presence of positive fibrin split products suggests thrombin activity and thus thrombosis.

5. **Ultrasonography**: The findings of incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow are diagnostic of DVT.

6. **Treatment and Response**: The patient is treated with unfractionated heparin, which is a standard treatment for DVT to prevent further clot formation. The aPTT is monitored to ensure it falls within a therapeutic range, indicating adequate anticoagulation.

Given these points, the question asks for the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, which are clearly due to a DVT. Considering the patient's age, family history, and lack of other clear risk factors (such as recent surgery, trauma, or malignancy), a congenital coagulopathy is a likely underlying cause.

Among the options provided:

- **Hyperhomocysteinemia** is a risk factor for thrombosis but is not as directly implicated in familial tendencies towards venous thromboembolism as some other options.
- **Antithrombin III deficiency** is a rare condition that significantly increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, but it's less common than some other congenital coagulopathies.
- **Factor V Leiden** is a mutation that makes Factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, significantly increasing the risk of venous thromboembolism. It's a common cause of inherited thrombophilia and could explain the patient's presentation and family history.
- **Protein C deficiency** also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism but is less common than Factor V Leiden.
- **Antiphospholipid syndrome** is an acquired condition associated with thrombosis, but it's less likely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms suggestive of this syndrome.

Considering the patient's age, family history of pulmonary embolism, and the presentation of DVT without other clear risk factors, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a congenital coagulopathy, with Factor V Leiden being a common and likely candidate.

1030,"A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness visit. She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?
A) Elevated TSH
B) High Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score
C) Improved symptoms with carbidopa/levodopa administration
D) Positive anti-CCP antibodies
E) Positive urine toxicology","The patient is a 24-year-old woman who presents with a variety of symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, mild constipation, and joint pain. She also reports a history of palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her physical exam reveals slow speech and movement, tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes.

Considering her symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and joint pain. The patient's slow speech and movement, as well as her delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes, are also consistent with hypothyroidism.

The patient's history of palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor may suggest a period of hyperthyroidism, which can sometimes precede hypothyroidism. However, her current symptoms and physical exam findings are more consistent with hypothyroidism.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is an elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level, which is a common indicator of hypothyroidism.

532,"A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room (ER) by her co-workers after they found her unconscious in her cubicle when they returned from lunch. They tell you that she has diabetes but do not know anything more about her condition. The woman’s vital signs include: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 24/min, temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is breathing heavily and gives irrelevant responses to questions. The skin and mucous membranes appear dry. Examination of the abdomen reveals mild diffuse tenderness to palpation. Deep tendon reflexes in the extremities are 1+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Finger stick glucose 630 mg/dL
Arterial blood gas analysis:

The patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A) Infuse NaHCO3 slowly
B) Switch fluids to 0.45% NaCl
C) Start IV insulin infusion
D) Replace potassium intravenously
E) Start IV 5% dextrose","The patient is presenting with symptoms and laboratory results consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes. The patient's high finger stick glucose level of 630 mg/dL, positive ketones in the urine, and arterial blood gas analysis showing a pH of 7.1, all support the diagnosis of DKA. The patient is also showing signs of dehydration, such as dry skin and mucous membranes, and mild diffuse abdominal tenderness.

The initial management of DKA involves aggressive fluid replacement to correct dehydration and hyperglycemia. The patient has already been started on a bolus of IV 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl), which is the correct initial step.

The next best step in the management of this patient is to continue fluid replacement and to start IV insulin infusion to lower the blood glucose level and correct the metabolic acidosis. However, before starting insulin, it is essential to replace potassium intravenously to prevent hypokalemia, which can occur as a result of insulin administration.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is to replace potassium intravenously, as the patient's potassium level is already low at 3.1 mEq/L.

603,"A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?
A) Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.
B) Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.
C) Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of progestins.
D) Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of estrogens.
E) Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of progestins.","The patient is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis against meningococcal meningitis. However, the physician also suggests that her husband should use condoms for contraception in addition to her combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). This is because rifampin can affect the efficacy of OCPs.

Rifampin is a known inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including the hormones in OCPs. When rifampin induces CYP3A4, it increases the metabolism of these hormones, leading to decreased levels of estrogens and progestins in the body. This can reduce the effectiveness of OCPs and increase the risk of unplanned pregnancy.

Among the options provided, the correct mechanism is that rifampin induces CYP3A4, which metabolizes estrogens, but it is also true for progestins. However, the most accurate statement regarding the effect of rifampin on OCPs is that it alters the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens, which is not the best answer choice. A more accurate answer choice would be that rifampin induces CYP3A4, which metabolizes estrogens and progestins, but this is not available. The closest correct answer is that rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.

A) Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy
B) Tenofovir and velpatasvir therapy
C) Interferon and ribavirin therapy
D) Tenofovir and entecavir therapy
E) Schedule a follow-up in 6 months","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. **Patient's Profile**: A 42-year-old man with elevated liver function tests, occasional headaches, and a history of a severe car accident 30 years ago. He does not have a history of alcohol or drug use but has a family history of alcoholism and liver cancer.

2. **Clinical Findings**: The patient appears thin, with slightly elevated temperature and pulse but normal blood pressure. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

3. **Laboratory Studies**: Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. He is HIV negative, Hepatitis B surface antigen negative, but Hepatitis C antibody positive with detectable HCV RNA, indicating active Hepatitis C infection.

4. **Liver Biopsy Results**: Mononuclear infiltrates limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis, consistent with chronic hepatitis.

Given this information, the management of the patient should focus on treating the Hepatitis C infection, which is the primary cause of his liver dysfunction.

**Treatment Options for Hepatitis C**:

- **A) Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy**: This is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combination therapy that is highly effective for treating Hepatitis C genotype 1, which the patient has. Sofosbuvir is an NS5B inhibitor, and ledipasvir is an NS5A inhibitor. This combination has a high cure rate and is well-tolerated.

- **B) Tenofovir and velpatasvir therapy**: While tenofovir is used in the treatment of Hepatitis B and HIV, and velpatasvir is a pangenotypic NS5A inhibitor used in Hepatitis C treatment, this combination is not the first-line treatment for Hepatitis C genotype 1.

- **C) Interferon and ribavirin therapy**: This is an older treatment approach for Hepatitis C that is less effective and has more side effects compared to DAA therapies. It's not the preferred first-line treatment anymore.

- **D) Tenofovir and entecavir therapy**: This combination is used for treating Hepatitis B, not Hepatitis C.

- **E) Schedule a follow-up in 6 months**: Given the patient's active Hepatitis C infection and liver biopsy findings, waiting 6 months without initiating treatment is not appropriate.

**Conclusion**: The most appropriate next step in management is to initiate a direct-acting antiviral therapy that is effective against Hepatitis C genotype 1.

927,"A 48-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus complicated by peripheral neuropathy presents to the emergency department for a foot wound that he noticed. He denies any pain, fevers, or chills. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 150/80 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 22/min. An ulcer with associated erythema and purulence is noted on his foot. Based on his radiography, he is diagnosed with osteomyelitis and admitted to the hospital for partial amputation of his right foot. He is given appropriate prophylaxis for tetanus and discharged 5 hospital days later on antibiotics. He returns to the emergency department one week later with difficulty breathing. His temperature is 98°F (37°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 27/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. His amputated foot stump is erythematous and edematous but not tender to palpation. An electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia. He requests something to help calm his breathing down. What is the next best step in management?
A) Complete blood count, type and screen, and order 1 unit of blood
B) CT angiography of the chest and give oxygen
C) D-dimer and lower extremity Dopper ultrasound
D) Deep wound culture and start piperacillin-tazobactam
E) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and give oxycodone","The patient is a 48-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus complicated by peripheral neuropathy, who was recently hospitalized for osteomyelitis and underwent partial amputation of his right foot. He returns to the emergency department one week later with difficulty breathing, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation. The erythematous and edematous amputated foot stump, although not tender to palpation, raises concern for a possible infection. However, the primary concern is the patient's respiratory distress.

Given the patient's recent surgery and hospitalization, one of the most significant concerns is the development of a pulmonary embolism (PE). The symptoms of difficulty breathing, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation are consistent with a PE. Additionally, the patient's immobility due to the recent surgery increases his risk for developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequently a PE.

The next best step in management would be to evaluate the patient for a possible PE. Among the options provided, choice B, CT angiography of the chest and giving oxygen, is the most appropriate course of action. CT angiography is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing PE, and providing oxygen would help to alleviate the patient's respiratory distress.

1009,"A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient’s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
Leukocyte esterase  positive
WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF
Nitrites positive
RBCs 2 cell/HPF
Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF
Urine pH 5.7
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A) TMP-SMX
B) Nitrofurantoin
C) Levofloxacin
D) Cephalexin
E) No treatment is necessary","Analyzing the situation, the 78-year-old woman presents with difficulty locating objects, which may be a manifestation of her Alzheimer's dementia. However, the focus of the question is on the management of her urinary tract infection (UTI) as indicated by the urinalysis findings, which include positive leukocyte esterase, presence of WBCs, positive nitrites, and RBCs. Given her age and medical history, it's essential to consider the most effective and safest antibiotic option.

Option A, TMP-SMX, is a common choice for UTIs but may not be the best option in this case due to the patient's age and potential kidney function issues. Option B, Nitrofurantoin, is effective against Enterobacter but requires careful consideration due to the patient's age and potential kidney function issues. Option C, Levofloxacin, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against Enterobacter and is often used in older adults. Option D, Cephalexin, is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against Enterobacter and is generally well-tolerated in older adults.

Considering the patient's medical history and the presence of Enterobacter in the urine culture, the most appropriate next step is to treat the UTI with an effective antibiotic. Among the options provided, Cephalexin is a reasonable choice due to its effectiveness against Enterobacter and its relatively favorable safety profile in older adults.

552,"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?
A) Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes
B) Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase
C) Decreased proteolysis
D) Increased lipoprotein lipase activity
E) Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells","Let's break down the scenario step by step. The 13-year-old boy presents with confusion, abdominal pain, vomiting, frequent urination, polydipsia, and significant weight loss over a short period. His vital signs indicate tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypothermia, and his physical examination reveals disorientation, abdominal tenderness, and guarding. Laboratory tests show severe hyperglycemia (754 mg/dL) and acidosis (pH 7.19), which are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus.

In DKA, the body produces ketones due to a lack of insulin, leading to acidosis. Insulin deficiency also results in decreased glucose uptake by cells, increased lipolysis, and proteolysis. Considering the options provided, the most likely effect of insulin deficiency in this patient would be decreased glucose uptake by cells. However, the options specifically mention ""adipocytes,"" ""brain cells,"" and other effects. Among these, decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes is a direct consequence of insulin deficiency, as insulin normally promotes glucose uptake in adipocytes.

25,"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Intubate with mechanical ventilation
B) Perform needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space
C) Perform bronchoscopy
D) Provide helium and oxygen mixture
E) Provide additional dose of methylprednisolone","The patient, a 6-year-old boy with asthma and eczema, presented with worsening wheezing and shortness of breath, which is indicative of an asthma exacerbation. He was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium, as well as intravenous methylprednisolone, but subsequently became limp and lethargic. The administration of magnesium sulfate resulted in the resolution of wheezing, but the patient's condition remains concerning due to the lethargy.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to ensure the patient's airway is secure, given the lethargy and potential for respiratory depression. However, since the wheezing has resolved and there is no indication of severe respiratory distress, immediate intubation may not be necessary. Instead, close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and level of consciousness is crucial.

Among the options provided, the best course of action would be to provide a helium and oxygen mixture (heliox) to help reduce airway resistance and improve ventilation, thereby alleviating any potential respiratory distress. This approach is particularly useful in patients with asthma exacerbations who have responded to initial treatments but may still require support to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

1113,"An 18-year-old patient is visiting the pediatrician with her mother for her annual exam before college starts. Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn’t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, “Nobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I’ll end up getting rejected.” Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter’s behavior?
A) Schizotypal personality disorder
B) Generalized anxiety disorder
C) Avoidant personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Dependent personality disorder","To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Social Isolation and Loneliness**: The patient is described as socially isolated and feeling lonely, which indicates difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships.
2. **Shyness and Withdrawal**: Her shy and withdrawn behavior, especially in new or unfamiliar situations, suggests a pattern of avoidance due to feelings of inadequacy.
3. **Sensitivity to Criticism**: The patient is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family members, which further indicates low self-esteem and a fear of rejection.
4. **Lack of Participation in Extracurricular Activities**: Despite interests in art and music, she hasn't participated in any extracurricular activities due to feelings of being untalented and a fear of rejection.
5. **Fear of Rejection and Negative Self-Image**: Her reaction to her mother's suggestion to invite friends over, bursting into tears and expressing a negative self-image (""too lame and ugly""), strongly suggests a deep-seated fear of rejection and low self-esteem.

Given these observations, the most fitting diagnosis would be one that encompasses social avoidance due to feelings of inadequacy, fear of rejection, and a pattern of low self-esteem.

**Avoidant Personality Disorder (AVPD)** is characterized by pervasive feelings of social inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection, and social inhibition. Individuals with AVPD often avoid social interactions due to fear of criticism or rejection, which aligns with the patient's behavior and expressed feelings.

C) Minor allergic reaction; discontinue transfusion
D) Hemolytic transfusion reaction; administer antihistamines
E) Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion","The patient, a 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease, experiences a severe reaction shortly after the initiation of a blood transfusion. The symptoms include fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the intravenous (IV) site, and sudden hypotension. These symptoms are indicative of a hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. A hemolytic transfusion reaction occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood type of the donor and the recipient, leading to the destruction of red blood cells. In this case, the reaction is likely due to the presence of antibodies against the transfused blood.

The best treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction is to immediately discontinue the transfusion to prevent further hemolysis and to administer supportive care to manage the symptoms. Discontinuing the transfusion is crucial to prevent further damage, and administering antihistamines is not sufficient to manage this severe reaction.

Ultrasound of the liver and kidneys shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?""
A) Adverse effect of ibuprofen
B) Decreased cardiac ejection fraction
C) Renal deposition of AL amyloid
D) Increased serum amyloid A production
E) Renal deposition of anti-dsDNA immune complexes","The patient presents with fatigue, swelling of his legs and feet, puffy eyes in the mornings, and frothy urine, which suggests nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by significant proteinuria (protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low albumin in the blood), and edema (swelling). The laboratory results support this diagnosis, showing 3+ proteinuria, low serum albumin (2.8 g/dl), and edema.

The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the presence of rheumatoid factor suggest an autoimmune component. The most likely cause of this patient's findings is the deposition of immune complexes in the kidneys, which is a common complication of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the specific type of immune complex deposition is not clear from the information provided.

Among the options, choice C, renal deposition of AL amyloid, is a possible cause of nephrotic syndrome in patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. AL amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins (amyloid) accumulate in the kidneys and other organs, leading to damage and dysfunction. However, this diagnosis would typically require a kidney biopsy to confirm the presence of amyloid deposits.

Choice E, renal deposition of anti-dsDNA immune complexes, is more commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

The other options are less likely to be the primary cause of this patient's findings. Choice A, adverse effect of ibuprofen, could contribute to kidney damage, but it is unlikely to be the primary cause of nephrotic syndrome. Choice B, decreased cardiac ejection fraction, could lead to edema, but it would not explain the proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. Choice D, increased serum amyloid A production, is associated with AA amyloidosis, which is a different type of amyloidosis that is more commonly seen in patients with chronic infections or inflammatory diseases.

Abdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Colonoscopy shows dark colored mucosa with interspersed white spots. Biopsies of colonic mucosa are obtained and sent for pathological evaluation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?""
A) Celiac disease
B) Carcinoid tumor
C) VIPoma
D) Irritable bowel syndrome
E) Medication abuse","The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting with persistent diarrhea and fatigue for 1 month, with up to 12 watery stools per day, abdominal bloating, cramps, and a 2-kg weight loss. She recently returned from a trip to Costa Rica 7 weeks ago. Her laboratory studies show a low potassium level (hypokalemia) and a high bicarbonate level (metabolic acidosis). The abdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities, but the colonoscopy reveals dark-colored mucosa with interspersed white spots.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of a secretory diarrhea, which is characterized by a high volume of watery stools, often accompanied by hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. The colonoscopy findings of dark-colored mucosa with interspersed white spots are consistent with melanosis coli, which is a condition associated with the use of laxatives.

Given the patient's history of bulimia nervosa and her profession as a nurse, which may provide her with access to medications, it is likely that she is abusing laxatives or other medications that can cause secretory diarrhea. The patient's denial of medication abuse is not uncommon in patients with eating disorders or substance abuse.

The other options are less likely to be the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Celiac disease (A) typically presents with malabsorptive diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, but the patient's colonoscopy findings and laboratory studies are not consistent with this diagnosis. Carcinoid tumor (B) and VIPoma (C) are rare tumors that can cause secretory diarrhea, but they are not as likely to be the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms given the absence of other systemic symptoms and the patient's history of bulimia nervosa. Irritable bowel syndrome (D) is a functional disorder that can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, but it is not typically associated with secretory diarrhea or hypokalemia.

689,"A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and binge drinks alcohol after work and on the weekends. He underwent an appendectomy when he was 14 years old. He is a long-distance truck driver. Neither of his parents had any significant medical history. His temperature is 37.7°C (100°F), blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and BMI is 25 kg/m2. On examination, his right first metatarsophalangeal joint is very tender, swollen, warm, and red in color. Range of motion cannot be assessed due to extreme tenderness.
Laboratory test
Complete blood count:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 16,000/mm3
Platelets 150,000/mm3
ESR 50 mm/hr
Synovial fluid is aspirated from the joint. The findings are:
Appearance Cloudy, dense yellow
WBC 30,000 cells/µL
Culture Negative
Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?
A) Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion
B) Increased renal reabsorption of urate
C) Lysis of large numbers of cells
D) Deficiency of HGPRT
E) High-purine diet","Let's break down the case step by step.

The patient is a 55-year-old man who presents with severe pain in his right toe, which woke him up. The pain is accompanied by tenderness, swelling, warmth, and redness in the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. The patient has a history of smoking and binge drinking, which may contribute to his condition.

Laboratory tests reveal a low hemoglobin level, elevated leukocyte count, and elevated ESR. The synovial fluid aspirate from the joint shows cloudy, dense yellow fluid with a high WBC count and negative culture. However, the most significant finding is the presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate.

The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals is characteristic of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, which are seen in gout. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of MSU crystals in the joints.

Now, let's consider the possible underlying causes of gout:

A) Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion: This is a possible cause of gout, as certain organic acids can compete with urate for secretion in the kidneys, leading to increased urate levels.

B) Increased renal reabsorption of urate: This is another possible cause of gout, as increased reabsorption of urate in the kidneys can lead to elevated urate levels.

C) Lysis of large numbers of cells: This is not a typical cause of gout, as gout is usually caused by elevated urate levels, not cell lysis.

D) Deficiency of HGPRT: This is a rare genetic disorder that can cause gout, but it is not the most likely cause in this case.

E) High-purine diet: This is a possible contributing factor to gout, as a diet high in purines can increase urate levels.

Considering the patient's history and laboratory findings, the most likely underlying cause of his condition is related to his diet and lifestyle. However, the exact cause is not explicitly stated in the options. Among the options provided, the most plausible answer is:

1107,"A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Bipolar I disorder
B) Bipolar II disorder
C) Cyclothymic disorder
D) Persistent depressive disorder
E) Schizoaffective disorder","Analyzing the patient's symptoms, the 35-year-old woman reports experiencing periods of depressed mood lasting 4-6 weeks, along with sleep disturbances and poor appetite. However, she is sometimes able to enjoy spending time with her family, indicating that her depressive episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. Additionally, she reports experiencing episodes of elevated mood, increased productivity, and reduced sleep requirements, which have been occurring over the past ten years. These elevated mood episodes do not seem to be severe enough to meet the criteria for a manic episode, as there is no mention of psychotic symptoms, reckless behavior, or significant impairment in social or occupational functioning.

Given the duration and characteristics of her mood episodes, the most likely diagnosis is cyclothymic disorder. Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic mood disorder characterized by periods of hypomanic symptoms (elevated mood, increased energy, and reduced sleep requirements) and periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. The symptoms must last for at least two years, and there must be no periods of two months or longer where the symptoms are absent.

The other options are less likely because:
- Bipolar I disorder is characterized by the presence of at least one manic episode, which is not present in this patient.
- Bipolar II disorder is characterized by the presence of at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, which is not present in this patient.
- Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood that lasts for two years or more, but this patient's depressive episodes are not continuous and are interspersed with periods of elevated mood.
- Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by the presence of psychotic symptoms, which are not present in this patient.

D) Administer lactulose
E) Administer vitamin B1","The patient's presentation of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, irritability, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness, along with the inability to recall her husband's name or their address, suggests a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. The recent placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) one month ago and the history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis support this diagnosis. The physical examination findings of scleral icterus, jaundice, telangiectasias, palmar erythema, and a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed are also consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer lactulose, which is a non-absorbable disaccharide that helps reduce ammonia levels in the blood by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Elevated ammonia levels are a key contributor to the development of hepatic encephalopathy.

The 76-year-old man presents with low back pain and weakness that have progressed over the past 4 weeks. The pain is described as sharp, radiating to his left side, and having a burning quality. Additionally, he has experienced a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months, along with significant weight loss. His symptoms have progressed to the point where he is unable to walk without assistance and is experiencing constipation and difficulty urinating.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, for which he is treated with enalapril, and a significant smoking history of 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His neurological examination reveals 3/5 strength of the lower extremities, hyperreflexive deep tendon reflexes, a present Babinski sign bilaterally, and decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome.

The chest x-ray shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs, which, in the context of his symptoms and history, raises concern for metastatic disease, particularly given his smoking history.

Considering the patient's severe pain, inability to lie recumbent, and neurological findings, the most appropriate next step is to initiate treatment to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms, especially given the likelihood of spinal cord compression due to metastasis.

Among the options provided, intravenous dexamethasone therapy is the most appropriate choice for immediate management to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms, particularly in the context of suspected spinal cord compression.

1204,"A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?
A) Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption.
B) Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products.
C) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.
D) The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed.
E) This patient has no contraindications for bupropion and may safely use it.","To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's medical history and the characteristics of the medication in question, which is bupropion. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is also used for smoking cessation.

First, let's address the patient's medical history. He has a history of head trauma followed by two seizure episodes but is not currently on any antiepileptic medication. This is a crucial point because bupropion is known to lower the seizure threshold, which means it can increase the risk of seizures in susceptible individuals.

Now, let's evaluate the options provided:

A) Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption. - This statement is not accurate regarding the interaction between omeprazole and bupropion.

B) Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products. - This is not true; bupropion can be effective for smoking cessation when used alone.

C) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder. - This statement is correct. Given the patient's history of seizures, this is a significant concern.

D) The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed. - While cardiac conditions can be a consideration for certain medications, this is not specifically relevant to the use of bupropion in this context.

E) This patient has no contraindications for bupropion and may safely use it. - This statement is incorrect given the patient's history of seizures.

Considering the patient's history of seizures and the known effect of bupropion on lowering the seizure threshold, the correct answer is the one that highlights this contraindication.

His temperature is 39.1°C (103.1°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
A) Ceftriaxone and azithromycin
B) Ertapenem
C) Colistin
D) Cefepime and levofloxacin
E) Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate","The patient is a 68-year-old man presenting with symptoms of a severe respiratory infection, including cough, dyspnea, fever, and productive green phlegm. His medical history is significant for metastatic colon cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and long-term smoking. The patient's vital signs indicate severe infection with a high fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. The pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, indicating hypoxemia. The pulmonary examination reveals diffuse crackles and rhonchi, and the chest x-ray shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate, consistent with pneumonia.

Given the severity of the patient's presentation and the presence of gram-negative rods on the endotracheal aspirate Gram stain, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is necessary. The patient's history of COPD and recent chemotherapy also increases the risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which requires specific antibiotic coverage.

Among the options provided, choice D, Cefepime and levofloxacin, offers broad-spectrum coverage against gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with activity against Pseudomonas, while levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity. This combination provides adequate coverage for the patient's severe pneumonia and addresses the risk of Pseudomonas infection.

A) Chemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation
B) Chemotherapy and radiation
C) Chemotherapy
D) Surgical resection
E) Hormone replacement therapy","To approach this question, let's break down the key findings from the patient's presentation and laboratory results.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 14-year-old teenager presenting with headaches, excessive fatigue, weight gain despite a healthy diet, frequent urination, nonpitting edema, decreased reflexes, orthostatic hypotension, papilledema, and bitemporal hemianopsia. These symptoms collectively point towards a condition affecting multiple systems, including the endocrine system, given the broad range of symptoms.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient's lab results show hyponatremia (low sodium), hypokalemia (low potassium), hypochloremia (low chloride), metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), and low glucose levels. Additionally, the patient has a low TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level and low free T4 levels, indicating secondary hypothyroidism.

3. **Diagnosis**: The combination of these findings, particularly the visual field defects (bitemporal hemianopsia) and the endocrine abnormalities, strongly suggests a pituitary tumor, likely a craniopharyngioma or an adenoma, which is compressing the pituitary gland and leading to hypopituitarism. The tumor's location near the optic chiasm explains the visual disturbances.

4. **Treatment**: Given the likely diagnosis of a pituitary tumor causing hypopituitarism and the patient's symptoms, the necessary treatment would involve addressing the tumor itself and replacing the deficient hormones.

Considering these points, the best answer is **E) Hormone replacement therapy** as part of the management, but the initial approach would likely involve **surgical resection** of the tumor if possible, followed by **hormone replacement therapy** to manage the hormonal deficiencies. However, among the provided options, the closest to addressing the hormonal deficiencies directly is hormone replacement therapy, although in practice, a multidisciplinary approach including surgery and possibly other treatments would be considered based on the tumor type and the patient's overall condition.

C) PAS-positive material in the small intestine
D) Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine
E) Crypt abscesses in the large intestine","The patient presents with abdominal pain that is relieved by eating more frequently and taking ibuprofen with food. This pattern of symptoms is suggestive of peptic ulcer disease (PUD), specifically duodenal ulcers.

HUS is characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation are consistent with this diagnosis. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (A) typically presents with palpable purpura, abdominal pain, and arthritis, which are not present in this case. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (B) is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms, but the patient's presentation and laboratory results do not fully support this diagnosis. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (D) is characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia, which is not present in this case. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (E) is characterized by a consumption coagulopathy, which is not present in this case.

An x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
A) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C) Elder abuse
D) Pseudohypoparathyroidism
E) Primary hyperparathyroidism","Analyzing the situation, the 63-year-old woman presents with severe pain in her lower back that radiates down the legs, which began two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis. Her medical history includes hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. Laboratory results show elevated serum urea nitrogen, glucose, and creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment. The x-ray of the spine reveals a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra.

Given her history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), secondary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely explanation for the findings. Secondary hyperparathyroidism often occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the inability of the kidneys to activate vitamin D, leading to decreased calcium absorption and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. Elevated PTH levels can cause bone resorption, leading to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.

While tertiary hyperparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism can also cause bone disease, the presence of chronic kidney disease and the absence of other symptoms make secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely explanation. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder that affects the response to PTH, but it is not directly related to chronic kidney disease. Elder abuse is not supported by the information provided.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Chikungunya
B) Dengue fever
C) Epstein-Barr virus
D) Hepatitis A
E) Typhoid fever","To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and the laboratory findings.

1. **Travel History**: The patient recently returned from a 2-week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. This is crucial because it exposes him to a range of infectious diseases endemic in those regions.

2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, pain in his hands and wrists, and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. These symptoms are suggestive of a systemic infection.

3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of tenderness over the bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints and a maculopapular rash supports the diagnosis of an infectious or inflammatory condition.

4. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has leukopenia (low leukocyte count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). These findings are indicative of a viral infection affecting the hematologic and hepatic systems.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Chikungunya**: This is a viral disease characterized by fever, joint pain, and swelling, typically transmitted by mosquitoes. The symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with chikungunya, especially considering the travel history to regions where this virus is endemic.

- **B) Dengue Fever**: While dengue fever also presents with fever, joint pain, and thrombocytopenia, the presence of a maculopapular rash and the specific pattern of laboratory abnormalities might not as closely align with dengue.

- **C) Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)**: EBV infection (causing infectious mononucleosis) could explain some symptoms and lab findings, but the travel history and specific symptomatology (like joint pain and rash) are less typical for EBV.

- **D) Hepatitis A**: Primarily affects the liver, and while it can cause elevated liver enzymes, the broader range of symptoms (joint pain, rash) and specific laboratory findings (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) are not as characteristic.

- **E) Typhoid Fever**: Caused by Salmonella Typhi, it presents with fever, abdominal pain, and sometimes rash, but the laboratory findings and symptom complex don't align as closely as they do with chikungunya.

782,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?
A) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
B) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
C) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
D) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
E) A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.","To determine which statement is most likely to be true regarding the experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions, let's consider the function of each blotting technique and the expected outcome based on the mechanism of HIF-1a regulation.

1. **Northern Blot**: This technique is used to detect RNA levels. Given that RCC can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia, we would expect an increase in HIF-1a mRNA levels in RCC under normoxic conditions compared to a normoxic control cell. However, comparing it to a hypoxic control cell might not show an increase since hypoxia naturally stabilizes HIF-1a.

2. **Southern Blot**: This technique is used to detect DNA sequences. Since the question is about detecting HIF-1a levels (which would be more relevant to RNA or protein levels in the context of expression), a Southern blot is not the best choice for comparing expression levels of HIF-1a in different conditions.

3. **Western Blot**: This technique is used to detect protein levels. Given that RCC inhibits HIF-1a hydroxylation, leading to its stabilization and accumulation even under normoxic conditions, a Western blot would likely show increased HIF-1a protein levels in RCC compared to a normoxic control cell.

Based on the above explanations, the statement that is most likely to be true regarding the experiment is related to the Western blot, as it directly measures protein levels, which would be affected by the stabilization of HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions.

655,"A mother brings her 18-year-old daughter to your office because she has not menstruated yet. They recently immigrated from another country, and do not have any previous medical records. The adolescent girl looks relatively short, but otherwise looks healthy. She has no complaints except for mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year. On physical examination, vitals are within normal limits. There is the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. You explain to the mother and the patient that you need to perform a complete vaginal examination, however, both of them declined the procedure and would prefer that lab test be performed. Her labs are significant for the following:
FSH 7 mIU/mL
Normal values:  
   Follicular phase 3.1 – 7.9 mIU/mL
   Ovulation peak 2.3 – 18.5 mIU/mL
   Luteal phase 1.4 – 5.5 mIU/mL

What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?
A) Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
B) Muellerian agenesis
C) Hyperprolactinemia
D) Turner syndrome
E) Androgen insensitivity","To determine the most likely diagnosis for this patient, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Age and Chief Complaint**: The patient is 18 years old and has not menstruated yet (primary amenorrhea), which indicates a potential issue with her reproductive system.

2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, indicating normal secondary sexual characteristics. This suggests that she has undergone normal pubertal development in terms of estrogen effects.

3. **Laboratory Results**:
   - FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) is within the normal range for the follicular phase, which does not indicate ovarian failure.
   - Estradiol levels are within the normal range for the mid-follicular phase, suggesting adequate estrogen production.
   - Testosterone levels are within the normal range, indicating no significant androgen excess or deficiency.

4. **Declining Vaginal Examination**: The patient and her mother declined a vaginal examination, which could be due to cultural or personal reasons but also might hint at a potential anatomical issue that they are aware of.

Given these points, the most plausible diagnosis is **Muellerian agenesis** (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome). This condition involves the congenital absence or underdevelopment of the vagina and uterus, which would explain the primary amenorrhea and the patient's reluctance to undergo a vaginal examination. However, individuals with this condition typically have normal ovarian function (as indicated by the patient's normal FSH and estradiol levels) and normal development of secondary sexual characteristics due to the presence of functioning ovaries.

**Other options can be ruled out as follows**:
- **Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)** would typically present with elevated FSH levels, which is not the case here.
- **Hyperprolactinemia** can cause amenorrhea but would not explain the normal FSH and estradiol levels or the reluctance to undergo a vaginal examination.
- **Turner syndrome** involves short stature and gonadal dysgenesis, leading to estrogen deficiency and elevated FSH levels, which does not match this patient's profile.
- **Androgen insensitivity** would result in a male karyotype (46,XY) with a female phenotype due to unresponsiveness to androgens, which does not align with the normal female development and hormone levels observed in this patient.

715,"A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain. He describes the pain as ripping and radiating to the back. The patient’s past medical history is significant for a heart murmur that is being followed by his outpatient cardiologist. He takes no medications. The patient works as a carpenter and reports being monogamous with his wife. He denies any history of intravenous drug use or recent travel. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature is 99.4°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to be in moderate distress and is clutching his chest. He is tall and has joint hypermobility. His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.

Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?
A) Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border
B) Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click
C) Mid-diastolic murmur at the apex with opening snap
D) Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
E) Systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 28-year-old male with chest pain that started suddenly while climbing stairs, described as ripping and radiating to the back, along with a history of a heart murmur, suggests a possible aortic dissection. The patient's physical exam findings of being in moderate distress, clutching his chest, and having weak distal pulses further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's tall stature and joint hypermobility are consistent with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of aortic dissection. Aortic dissection is often associated with a diastolic murmur due to aortic regurgitation, which is typically heard at the left lower sternal border. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is a mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
A) Diuretic overdose
B) Osmotic diuresis
C) Gastroinstestinal fluid loss
D) Excess production of aldosterone
E) Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone","To determine the most likely explanation for the patient's findings, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Symptoms and History**: The patient is a 75-year-old man presenting with a 7-day history of nausea and vomiting, followed by weakness, tiredness, and dizziness upon standing. He also reports increased urination but with a normal amount each time. He has hypertension and has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the past 6 months. He is well-hydrated, drinking 9 glasses of water per day.

2. **Physical Examination**: Key findings include whitening of the tongue, skin that retracts after 5 seconds when pinched (indicating dehydration), and slowed speech with orientation to person, place, and time.

3. **Laboratory Studies**:
   - **Serum**: Shows hypernatremia (Na+ 150 mEq/L), elevated serum osmolality (354 mOsm/kg), and a slightly elevated Hemoglobin A1C (10.5%), indicating hyperglycemia.
   - **Urine**: Has a high osmolality (400 mOsm/kg), which is indicative of concentrated urine.

Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with **osmotic diuresis**. This condition occurs when substances such as glucose, which is elevated in this patient (Hemoglobin A1C 10.5%), increase the osmotic pressure of blood and urine, leading to an increase in urine production. This results in dehydration and hypernatremia, as seen in the patient's serum studies. The high urine osmolality indicates that the kidneys are concentrating the urine appropriately in response to dehydration, but the presence of an osmotic diuretic (in this case, glucose) is preventing adequate water reabsorption.

The other options do not fully explain the patient's presentation:
- **A) Diuretic overdose**: While the patient is on a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), the presence of hypernatremia and dehydration with concentrated urine suggests an osmotic effect rather than a diuretic effect.
- **C) Gastrointestinal fluid loss**: The patient's vomiting could contribute to dehydration, but the laboratory findings, especially the high urine osmolality, point more towards an osmotic diuresis.
- **D) Excess production of aldosterone**: Would typically result in hypokalemia (low potassium), which is not present in this case.
- **E) Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)**: Would result in diabetes insipidus, characterized by dilute urine, which is not consistent with the patient's concentrated urine.

She notes that he has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but that they have not helped. She reports no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. The boy has no significant medical history. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. He is in the 85th percentile for height and weight, and he has been meeting all developmental milestones. His temperature is 37.8℃ (100.0℉). On physical examination, the patient has a prominent 8 × 8 cm mass over the right mandible. The mass has partially distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek. The overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?
A) Babesia microti
B) Bartonella henselae
C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
D) Epstein barr virus (EBV)
E) Yersinia pestis","To determine the microorganism associated with the patient's condition, we need to analyze the provided information. The 7-year-old boy presents with a 2-month history of increasing swelling of his right jaw, which has not responded to antibiotic treatment. The swelling is described as an 8 × 8 cm mass over the right mandible, with partial distortion of the borders of the mandible and cheek, and the overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The biopsy of the mass and histopathologic analysis are mentioned, but the specific findings are not described.

Given the clinical presentation of a jaw mass in a child, particularly one who has recently emigrated from Nigeria, we should consider endemic diseases that can cause such symptoms. The most likely diagnosis in this case is Burkitt lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is common in equatorial Africa. Burkitt lymphoma is known to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is a herpesvirus that can cause various types of cancer, including Burkitt lymphoma.

Therefore, the microorganism most likely associated with this patient's condition is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

246,"A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Computed tomography shows a small bowel perforation. The patient is prepared for emergent exploratory laparotomy. She is sedated with midazolam, induced with propofol, intubated, and maintained on nitrous oxide and isoflurane for the duration of the surgery. A single perforation in the terminal ileum is diagnosed intraoperatively and successfully repaired. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit. The ventilator is set at an FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 2.5 cm H2O. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 111/50 mm Hg. She is responsive to painful stimuli. Lung examination shows bilateral rales. Abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis shows:
pH 7.44
pO2 54 mm Hg
pCO2 31 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mm Hg
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""
A) Increase the FiO2
B) Extubate
C) Increase the tidal volume
D) Increase PEEP
E) Increase the respiratory rate","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's situation and the provided arterial blood gas (ABG) results.

The patient is a 70-year-old woman who underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for a small bowel perforation and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) on mechanical ventilation. The ventilator settings are as follows: FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2.5 cm H2O.

The ABG results show:
- pH 7.44, which is slightly alkalotic.
- pO2 54 mm Hg, which is low indicating hypoxemia.
- pCO2 31 mm Hg, which is low indicating hypocapnia.
- HCO3- 22 mm Hg, which is within the normal range.

Given the low pO2 level and the presence of bilateral rales on lung examination, the patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. The current FiO2 is 50%, and the patient is still hypoxemic, indicating the need for further adjustments to improve oxygenation.

Let's evaluate the options:

A) Increase the FiO2: This would be a reasonable step to improve oxygenation, but it's essential to consider the potential risks of high FiO2, such as oxygen toxicity.

B) Extubate: Given the patient's current respiratory status, extubation is not appropriate.

C) Increase the tidal volume: Increasing tidal volume could potentially improve oxygenation but also risks causing lung injury due to overdistension.

D) Increase PEEP: Increasing PEEP can help improve oxygenation by recruiting more alveoli and reducing atelectasis. Given the patient's current PEEP of 2.5 cm H2O, which is relatively low, increasing PEEP could be beneficial.

E) Increase the respiratory rate: While increasing the respiratory rate can help with ventilation, it may not directly address the issue of hypoxemia.

Considering the options, increasing PEEP is the most appropriate next step to improve oxygenation while minimizing the risk of lung injury.

908,"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks. The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
A) Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress
B) Upper endoscopy
C) Coronary angiography
D) Echocardiography at rest
E) Repeat ECG under treadmill stress","The patient is a 58-year-old woman presenting with intermittent painful retrosternal dullness that occurs with exertion or exposure to cold weather, accompanied by shortness of breath and palpitations. These symptoms are suggestive of angina pectoris, which is a sign of myocardial ischemia. Her medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both of which are risk factors for coronary artery disease. Given that her symptoms have increased in frequency over the past few days, it is crucial to evaluate her for coronary artery disease.

The patient's ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without signs of ischemia, but this does not rule out coronary artery disease. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range, which indicates that there is no evidence of acute myocardial infarction. However, this does not exclude the possibility of chronic ischemia.

Among the options provided, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress. This test is useful for evaluating coronary artery disease in patients who are unable to undergo exercise stress testing, such as this patient who walks with crutches due to a leg amputation. The test can help identify areas of myocardial ischemia and infarction, which would guide further management.

64,"An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?
A) Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder
B) Ultrasound the surgical site
C) Aggressive IV fluids
D) Digital rectal exam
E) Renal ultrasound","To determine the next best step in the treatment of this patient, let's consider the information provided. The patient is an 80-year-old man who underwent hernia surgery 14 hours ago and has been recovering well. However, upon arrival at the med-surg floor, it is noted that he has not passed urine since the surgery, which raises concerns about urinary retention. This is a common postoperative complication, especially in older adults and those who have received opioids like morphine for pain management.

Given the patient's discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis, and the lack of urination, the primary concern is to assess and address the potential urinary retention. The bladder scan was inconclusive due to the patient's body habitus, which means that another method is needed to determine if the patient's bladder is full.

Among the provided options, inserting a 'straight cath' into the patient's bladder (Option A) is the most direct and effective way to assess and address potential urinary retention. This procedure involves inserting a catheter into the bladder to drain the urine and relieve any retention. It is a common and generally safe procedure that can provide immediate relief and help to prevent further complications.

The other options are not directly relevant to addressing the patient's urinary retention. Ultrasound of the surgical site (Option B) might be useful if there were concerns about the surgical site itself, but it does not address the urinary issue. Aggressive IV fluids (Option C) might be helpful if the patient were dehydrated, but there is no indication of this in the provided information. A digital rectal exam (Option D) can provide some information about the prostate and rectum but is not the best way to assess urinary retention. A renal ultrasound (Option E) could provide information about the kidneys but is not the most direct way to address the immediate concern of urinary retention.

350,"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?
A) Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle
B) This patient has insulin resistance
C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient
D) The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
E) The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction","Analyzing the situation, the 16-year-old patient presents with an absence of menstruations for 6 months, which is a significant change from her normal menstrual cycle since menarche at age 12. She has intentionally restricted her diet, exercised intensively, and lost a substantial amount of weight (18.0 kg or 39.7 lb) over the past year and a half. Her physical examination reveals good muscle development but decreased adiposity, and a bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits.

Given these details, the patient's condition is likely related to the significant changes in her diet and exercise habits, leading to a substantial weight loss and decreased body fat. Among the provided options, decreased adiposity is known to contribute to hypoestrogenemia, as adipose tissue is involved in the production and regulation of estrogen levels. With less body fat, the patient would likely have lower levels of estrogen, which can disrupt menstrual cycles.

Therefore, the correct statement about this patient's condition is that decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia.

186,"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?
A) Help the parents to arrange supportive care at home
B) Refer the patient to another oncologist
C) Recommend for parents to take 2 weeks to think about decision
D) Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy
E) Attempt surgical resection of the tumor","This is a complex and sensitive situation, as the parents are refusing a potentially life-saving treatment for their child due to concerns about the side effects of chemotherapy. The physician must balance the parents' autonomy and right to make decisions for their child with the child's best interests and the potential consequences of forgoing treatment.

In this case, the child has been diagnosed with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that requires prompt and aggressive treatment to achieve the best possible outcomes. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the established standard of care for this condition, and it is likely that the tumor is unresectable without it.

Given the gravity of the situation, the physician should not simply help the parents arrange supportive care at home (A) or refer the patient to another oncologist (B), as this would not address the underlying issue of the parents' refusal of treatment. Similarly, recommending that the parents take 2 weeks to think about their decision (C) may not be sufficient, as the child's condition may deteriorate during this time.

Attempting surgical resection of the tumor (E) is not a viable option, as the tumor is likely to be unresectable without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Therefore, the most appropriate action by the physician would be to seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (D). This would involve petitioning the court to override the parents' decision and authorize the treatment that is in the child's best interests. This is a serious step that should not be taken lightly, but it may be necessary to ensure that the child receives the life-saving treatment they need.

833,"Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks’ gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?
A) Apical ballooning of the left ventricle
B) Allergic reaction to anesthetic agent
C) Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins
D) Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space
E) Systemic bacterial infection","Considering the 35-year-old woman's sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension 2 hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, along with her recent history of combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a severe and life-threatening condition. The presence of bright red blood in the cervical canal, significantly low hemoglobin concentration, and undetectable fibrinogen concentration point towards a coagulopathy. The patient's symptoms, including labored breathing, thready pulses, and crackles at both lung bases, are indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is most likely caused by amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins, which can trigger anaphylaxis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), leading to the observed symptoms and laboratory results.

288,"A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?
A) Doxycycline
B) Ciprofloxacin
C) Erythromycin
D) Piperacillin
E) Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time","To address this patient's condition, let's consider the key points from the scenario:

1. **Patient's History and Current Symptoms**: The patient has a history of COPD and has been experiencing an exacerbation of symptoms, including a persistent cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, along with the production of greenish-yellow sputum. These symptoms suggest a bacterial infection.

2. **COPD Exacerbation**: The patient's condition indicates an acute exacerbation of COPD, which is often triggered by bacterial infections. The presence of fever and purulent sputum supports this.

3. **Treatment Considerations**: The patient has already been started on oxygen and oral prednisone, which are standard treatments for exacerbations of COPD to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. However, given the indication of a bacterial infection, antibiotic therapy should also be considered.

4. **Antibiotic Choice**: For COPD exacerbations suspected to be caused by bacterial infections, antibiotics that cover common respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are recommended.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the provided options:

- **A. Doxycycline**: A reasonable choice for community-acquired pneumonia or mild exacerbations but might not be the first choice for more severe exacerbations or when coverage for H. influenzae is desired.
  
- **B. Ciprofloxacin**: A broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against many Gram-negative bacteria, including those commonly causing respiratory infections. It's a good option for COPD exacerbations, especially when oral therapy is preferred.

- **C. Erythromycin**: Less commonly used for COPD exacerbations due to increasing resistance among common pathogens.

- **D. Piperacillin**: A broad-spectrum penicillin often used in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor (e.g., tazobactam). It's more typically used in severe cases or when IV therapy is required.

- **E. Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time**: This option is incorrect given the clinical presentation suggesting a bacterial infection.

Given the clinical scenario and the need for effective coverage against common respiratory pathogens in a patient with a COPD exacerbation, **B. Ciprofloxacin** appears to be a reasonable choice, considering its broad-spectrum activity and the patient's ability to take oral medications.

A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?""
A) Escherichia coli infection
B) Parvovirus B19 infection
C) Disseminated intravascular coagulation
D) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
E) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura","To approach this question, let's analyze the key findings from the patient's presentation and laboratory results.

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 4-year-old girl presents with pallor and a rash, following a recent episode of diarrhea and vomiting. She also had a high fever and rash a month ago. The presence of petechiae on her trunk and extremities, along with diffuse abdominal tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds, suggests a systemic condition affecting multiple body systems.

2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has severe anemia (Hemoglobin 8 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 49,000/mm3), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear is indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Additionally, the patient has elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, suggesting renal impairment.

3. **Differential Diagnosis**: Given the combination of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, and the patient's clinical presentation, the differential diagnosis includes conditions that can cause thrombotic microangiopathy.

Considering these points, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Escherichia coli infection**: Certain strains of E. coli, such as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. This is a strong candidate given the patient's recent history of diarrhea and vomiting.

- **B) Parvovirus B19 infection**: While Parvovirus B19 can cause anemia, it typically does so through a different mechanism and is not commonly associated with the full spectrum of findings seen in this patient.

- **C) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: DIC can cause thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia but is typically associated with a more pronounced coagulopathy, which is not evident in this patient's laboratory results.

- **D) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)**: ITP can cause thrombocytopenia but does not typically cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or renal impairment.

- **E) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)**: TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal impairment, and neurological symptoms. However, the patient's presentation lacks the characteristic neurological findings of TTP.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely underlying cause is an E. coli infection leading to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

127,"An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her son after witnessing the patient fall and hit her head. The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient’s symptoms?
A) Herniation of the uncus
B) Herniation of the cingulate gyrus
C) Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery
D) Occlusion of the basilar artery
E) Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery","The patient's symptoms, including disorientation, a non-reactive pupil on the left, a visual field defect on the right, and weakness on the right upper and lower extremity, are indicative of a serious neurological condition. The CT scan of the head, although not provided, would likely show evidence of a space-occupying lesion or a shift in brain structures.

Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of warfarin, a bleeding event is a strong possibility. The symptoms described, including the dilated pupil on the left and the visual field defect on the right, suggest a mass effect that is compressing or stretching the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) on the left side. This pattern of deficits is most consistent with transtentorial herniation, specifically uncal herniation.

Uncal herniation occurs when the uncus of the temporal lobe herniates through the tentorial notch, compressing the midbrain and cranial nerves. This would explain the patient's symptoms, including the dilated pupil on the left, the visual field defect on the right, and the weakness on the right side of the body.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is herniation of the uncus.

544,"A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration. He says this started abruptly about 6 hours ago. He says that he has not noticed that anything that makes his pain better or worse. He also denies any other symptoms. He works as a long-haul truck driver, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?
A) ECG
B) V/Q scan
C) D-dimer
D) Lower extremity venous ultrasound
E) CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast","To approach this patient's presentation, it's essential to consider the differential diagnoses for sharp chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration, also known as pleuritic chest pain. The patient's recent travel history as a long-haul truck driver increases his risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Given the patient's low-risk profile for PE (based on the absence of severe symptoms, lack of significant comorbidities that would increase the risk of PE, and the clinical presentation not strongly suggesting PE), the most reasonable first step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism would be to perform a D-dimer test.

The D-dimer test is a sensitive but not specific test for thrombus formation. It is used as a screening tool to rule out PE in low-risk patients. A negative D-dimer result can effectively exclude PE in patients with a low pretest probability, thus avoiding the need for further imaging. This approach is in line with current clinical guidelines that recommend using the D-dimer test as an initial step in the diagnostic workup for PE in patients with a low clinical probability of PE.

A) ECG is not specific for PE and can be normal even in the presence of a large PE.
B) V/Q scan is typically used when CT pulmonary angiogram is not feasible, such as in patients with significant renal impairment.
C) D-dimer is the correct choice for a low-risk patient as it can effectively rule out PE with a negative result.
D) Lower extremity venous ultrasound is used to diagnose DVT, not PE, although finding a DVT would increase the likelihood of also having a PE.
E) CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast is the gold standard for diagnosing PE but is typically reserved for patients with a higher clinical probability of PE or those with a positive D-dimer result.

1173,"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Vaginal exam under anesthesia
B) Report to child protective services
C) Vaginal culture
D) Warm water irrigation of the vagina
E) Reassurance","The four-day-old neonate presents with a blood-tinged vaginal discharge, which is a common finding in newborns due to the withdrawal of maternal hormones after birth. The mother's concern is understandable, but the neonate's overall health and behavior, such as feeding and voiding well, suggest that the discharge is likely a normal physiological response. The prenatal history of chlamydia in the mother is noted, but both the mother and her partner were treated, and the test of cure was negative, making it less likely that the neonate has a chlamydial infection. The presence of a new partner in the mother's life raises the possibility of potential abuse, but there are no visible signs of trauma or neglect on the neonate's skin. Given these factors, the best next step in management is to reassure the mother that the discharge is likely a normal finding in newborns and does not require further intervention at this time.

129,"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
A) Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy
B) Inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound
C) Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy
D) Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
E) Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient is a 47-year-old woman presenting with progressive muscle weakness over five months, particularly affecting the muscles in her shoulders and hips. She also experiences difficulty swallowing solid foods. These symptoms suggest a muscular disorder. 

Her laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which are indicative of muscle damage. The patient's family history of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, is also relevant.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory muscle disease, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Polymyositis is characterized by muscle inflammation and damage, leading to progressive weakness. Dermatomyositis is similar but also involves skin manifestations.

To confirm the diagnosis, a muscle biopsy is typically performed. The biopsy would show inflammation and muscle damage. Specifically, perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy is characteristic of dermatomyositis, but in the absence of skin manifestations, the findings would be more consistent with polymyositis, which typically shows endomysial inflammation.

Considering the options provided:
A) Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy is not typical for polymyositis or dermatomyositis.
B) Inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound is more suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis.
C) Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy is characteristic of dermatomyositis, but given the lack of skin manifestations, this might not be the best fit.
D) Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are indicative of myasthenia gravis, which presents differently.
E) Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis is specific for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy, not consistent with the patient's presentation or age of onset.

Given the patient's presentation and the options provided, the best answer is not a perfect match for polymyositis, which would typically show endomysial inflammation. However, among the options provided, the closest to confirming a diagnosis of an inflammatory muscle disease like polymyositis (given the absence of a perfect match) would involve inflammation on muscle biopsy.

548,"A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after his wife noticed during breakfast that the left side of his face was drooping. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and shoes before coming to the hospital. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He drinks one glass of wine daily. He is alert and oriented to time, place and person. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 99/min and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows equal and reactive pupils. There is drooping of the left side of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and lower extremities. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left side. Speech is dysarthric. There is a bruit on the right side of the neck. Fundoscopy shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum concentrations of glucose and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) MRI of the brain
B) Lumbar puncture
C) Duplex ultrasonography of the neck
D) Cerebral angiography
E) CT scan of the head","Considering the 62-year-old man's presentation with sudden onset of left-sided facial drooping, difficulty with dressing, decreased muscle strength in the left upper and lower extremities, extensor plantar reflex on the left side, and dysarthric speech, it is highly suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. Given the time frame of 40 minutes since the onset of symptoms, the most critical step is to quickly determine if the patient is a candidate for thrombolytic therapy, which is time-sensitive. A non-contrast CT scan of the head is the fastest and most appropriate initial imaging study to rule out hemorrhagic stroke and assess for potential ischemic changes, thereby guiding further management, including potential thrombolysis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a CT scan of the head.

281,"A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?
A) Alprazolam
B) Cognitive behavioral therapy
C) Fluoxetine
D) Psychodynamic psychotherapy
E) Zolpidem","The patient's symptoms and behavior are characteristic of a specific phobia, in this case, aviophobia or fear of flying. The patient's fear is irrational, and he recognizes it, but it significantly affects his life, causing him distress and impairment in his relationships and job. 

The best therapy for specific phobias, including aviophobia, is exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the phobia. Exposure-based CBT involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared situation (in this case, flying) in a controlled and safe environment, helping the patient become desensitized to the fear and eventually able to manage it.

Medications such as alprazolam (A) may be used to treat anxiety symptoms but are not a long-term solution for specific phobias. Fluoxetine (C) is an antidepressant that may be used to treat anxiety disorders but is not the first-line treatment for specific phobias. Psychodynamic psychotherapy (D) may be helpful in exploring underlying causes of the phobia, but it is not as effective as CBT in treating specific phobias. Zolpidem (E) is a sleep aid and is not relevant to the treatment of specific phobias.

The physician suspects that the patient is suffering from a chronic lung infection. Which of the following statements best describes the type of lung inflammation in this patient?
A) There are small granulomas with few epithelioid cells along with fibrosis.
B) It has a granuloma with Anitchov cells around a core of fibrinoid collagen necrosis.
C) It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.
D) An ill-defined granuloma with macrophages and epithelioid cells is seen in this type of inflammation.
E) This type of granulomatous inflammation is also seen in histoplasmosis.","The patient's symptoms, including low-grade fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, productive cough, and night sweats, along with the radiographic finding of consolidation in the apical part of the right lung, are suggestive of a chronic lung infection. The laboratory results, such as anemia, elevated white blood cell count with lymphocytosis, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, further support this diagnosis. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms and the radiographic findings, the most likely diagnosis is tuberculosis (TB). TB is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are aggregates of immune cells that attempt to contain the infection. The granulomas in TB are typically well-circumscribed and consist of epithelioid cells, Langhans giant cells, and fibrosis. Therefore, the type of lung inflammation in this patient is best described as a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.

E) Lamivudine","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 53-year-old male with a history of fatigue and joint and muscle pain for 6 months, along with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina, and a history of intravenous drug use, is found to have positive Hepatitis C IgG and a high HCV RNA level of 100,000,000 IU/ml. This indicates that the patient has chronic hepatitis C infection, which can cause fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and liver inflammation.

The patient's laboratory results show that he has not been infected with hepatitis A, and he has not been vaccinated against hepatitis B, as evidenced by the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen. However, he has been exposed to hepatitis B in the past, as indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface IgG. The patient's high HCV RNA level indicates that he has an active hepatitis C infection.

634,"A 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed last year. He also experienced a head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures. His only medication is daily phenytoin, which was restarted after he had a seizure 3 months ago. His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:

D) Mononucleosis
E) Phenytoin-induced adenopathy","Analyzing the 25-year-old man's presentation, he has a painless swelling of the neck with multiple non-tender lymph nodes palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and he is on daily phenytoin for residual seizures. Laboratory studies show a normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The histopathologic analysis of the excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is not provided, but given the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis can be deduced.

The patient's HIV infection is a crucial factor in this case, as it increases his susceptibility to various opportunistic infections and malignancies, including lymphomas. The presence of painless lymphadenopathy, particularly in the cervical region, is a common presentation of lymphoma in HIV-infected individuals.

Considering the options provided:

A) Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is unlikely, as it typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and bone marrow failure, which are not present in this case.

B) Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) is a possibility, as it often presents with painless lymphadenopathy, particularly in the cervical region. The histopathologic analysis would be crucial in confirming this diagnosis.

C) HIV lymphadenopathy is a common condition in HIV-infected individuals, but it typically presents with systemic symptoms and a more widespread lymphadenopathy.

D) Mononucleosis is unlikely, as it typically presents with fever, sore throat, and fatigue, which are not present in this case.

E) Phenytoin-induced adenopathy is a rare condition, and the patient's lymphadenopathy is unlikely to be caused by his phenytoin medication.

Given the patient's HIV infection and the presence of painless lymphadenopathy, the most likely diagnosis is a lymphoma. The histopathologic analysis would be crucial in confirming the specific type of lymphoma.

277,"A 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma on chemotherapy presents to his oncologist for a follow-up visit. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he reports that he recently developed multiple “spots” all over his body. He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient’s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Results from a complete blood count are shown below:
Hemoglobin: 11.9 mg/dl
Hematocrit: 35%
Leukocyte count: 5,000/mm^3
Platelet count: 20,000/mm^3

The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?
A) Interleukin 2
B) Interleukin 8
C) Interleukin 11
D) Erythropoietin
E) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor","To approach this question, let's consider the patient's presentation and laboratory results. The patient has a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma and is undergoing chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin. He has developed a rash and has a low platelet count of 20,000/mm^3, which is a significant concern for the oncologist as it may limit the optimal dose and frequency of the chemotherapy regimen.

The patient's low platelet count is likely due to the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy, which can cause bone marrow suppression leading to decreased production of blood cells, including platelets. In this scenario, the oncologist is looking for a recombinant version of a growth factor that can help stimulate the production of platelets.

Among the options provided, the recombinant version of Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is the most appropriate choice. IL-11 is a thrombopoietic growth factor that stimulates the production of platelets. It is used to prevent severe thrombocytopenia and reduce the need for platelet transfusions in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

The other options are not directly relevant to the patient's low platelet count. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is an immunomodulatory cytokine that stimulates the proliferation of T cells, but it is not typically used to stimulate platelet production. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils and other leukocytes, but it is not directly involved in platelet production. Erythropoietin is a growth factor that stimulates the production of red blood cells, but it is not relevant to the patient's thrombocytopenia. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a growth factor that stimulates the production of white blood cells, but it is not directly involved in platelet production.

1024,"A 38-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of new bilateral blisters on her hands. She says that she first noticed these blisters shortly after returning from a weekend trip to the beach two weeks prior. She denies any fevers, joint pains, or other skin rash during this period. The patient works in the adult entertainment industry. On examination, there are multiple flaccid blisters of the bilateral dorsal hands with hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation. In addition, increased hair growth is noted on the bilateral malar cheeks. Her temperature is 99.1° F (37.3° C), pulse is 95/min, blood pressure is 130/87 mmHg, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Her laboratory results are:

Na+: 140 mEq/L
K+: 4.5 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 21 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL

Anti-nuclear antibody titer 1:320

Which of the following would confirm the diagnosis in this patient?
A) Anti dsDNA titers
B) C-reactive protein
C) Anti-hemidesmosome titers
D) Urine porphyrin levels
E) Tzanck smear","To determine the diagnosis for the 38-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia who presents with new bilateral blisters on her hands, we need to consider the symptoms and laboratory results provided.

The patient's symptoms of multiple flaccid blisters on the bilateral dorsal hands with hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation, along with increased hair growth on the bilateral malar cheeks, suggest an autoimmune or porphyria-related condition. The recent exposure to the sun during her weekend trip to the beach may have triggered the symptoms.

The laboratory results show a mild leukocytosis, normal hemoglobin, and thrombocytosis. The anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer is elevated at 1:320, which is consistent with her history of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the ANA titer is not specific for lupus and can be elevated in other autoimmune conditions.

To confirm the diagnosis, we need to consider the options provided:

A) Anti-dsDNA titers: This test is specific for systemic lupus erythematosus, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not strongly suggest a lupus flare.

B) C-reactive protein: This test is a non-specific marker of inflammation and would not confirm a specific diagnosis.

C) Anti-hemidesmosome titers: This test is specific for bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune condition that presents with blisters, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not strongly suggest this diagnosis.

D) Urine porphyrin levels: This test is specific for porphyria, a group of disorders that can present with blistering skin lesions, hypertrichosis, and sensitivity to sunlight. The patient's symptoms and recent sun exposure make this a plausible diagnosis.

E) Tzanck smear: This test is used to diagnose herpes simplex and varicella-zoster infections, which do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is porphyria, specifically porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), which is associated with blistering skin lesions, hypertrichosis, and sensitivity to sunlight.

E) Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months","Let's break down the developmental milestones for each child:

1. The first child:
   - Breastfeeds well and voids at least eight times per day, indicating good hydration and renal function.
   - Yellow-colored stools and no straining suggest normal bowel movements.
   - Can lift his head and chest when in the prone position, which is a milestone typically achieved around 1-2 months of age.
   - Can track an object with his eyes to the midline, which is also consistent with this age range.
   - Hands remaining fisted 50% of the time is also normal for this age.

2. The second child:

B) Administer hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG)
C) Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG
D) Check hepatitis B serology
E) Check liver enzymes","To approach this question, let's break down the key points provided:

1. **Mother's Hepatitis B Status**: The mother is known to have hepatitis B, but the specifics of her status (e.g., whether she is infectious, chronic, or has been treated) are not detailed in the question stem. However, the serology results provided give us more insight.

2. **Newborn's Risk**: The newborn is at risk of acquiring hepatitis B from the mother, particularly during delivery. The risk is higher if the mother is positive for HBsAg and HBeAg, indicating she is infectious.

3. **Provided Serology Results**:
   - **HBsAg positive**: Indicates the mother is infected with hepatitis B.
   - **HBeAg positive**: Suggests the mother has a high viral load and is infectious.
   - **IgM HBc negative**: Indicates the mother's infection is not acute.
   - **Total anti-HBc positive**: Shows the mother has been infected with hepatitis B at some point.
   - **Anti-HBs negative**: Indicates the mother is not immune to hepatitis B.
   - **Anti-HBc negative**: This result seems to contradict the ""Total anti-HBc positive"" result, but in the context of the question, it might be a typographical error or misunderstanding since the presence of HBsAg and HBeAg already indicates infection.
   - **HBV DNA greater than 1 million IU/mL**: Confirms the mother has a high viral load.

Given the mother's infectious status (HBsAg and HBeAg positive), the best course of action to prevent the newborn from acquiring hepatitis B is to administer both the hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG). The vaccine will provide long-term immunity, while HBIG will offer immediate, short-term protection against the virus.

Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?
A) Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential
B) Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient
C) Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels
D) Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption
E) Reduction in myocardial contractility","The patient presents with symptoms of heart failure, including difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling. The physical examination findings, such as distended neck veins, bilateral pitting edema, and coarse crepitations over the lung bases, further support this diagnosis. The medication prescribed for his symptoms changes his cardiac physiology, as depicted by the dashed line recorded post-medication.

The dashed line likely represents a decrease in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and an increase in the cardiac output. This suggests that the medication is working to reduce the preload and afterload on the heart, allowing it to pump more efficiently.

Considering the options provided, the mechanism of action that best explains the observed changes in cardiac physiology is preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels. This would lead to a decrease in venous return and a subsequent decrease in LVEDP, allowing the heart to pump more efficiently.

D) Methotrexate
E) Dilation and curettage","Let's break down the situation step by step. The 27-year-old woman, who is 13 weeks pregnant, presents with profuse bleeding, dizziness, and weakness. Her vital signs indicate hypotension (90/60 mm Hg), tachycardia (125/min), and a slightly elevated temperature (37.8°C or 100°F). The pelvic examination reveals blood in the vagina, an open cervical os, cervical motion tenderness, and adnexal tenderness. The ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity with no fetal movement or cardiac activity, and a repeated scan after a couple of hours shows slight downward migration of the gestational sac with no change in the fetal status.

Given these findings, the patient is experiencing a miscarriage, specifically an incomplete abortion, where the fetus has not developed or has died, but the products of conception have not been fully expelled from the uterus. The presence of an open cervical os and the downward migration of the gestational sac indicate that the miscarriage is in progress.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the ultrasound findings, the next step in management would be to complete the evacuation of the uterus to prevent further bleeding and potential infection. Among the options provided, dilation and curettage (D&C) is the most appropriate procedure to remove the remaining products of conception from the uterus.

The physical exam revealed signs of dehydration, including dry mucous membranes, and abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding. The absence of appendicitis on ultrasound and the presence of guaiac-positive stool suggest a gastrointestinal infection. The development of lower extremity weakness and tingling, along with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes, indicates neurological involvement.

Considering the progression of symptoms and the presence of neurological findings, the most likely diagnosis is Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder that can be triggered by certain infections, including gastrointestinal pathogens. The characteristic laboratory finding in GBS is an increase in cerebrospinal fluid protein with a normal cell count, which reflects the demyelination of nerve roots.

A) Inferior vena cava thrombosis
B) Cutaneous xanthomas
C) Butterfly-shaped vertebrae
D) Increased CA 19-9 levels
E) Kayser-Fleischer rings
""","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient presents with a 3-month history of fatigue, generalized itchiness that started approximately 2 months ago, and yellowing of her eyes (jaundice) that began two weeks ago. The physical examination confirms jaundice of the conjunctivae and skin, dry mucous membranes of the mouth, a palpable liver edge, and generalized skin excoriations.

Laboratory studies reveal elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT), increased total and direct bilirubin, and normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. The patient is negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and core IgM antibody, positive for hepatitis B surface antibody, and negative for hepatitis C antibody. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows mildly increased echogenicity of the liver.

Given these findings, the patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis, jaundice, and ultimately cirrhosis. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin levels, along with the patient's symptoms of fatigue, itchiness, and jaundice, are typical of PBC.

Among the provided options, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be related to the complications or associated conditions of PBC. Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are deposits of copper in the Descemet membrane of the cornea, are a feature of Wilson's disease but can also be seen in other cholestatic liver diseases, including PBC, due to impaired copper excretion.

Her upper extremities exhibit fine tremors during an anxiety attack. The laboratory test results reveal elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines. Serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels are also elevated. Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia are also noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
B) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1
C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A
D) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B
E) Neurofibromatosis","The patient presents with a combination of symptoms and laboratory findings that suggest a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). The presence of diffuse thyroid swelling, elevated calcitonin levels, and hyperparathyroidism (indicated by elevated parathormone levels) points towards a medullary thyroid carcinoma, which is a characteristic feature of MEN 2A. Additionally, the patient's elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines, as well as elevated serum epinephrine levels, suggest the presence of a pheochromocytoma, which is also a component of MEN 2A. The presence of hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia further supports this diagnosis.

MEN 2A is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis, making it the most likely cause of her condition.

542,"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?
A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
B) The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.
C) The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.
D) One can not comment, as the p-value is not given.
E) The association is statistically significant, and low education is a risk factor.","To determine the association between young age myocardial infarction (MI) and educational status, we need to analyze the results of the chi-square test and the odds ratio (OR) with its confidence interval (CI).

The odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low educational status have a higher risk of MI compared to those with high educational status. However, the confidence interval (0.9–9.7) includes 1, which indicates that the association is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.

If the confidence interval did not include 1, we could conclude that the association is statistically significant. However, in this case, since the interval includes 1, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between low education and the risk of MI.

Therefore, the correct inference is that the association is not statistically significant, and we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for young age MI based on this study.

883,"A 72-year-old man develops reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL three days after being hospitalized for acute diverticulitis. On admission, a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3. Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, and serum studies showed a blood glucose of 145 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Therapy with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam was begun, and the patient was placed on bowel rest. He has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. Today, his temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft on physical examination, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings?
A) Gastrointestinal blood loss
B) Adverse drug reaction
C) Dehydration
D) Contrast administration
E) Chronic hypertension
""","To determine the most likely cause of the patient's current renal findings, let's analyze the given information. The patient, a 72-year-old man, was hospitalized for acute diverticulitis and developed reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL three days after admission. His initial serum creatinine concentration was 1.2 mg/dL, indicating a significant increase.

The patient's medications upon admission included insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. After admission, he was started on intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam for his diverticulitis. Among these medications, ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) known to potentially cause renal impairment, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those who are dehydrated.

Given the patient's age, medical history, and the medications he was taking, we can evaluate the options:

A) Gastrointestinal blood loss: There is no indication of significant blood loss in the provided information.

B) Adverse drug reaction: This is a possible cause, given the patient's recent start of ketoprofen, an NSAID that can impair renal function.

C) Dehydration: Although dehydration can cause renal impairment, there is no specific information suggesting that the patient was dehydrated.

D) Contrast administration: There is no mention of the patient receiving contrast agents, which can cause contrast-induced nephropathy.

E) Chronic hypertension: While the patient has a history of hypertension, his current renal findings are more likely related to an acute cause rather than his chronic condition.

Considering these factors, the most likely cause of the patient's current renal findings is an adverse drug reaction, specifically related to the use of ketoprofen.

Serum concentration of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 are within the reference range. He is very concerned about his memory lapses. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
A) Donepezil
B) Fluoxetine
C) Aspirin
D) Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
E) Memantine","The patient is a 78-year-old man who has been experiencing increasing forgetfulness over the past 5 weeks, leading to difficulties with daily activities. He has also exhibited signs of depression, such as psychomotor retardation, blunted affect, and impaired attention and concentration. The mental status examination shows impaired short- and long-term memory, but the patient is still oriented to person, place, and time. The absence of focal findings on neurologic examination and normal serum concentrations of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 help rule out other potential causes of his symptoms.

Given the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. The patient's symptoms, such as impaired memory, attention, and concentration, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient would be a cholinesterase inhibitor, such as donepezil, which is commonly used to manage mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain, a neurotransmitter that is involved in memory and learning.

While other options, such as fluoxetine (an antidepressant) and memantine (an NMDA receptor antagonist), may be used to manage certain symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, they are not the most appropriate first-line treatment for this patient.

Aspirin is not typically used to treat Alzheimer's disease, and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is a surgical procedure used to treat hydrocephalus, which is not indicated in this patient.

E) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because she no longer requires his service as a physician.
""","The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics states that romantic or sexual relationships between a physician and a current patient are unethical. This is because the power dynamic in the physician-patient relationship can make it difficult for the patient to provide truly informed consent, and because such relationships can create conflicts of interest and impair the physician's judgment. The fact that the patient's case is uncomplicated or does not require decision-making on the part of the physician does not change this. The physician should inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical, and that he cannot accept her invitation.

A) Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles
B) Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate
C) Papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions
D) Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis
E) Stromal amyloid deposition","To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the patient's presentation and history:

1. **Neck Mass and Symptoms**: The patient has a painless, firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck that has not increased in size over 4 months. He also experiences occasional fatigue and weight gain despite no changes in diet or exercise.

2. **Past Medical History and Lifestyle**: The patient has gout, for which he takes allopurinol, and has a healthy lifestyle with regular running and a balanced diet. He does not smoke and has minimal alcohol consumption.

3. **Family History**: Notably, he has a family history of medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle.

4. **Physical Examination**: The thyroid gland is described as firm, symmetric, and ""stone-firm,"" which is suggestive of a specific type of thyroid pathology.

Given these points, the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of **medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)**, especially considering the family history of MTC in his maternal uncle. MTC is a type of thyroid cancer that originates from the parafollicular cells (also known as C cells), which produce calcitonin. A key histopathological feature of MTC is the presence of **stromal amyloid deposition**, which is a characteristic finding that helps differentiate MTC from other types of thyroid cancers.

Considering the options provided:

- A: This describes a condition more consistent with autoimmune thyroiditis, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
- B: This could suggest a condition like Riedel's thyroiditis, characterized by a dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate.
- C: This is indicative of papillary thyroid carcinoma, which often shows papillary projections and dystrophic calcification.
- D: This describes an anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, characterized by pleomorphic undifferentiated cells and necrosis.
- E: **This option correctly describes the stromal amyloid deposition characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma.**

However, the primary concern is her compulsive behavior of shoplifting, which provides her with temporary relief but is followed by feelings of shame and guilt. This behavior is characteristic of kleptomania, a type of impulse control disorder.

Kleptomania is often treated with psychotherapy, and among the options provided, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most appropriate next step in management. CBT is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors, which can help the patient manage her anxiety and compulsive behavior.

CBT can help the patient identify triggers for her shoplifting behavior, develop coping strategies to manage stress and anxiety, and work through feelings of shame and guilt. Additionally, CBT can address underlying issues that may be contributing to her behavior, such as difficulties in her marriage and work-related stress.

While other forms of therapy, such as interpersonal therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy, may also be beneficial, CBT is a more direct and effective approach for addressing the patient's specific symptoms and behaviors. Lithium is a medication typically used to treat bipolar disorder and is not indicated for kleptomania. Motivational interviewing is a technique used to help patients resolve ambivalence about changing their behavior, but it is not a comprehensive treatment approach for kleptomania.

A) MRI of the adrenal glands
B) MRI of the chest
C) MRI of the pituitary gland
D) Low dose dexamethasone suppression test
E) Inferior petrosal sinus sampling","Let's analyze the patient's presentation and laboratory results step by step.

The patient is a 25-year-old woman with a four-month history of progressive fatigue and weakness, which has significantly impacted her daily activities. She also reports a history of irregular menstrual periods, which suggests hormonal imbalances. Additionally, she has abdominal striae, obesity, and hypertension, all of which are indicative of Cushing's syndrome.

Laboratory results show elevated serum cortisol levels (30 µg/mL), which is consistent with Cushing's syndrome. The 24-hour urinary cortisol level is also elevated (470 µg), further supporting this diagnosis. However, the serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) level is low (2 pg/mL), which suggests that the cortisol overproduction is not due to ACTH stimulation.

The 48-hour high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that the patient's serum cortisol levels do not decrease, which indicates that the cortisol overproduction is not suppressible by glucocorticoids. This result suggests that the cortisol overproduction is likely due to an adrenal source rather than a pituitary or ectopic source.

Given these results, the best next step in management would be to investigate the adrenal glands as the source of cortisol overproduction. Therefore, the best answer is A) MRI of the adrenal glands.

The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent’s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient’s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Bipolar I disorder
B) Bipolar II disorder
C) Cyclothymic disorder
D) Persistent depressive disorder
E) Schizoaffective disorder","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 22-year-old man presenting with mood fluctuations, it's essential to analyze the symptoms and episodes he has experienced. The patient had a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy, during which he engaged in impulsive behavior (spending $2,000 of his parent's money without asking). This episode resolved after 5 days, followed by feelings of guilt and upset. Additionally, he has experienced multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty.

The key features of his presentation include:

1. A distinct episode of elevated mood and energy, which lasted for 5 days and was accompanied by impulsive behavior.
2. Multiple episodes of depressive symptoms lasting for months.
3. No mention of psychotic symptoms during the current episodes, but a history of severe meningoencephalitis at age 17 with reported hallucinations.

Given these features:

- **Bipolar I disorder** is characterized by at least one manic episode, which may be accompanied by depressive episodes. The patient's 5-day episode of elevated mood and energy could be considered a hypomanic episode, but it does not meet the full criteria for a manic episode (which requires at least 7 days or less if hospitalization is required).
  
- **Bipolar II disorder** involves at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. The patient's history of depressive episodes and the recent 5-day episode of elevated mood and energy align with this diagnosis.

- **Cyclothymic disorder** involves periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms lasting at least 2 years; however, the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.

- **Persistent depressive disorder** involves depressive symptoms that last for 2 years or more but does not account for the patient's episode of elevated mood and energy.

- **Schizoaffective disorder** involves an uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major depressive or manic episode concurrent with symptoms that meet criterion A for schizophrenia. The patient does not currently exhibit psychotic symptoms, and his past hallucinations were in the context of a severe medical condition.

Considering the patient's episodes of depressive symptoms and the recent episode of elevated mood and energy, the most fitting diagnosis is Bipolar II disorder, as it accounts for both the hypomanic and depressive episodes without meeting the full criteria for a manic episode.

338,"A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient’s condition?
A) Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
B) Increase in heart rate
C) Decrease in systemic vascular resistance
D) Increase in cardiac output
E) Increase in blood volume","To approach this question, let's consider the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy and how they might impact a pre-existing cardiac condition.

The patient has a history of a cardiac murmur since childhood, which was likely due to an atrial septal defect (ASD), given the description of fixed splitting of S2 and a midsystolic murmur. ASDs are characterized by an abnormal opening in the atrial septum, allowing blood to flow between the left and right atria. This can lead to increased flow through the pulmonary circulation.

During pregnancy, there are several physiological changes that can impact cardiac function:

- Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (A): This would actually decrease the shunt flow in an ASD, potentially improving symptoms.
- Increase in heart rate (B): While an increased heart rate can increase cardiac output, it's not the primary factor affecting this patient's condition.
- Decrease in systemic vascular resistance (C): This is a normal change in pregnancy, but it's not directly related to the patient's symptoms.
- Increase in cardiac output (D): This is a significant change in pregnancy, with cardiac output increasing by up to 50% above nonpregnant levels. This increase in cardiac output can exacerbate the shunt flow in an ASD, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow and symptoms of dyspnea and cyanosis.
- Increase in blood volume (E): While an increase in blood volume does occur in pregnancy, it's not the primary factor affecting the patient's condition in this scenario.

Given the patient's symptoms and the physiological changes of pregnancy, the increase in cardiac output is the most likely cause of the change in her condition. This increase in cardiac output exacerbates the shunt flow through the ASD, leading to increased pulmonary blood flow and symptoms of dyspnea and cyanosis.

864,"A 25-year-old woman presents generalized abdominal pain and vomiting for the past hour. She has also had watery diarrhea for several days with no blood or pus in the stools. She is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, and drinking oral rehydration solution, which has helped a little. Her past medical history shows she was hospitalized 10 years ago for an appendectomy and 4 years ago for a fractured ulna following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs are pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min with shallow breathing, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, pupils are constricted. Extremities are pale and cold. The abdomen is soft but mildly, diffusely tender to palpation with a palpable bladder. No rebound or guarding. Fingerstick blood glucose is 124 mg/dL. Laboratory tests are pending. A urinary catheter is placed, and intravenous fluids are started. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A) Administer naloxone
B) Administer opioid analgesics
C) Scopolamine patch
D) Start dextrose infusion
E) Perform a gastric lavage","The patient is a 25-year-old woman presenting with generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea for several days. She has been taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which has provided some relief, and drinking oral rehydration solution. Her vital signs show tachycardia (104/min), normal blood pressure (120/80 mm Hg), shallow breathing, and a normal temperature (36.7°C or 98.0°F). Physical examination reveals constricted pupils, pale and cold extremities, a soft but mildly tender abdomen, and a palpable bladder. The absence of rebound or guarding suggests that the abdominal pain is not due to an acute abdomen. The fingerstick blood glucose is slightly elevated at 124 mg/dL.

The key findings in this case are the constricted pupils and the abdominal symptoms. The constricted pupils suggest opioid use, which is consistent with the patient's use of an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication that likely contains an opioid. The abdominal symptoms, including pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, are also consistent with opioid-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction.

Given these findings, the next best step in management is to administer naloxone, a medication that reverses opioid effects. Naloxone is indicated in cases of suspected opioid overdose or opioid-induced gastrointestinal dysfunction. It works by binding to opioid receptors and reversing the effects of opioids, including constipation, nausea, and vomiting.

323,"A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife who is concerned about the patient's frequent falls. Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?
A) Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets
B) Atrophy of the caudate nucleus
C) Extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta
D) Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein
E) Intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau","The patient's symptoms of frequent falls, slowed movement, and shuffling gait, along with increased tone in the upper and lower extremities, are indicative of Parkinson's disease. This condition is characterized by the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, a part of the brain that plays a crucial role in movement control. A key histologic feature of Parkinson's disease is the presence of intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies, which are composed of alpha-synuclein, a protein that is abnormally aggregated in the brains of individuals with this disease.

725,"A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with fever, nausea, and vomiting. The patient states that his symptoms started last night and have persisted to this morning. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his current medications include albuterol and fluticasone. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient seems uncomfortable. He requests that the lights in the room stay turned off during the physical exam.

Total protein: 55 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis?
A) Acyclovir
B) Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine
C) Ceftriaxone
D) Ceftriaxone and vancomycin
E) IV fluids and monitoring","The patient's presentation of fever, nausea, vomiting, and diminished mobility of the neck with discomfort upon flexion, along with the results of the lumbar puncture, suggests a diagnosis of meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows an elevated cell count, decreased glucose, and increased total protein, which are all indicative of bacterial meningitis.

Given the patient's symptoms and CSF results, the best treatment option would be to initiate antibiotics that cover the most common causes of bacterial meningitis. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin are commonly used in combination to treat bacterial meningitis, as they provide broad coverage against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae.

11,"A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient’s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?
A) It determines the genotype of the virus
B) It is a Southwestern blot, identifying the presence of DNA-binding proteins
C) It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of RNA
D) It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of DNA
E) It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay","To approach this question, let's break down the key points provided:

1. **Patient's Presentation and Initial Management**: A 24-year-old woman in her 39th week of gestation presents with symptoms of latent labor. She undergoes rapid screening tests as part of her workup, which leads to the administration of zidovudine during delivery to both her and her infant. This is a standard protocol to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

2. **The Need for a Confirmatory Test**: After the initial rapid screening tests, a confirmatory test is mentioned to confirm the diagnosis of HIV in the mother. This is crucial because rapid screening tests can sometimes produce false positives, and a confirmatory test is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis.

3. **Understanding the Options for the Confirmatory Test**:
   - **A)** This option mentions determining the genotype of the virus. While genotyping is important for understanding the viral strain and guiding treatment, it's not the primary purpose of a confirmatory test in this context.
   - **B)** This option mentions a Southwestern blot identifying DNA-binding proteins. This is not a standard confirmatory test for HIV.
   - **C)** This option mentions a Northern blot identifying the presence of RNA. Northern blot can be used to detect RNA, but it's not typically used as a confirmatory test for HIV diagnosis.
   - **D)** This option incorrectly states that a Northern blot identifies the presence of DNA. Northern blot is used for RNA detection, not DNA.
   - **E)** This option mentions an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. This type of test is indeed used as a confirmatory test to differentiate between antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2, providing a definitive diagnosis.

Given the context of needing a confirmatory test to establish a definitive diagnosis of HIV after initial rapid screening tests, the most appropriate choice is the one that describes a test used to confirm and differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.

1002,"A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A) Testing for serum Ca and PTH
B) Calcium and Vitamin D prescription
C) Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies
D) Testing for serum ferritin
E) Synovial fluid aspiration","The patient is a 42-year-old man presenting with progressively worsening back pain, morning stiffness lasting 30 minutes to an hour, and painful knees, particularly upon standing. He also reports joint pain and stiffness in his hands, which improves with movement. His family history includes joint issues and osteoporosis. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen.

Considering the patient's symptoms, such as morning stiffness, improvement with movement, and involvement of multiple joints, including the spine, a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, specifically ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), should be considered. However, the patient's symptoms and family history also raise the possibility of osteoarthritis (OA) or another form of spondyloarthritis.

To differentiate between these conditions and to guide management, testing for serum inflammatory markers and autoantibodies would be helpful. Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can help identify the presence of inflammation, while autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (anti-CCP) can help diagnose RA. HLA-B27 testing may also be useful in diagnosing AS.

Therefore, the next best step in management would be to test for serum ESR and autoantibodies to help guide the diagnosis and treatment plan.

872,"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:

Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
A) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
B) Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis
C) Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis
D) Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli
E) Interstitial cystitis","The patient presents with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. Despite multiple evaluations and antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, there has been no improvement. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. The absence of improvement with antimicrobial therapy and the presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) without a positive culture suggest a non-bacterial cause. The symptoms of pelvic pain, irritative voiding, and painful ejaculation are consistent with chronic prostatitis. However, the lack of bacterial growth in the urine and EPS cultures rules out bacterial prostatitis. 

Considering the patient's symptoms and the absence of bacterial infection, the most likely diagnosis is chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). This condition is characterized by chronic pain and discomfort in the pelvic region, often accompanied by urinary symptoms and painful ejaculation, without evidence of bacterial infection.

A) Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies
B) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
C) Anti-histone bodies
D) Anti-Ro
E) Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies","Let's break down the patient's presentation and laboratory findings to determine the most likely diagnosis.

The patient presents with bloody nasal secretions, shortness of breath, weight loss, and joint pain. Physical examination reveals nasal ulcers and diffuse crackles over all lobes of the lung bilaterally. Laboratory findings include anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a systemic vasculitis, particularly Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA). GPA is characterized by inflammation of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, which can affect various organs, including the respiratory tract, kidneys, and joints.

The patient's lack of response to corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics suggests that the underlying condition is not a simple infection or allergic reaction.

Among the options provided, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a hallmark of GPA and other ANCA-associated vasculitides. ANCA are autoantibodies that target neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens, leading to inflammation and damage to blood vessels.

Therefore, the presence of ANCA would most likely confirm the diagnosis of GPA in this patient.

B) Congenital defect of the Mullerian ducts
C) Purging behavior
D) Polycystic ovaries
E) Anovulation","To determine the most likely cause of the 15-year-old girl's symptoms, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Age and Menstrual History**: She is 15 years old and has a history of irregular menstrual cycles with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche occurred at 14 years, which is within the normal range.

2. **Symptoms and Recent Changes**: She has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months, which is a change from her previous irregular but present menstrual cycles. This change coincides with the start of sexual intercourse, but a urine pregnancy test is negative, ruling out pregnancy as the cause of amenorrhea.

3. **Medical History**: She had a manic episode treated with risperidone, which can affect menstrual cycles due to its impact on prolactin levels. However, her prolactin level is within the normal range.

4. **Family History**: Her mother has PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome), which can influence her risk for similar hormonal imbalances.

5. **Physical Examination and Measurements**: She is slightly overweight with a BMI of 27.02 kg/m2, which could contribute to hormonal imbalances.

6. **Laboratory Results**: Her hormone studies show normal prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone levels. The progesterone level is low, indicating anovulation.

Given these points, the most likely cause of her symptoms is anovulation, which is the absence of ovulation. Anovulation can lead to irregular menstrual cycles and amenorrhea. Factors contributing to anovulation in this case could include her slightly overweight status, potential psychological stress related to her appearance and weight consciousness, and possibly the influence of her family history of PCOS, although her testosterone levels are within normal limits.

The patient refuses an examination of his genitals. Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?
A) CAGE questions
B) Direct influenza antigen
C) Uretheral swab and culture
D) Viral core antibody
E) Viral surface antibody","To determine the best diagnostic test for this patient, let's analyze the provided information. The patient is a 27-year-old college student presenting with constant fatigue, occasional nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. He has a history of unprotected sex with multiple partners, which increases his risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), which could be indicative of liver damage or inflammation. The presence of amber/brown urine color and the patient's symptoms could suggest a liver or biliary issue, but given the patient's lifestyle and refusal of a genital examination, it's crucial to consider STIs, particularly those that can cause liver involvement.

The patient's positive results for marijuana, amphetamines, and cocaine in the urine are noted, but these do not directly explain the liver enzyme elevation or the patient's symptoms. The CAGE questions (A) are used to screen for alcohol use disorders, which might be relevant given the patient's history of regular alcohol consumption, but this does not directly address the liver enzyme elevation or the specific symptoms.

Direct influenza antigen (B) testing is not indicated here as there's no specific mention of symptoms suggestive of influenza (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat).

A urethral swab and culture (C) could be relevant if the patient were willing to undergo a genital examination, as this could help diagnose certain STIs. However, the patient's refusal limits this option.

Viral core antibody (D) and viral surface antibody (E) tests are relevant for diagnosing hepatitis infections, which could explain the liver enzyme elevation and the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's risk factors (unprotected sex with multiple partners) and the laboratory findings, testing for hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B or C, would be appropriate. The distinction between core and surface antibodies can help in understanding the stage and type of hepatitis infection. The core antibody typically indicates current or past infection, while the surface antibody can indicate immunity due to vaccination or past infection.

Given the patient's presentation and the need to address the liver enzyme elevation and potential STI risk, the best diagnostic test would be to assess for hepatitis infection, specifically through testing for viral antibodies.

A) “I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you.”
B) “Losing a baby is difficult, but I'm sure next time it'll work out.”
C) “I'm sorry for your loss. Let's talk about how to move forward from here.”
D) “Losing a baby is difficult; but I see this every day, and I know you'll get through it.”
E) “I'm sorry for your loss. I can write you a prescription to help with your anxiety and grief.”","The patient, a 32-year-old woman, has just experienced a traumatic event with the loss of her baby due to placental detachment. She is now showing signs of emotional distress, becoming tearful and distraught. The most appropriate initial response by the physician is one that acknowledges her loss, offers empathy, and validates her feelings.

Option A, ""I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you,"" is the most suitable response. It directly acknowledges the patient's loss, expresses sympathy, and recognizes the difficulty of the situation. This response allows the patient to feel heard and understood, creating a safe space for her to process her emotions.

The other options are not as effective. Option B comes across as dismissive and minimizing, implying that the loss is not significant. Option C, while well-intentioned, may come across as too forward or solution-focused, potentially dismissing the patient's immediate emotional needs. Option D may be perceived as insensitive, as it downplays the patient's unique experience and implies that the physician's familiarity with the situation somehow lessens the patient's pain. Option E, while offering a practical solution, may be seen as premature or dismissive of the patient's emotional needs, potentially undermining the importance of her feelings.

A) Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar
B) Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar
C) Spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli forming yellow colonies on casein agar
D) Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar
E) Gamma-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci forming green colonies on vancomycin agar","The patient presents with symptoms of sepsis, including high fever, chills, left lower quadrant pain, and low blood pressure. The presence of mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness suggests pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The laboratory results show a low platelet count, decreased fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer, which are indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain when phenol is applied suggests the presence of lipopolysaccharides typical of certain Gram-negative bacteria.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely cause of her condition is a Gram-negative bacterial infection. Among the options provided, choice D describes a lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar, which is characteristic of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common pathogen responsible for severe infections leading to sepsis and DIC.

826,"A 16-year-old female presents to her physician’s office after noticing a round lump in her left breast 2 months ago. She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?
A) This mass will likely require excision
B) This mass will decrease in size if the patient starts oral contraceptives
C) This mass slightly increases this patient’s risk of breast cancer in the future
D) This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time
E) If this mass grows rapidly to greater than 5 cm, radiation and chemotherapy are indicated","The patient is a 16-year-old female who presents with a round lump in her left breast that has been enlarging and becoming tender just preceding her last 2 menses. The lump is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. The presence of a mobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast with slight tenderness to deep palpation is suggestive of a benign breast lesion, such as a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are common in young women, particularly during puberty, and are often influenced by hormonal changes. They are typically mobile, painless, and can fluctuate in size with the menstrual cycle. Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the most likely outcome of this patient's condition is that the mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time, especially after menarche or with changes in hormonal balance. Therefore, a conservative approach with regular follow-up and reassurance is usually recommended.

556,"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A) Agree to his wish for no further treatment
B) Begin paroxetine therapy
C) Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents
D) Reassure the patient that he will feel better
E) Start outpatient psychotherapy","The patient is a 14-year-old boy presenting with symptoms of depression, including loss of appetite, sleeplessness, extreme irritability, social withdrawal, and feelings of loneliness. He has also expressed suicidal ideation, stating that he would be better off dead and has a plan to use his father's licensed firearm to end his life. Given the severity of his symptoms and the presence of suicidal ideation with a plan, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure the patient's safety.

Involuntary hospitalization is necessary to protect the patient from harming himself. This decision should be made in conjunction with informing the parents, as they need to be aware of the situation and the actions being taken to ensure their son's safety.

Starting paroxetine therapy (option B) or outpatient psychotherapy (option E) may be appropriate in the long term, but they do not address the immediate risk of suicide. Reassuring the patient that he will feel better (option D) is not sufficient, as it does not address the underlying issues or the immediate risk of harm. Agreeing to his wish for no further treatment (option A) is not a viable option, as it would put the patient at risk of harming himself.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to ensure the patient's safety through involuntary hospitalization.

E) Supportive therapy","Let's break down the scenario step by step to determine the best next step in management.

The patient, a 25-year-old man, was brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious at a college party. He exhibited belligerent behavior before passing out and falling to the ground. His past medical history is unknown. Initially, he presented with vomiting, incoherent responses, and a slightly elevated temperature. After receiving IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics, he began to feel better but then developed muscle rigidity, became less responsive, and had a further increase in temperature.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the muscle rigidity, elevated temperature, and altered mental status, are indicative of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening medical emergency that can be triggered by certain medications, including volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine, or by strenuous exercise and other stressors.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and the failure of initial measures to control his symptoms, the best next step in management would be to administer a specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia.

1001,"A 65-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness and a 13.6 kg (30 lb) weight loss. He is a vegetarian. The patient’s family says that he had been high functioning but has had significant behavioral changes over the past year. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. No significant family history. His vital signs include: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg without postural changes, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉). Physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man. He is irritable, paranoid, and delusional but denies any hallucinations. An unstable, wide-based ataxic gait is noted.

Hb 6.1 g/dL
MCV 109 fL
Platelets 90,0000/mm3
Total count 3,000/mm3
Reticulocyte count 0.8%
A peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
 
A) Hypothyroidism
B) Folate deficiency
C) Vitamin B12 deficiency
D) Parvovirus infection
E) Pernicious anemia","The patient presents with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness, and significant weight loss. He is also a vegetarian, which increases his risk for certain nutritional deficiencies. The patient's family reports significant behavioral changes over the past year, and the patient exhibits irritability, paranoia, and delusions. The physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man with an unstable, wide-based ataxic gait.

Laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level, elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV), thrombocytopenia, and a low reticulocyte count. The peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils, which is a characteristic finding in megaloblastic anemia.

Given the patient's vegetarian diet and the presence of megaloblastic anemia, the most likely cause of his condition is a deficiency in either folate or vitamin B12. However, the patient's behavioral changes, such as irritability, paranoia, and delusions, are more consistent with a vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment, personality changes, and psychiatric symptoms, in addition to hematological findings.

Folate deficiency, on the other hand, typically presents with hematological findings, but not with the same degree of neurological symptoms as seen in this patient.

Pernicious anemia, which is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor leading to vitamin B12 deficiency, is also a possibility. However, the patient's negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies make this diagnosis less likely.

Hypothyroidism and parvovirus infection are not supported by the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a vitamin B12 deficiency, likely due to his vegetarian diet.

C) Left coronary artery
D) Posterior descending artery
E) Right marginal artery","Considering the patient's symptoms and autopsy results, the 61-year-old man experienced severe, crushing, substernal chest pain while hiking, which is indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The electrocardiogram demonstrating ST elevations in leads I and aVL further supports this diagnosis. The autopsy results showing ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle suggest that the affected area is supplied by the left circumflex artery. This artery typically supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle, the posterior descending artery (in right-dominant circulation), and the left atrium. Therefore, the most likely affected vessel in this patient is the left circumflex artery.

239,"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?
A) Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.
B) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.
C) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.
D) The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.
E) The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.","To answer this question, let's break down the concepts of incidence and prevalence rates and how they relate to the time period chosen for the study.

Incidence rate refers to the number of new cases of a disease (in this case, systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) that occur within a specified time period among a population at risk. It essentially measures the rate at which new cases of the disease are diagnosed.

Prevalence rate, on the other hand, refers to the total number of cases of a disease present in a population at a specific point in time or during a specified time period, regardless of when the cases first occurred. It includes both new cases (incident cases) and existing cases.

When considering the impact of the length of the time period on these rates:

- **Incidence rates** are typically higher in shorter time periods because they capture the rate of new cases occurring within that specific, shorter timeframe. As the time period lengthens, the incidence rate may decrease because the rate of new cases is averaged over a longer period.

- **Prevalence rates**, however, tend to increase with longer time periods because they accumulate both new and existing cases over time. The longer the time period, the more cases are included in the prevalence estimate, leading to higher prevalence rates.

Given these explanations, let's evaluate the options:

A) Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates. - This statement is incorrect because prevalence rates typically increase with longer time periods due to the accumulation of cases.

B) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods. - This statement is correct because incidence rates capture the rate of new cases, which is typically higher when averaged over a shorter period.

C) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated. - This statement is incorrect because prevalence rates are generally lower in shorter time periods due to fewer accumulated cases.

D) The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods. - This statement is incorrect because the inclusion of attack rates (the proportion of individuals who develop a disease after exposure to a risk factor) does not inherently increase incidence estimates in longer periods.

E) The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods. - This statement is also incorrect because the inclusion of attack rates does not directly impact the incidence rate calculation in this manner.

A) This patient has peptic ulcer disease.
B) The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.
C) The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior vena cava.
D) The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior rectal vein.
E) Fecal leukocytes and a stool culture are required for diagnosis.","The patient's presentation of bright red blood in his stool, which occurred 2 times this week, without fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus, or urinary symptoms, suggests a lower gastrointestinal bleeding source. The physical examination finding of a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion indicates ascites, which is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. The presence of multiple purple spider web-like lesions on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied, is characteristic of spider angiomas, a sign of liver disease. The negative fecal occult blood test and the presence of a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion superior to the pectinate line on anoscopy suggest a hemorrhoid, specifically an internal hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids are located above the pectinate line and drain into the superior rectal vein, which is a tributary of the inferior mesenteric vein and ultimately the portal vein.

43,"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?
A) Duodenal atresia
B) Intestinal malrotation
C) Meconium ileus
D) Necrotizing enterocolitis
E) Pyloric stenosis","The patient's presentation of bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium, and a firm and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds suggests an intestinal obstruction. The decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A on the quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation are indicative of a possible chromosomal abnormality, specifically Down syndrome. The presence of an intestinal obstruction in a newborn with a possible chromosomal abnormality is highly suggestive of duodenal atresia, which is a common gastrointestinal anomaly associated with Down syndrome.

Duodenal atresia is a congenital obstruction of the duodenum that occurs when the duodenum does not properly form during fetal development. The symptoms of duodenal atresia typically present in the first few days of life and include bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium. The diagnosis of duodenal atresia is often confirmed with imaging studies, such as a plain abdominal radiograph or an upper GI series.

In contrast, intestinal malrotation (B) is a condition where the intestines do not properly rotate during fetal development, which can lead to an intestinal obstruction. However, the presentation of intestinal malrotation is often more variable and may not always include bilious vomiting.

Meconium ileus (C) is a condition where the meconium in the intestines is thicker and stickier than normal, causing an intestinal obstruction. However, meconium ileus is often associated with cystic fibrosis, which is not indicated in this patient's presentation.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (D) is a condition where the intestines become inflamed and damaged, often in premature infants. However, this patient was born at 38 weeks gestation and does not have a history of prematurity.

Pyloric stenosis (E) is a condition where the pylorus, the muscle that separates the stomach from the small intestine, becomes thickened and narrowed, causing an obstruction. However, pyloric stenosis typically presents with non-bilious vomiting, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.

130,"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?
A) Decreased acetylcholine release
B) Overactivation of adenylate cyclase
C) Release of interferon-gamma
D) Degradation of phospholipids
E) Inhibition of GABA release","Considering the patient's symptoms of sudden onset of blurry vision, difficulty reading, and seeing double with two images on top of each other, along with a history of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea after consuming food at a picnic, it is likely that the patient has been poisoned by a toxin. The patient's friend who also attended the picnic has developed similar symptoms, which further supports the possibility of foodborne illness. The patient's symptoms of fixed pupillary dilation and difficulty depressing both eyes suggest an anticholinergic effect, which is typically caused by decreased acetylcholine release. 

The foods listed, such as potato salad, deviled eggs, and pickles, are common vehicles for foodborne illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium botulinum. However, the anticholinergic effects described, particularly the fixed pupillary dilation, are more consistent with botulism. The toxin responsible for botulism, botulinum toxin, acts by decreasing the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to the observed symptoms.

A) Cardiac tamponade
B) Cervical spinal cord transection
C) Occult hemorrhage
D) Pulmonary embolism
E) Undiagnosed pneumonia","To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Extensive Trauma and Blood Loss**: The patient was stabbed 12 times and had extensive blood loss at the scene, necessitating aggressive resuscitation efforts including a massive transfusion protocol.

2. **Unstable Vital Signs**: Despite aggressive resuscitation, the patient's vital signs remain unstable with a low blood pressure (50/40 mmHg), low temperature (95°F or 35°C), and a pulse of 80/min.

3. **Respiratory Support**: The patient is on controlled respirations at 20/min on lung-protective volume control, indicating the need for mechanical ventilation.

4. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient's ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) is low at 39%, despite having a SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) of 100% on 100% oxygen. This discrepancy suggests a problem with oxygen utilization at the tissue level rather than oxygen delivery.

5. **Cold Extremities**: Despite warming measures, the patient's extremities remain cold, which can indicate poor peripheral circulation.

Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's presentation is not directly related to the options provided in the sense of a new, additional diagnosis but rather a consequence of the severe trauma and resuscitation efforts. However, the best fit from the provided options, considering the context of trauma, resuscitation, and the patient's presentation, would be related to the consequences of severe blood loss and resuscitation efforts, which could lead to issues such as cardiac dysfunction or other complications not explicitly listed.

However, if we must choose from the provided options based on the information given and the typical complications seen in such scenarios:

- **Cardiac Tamponade** (A) is unlikely as there's no mention of equalization of pressures or specific echocardiogram findings suggestive of tamponade.
- **Cervical Spinal Cord Transection** (B) would present with more neurological deficits and is not directly implied by the information provided.
- **Occult Hemorrhage** (C) is a possibility but the surgical team reports no active blood loss, making this less likely.
- **Pulmonary Embolism** (D) could be a concern in trauma patients but the information provided does not directly support this diagnosis.
- **Undiagnosed Pneumonia** (E) is not supported by the information given.

Considering the patient's presentation and the provided options, the most fitting answer, although not perfectly aligned with the scenario's details, would relate to complications arising from the severe trauma and resuscitation efforts, which are not explicitly listed among the options.

979,"A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?
A) Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
B) Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
C) Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
D) Increased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
E) Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume","The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, pursed-lip breathing, decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterized by airflow limitation, which is typically caused by smoking. The patient's long history of smoking one pack per day for 55 years significantly increases his risk for developing COPD.

In COPD, the lungs become less elastic, making it difficult to exhale air. This leads to an increase in residual volume (RV), which is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is also decreased due to the obstruction of airflow.

Considering the options provided, the most likely finding in this patient is an increased residual volume (RV) and a decreased 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1). This is because the lungs are over-inflated, leading to an increase in RV, and the obstruction of airflow results in a decrease in FEV1.

Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, she has persistent hypotension. Laboratory studies show a low free T3 level, which is indicative of euthyroid sick syndrome, a condition where patients with severe illness have altered thyroid hormone levels without actual thyroid disease. The low free T3 level is likely a response to her severe illness rather than a primary thyroid disorder. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is to focus on managing her underlying illness, which is septic shock.

A) Immediate cardiac transplant
B) Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated
C) Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets
D) Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space
E) Surgical adhesive glue","To approach this patient's situation, we need to consider the severity of the injury and the most effective way to manage it. The patient has a penetrating wound to the chest, specifically a 3-inch long wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. Given the severity of the injury and the patient's unstable condition, immediate surgical intervention is necessary to repair the damage and prevent further complications.

Among the options provided, choice C, ""Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets,"" is the best definitive surgical approach. This method involves using sutures to close the wound, with pledgets (small pieces of material) used to support the sutures and prevent them from tearing through the tissue. This technique is commonly used in cardiac surgery to repair injuries to the heart, including penetrating wounds like the one described.

The other options are not suitable for this situation. Choice A, ""Immediate cardiac transplant,"" is not necessary, as the injury is limited to the right ventricular free wall and does not require replacement of the entire heart. Choice B, ""Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated,"" is not appropriate, as the patient's condition is critical and requires immediate surgical intervention. Choice D, ""Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space,"" is a procedure used to relieve tension pneumothorax, which is not indicated in this case. Choice E, ""Surgical adhesive glue,"" is not a suitable method for repairing a penetrating wound to the heart.

901,"A 38-year-old man presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Past medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2 years ago for which he is not compliant with his medications. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history and occasionally alcohol use. His vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, pulse 98/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

A) Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration
B) ↑ megakaryocytes
C) ↓ hemosiderin stores
D) Ringed sideroblasts
E) Myeloblasts with immature precursors","Let's analyze the patient's presentation and laboratory findings to determine the most likely finding on a bone marrow biopsy.

The patient presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion, which are common symptoms of anemia. His laboratory findings confirm anemia, with a low hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, low hematocrit of 29.1%, and low red cell count of 3.7 million/mm3. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 71 μm3, which is below the normal range, indicating microcytic anemia. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are also low, which is consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

The iron studies show a high total iron binding capacity (TIBC) of 620 μg/dL and a low transferrin saturation of 9%, which is indicative of iron deficiency anemia. The reticulocyte count is low at 0.2%, which suggests inadequate bone marrow response to the anemia.

Given these findings, the most likely finding on a bone marrow biopsy would be a decrease in hemosiderin stores, which is indicative of iron deficiency. Hemosiderin is a protein that stores iron in the bone marrow, and a decrease in its stores suggests that the bone marrow is not receiving enough iron to produce red blood cells.

C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?
A) Recipient T-cells in the graft
B) Drug-induced nephrotoxicity
C) Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels
D) Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy
E) Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies
""","Analyzing the situation, the 21-year-old man who underwent a cadaveric renal transplant 10 days ago is now experiencing pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, and decreasing urinary output. His serum studies show a rising creatinine concentration, indicating impaired kidney function. The biopsy of the transplanted kidney reveals tubulitis, which is a hallmark of acute cellular rejection. The C4d staining is negative, which rules out antibody-mediated rejection. Given these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is acute cellular rejection, which involves the recipient's T-cells attacking the graft. This is a common complication in the early post-transplant period, especially in patients who are not adequately immunosuppressed.

330,"A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance for dysarthria and left-sided facial droop. She is accompanied by her son, who states that the patient had just returned home an hour ago from walking the dog when suddenly the patient stated she felt “strange.” When her son asked her what was wrong, her speech was slurred and her ""face looked funny.” The son quickly called an ambulance. The paramedic upon arrival noted that the patient had left-sided facial droop. Her medical history includes asthma and sickle cell disease. She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. The patient’s temperature is 97°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination, a left-sided facial droop is appreciated. She has trouble articulating her words, and her speech is garbled. She is put on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Labs are obtained and pending. Which of the following therapies is most likely indicated?
A) Alteplase
B) Exchange transfusion
C) Hydralazine
D) Naloxone
E) Warfarin","The patient's symptoms of sudden onset dysarthria (difficulty speaking) and left-sided facial droop are highly suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke. The patient's medical history of sickle cell disease increases her risk for stroke due to the potential for vaso-occlusion and subsequent cerebral ischemia. However, the presence of sudden onset focal neurological deficits is more typical of an acute ischemic stroke rather than a sickle cell crisis.

Given the acute onset of symptoms and the absence of any contraindications, the most appropriate therapy would be thrombolytic treatment with alteplase (tissue plasminogen activator, tPA), which is indicated for acute ischemic stroke within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset. Alteplase works by dissolving the blood clot that is causing the stroke, thereby restoring blood flow to the affected area of the brain.

The other options are not indicated in this scenario. Exchange transfusion (B) may be considered in patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke, but it is not the initial treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Hydralazine (C) is a vasodilator used to treat high blood pressure, which is not the primary concern in this scenario. Naloxone (D) is an opioid antagonist used to treat opioid overdose, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation. Warfarin (E) is an anticoagulant used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it is not indicated in the acute treatment of ischemic stroke.

The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn’t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse’s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?
A) Metformin
B) Oxybutynin
C) Metoprolol
D) Lisinopril
E) Hydrochlorothiazide","Considering the patient's presentation, the 95-year-old woman's confusion is a significant concern. The patient's past medical history and current medications are reviewed to identify potential causes of her confusion. Among her medications, oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication commonly used to treat incontinence. Anticholinergic medications are known to cause cognitive side effects, particularly in the elderly, including confusion, disorientation, and memory impairment. The patient's confusion, inability to remember the date, and insistence to leave the hospital immediately are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. Therefore, the medication most likely associated with this patient's confusion is oxybutynin.

Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?
A) Alanine
B) Adenosine diphosphate
C) Adenosine monophosphate
D) Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
E) Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate","The patient's symptoms of lethargy and irritability between meals that are alleviated by frequent small feedings, along with laboratory findings of normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin, suggest a diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. However, given that the red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal and other hemoglobinopathies are ruled out, the enzyme deficiency in question is more likely to be pyruvate kinase deficiency. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, and its deficiency can lead to hemolytic anemia. Among the options provided, alanine is known to allosterically inhibit pyruvate kinase.

800,"A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with chest pain. She reports sudden severe and crushing substernal chest pain that started 1 hour ago. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a prior myocardial infarction requiring a coronary artery bypass graft 2 years ago. She takes aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, atorvastatin, and insulin. She is retired and lives a sedentary lifestyle at home. Her temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 109/68 mmHg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 24/min. Before being able to start the physical examination, the patient loses consciousness. Her pulse is palpable but weak. Her blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg and pulse is 130/min. Her skin is pale, cold, and clammy. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6. A medication that primarily stimulates which of the following receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient?
A) Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor
B) Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor
C) Beta-1 adrenergic receptor
D) Beta-2 adrenergic receptor
E) D2 receptor","The patient presents with sudden severe and crushing substernal chest pain, which is indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in multiple leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with a weak pulse, low blood pressure, and signs of shock (pale, cold, and clammy skin).

In this scenario, the primary goal is to improve the patient's hemodynamic status by increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. The most appropriate medication to achieve this would be one that primarily stimulates the beta-1 adrenergic receptor.

Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are located in the heart and stimulate an increase in heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output. Stimulating these receptors would help to improve the patient's hemodynamic status by increasing cardiac output and blood pressure.

The other options are not as appropriate in this scenario:

* Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors cause vasoconstriction, which would increase blood pressure but also increase afterload and potentially worsen cardiac output.
* Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors cause vasodilation and would not be effective in increasing blood pressure.
* Beta-2 adrenergic receptors cause vasodilation and bronchodilation, but would not have a significant effect on cardiac output or blood pressure.
* D2 receptors are involved in the regulation of dopamine and would not have a direct effect on cardiac output or blood pressure.

Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?
A) Head CT
B) Head MRI
C) Lumbar puncture
D) Post void residual volumes
E) Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 24-year-old female is experiencing an inability to urinate, along with a history of transient episodes of difficulty speaking, changes in vision, and recent extreme pain in her face exacerbated by certain actions. These symptoms, particularly the episode of pain in her face and the finding of leftward gaze resulting in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward, suggest a possible multiple sclerosis (MS) or a condition that affects the central nervous system. However, the patient's chief complaint of an inability to urinate is more immediate and requires prompt attention.

Considering the patient's acute presentation of urinary retention, the best initial test would be to assess the post-void residual (PVR) volume. This non-invasive ultrasound test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination, helping to determine if the patient has a urinary retention issue due to a neurological cause, such as MS, or another underlying condition. Therefore, the initial focus should be on addressing the urinary retention.

E) Synthetic cathinone intoxication","To approach this question, let's consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a 19-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department due to unusual behavior that started 3 hours ago while he was at a party. He has a history of major depressive disorder and seasonal allergies, and his current medications include amitriptyline and diphenhydramine.

The patient's symptoms include not responding to questions, repeatedly stating that ""The government is following me everywhere,"" a high temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), an elevated pulse of 115/min, increased respirations at 24/min, and high blood pressure of 160/89 mm Hg. He is also diaphoretic, not oriented to place or time, and exhibits dilated pupils bilaterally and diffuse hyperreflexia. His feet are cold, and capillary refill time is 3 seconds.

After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide, which is a metabolite of ethanol. However, given the patient's symptoms, it is unlikely that ethanol alone is the cause.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the presence of ethyl glucuronide, it is possible that the patient ingested a substance that was contaminated with another drug or that he intentionally took a different substance.

Among the options provided, synthetic cathinone intoxication is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms. Synthetic cathinones, also known as ""bath salts,"" are a class of psychoactive substances that can cause agitation, aggression, hallucinations, and other symptoms similar to those exhibited by the patient.

Synthetic cathinone intoxication can also cause increased heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature, as well as dilated pupils and hyperreflexia. The patient's symptoms, including his agitation, aggression, and hallucinations, are consistent with synthetic cathinone intoxication.

E) Anti-HEV IgM","To determine the diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation presents with lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, which are indicative of liver dysfunction. The laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), increased total bilirubin, and a prolonged prothrombin time, all of which are consistent with acute liver injury.

Given the patient's recent travel to Sudan, we should consider infectious causes of liver disease that are prevalent in that region. The patient denies eating seafood, which reduces the likelihood of hepatitis A. The negative results for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-CMV antibody, and anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody rule out autoimmune and other viral causes of hepatitis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with acute hepatitis E infection, which is prevalent in Sudan and other parts of Africa and Asia. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is typically transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water or food.

To confirm the diagnosis, an ELISA for anti-HEV IgM antibodies would be the most appropriate test. The presence of anti-HEV IgM antibodies indicates acute infection, whereas anti-HEV IgG antibodies would indicate past infection or immunity.

Over the last 2 months, he often felt that his face was mildly swollen, especially in the morning hours, but he did not consider it to be anything serious. No significant past medical history. He reports a 20-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 96/min, blood pressure is 108/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. A chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. Which of the following clinical signs would most likely be present in this patient?
A) Bilateral pedal edema
B) Distended veins over lower abdomen
C) Papilledema
D) Positive Adson test
E) Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of right forearm and right hand","Considering the 68-year-old man's presentation with difficulty breathing, a cough for the last 4 months, frequent nasal stuffiness, headaches, and a feeling of facial swelling, especially in the morning, along with a 20-pack-year smoking history, the presence of a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung on chest radiograph suggests lung cancer. The symptoms of facial swelling and nasal stuffiness could be indicative of superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), a condition where the superior vena cava is compressed or obstructed, often by a tumor. SVCS can cause facial swelling, nasal congestion, and distended veins over the upper body. Among the options provided, the distended veins over the lower abdomen (option B) are less likely to be directly associated with SVCS, but the presence of distended veins in general is a sign of SVCS. However, a more specific and direct sign related to the options provided is not listed, but given the context, the most likely related clinical sign would be related to the presence of a tumor and its effects on the body, such as facial swelling, but the exact match is not available.

However, considering the context of the question and the provided options, the best match based on the context of a lung tumor and its potential effects would be related to the signs of increased intrathoracic pressure or obstruction, but none directly match the typical signs of superior vena cava syndrome like facial edema or distended neck veins. 

The best approximation given the options would be related to signs of increased pressure or obstruction, but the exact match is not available in the options provided.

213,"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?
A) Lack of a comparison group
B) No prevalence assessment
C) Low number of patients
D) Ascertainment bias
E) Lack of risk calculation","The journal editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study for the reason that there was a lack of a comparison group. A cohort study typically involves comparing outcomes between two groups, such as a treatment group and a control group, to assess the effect of a particular intervention or exposure. In contrast, a case series involves the detailed description of a series of patients with a particular condition or treatment, without a comparison group.

In this study, the authors presented the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures in 14 patients, but they did not include a comparison group to assess the effectiveness of this approach relative to other treatments. Therefore, the study design is more consistent with a case series, which is a descriptive study that summarizes the characteristics and outcomes of a group of patients with a particular condition or treatment.

444,"A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40℃ (104℉)) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5℃ (99.5℉); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:
Laboratory test
Hemoglobin 11.4 g/d
Mean corpuscular volume 90 µm3
Leukocyte count 4,500/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 70%
Lymphocytes 15%
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Ring-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient’s illness?
A) Babesia babesia
B) Chikungunya virus
C) Dengue virus
D) Leishmania major
E) Tropheryma whipplei","The patient's symptoms, including a severe fever, maculopapular rash, painful wrists and fingers, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches, along with her recent travel history to rural areas in Africa, suggest an infectious etiology. The presence of a maculopapular rash and painful ankles, in particular, are key clinical findings. Laboratory studies show a mild anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, which can be seen in various infections.

Considering the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely cause of her illness is an arthropod-borne viral infection. Among the options provided, Chikungunya virus is a strong candidate, as it is known to cause a severe febrile illness accompanied by a maculopapular rash, arthralgias, and arthritis, particularly affecting the ankles and wrists. Chikungunya virus is prevalent in Africa and is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.

The other options are less likely: Babesia babesia typically causes a malaria-like illness with ring-form trophozoites present on the peripheral blood smear, which is not the case here. Dengue virus can cause a similar febrile illness, but the presence of hemorrhagic manifestations and a more pronounced thrombocytopenia would be expected. Leishmania major is more commonly associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis, and Tropheryma whipplei is a rare cause of Whipple's disease, which presents with malabsorption and weight loss.
