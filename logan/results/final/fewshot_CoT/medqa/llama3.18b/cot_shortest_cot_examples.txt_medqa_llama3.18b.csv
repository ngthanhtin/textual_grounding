789,"A 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1 at 24 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. She has a history of preterm birth. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate 100/min; respiratory rate 13/min; and temperature 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered. Betamethasone stimulates which fetal cells?
Options
A) Type I pneumocytes
B) Goblet cells
C) Bronchial epithelial cells
D) Type II pneumocytes
E) Vascular smooth myocytes","The 26-year-old woman at 24 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with symptoms of preterm labor, including mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. The administration of betamethasone is a common practice in the management of preterm labor, as it helps to accelerate fetal lung maturation. Betamethasone stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs, which is essential for gas exchange and preventing respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. The cells responsible for surfactant production are type II pneumocytes.

Type II pneumocytes are a type of epithelial cell found in the lungs that produce and secrete surfactant, a complex mixture of phospholipids and proteins that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, facilitating gas exchange. Betamethasone stimulates the production of surfactant by type II pneumocytes, thereby reducing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants.

Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."
862,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin. One week ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Options
A) Malaria
B) Acute myelogenous leukemia
C) Cholecystitis
D) Renal papillary necrosis
E) Splenic sequestration crisis","The 3-year-old boy presents with a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin, which started after an upper respiratory tract infection. The examination reveals jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae, and the spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dl and a high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 39% Hb/cell. The Coombs test is negative, and a peripheral blood smear is mentioned but not described.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is hemolytic anemia, likely due to a post-infectious cause such as parvovirus B19 infection. This condition can lead to a transient aplastic crisis, characterized by a sudden decrease in red blood cell production.

The patient is at greatest risk for splenic sequestration crisis, which is a complication of hemolytic anemia. In this condition, the spleen becomes overactive and sequesters large numbers of red blood cells, leading to severe anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A) Malaria is a parasitic infection that can cause hemolytic anemia, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

B) Acute myelogenous leukemia is a type of blood cancer that can cause anemia, but it is not typically associated with a post-infectious cause.

C) Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder, which is not directly related to the patient's condition.

D) Renal papillary necrosis is a complication of sickle cell disease, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

83,"A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?
Options
A) Desmoplastic
B) Nodular
C) Acral lentiginous
D) Lentigo maligna
E) Superficial spreading","To determine the type of melanoma this woman is at greatest risk for, we need to consider her risk factors. The patient is an African-American woman, which means she has a higher risk for acral lentiginous melanoma compared to other types of melanoma. This type of melanoma is more common in individuals with darker skin and typically occurs on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails.

The patient's history of traveling to the Caribbean regularly may increase her risk for skin cancer due to the high levels of UV radiation in that region. However, this does not specifically increase her risk for a particular type of melanoma.

The patient's uncle died of metastatic melanoma, which increases her risk for melanoma, but the type of melanoma is not specified. The patient's family history may increase her risk for certain types of melanoma, but it is not a strong risk factor for acral lentiginous melanoma.

The patient's skin examination shows no abnormal moles or warts, which reduces her risk for certain types of melanoma such as lentigo maligna and superficial spreading melanoma.

Based on the patient's risk factors, particularly her darker skin, the type of melanoma she is at greatest risk for is acral lentiginous melanoma.

E) Carotid artery dissection","The patient is a 35-year-old woman presenting with sudden weakness of her right arm and leg, which started 3 hours ago. She has a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is on oral contraceptives. Her examination shows decreased muscle strength on the entire right side, 4+ deep tendon reflexes, and a Babinski sign on the right. The left lower leg is swollen, erythematous, and tender to palpation. These symptoms suggest a possible stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Given her recent travel to Europe, it is essential to consider the possibility of a venous thromboembolism (VTE) or a paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

The presence of a PFO would allow a venous thromboembolism to bypass the lungs and directly enter the arterial circulation, potentially leading to a stroke or TIA. The patient's history of smoking and oral contraceptives increases her risk for VTE. The swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg suggests a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Among the options provided, a patent foramen ovale (A) is the most likely finding given the patient's presentation and history. This is because a PFO would allow a venous thromboembolism to bypass the lungs and directly enter the arterial circulation, potentially leading to a stroke or TIA.

996,"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Options
A) Polyhydramnios
B) Acute respiratory distress syndrome
C) Caudal regression syndrome
D) Meconium aspiration
E) Placental abruption","Considering the patient's presentation, the 36-year-old woman at 42 weeks' gestation is a good candidate for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated, and her previous two children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. However, her BMI is 33 kg/m², which falls into the obese category. Obesity is a risk factor for several complications during pregnancy, including gestational diabetes and hypertension.

The patient's child is at greatest risk for complications related to fetal distress or hypoxia during labor. Given the patient's obesity and the fact that she is at 42 weeks' gestation, there is an increased risk of meconium aspiration syndrome if the fetus is stressed or in distress during labor. Meconium aspiration syndrome occurs when the fetus passes meconium during labor, and then aspirates it into the lungs, leading to respiratory distress.

Therefore, the patient's child is at greatest risk for meconium aspiration syndrome.

Options
A) Azithromycin and admission to the medical floor
B) Azithromycin and discharge
C) Azithromycin, moxifloxacin, and admission to the intensive care unit
D) Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and admission to the intensive care unit
E) Moxifloxacin and admission to the medical floor","The patient is a 66-year-old man presenting to the emergency department with a cough and fatigue, accompanied by confusion for the past day. He has a history of diabetes and hypertension, and his current medications include insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. His vital signs reveal a fever of 102°F (38.9°C), tachycardia with a pulse of 120/min, and normal oxygen saturation. The physical exam shows crackles on pulmonary exam and an S4 on cardiac auscultation.

Given the patient's presentation of confusion, fever, and pulmonary crackles, it is essential to consider the possibility of pneumonia, especially in the context of a nursing home setting where aspiration pneumonia is a common concern. However, the patient's confusion and S4 heart sound also raise the suspicion of a more severe infection, such as pneumonia complicated by sepsis or a cardiac source of infection.

The next best step in management would be to initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for both respiratory and cardiac sources of infection. Considering the patient's presentation and the need for close monitoring, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) would be the most appropriate course of action.

Therefore, the next best step in management is to administer broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and admit the patient to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and further evaluation.

B) Human bite
C) Spider bite
D) Fish bite
E) Dog bite","The patient is a 59-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease, presenting with fever, night sweats, lethargy, and a history of a bite that occurred 3 days ago. He is afebrile but pale, with a surgically absent spleen and swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Given his history of sickle cell disease, he is immunocompromised and at increased risk for infections. The presence of swollen bite marks with red streaks suggests a possible infection spreading through the lymphatic system.

Among the options provided, the most concerning bite in this patient would be a cat bite. Cat bites are notorious for causing abscesses and cellulitis due to the bacteria present in the cat's saliva, which can infect the wound and spread through the lymphatic system. Additionally, cat bites are more likely to cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals.

Cat bites are typically caused by Pasteurella multocida, a bacterium that can cause severe infections, including sepsis and abscesses. Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of swollen bite marks with red streaks, a cat bite is the most concerning option.

Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?
Options
A) Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)
B) Oxytocin-induced labor
C) Manual uterine aspiration
D) Dilatation and curettage (D & C) after vacuum evacuation
E) Oral mifepristone + misoprostol","The patient is a 25-year-old woman who is 4 weeks pregnant and desires an elective abortion. She has a history of two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries and is currently using the withdrawal method for contraception. Given her gestational age of 4 weeks, the most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy would be medical abortion.

Medical abortion involves the use of medications to terminate the pregnancy. The most commonly used regimen is oral mifepristone followed by misoprostol. Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist that blocks the action of progesterone, which is necessary for pregnancy maintenance. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that causes uterine contractions and cervical dilation, leading to expulsion of the pregnancy.

Given the patient's gestational age and medical history, the most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy is oral mifepristone + misoprostol.

734,"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability. Over the past week, she has been projectile vomiting after most feedings. Initially, the vomiting would occur just once or twice a day, but now it occurs after every feed. However, her appetite hasn’t decreased, and she seeks milk right after each episode of vomiting. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is breastfed exclusively. On physical exam, the vital signs include: temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28/min, and heart rate 150/min. On examination, she appears to be mildly dehydrated, listless, and irritable. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?
Options
A) Respiratory alkalosis
B) Metabolic acidosis
C) Metabolic alkalosis
D) Respiratory acidosis
E) Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis","Analyzing the 1-month-old girl's presentation, she is experiencing persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability, with projectile vomiting after most feedings. Despite the frequent vomiting, her appetite remains intact, and she continues to seek milk after each episode. The presence of a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region suggests a possible gastric outlet obstruction. The most likely diagnosis is pyloric stenosis, a condition characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle, leading to gastric outlet obstruction.

Pyloric stenosis is often associated with metabolic alkalosis due to the loss of gastric acid during vomiting. The loss of hydrogen ions (H+) from the stomach results in a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration, leading to an increase in bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels, which is a hallmark of metabolic alkalosis.

Therefore, the acid-base disturbance most likely associated with this patient's condition is metabolic alkalosis.

E) Is transmitted by air conditioning","The patient is a 32-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with fever and diarrhea after returning from a vacation where he engaged in various activities such as kayaking, visiting spas, interacting with local animals, and eating local foods. His symptoms include fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea, which have been ongoing for 3 days. His chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation, and the chest radiograph shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. The patient's laboratory results show mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels.

Given the patient's symptoms and travel history, it is likely that he contracted a waterborne or zoonotic infection. The presence of fine crackles on auscultation and patchy infiltrates on the chest radiograph suggests a respiratory component to the infection. The patient's laboratory results showing mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels suggest that the infection is causing some degree of systemic inflammation.

Considering the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely organism responsible for his symptoms is Legionella pneumophila. This bacterium is a waterborne pathogen that can cause Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. Legionella pneumophila is often associated with contaminated water sources, such as hot tubs, cooling towers, and potable water systems.

The characteristics of Legionella pneumophila that are relevant to the question are:

* It can form biofilms, which are complex communities of microorganisms that adhere to surfaces and are difficult to eradicate.
* It has a rabbit reservoir, as it can infect rabbits and cause disease in them.
* It is more common in parrot owners, as it can be transmitted through contact with contaminated water or aerosols.

Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?
Options
A) Systemic vascular resistance
B) Fractional tissue oxygen extraction
C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity
D) Pulmonary vascular resistance
E) Cardiac inotropy","The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of heavy alcohol consumption and no prior medical visits in 15 years. He presents with recurrent vomiting that began 5 hours ago, described as bloody and containing black specks, which is indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. His physical examination reveals signs of shock, including decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, and a distended abdomen. These symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing a severe episode of bleeding, likely due to an acute gastrointestinal bleed.

Given the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal bleed, likely from a source such as an ulcer or varices. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption increases his risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the potential for gastritis, ulcers, and varices.

In response to his current condition, the patient's body is likely to undergo various physiological changes. One of the key changes is a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). In a healthy adult, SVR is a critical component of blood pressure regulation, and it is maintained by the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, in a patient with a severe gastrointestinal bleed, the body's response is to try to compensate for the blood loss by increasing cardiac output and decreasing SVR. This decrease in SVR allows for a greater distribution of blood flow to the vital organs, such as the brain and kidneys, which are essential for maintaining homeostasis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's current condition. Fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B) is a measure of the body's ability to extract oxygen from the blood, which is not directly affected by the patient's gastrointestinal bleed. Carotid baroreceptor firing activity (C) is a measure of the body's ability to regulate blood pressure, which is not directly related to the patient's current condition. Pulmonary vascular resistance (D) is a measure of the resistance to blood flow in the lungs, which is not directly affected by the patient's gastrointestinal bleed. Cardiac inotropy (E) is a measure of the heart's contractility, which is not directly related to the patient's current condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?
Options
A) Atropine
B) Physostigmine
C) Pralidoxime
D) Pyridostigmine
E) Neostigmine","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 35-year-old woman experienced muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, enlarged pupils, and an inability to urinate after foraging for plants on a hike. These symptoms are indicative of anticholinergic toxicity, which can be caused by exposure to certain plants, such as deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) or jimsonweed (Datura stramonium). Anticholinergic toxicity is characterized by the blockade of acetylcholine receptors, leading to a range of symptoms including dry mouth, blurred vision, hallucinations, and urinary retention.

The treatment for anticholinergic toxicity involves administering an anticholinergic antagonist to reverse the effects of the toxin. Among the options provided, atropine is an anticholinergic antagonist that can be used to treat anticholinergic toxicity. However, atropine is not typically used to treat anticholinergic toxicity caused by plant exposure, as it can exacerbate the condition.

Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can be used to treat anticholinergic toxicity caused by plant exposure. It works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby reversing the effects of the toxin. Physostigmine is the most appropriate choice for treating this patient's symptoms.

C) Start him on androgen replacement treatment
D) Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy
E) Order an ACTH stimulation test","Analyzing the 30-year-old man's presentation, he complains of excessive fatigue and weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss over several weeks. His physical examination reveals a bronze discoloration to his skin, which is a characteristic sign of Addison's disease. Addison's disease is a rare endocrine disorder caused by the inadequate production of cortisol and aldosterone by the adrenal glands. The bronze discoloration is due to the accumulation of melanin in the skin as a result of increased ACTH production.

Given the symptoms and physical examination findings, the next best step in the management of this patient is to administer intravenous hydrocortisone, which is a glucocorticoid replacement therapy. This will help to alleviate the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and stabilize the patient's condition. Fludrocortisone is an aldosterone replacement therapy, which may also be necessary, but it is not the immediate priority.

Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to administer intravenous hydrocortisone.

578,"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?
Options
A) Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%
B) Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation
C) Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle
D) Abnormal left ventricular relaxation
E) Decreased right atrial pressure","To determine the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, hypertension, and a history of high blood sugars. He has a significant smoking history and consumes alcohol occasionally. His physical examination reveals jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, ascites, and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. These findings suggest right-sided heart failure and possibly tricuspid regurgitation.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram is increased peak tricuspid regurgitation. This is because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with right-sided heart failure, which is often associated with tricuspid regurgitation.

The echocardiogram would likely show increased peak tricuspid regurgitation, which would be consistent with the patient's clinical presentation.

287,"A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?
Options
A) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
B) Western blot
C) Rapid HIV antibody test
D) Polymerase chain reaction
E) Southern blot","To determine if the child has been infected with HIV, the hospital would need to detect the genetic material of the virus, which is the correct answer. The child may not have developed antibodies to HIV yet, so antibody tests like ELISA, Western blot, and rapid HIV antibody test would not be effective. 

The Southern blot is a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it is not typically used for detecting viral infections like HIV. 

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular biology technique used to amplify and detect specific DNA sequences. It is commonly used to detect the genetic material of viruses, including HIV. PCR can detect the presence of HIV DNA in the child's cells, even if the child has not developed antibodies to the virus.

Therefore, the hospital would use PCR to detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected.

195,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?
Options
A) Conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron
B) Conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane
C) Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen
D) Conversion of homocysteine to methionine
E) Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III","The 3-year-old boy is presenting with abdominal pain, constipation, and irritability, which have been ongoing for 3 weeks. He also has pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness on physical examination. The peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling, which is indicative of lead poisoning. Lead poisoning can cause a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, constipation, and irritability, due to its toxic effects on multiple systems, including the hematopoietic and nervous systems.

The peripheral blood smear findings are consistent with lead poisoning, which can cause basophilic stippling in red blood cells due to the accumulation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) as a result of the inhibition of the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD). This enzyme is involved in the conversion of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to porphobilinogen (PBG), a key step in the biosynthesis of heme.

The correct answer is the process that is most likely impaired in this patient, which is the conversion of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to porphobilinogen (PBG). This process is impaired due to the inhibition of the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) by lead, leading to the accumulation of ALA and the formation of basophilic stippling in red blood cells.

The correct answer is {C}."
1267,"A 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension presents to his primary care physician for an annual check-up.

His physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the patient’s regimen. One month later, the patient returns to the physician complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling. Which of the following medications was likely prescribed to this patient?
Options
Options
A) Metoprolol
B) Verapamil
C) Nifedipine
D) Hydrochlorthiazide
E) Spironolactone","To determine which medication was likely prescribed to the patient, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history.

The patient has a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension. He was already taking enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (an oral antidiabetic medication). The addition of another anti-hypertensive medication likely aimed to further lower his blood pressure.

The patient's new complaint of lower extremity swelling suggests that the added medication may have caused fluid retention or increased sodium reabsorption, leading to edema.

Considering the options:

A) Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can cause fatigue, dizziness, and bradycardia, but it is not typically associated with fluid retention or edema.

B) Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can cause peripheral edema, but it is not the most likely cause of fluid retention in this patient.

C) Nifedipine is also a calcium channel blocker that can cause peripheral edema, but it is not the most likely cause of fluid retention in this patient.

D) Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a diuretic that can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, but it is more likely to cause hypotension and dehydration rather than fluid retention.

E) Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause fluid retention and edema, particularly in patients with heart failure or cirrhosis. However, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for hypertension.

Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely medication that was prescribed to this patient is a diuretic that can cause fluid retention and edema. However, none of the options provided are typical diuretics. 

Considering the options, Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can cause fluid retention and edema, but it is more likely to cause hypotension and dehydration rather than fluid retention."
514,"A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Compression fracture
B) Herniated nucleus pulposus
C) Musculoskeletal strain
D) Spinal stenosis
E) Vascular claudication","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 65-year-old man, let's analyze his symptoms and history. He presents with gradually worsening back pain that worsens with movement, such as walking, but improves with activities that involve sitting or leaning forward, such as riding a bike or pushing a cart. This pattern of pain suggests that the patient's symptoms are related to a condition that worsens with extension or standing and improves with flexion or sitting.

The patient's history of osteoporosis increases his risk for compression fractures, but the fact that his back pain improves with activities that involve leaning forward makes this less likely. The patient's symptoms do not align with a herniated nucleus pulposus, as this condition typically causes pain that worsens with flexion or sitting.

Musculoskeletal strain is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more complex and suggest a underlying structural issue rather than a simple strain.

Spinal stenosis is a condition in which the spinal canal narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. This condition typically causes pain that worsens with standing or walking and improves with sitting or leaning forward, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.

Vascular claudication is a condition in which the blood flow to the legs is reduced, causing pain with walking. While this condition can cause pain in the legs, it does not typically cause back pain.

Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is spinal stenosis.

1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
Options
A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.","A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. This means that the study concludes that there is a significant difference between study groups when, in fact, there is no real difference. In the context of the provided research abstract, a type 1 error would mean that the study incorrectly concludes that mepolizumab significantly reduces asthma exacerbations when, in reality, it does not.

Let's consider the options provided:

A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups. This is incorrect, as a type 1 error is not related to the study's power.

B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error. This is the correct definition of a type 1 error.

C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error. This is incorrect, as a type 1 error involves rejecting a true null hypothesis, not accepting a false one.

D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2. This is incorrect, as a type 1 error is actually an alpha (α) error, which is typically set at 0.05.

E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study. This is incorrect, as a type 1 error is related to the rejection of the null hypothesis, not the confidence interval.

301,"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?
Options
A) Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock
B) Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock
C) Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock
D) Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock
E) Inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock","To determine the location of the vaccine injection that caused the patient's symptoms, we need to consider the typical presentation of a specific condition related to vaccine administration.

The patient's symptoms, including an irregular gait, left leg weakness, and a tendency for the pelvis to tilt towards the left when standing on the right leg, suggest a condition known as Erb's palsy or brachial plexus injury. However, in this case, the symptoms are affecting the lower extremities rather than the upper extremities, suggesting a different condition.

The description of the child's symptoms is consistent with a condition known as hip abductor paralysis or hip abductor weakness, which can occur due to injury to the gluteus medius muscle or its nerve supply. This condition can result from an injection of a vaccine into the wrong location, leading to muscle weakness or paralysis.

The most common vaccine associated with hip abductor paralysis is the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The MMR vaccine is typically administered in the upper outer quadrant of the buttock, but if it is injected too far laterally, it can cause injury to the gluteus medius muscle or its nerve supply, leading to hip abductor paralysis.

Considering the location of the injection, the symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into the inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock.

The final answer is {A}."

Options
A) Angiography
B) Computed Tomography (CT)
C) Echocardiogram
D) Stress test
E) Cardiac biopsy","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 55-year-old man is experiencing severe cough, difficulty breathing, and nocturnal cough that wakes him up from sleep. He also mentions a history of a 'heart attack' 5 years ago and continues to consume alcohol despite doctor's advice. His symptoms of shortness of breath after minimal exertion, nocturnal cough, and use of multiple pillows to sleep comfortably suggest possible heart failure. The lab reports, ECG, and chest X-ray are crucial in determining the next step in management.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is heart failure. The next step in management would be to evaluate the heart function and assess the severity of heart failure. Among the options provided, an Echocardiogram is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. It is a non-invasive test that uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart, allowing for the assessment of heart function, chamber sizes, and valve function.

The Echocardiogram will help to determine the cause of heart failure, assess the severity of the condition, and guide further management. It will also help to identify any potential complications, such as valve problems or cardiac tamponade.

Therefore, the next step in this patient's management is an Echocardiogram.

Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia. CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. Treatment with radioiodine therapy is planned after near-total thyroidectomy. Considering this tumor, which of the following is the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient?
Options
A) Trachea
B) Hilar lymph nodes
C) Cervical lymph nodes
D) Inferior thyroid arteries
E) Thyrohyoid muscle","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a thyroid nodule that is fixed, immobile, and non-tender, and ultrasound results suggest a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. The fine needle biopsy reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia, and a CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. The most likely diagnosis is thyroid cancer, specifically papillary thyroid carcinoma, given the presence of a thyroid nodule and the suspicion of neoplasia.

Thyroid cancer can metastasize to various sites, including the lymph nodes, bones, and lungs. The most common initial metastatic site in thyroid cancer is the lymph nodes. Specifically, the cervical lymph nodes are the most common site for metastasis in thyroid cancer, particularly in papillary thyroid carcinoma.

152,"A transvaginal ultrasound shows an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. Both the ovaries are enlarged and have multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the ovarian findings?
Options
A) Chocolate cysts
B) Corpus luteum cysts
C) Yolk sac tumor
D) Luteoma of pregnancy
E) Theca leutein cysts","Evaluating the patient's presentation, the transvaginal ultrasound shows an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. This is indicative of a molar pregnancy. The ultrasound also shows enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content, which is suggestive of theca lutein cysts. Theca lutein cysts are a common complication of molar pregnancy, caused by high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulating the ovaries to produce multiple cysts.

The high levels of hCG in molar pregnancy stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple cysts, leading to the formation of theca lutein cysts. These cysts are thin-walled, septated, and contain clear fluid. They are a common finding in patients with molar pregnancy and are usually bilateral.

The other options are not consistent with the ultrasound findings. Chocolate cysts are a type of ovarian cyst that contains old blood and are not typically associated with molar pregnancy. Corpus luteum cysts are a type of ovarian cyst that forms after ovulation and are not typically associated with molar pregnancy. Yolk sac tumor is a type of germ cell tumor that is not typically associated with molar pregnancy. Luteoma of pregnancy is a rare condition that is not typically associated with molar pregnancy.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the ovarian findings is theca lutein cysts, which are a common complication of molar pregnancy.

Crackles were heard over the right upper and the entire left lung fields, indicating a severe respiratory infection. The sputum culture confirmed infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite appropriate therapy, the patient died.

The presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow in the photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is likely a neutrophil, given the context of a bacterial infection such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that play a crucial role in the innate immune response, particularly in the defense against bacterial infections. They are attracted to the site of infection by chemotactic factors, including platelet activating factor (PAF), which is a potent mediator of inflammation.

PAF is a phospholipid molecule that is released by various cell types, including neutrophils, macrophages, and endothelial cells, in response to inflammatory stimuli. It acts by binding to specific receptors on the surface of target cells, leading to a range of effects, including chemotaxis, degranulation, and the release of pro-inflammatory mediators.

Therefore, the mediator most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow is platelet activating factor (B).

Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?
Options
A) Alanine aminotransferase
B) Alkaline phosphatase
C) Creatine kinase (CK-MB)
D) Lactate dehydrogenase
E) Troponin T","To determine the most diagnostic utility of the laboratory tests provided, we need to consider the clinical scenario and the timing of the patient's presentation.

The patient is a 59-year-old man who was recently hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and was treated with alteplase. He now presents with chest pain and discomfort in his left shoulder, which is somewhat similar to his initial presentation.

Given that the patient was recently treated with alteplase, it is essential to consider the possibility of complications related to this treatment, such as bleeding or reperfusion injury.

Among the laboratory tests provided, Troponin T (Option E) is the most relevant in this scenario. Troponin T is a cardiac-specific biomarker that is elevated in the setting of myocardial injury, including AMI and reperfusion injury.

Given the timing of the patient's presentation, an abnormal result of Troponin T would have the most diagnostic utility in determining whether the patient is experiencing a reperfusion injury or another cardiac complication.

E) Refuse to treat the patient as he will die without a blood transfusion","When faced with a situation like this, it's essential to prioritize the patient's medical needs while also respecting their autonomy and any advance directives they may have in place. In this case, the patient has a clear annotation in their medical chart indicating that they do not want to receive blood transfusions for religious reasons. This is an advance directive that should be respected.

Administering a blood transfusion without the patient's consent would be a violation of their autonomy and could potentially lead to legal and ethical consequences. The patient's wife may be concerned for her husband's well-being, but ultimately, it's the patient's decision whether or not to receive medical treatment.

Calling the ethics board of the hospital may be an option, but in this case, the patient's advance directive is clear, and it's not necessary to involve a third party to make a decision that the patient has already made.

Convincing the wife to administer a blood transfusion to her husband is not an option, as it would be coercive and disregard the patient's autonomy.

Refusing to treat the patient is not a viable option, as it would result in the patient's death, which would be a tragic outcome.

Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to respect the patient's written instructions and not administer a blood transfusion.

Options
A) LOD Score < 1
B) LOD Score < 3
C) LOD Score < 2
D) LOD Score > 3
E) LOD Score = 0","To determine if two loci are closely linked, we need to calculate the LOD (Log of the Odds (LOD) score. The LOD score is a measure of the likelihood that two loci are linked. A higher LOD score indicates that the two loci are more likely to be linked.

The LOD score is calculated using the formula:

LOD = log10 (Odds of linkage / Odds of no linkage)

where Odds of linkage = (Frequency of recombinants / Total number of offspring) and Odds of no linkage = (1 - Frequency of recombinants) / (Total number of offspring)

A LOD score of 3 or greater is generally considered to be strong evidence for linkage between two loci.

Given this information, let's evaluate the options:

A) LOD Score < 1: This would suggest that the two loci are unlikely to be linked.

B) LOD Score < 3: This would suggest that the two loci may be linked, but the evidence is not strong.

The lumbar puncture results show an elevated cell count, decreased glucose, and increased protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which are indicative of bacterial meningitis.

The patient's symptoms and CSF results are consistent with bacterial meningitis, particularly caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae. Among the options provided, the best treatment for bacterial meningitis would involve antibiotics that cover these pathogens.

Option D, Ceftriaxone and vancomycin, is the most appropriate choice for treating bacterial meningitis. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that covers N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae, while vancomycin is effective against S. pneumoniae, particularly the penicillin-resistant strains.

The other options are not the best choices for treating bacterial meningitis. Acyclovir (Option A) is used to treat viral encephalitis, particularly herpes simplex encephalitis. Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine (Option B) are used to treat fungal infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis. Ceftriaxone alone (Option C) may not provide adequate coverage for S. pneumoniae. IV fluids and monitoring (Option E) are supportive measures but do not address the underlying infection.

The laboratory results show a decreased platelet count, normal prothrombin time, and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The aPTT is a measure of the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways. The factor VIII activity is decreased, and the ristocetin cofactor assay is also decreased. The ristocetin cofactor assay is a specific test for von Willebrand factor (VWF) activity. 

Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of VWF. VWF plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury. It also serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII in the circulation, protecting it from degradation. A deficiency in VWF can lead to decreased factor VIII activity, as seen in this patient.

Given the information above, the aspect of coagulation that would most likely be affected is the platelet adhesion and aggregation process, which is mediated by VWF. The correct answer is B) Gp Ib, as it is a platelet receptor for VWF."

He states that ever since her uncomplicated delivery she has failed to gain weight, has had chronic diarrhea, and has had multiple bacterial and viral infections. During the course of the workup, an absent thymic shadow is noted and a lymph node biopsy demonstrates the absence of germinal centers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options
A) Defect in WASP gene
B) Defect in ATM gene
C) Adenosine deaminase deficiency
D) NADPH oxidase deficiency
E) Defect in BTK gene","Let's think step by step. The 2-month-old girl is experiencing failure to gain weight, chronic diarrhea, and recurrent bacterial and viral infections. These symptoms suggest an immunodeficiency disorder. The absence of a thymic shadow on imaging and the absence of germinal centers in lymph node biopsy further support this diagnosis. The thymus is responsible for the development and maturation of T-lymphocytes, and the germinal centers are where B-lymphocytes undergo maturation and proliferation. The absence of these structures indicates a problem with T-lymphocyte development.

Among the options provided, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a condition that leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the body, which in turn causes the destruction of lymphocytes in the thymus and bone marrow. This results in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder, characterized by the absence of T-lymphocytes and impaired B-lymphocyte function. The symptoms of ADA deficiency include failure to thrive, recurrent infections, and absence of lymphoid tissues.

The other options do not match the clinical presentation as closely as ADA deficiency. WASP gene defect is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a condition characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. ATM gene defect is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, a condition characterized by ataxia, telangiectasias, and increased risk of cancer. NADPH oxidase deficiency is associated with chronic granulomatous disease, a condition characterized by recurrent infections and granuloma formation. BTK gene defect is associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a condition characterized by impaired B-lymphocyte function and recurrent infections.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is adenosine deaminase deficiency.

1252,"A 14-year-old girl presents with sudden drooping of the right side of her face with drooling and excessive tearing. The patient’s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors. Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation. Which of the following most likely transmitted the organism responsible for this patient’s illness?
Options
A) Ixodes scapularis
B) Tsetse fly
C) Culicidae
D) Dermacentor variabilis
E) Anopheles","The patient is a 14-year-old girl presenting with sudden drooping of the right side of her face, drooling, excessive tearing, and a circular red rash with central clearing on the trunk. The physical examination also reveals slight asymmetry of the facial muscles, inability to whistle or close the right eye, and decreased taste sensation. These symptoms are indicative of Bell's palsy, which is a form of facial paralysis. However, the presence of the rash and the patient's recent outdoor activities in northern Maine suggest a tick-borne illness.

The circular red rash with central clearing is characteristic of erythema migrans, which is a hallmark of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis).

Considering the patient's symptoms and the geographic location of the tick, the most likely vector responsible for transmitting the organism responsible for this patient's illness is the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis).

Therefore, the answer is {A}."
419,"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of fatigue for several weeks. The parents report that their son quit doing sports at school because of low energy.

Red cell distribution width 18% (N = 13%–15%)
Leukocyte count 7,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?""
Options
A) Regular blood transfusions
B) Fluoxetine
C) Methylphenidate
D) Iron supplementation
E) Allogenic stem cell transplantation","The 16-year-old boy presents with fatigue, low energy, and a decline in academic performance. He has a history of spending most of his time in the basement playing video games and eating bowls of cereal, which suggests a sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits. His physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth, and concavity of the finger nails, which are indicative of iron deficiency anemia. Laboratory studies confirm this diagnosis, showing a low hemoglobin level, a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and an elevated red cell distribution width (RDW).

The most appropriate initial step in treatment is to address the underlying cause of the iron deficiency anemia, which is likely due to inadequate iron intake and poor absorption. Iron supplementation is the most effective and safest treatment option for iron deficiency anemia. It is essential to note that iron deficiency anemia can have long-term consequences, such as impaired cognitive function and decreased academic performance, if left untreated.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is {D} Iron supplementation.

However, it is also essential to address the underlying causes of the patient's sedentary lifestyle and poor dietary habits, such as a lack of physical activity and a diet deficient in iron-rich foods. A multidisciplinary approach, including a registered dietitian and a counselor, may be helpful in addressing these issues.

Additionally, it is essential to rule out other potential causes of anemia, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic disease, or a bleeding disorder, through further diagnostic testing.

In terms of the patient's family history, his mother's Hashimoto's thyroiditis and his father's major depressive disorder are not directly related to his iron deficiency anemia, but they may indicate a higher risk for other health issues that should be monitored.

In conclusion, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is iron supplementation, but a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes of the patient's anemia and involves a multidisciplinary team is essential for optimal management."
1132,"A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?
Options
A) Left frontal lobe
B) Left internal capsule
C) Left temporal lobe
D) Right frontal lobe
E) Right temporal lobe","To determine the location of the damage, let's analyze the patient's symptoms. The patient is a right-handed man, which means that means he uses his left hemisphere for language processing. The symptoms include sudden onset speech changes with distorted and disconnected words, which is indicative of aphasia. The physical examination also shows weakness of the right arm, which suggests a left-sided motor deficit.

The left frontal lobe is responsible for language processing, including speech production and comprehension. Damage to this area can result in Broca's aphasia, characterized by non-fluent speech with effortful and halting speech production. The patient's symptoms of distorted and disconnected words, as well as his frustration with not being understood, are consistent with Broca's aphasia.

The left internal capsule is a structure that contains nerve fibers that carry motor and sensory information between the brain and the spinal cord. Damage to this area can result in a variety of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and sensory loss. However, it is less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's speech changes.

The left temporal lobe is involved in auditory processing and memory, and damage to this area can result in Wernicke's aphasia, characterized by fluent but meaningless speech. However, the patient's speech is described as distorted and disconnected, which is more consistent with Broca's aphasia.

The right frontal lobe and right temporal lobe are less likely to be involved in language processing, and damage to these areas would not typically result in the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the damage is most likely located in the left frontal lobe, which is responsible for language processing and is consistent with the patient's symptoms of Broca's aphasia.

Options
A) Nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells
B) Clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity
C) Mixture of cells from different germinal layers
D) Encapsulated cluster of mature fat cells
E) Nests of atypical melanocytes","To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's presentation and the findings from the transthoracic echocardiogram.

The patient is a 45-year-old woman presenting with intermittent chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss over the past 2 months. These symptoms suggest a cardiac condition that may be causing her symptoms.

The cardiac examination reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is indicative of atrial fibrillation, and a grade 3/6, low-pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex. This murmur is characteristic of mitral stenosis.

The lung examination shows diffuse wheezing and bilateral rales, which suggests pulmonary congestion.

The transthoracic echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, indicating left ventricular dysfunction, and a mass in the left atrium.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a left atrial myxoma, which is a type of benign tumor that arises from the left atrium.

A biopsy of the mass is likely to show a mixture of cells from different germinal layers, which is characteristic of a myxoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and fetal weight is estimated to be at the 90th percentile for gestational age. During delivery, there is an arrest in the second stage of labor, and a vacuum-assisted delivery is performed. Postpartum examination shows a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following complications?
Options
A) Urge incontinence
B) Vesicovaginal fistula
C) Fecal incontinence
D) Small bowel obstruction
E) Stress incontinence","The patient is a 27-year-old woman who had a vacuum-assisted delivery due to an arrest in the second stage of labor. She has a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position. This type of laceration involves the anal sphincter and can lead to complications related to fecal incontinence.

A third-degree laceration can result in damage to the anal sphincter muscles, leading to impaired anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence. This is because the anal sphincter plays a crucial role in maintaining fecal continence, and damage to this muscle can lead to involuntary loss of stool.

While urge incontinence (A) is a possible complication of childbirth, it is more commonly associated with stress incontinence (E) and is not directly related to the type of laceration described. Vesicovaginal fistula (B) is a complication of childbirth that involves a connection between the bladder and vagina, but it is not directly related to the type of laceration described. Small bowel obstruction (D) is not a direct complication of childbirth or lacerations.

Therefore, the patient is most likely to experience fecal incontinence due to the third-degree laceration.

The renal biopsy demonstrates hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. What is the most likely cause?
Options
A) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)
B) Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
C) Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
D) Minimal change disease
E) Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN)","Given the patient's presentation of increased tiredness and lethargy for the past 4 weeks, along with laboratory results showing a low hemoglobin level of 8.6 gm/dL and elevated serum creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL, it suggests a possible renal failure. The presence of 3+ proteinuria in the urinalysis further supports kidney damage. The renal biopsy findings of a hypercellular glomerulus with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane indicate a proliferative glomerulonephritis.

The patient's serum is negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which makes autoimmune diseases such as lupus nephritis less likely. However, the presence of C3 nephritic factor, which is an autoantibody that activates the alternative complement pathway, is a key finding. This suggests an immune complex-mediated disease.

Among the options provided, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is the most likely cause. MPGN is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes and complement components in the glomerular basement membrane, leading to a hypercellular glomerulus and electron-dense deposits. The presence of C3 nephritic factor is a hallmark of MPGN, particularly the type II variant.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's renal failure is membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).

128,"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?
Options
A) CD8+ T lymphocytes
B) Bone marrow-derived macrophages
C) CD4+ T lymphocytes
D) Natural killer cells
E) Band neutrophils","The 67-year-old man has monoclonal gammopathy, which is a condition characterized by the proliferation of a single clone of plasma cells. The presence of 6% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow biopsy indicates that this clone is expanding. The downregulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules in these monoclonal plasma cells suggests that they are attempting to evade immune surveillance. Normally, class I major histocompatibility molecules are expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells, including plasma cells, and are recognized by CD8+ T lymphocytes. However, in this case, the downregulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules makes the monoclonal plasma cells less recognizable to CD8+ T lymphocytes.

The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. This class of immune cells is the natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are a type of lymphocyte that can recognize and kill abnormal cells, including tumor cells and virus-infected cells, without prior activation. They do this by recognizing changes in the expression of class I major histocompatibility molecules on the surface of these cells. When class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated, as in the case of the monoclonal plasma cells, NK cells can recognize and kill these cells.

Therefore, the class of immune cells that best describes this function is the natural killer cells.

Options
A) Maternal oligohydramnios
B) Intrauterine alcohol exposure
C) Chromosome 13 trisomy
D) Maternal diabetes
E) Chromosome 18 trisomy","To determine the strongest predisposing factor for the patient's condition, we need to analyze the provided information and the characteristics of the stillborn infant. The infant has a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet, which are indicative of a congenital condition affecting the development of the spine and limbs. The x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, which further supports this conclusion.

The condition described is likely to be a form of spina bifida, which is a congenital defect of the spine and spinal cord. Spina bifida can be associated with various genetic and environmental factors.

Let's evaluate the provided options:

A) Maternal oligohydramnios: Oligohydramnios is a condition characterized by a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid. While it can be associated with various fetal abnormalities, it is not a direct predisposing factor for spina bifida.

B) Intrauterine alcohol exposure: Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a range of fetal abnormalities, including growth restriction and developmental delays. However, it is not a specific predisposing factor for spina bifida.

C) Chromosome 13 trisomy: Trisomy 13 is a genetic disorder that can cause severe developmental delays and physical abnormalities. While it can be associated with spina bifida, it is not the strongest predisposing factor.

D) Maternal diabetes: Maternal diabetes can increase the risk of various fetal abnormalities, including neural tube defects such as spina bifida. However, it is not the strongest predisposing factor.

E) Chromosome 18 trisomy: Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder that can cause severe developmental delays and physical abnormalities. It is a strong predisposing factor for spina bifida and other neural tube defects.

During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0°C (102.3°F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Scarlet fever
B) Scalded skin syndrome
C) Impetigo
D) Erysipela
E) Pyoderma","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 7-day-old newborn boy, let's analyze the provided information:

1. The patient presents with fever, irritability, and generalized erythema, which suggests an infectious process.
2. The parents initially tried to control the symptoms with acetaminophen, but the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters appeared around the buttocks, hands, and feet.
3. During the physical examination, the patient's vital signs indicate a high temperature of 39.0°C (102.3°F), an elevated heart rate of 130/min, and an increased respiratory rate of 45/min.
4. The skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky's sign.

Considering these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSS), also known as Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS). SSSS is a condition caused by the exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which can lead to skin blistering and detachment. The positive Nikolsky's sign, which is the ability to remove the outer layer of the skin with gentle pressure, is a characteristic feature of SSSS.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

* Scarlet fever is characterized by a distinctive rash, but it typically spares the palms and soles, and Nikolsky's sign is negative.
* Impetigo is a skin infection that can cause blisters, but it is typically localized and does not present with the widespread erythema and blistering seen in SSSS.
* Erysipela is a bacterial infection of the skin that can cause redness and swelling, but it does not typically cause blisters or a positive Nikolsky's sign.
* Pyoderma is a bacterial infection of the skin that can cause abscesses and cellulitis, but it does not typically cause widespread erythema and blistering.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Scalded Skin Syndrome.

She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while she was traveling in Southeast Asia. The physical examination is significant for left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration.

Considering her symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1-L3. LGV is characterized by a primary lesion, which often resolves, followed by the development of tender, ulcerative lymph nodes, which can become necrotic and form a ""bubone"" or ""groove sign"" on physical examination.

The key finding in LGV is the presence of Donovan bodies, which are intracellular inclusions of the bacteria seen on Wright-Giemsa stain of infected cells. These inclusions are characteristic of LGV and are not seen in other sexually transmitted infections.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient's condition is the presence of Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain.

683,"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?
Options
A) Isoniazid
B) Fluconazole
C) Caspofungin
D) Prednisone
E) Surgical resection of the infiltrates","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma who presents with worsening shortness of breath, lung function deterioration, and recurrent episodes of pneumonia.

The physical exam reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. The chest radiograph shows atelectasis in the right lung base and branched radiodensities described as ""glove-finger shadows.""

Given the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings, the most likely diagnosis is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus. The presence of elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and the patient's history of asthma further support this diagnosis.

The treatment of ABPA typically involves corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and immunosuppressive agents to reduce the immune response to Aspergillus. Among the options provided, prednisone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat ABPA.

Therefore, the most appropriate therapy in this patient is prednisone.

500,"A 30-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of infertility. He and his wife have been trying to get pregnant for the past two years. They have used fertility monitors and other aids without success. A hysterosalpingogram in his wife was normal. The patient has a history of cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child. He was briefly hospitalized for severe pneumonia when he was 9-years-old. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs. Notably, cardiac auscultation is silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This patient most likely has a mutation in which of the following classes of proteins?
Options
A) Microtubule monomeric protein
B) Lysosomal trafficking regulator protein
C) Transmembrane ion channel protein
D) Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein
E) Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein","To determine the most likely mutation in the patient, let's analyze the provided information. The patient is a 30-year-old male presenting with infertility, a history of cleft lip, and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child. He was also hospitalized for severe pneumonia at the age of 9. The key finding on examination is the absence of a cardiac murmur in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line, suggesting a possible issue with the aortic valve or the aortic root.

Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic stenosis or a related condition affecting the aortic valve or root. Aortic stenosis can be caused by various genetic mutations affecting the structure and function of the aortic valve or root.

Among the provided options, mutations in the transmembrane ion channel protein class are associated with conditions affecting the aortic valve or root. Specifically, mutations in the MYBPC3 gene, which encodes a transmembrane ion channel protein, are a common cause of aortic stenosis and related conditions.

Therefore, the patient most likely has a mutation in the class of transmembrane ion channel proteins, which is option {C}.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
Options
A) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis
B) Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate
C) Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal
D) Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus
E) Primary germ cell neoplasia of the testicle","The patient is a 52-year-old man presenting with a painless right-sided scrotal swelling that started several weeks ago. The physical examination reveals an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing, and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. These findings are characteristic of a hydrocele, which is an accumulation of fluid in the tunica vaginalis of the testis.

The most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which leads to the accumulation of fluid and the formation of a hydrocele. This condition is often idiopathic but can be caused by a variety of factors, including inflammation, trauma, or infection.

The failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate (option B) is a common cause of indirect inguinal hernias, which can also present as a scrotal mass. However, the mass in this case is described as soft, cystic, and transilluminating, which is more consistent with a hydrocele than a hernia.

Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal (option C) would more likely present as an inguinal hernia, which is typically a more acute and painful condition.

Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus (option D) would more likely present as a varicocele, which is a collection of dilated veins in the scrotum.

Primary germ cell neoplasia of the testicle (option E) would more likely present as a firm, nontender testicular mass, which is not consistent with the findings in this case.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which leads to the accumulation of fluid and the formation of a hydrocele.

While observing sinus tachycardia on the patient's telemetry, you note that the radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration. What should be the next step in management of this patient?
Options
A) IV Heparin
B) Pericardiocentesis
C) Chest CT scan
D) Pericardial window
E) Insert chest tube","Let's think step by step. The patient is a 34-year-old individual who has been involved in a motor vehicle accident and is now presenting with sinus tachycardia and an enlarged cardiac silhouette on the EKG and chest radiograph, respectively. The absence of a palpable radial pulse during inspiration is a classic sign of pulsus paradoxus, which is often associated with cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, compressing the heart and impeding its ability to pump blood effectively.

Given the clinical presentation of sinus tachycardia, an enlarged cardiac silhouette, and pulsus paradoxus, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade. The next step in management should be to relieve the pressure on the heart by removing the fluid from the pericardial space.

The correct answer is B) Pericardiocentesis, which is the procedure of removing fluid from the pericardial space to relieve cardiac tamponade. This should be performed immediately in a controlled setting, such as an operating room or a cardiac catheterization laboratory, to ensure the patient's safety.

Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."
1163,"A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?
Options
A) Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
B) Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation
C) Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
D) Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
E) Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation","To determine the most likely lymphatic route for the ovarian cancer to have metastasized to the brain, we need to consider the lymphatic drainage of the ovaries and the pathways that could lead to distant metastases.

The ovaries primarily drain lymphatically to the para-aortic and iliac lymph nodes. From there, the lymphatic fluid can flow through the cisterna chyli and into the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct then drains into the left subclavian vein, which eventually leads to the systemic circulation.

Given that the ovarian cancer has metastasized to the brain, we need to consider the lymphatic pathways that could lead to the brain. The brain is primarily drained by the deep cervical lymph nodes, which then drain into the jugular veins and into the systemic circulation. However, there is a smaller lymphatic pathway that can bypass the jugular veins and directly drain into the deep cervical lymph nodes from the thoracic duct.

Considering the options provided, the most likely lymphatic route for the ovarian cancer to have metastasized to the brain would be through the thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein, and then into the systemic circulation. This route is described in option E.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B) Anti-centromere antibody
C) Anti-Jo-1 antibody
D) Anti-Scl-70 antibodies
E) Anti-double stranded (-ds)DNA","The patient presents with eye dryness and a foreign body sensation in the eyes, which are common symptoms of Sj Sjögren's syndrome. The oral cavity shows mucosal ulceration and atrophy, which is also consistent with Sjögren's syndrome. The biopsy of the lower lip shows marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands, which is a characteristic feature of Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to symptoms of dry mouth and dry eyes.

The presence of anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody is a specific marker for Sjögren's syndrome. This antibody is directed against the SS-B/Ro antigen and is found in approximately 70% of patients with Sjögren's syndrome. The presence of this antibody is highly suggestive of Sjögren's syndrome, making option A the most likely answer.

The other options are not as closely associated with Sjögren's syndrome. Anti-centromere antibody is associated with limited systemic sclerosis, anti-Jo-1 antibody is associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis, anti-Scl-70 antibodies are associated with diffuse systemic sclerosis, and anti-double stranded (ds)DNA is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Therefore, the most likely answer is {A}."

These symptoms are indicative of livedo reticularis, a condition characterized by a lacy, net-like pattern of discoloration on the skin, often associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disorder that can cause blood clots, miscarriages, and other complications.

The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, such as anti-cardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I, and lupus anticoagulant, is a hallmark of APS. These antibodies are directed against phospholipid-binding proteins and can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including thrombosis, recurrent miscarriages, and skin manifestations like livedo reticularis.

Options
A) Schizotypal personality disorder
B) Generalized anxiety disorder
C) Avoidant personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Dependent personality disorder","The 18-year-old patient exhibits several characteristics that suggest she may be struggling with avoidant personality disorder. She is socially isolated, feels lonely, and is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from her family. She also believes that she is untalented and unattractive, which leads her to avoid social interactions and extracurricular activities. Her behavior is not consistent with the other options, as she does not exhibit the characteristic traits of schizotypal personality disorder (e.g., odd beliefs or behaviors), generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., excessive worry about everyday things), paranoid personality disorder (e.g., suspiciousness of others), or dependent personality disorder (e.g., excessive need for reassurance and support).

Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social avoidance, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism. Individuals with this disorder often have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, and may avoid social interactions due to fear of rejection or criticism. They may also have low self-esteem and feel unattractive or untalented.

In this case, the daughter's behavior and thoughts are consistent with avoidant personality disorder. She avoids social interactions and extracurricular activities due to fear of rejection, and she has low self-esteem and feels unattractive and untalented. Her mother's concerns about her social isolation and sensitivity to criticism are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the daughter's behavior is avoidant personality disorder.

A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options

B) Glucagonoma
C) Primary adrenal insufficiency
D) Conversion disorder
E) Factitious disorder imposed on another
""","Analyzing the situation, the 5-year-old boy experienced a sudden loss of consciousness with low blood glucose (22 mg/dL) and low potassium (2.4 mEq/L), which improved after a dextrose infusion. However, he had another episode of decreased consciousness with low blood glucose (19 mg/dL) and high insulin levels (108 mIU/L), but very low C-peptide levels (0.3 ng/mL). C-peptide is a byproduct of insulin production in the pancreas, and low levels suggest that the insulin is not being produced by the pancreas but rather being administered externally.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another, also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy. This condition involves a caregiver, often a parent, fabricating or inducing illness in a child to gain attention and sympathy for themselves. The high insulin levels and low C-peptide levels suggest that the child was receiving exogenous insulin, likely administered by the mother to induce hypoglycemia and garner medical attention.

The other options are less likely:

A) Malingering: This involves a person intentionally feigning illness for personal gain, but it is typically seen in older children or adults, not young children.

B) Glucagonoma: This is a rare tumor of the pancreas that produces excess glucagon, leading to high blood glucose levels, not hypoglycemia.

C) Primary adrenal insufficiency: This condition involves a deficiency of cortisol and aldosterone, leading to low blood pressure and electrolyte imbalances, but it does not typically present with hypoglycemia and high insulin levels.

D) Conversion disorder: This involves a physical symptom or deficit that cannot be explained by a medical condition, but it does not typically involve deliberate manipulation of a child's medical condition.

E) Factitious disorder imposed on self: This involves a person fabricating or inducing illness in themselves to gain attention and sympathy, but it is not relevant to this scenario where the child is the one experiencing symptoms.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another, also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

B) The ribosome will recognize the inappropriately inserted valine residue and terminate protein translation
C) The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine
D) The mischarged tRNA will be degraded by the proteasome
E) The mischarged tRNA will be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

The laboratory is investigating whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. To do this, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They then design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine.

The key point here is that the tRNA is mischarged with valine instead of lysine. This means that the tRNA is carrying an amino acid that is not the correct one for the codon it is being inserted into.

The ribosome reads the mRNA sequence and matches the codons to the corresponding amino acids. In this case, the codons specify for lysine, but the tRNA is carrying valine. However, the ribosome does not have a mechanism to recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation.

Instead, the ribosome will simply incorporate the valine into the growing peptide chain, regardless of the fact that it is not the correct amino acid for the codon. This is because the ribosome relies on the accuracy of the tRNA synthetase to ensure that the correct amino acid is attached to the tRNA.

Therefore, the mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated into the codons that specify for lysine.

The answer is {C}."

She has a history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux, and she volunteers at an animal shelter three times a week. Her physical examination reveals a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast.

Given the patient's history of volunteering at an animal shelter, it is essential to consider zoonotic infections, which are diseases transmitted from animals to humans. The rash described is consistent with shingles, also known as herpes zoster, which is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). VZV is a member of the herpesvirus family and is responsible for chickenpox in children. After the initial infection, the virus remains latent in the dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate later in life, causing shingles.

The rash described, with its characteristic distribution and appearance, is consistent with shingles. The patient's history of volunteering at an animal shelter and her age increase her risk for zoonotic infections, including shingles.

The most likely underlying mechanism of the disease is viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia.

A) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomoyopathy
B) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
C) Brugada syndrome
D) Ventricular tachycardia
E) Sick sinus syndrome","To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the information provided. The 28-year-old man presents with dizziness and palpitations that started 2 days ago, and he had a history of excessive alcohol consumption prior to the onset of symptoms. The ECG results are not explicitly described, but we can infer that the symptoms and potential ECG findings are related to the excessive alcohol consumption.

Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to various cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by an irregular and often rapid heart rate, which can cause symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. The ECG findings would typically show an irregularly irregular rhythm, with no clear P waves and a rapid ventricular rate.

Considering the options provided:

A) Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to obstruction of blood flow and symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath. This condition is not directly related to excessive alcohol consumption.

B) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a type of atrial fibrillation that occurs in episodes, often triggered by factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, stress, or caffeine intake. This condition is consistent with the patient's symptoms and potential ECG findings.

C) Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the heart's electrical system, leading to abnormal ECG findings and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. This condition is not directly related to excessive alcohol consumption.

D) Ventricular tachycardia is a type of abnormal heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles, often leading to symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. While this condition can be triggered by excessive alcohol consumption, it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided.

E) Sick sinus syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormal heart rhythm due to problems with the sinoatrial node, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. This condition is not directly related to excessive alcohol consumption.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which is a type of atrial fibrillation that occurs in episodes, often triggered by factors such as excessive alcohol consumption.

224,"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of episodic pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs for 4 months. The pain occurs a few hours before her menstrual period and lasts for 2 days. She has been taking ibuprofen, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 28-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years and last for 5 to 6 days. She is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options
A) Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin
B) Ascending infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or surrounding tissue
C) Fluid-filled sac within the ovary
D) Pregnancy
E) Hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor of the myometrium","The 15-year-old girl presents with episodic pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs that occurs a few hours before her menstrual period and lasts for 2 days. This pattern of pain is characteristic of dysmenorrhea, which is a common symptom associated with menstrual cramps. The pain is thought to be caused by the contraction of the uterus, which is mediated by prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that are produced by the endometrium (the lining of the uterus) and cause the uterus to contract. These contractions can be painful and are often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's use of ibuprofen, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), has provided some relief from her symptoms. This is because NSAIDs can help to reduce the production of prostaglandins and therefore decrease the severity of menstrual cramps.

Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that she has regular menstrual periods, the most likely cause of her symptoms is endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin. This is a normal process that occurs during menstruation and is not typically associated with any underlying pathology.

618,"A microbiologist has isolated several colonies of Escherichia coli on an agar plate. The microbiologist exposes the agar plate to ciprofloxacin, which destroys all of the bacteria except for one surviving colony. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony?
Options
A) Replacement of D-alanine
B) Mutation of DNA gyrase
C) Inactivation by bacterial transferase
D) Production of β-lactamase
E) Modification of surface binding proteins","To determine the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony, let's consider the characteristics of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the type of bacteria Escherichia coli.

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and transcription. By binding to these enzymes, ciprofloxacin prevents the bacterial DNA from replicating, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth and multiplication.

Given that the surviving colony is resistant to ciprofloxacin, the most likely mechanism of resistance is a mutation in the target enzyme, DNA gyrase. This mutation would alter the binding site of ciprofloxacin, preventing it from effectively inhibiting DNA gyrase and allowing the bacteria to continue replicating despite the presence of the antibiotic.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin or the type of bacteria Escherichia coli. Replacement of D-alanine is associated with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, inactivation by bacterial transferase is associated with resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, production of β-lactamase is associated with resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, and modification of surface binding proteins is associated with resistance to certain antibiotics that target surface proteins.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony is a mutation of DNA gyrase.

1129,"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care ward due to progressive dyspnea, cough with pink sputum, and diaphoresis. He had 2 myocardial infarctions at the age of 66 and 69 years and suffers from chronic heart failure. At the time of presentation, his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 29/min, and temperature 35.5°C (95.9°F). On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?
Options
A) Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining
B) Areas with 'ghost cells' surrounded by macrophages in the cardiac tissue
C) Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue
D) Ground-glass hepatocytes
E) Positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue","To approach this question, let's break down the patient's presentation and history. The 74-year-old man had a history of myocardial infarctions at ages 66 and 69, and he suffers from chronic heart failure. He presents with progressive dyspnea, cough with pink sputum, and diaphoresis, which suggests a severe cardiac condition. His vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea, indicating shock. The physical examination findings, including the patient's lethargy, cyanosis, and widespread bilateral fine rales, are consistent with acute heart failure and possibly cardiac arrest. The cardiac examination reveals an S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur, which are indicative of left ventricular failure and possible mitral regurgitation.

The patient's sudden deterioration and death, despite adequate resuscitation measures, suggest a catastrophic cardiac event. The microscopic findings listed in the options are associated with various conditions, but we need to identify the one that is most likely related to the patient's presentation.

Option A refers to brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining, which are characteristic of alveolar proteinosis. However, this condition is not directly related to the patient's cardiac history or presentation.

Option B mentions areas with 'ghost cells' surrounded by macrophages in the cardiac tissue, which is indicative of myocardial infarction and subsequent tissue damage. However, this finding is not specific to the patient's presentation and is a common feature of myocardial infarction.

Option C describes positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue, which is characteristic of hemosiderin deposition and seen in conditions such as hemochromatosis or chronic kidney disease. This finding is not directly related to the patient's cardiac presentation.

Option D refers to ground-glass hepatocytes, which are seen in conditions such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. This finding is not relevant to the patient's cardiac presentation.

Option E mentions positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue, which is characteristic of amyloidosis. However, this condition is not directly related to the patient's cardiac presentation.

Considering the patient's history of myocardial infarctions, chronic heart failure, and sudden cardiac death, the most likely microscopic finding would be related to the cardiac tissue itself. However, none of the options directly relate to the patient's presentation. Upon reevaluation, we can consider another option.

Given the patient's presentation and history, the most likely cause of death is cardiac arrest due to a catastrophic cardiac event, such as a massive myocardial infarction or arrhythmia. However, none of the options directly relate to this scenario. The patient's presentation is more suggestive of a condition that affects the cardiac tissue, but the options provided do not directly relate to this scenario.

597,"Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?
Options
A) Increase in concentration of serum myoglobin
B) Closure of the ductus arteriosus
C) Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+
D) Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
E) Allosteric alteration of heme groups","The newborn boy is experiencing tachypnea and elevated pulmonary artery pressure, which is indicative of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The use of an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP leads to immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status, suggesting a response to vasodilatory therapy. However, three hours later, the newborn develops cyanosis characterized by blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes.

The cyanosis in this scenario is likely due to the closure of the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is a vital fetal blood vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, allowing blood to bypass the lungs and flow directly to the systemic circulation. In the fetal circulation, the ductus arteriosus is kept open by the high pressure in the aorta and the low pressure in the pulmonary artery. After birth, the ductus arteriosus should close, and the blood should start flowing through the lungs for oxygenation.

However, in cases of PPHN, the ductus arteriosus may remain patent, allowing blood to bypass the lungs and flow directly to the systemic circulation. The use of vasodilatory therapy can lead to a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, which may cause the ductus arteriosus to close. When the ductus arteriosus closes, blood flow to the systemic circulation is reduced, leading to cyanosis.

The other options do not directly explain the cyanosis in this scenario. An increase in concentration of serum myoglobin (A) is not related to the closure of the ductus arteriosus. Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+ (C) is a process that occurs in the presence of oxygen and is not directly related to the closure of the ductus arteriosus. Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (D) is a process that occurs in the presence of certain toxins and is not directly related to the closure of the ductus arteriosus. Allosteric alteration of heme groups (E) is a process that occurs in the presence of certain toxins and is not directly related to the closure of the ductus arteriosus.

The answer is {B}."

Thalassemia intermedia is a milder form of beta-thalassemia, characterized by reduced production of the beta-globin chains of hemoglobin. This reduction leads to a decreased amount of hemoglobin in red blood cells, resulting in microcytic anemia.

The Kozak sequence is a region in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Beta-globin gene that plays a crucial role in the initiation of translation. A mutation in this sequence can affect the efficiency of translation, leading to reduced production of the beta-globin chains.

Given the pathophysiology of thalassemia intermedia, we would expect to see microcytic red blood cells on the blood smear. Microcytic anemia is characterized by small, pale red blood cells, which are a result of the reduced hemoglobin content.

The other options are not consistent with the expected findings in thalassemia intermedia:

* Macrocytic red blood cells (Option A) are characteristic of megaloblastic anemia, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate.
* Hyperchromic red blood cells (Option B) are not a typical finding in thalassemia intermedia.
* Bite cells (Option D) are characteristic of hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease, but are not a typical finding in thalassemia intermedia.
* Ringed sideroblasts (Option E) are characteristic of sideroblastic anemia, which is caused by a defect in heme synthesis.

Therefore, the expected blood smear findings in a patient with thalassemia intermedia due to a mutation in the Beta-globin gene would be microcytic red blood cells.

1122,"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?
Options
A) Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus
B) Compressive tumor of the pons
C) Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency
D) Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit
E) Infarction of the brainstem","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 25-year-old woman is experiencing periodic painful double vision for 3 days, which occurs only when looking sideways. She has a history of myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she fell off her bike and underwent a CT scan of the head, which showed no abnormalities. She is currently taking an oral contraceptive. The patient's symptoms include adduction deficits in both eyes and nystagmus in the opposite eye when looking sideways. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia.

The patient's symptoms suggest a condition that affects the extraocular muscles, particularly the medial rectus muscles, which are responsible for adduction. The presence of nystagmus in the opposite eye when looking sideways further supports this. The most likely cause of this patient's findings is a condition that affects the cranial nerves responsible for controlling the extraocular muscles.

Considering the options provided:

A) Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus: This condition, also known as internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), is a disorder of the brainstem that affects the medial longitudinal fasciculus, a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the cranial nerve nuclei controlling eye movements. INO is characterized by adduction deficits and nystagmus in the opposite eye when looking sideways, which matches the patient's symptoms.

B) Compressive tumor of the pons: This condition would likely cause more severe and persistent symptoms, such as cranial nerve palsies and ataxia, which are not present in this patient.

C) Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency: This condition, also known as Wernicke's encephalopathy, typically presents with ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion, which are not consistent with this patient's symptoms.

D) Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit: This condition would likely cause more severe and acute symptoms, such as severe headache, vomiting, and visual disturbances, which are not present in this patient.

E) Infarction of the brainstem: This condition would likely cause more severe and persistent symptoms, such as cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, and hemiparesis, which are not present in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, also known as internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO).

682,"A 29-year-old female presents to her primary care provider with an aching pain in her left leg that has progressively gotten worse over several days. She recently had an unfortunate sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs. An X-ray after the event was negative for fracture. Past medical history is positive for systemic lupus erythematosus. She also has a history of one spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 119/80 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her left leg appears pink and slightly swollen. Homan’s sign is positive. A Doppler ultrasound reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Her lab results are as follows:
Platelets 250,000/mm3
Prothrombin Time 14 sec
Partial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec
Mixing study (PTT) 89 sec
What is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?
Options
A) Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
B) Antibodies directed against phospholipids
C) Antibodies directed against endothelial cells
D) Vitamin K deficiency
E) Disseminated intravascular coagulation","The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a recent sporting incident resulting in bruises along both legs and lower thighs. She presents with an aching pain in her left leg that has progressively worsened over several days. The physical examination reveals a positive Homan's sign, which is suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The Doppler ultrasound confirms the presence of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein.

The patient's lab results show an elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 90 seconds, which is indicative of a coagulation disorder. The mixing study (PTT) remains elevated at 89 seconds, suggesting that the coagulation abnormality is not due to a factor deficiency but rather an inhibitor.

The patient's history of SLE and recent spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation are significant risk factors for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which are directed against phospholipids. These antibodies can lead to the formation of blood clots, including DVT.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and lab results, the most likely cause of her condition is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of antibodies directed against phospholipids.

The answer is {B}."
1107,"A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Bipolar I disorder
B) Bipolar II disorder
C) Cyclothymic disorder
D) Persistent depressive disorder
E) Schizoaffective disorder","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 35-year-old woman, let's analyze her symptoms and history.

She reports experiencing several periods of depressed mood over the past 3 years, which last for 4-6 weeks and do not coincide with any specific life events. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite. However, she is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband at times, indicating some degree of normal functioning.

She also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years, during which she is very productive at work and requires less sleep than usual. These episodes are not described as being as severe as those experienced by individuals with bipolar I disorder, and they do not appear to be a significant burden on her functioning.

Given her symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is cyclothymic disorder. Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by periods of hypomanic symptoms lasting at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents), with numerous episodes of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a major depressive or manic episode. The symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

The other options are not as likely:

* Bipolar I disorder is characterized by at least one manic episode, which is not present in this patient.
* Bipolar II disorder is characterized by at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but the patient's hypomanic episodes are not described as being a significant burden on her functioning.
* Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a depressed mood for most of the day, more days than not, for at least 2 years, but the patient's depressive episodes are not described as being as severe as those experienced by individuals with persistent depressive disorder.
* Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by a combination of schizophrenia symptoms and a major depressive or manic episode, but there is no indication of schizophrenia symptoms in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {C} Cyclothymic disorder."
417,"A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?
Options
A) Acts as an important opsonin  
B) Plays a role in angioedema
C) Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor
D) Creates pores in the cell membrane
E) Induces the alternative complement pathway","To determine the component that is likely deficient in this patient, let's analyze the information provided.

The patient has a history of infections, including meningitis and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. She also has a current infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a Gram-negative diplococcus. The fact that she uses safe sex practices suggests that her infection is not due to a lack of protection against sexually transmitted infections.

The patient's history of meningitis and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae suggests that she may have a deficiency in her innate immune system. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against infections and includes components such as complement proteins, neutrophils, and macrophages.

The fact that the patient's infections are caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae suggests that she may have a deficiency in the complement system, specifically the alternative complement pathway. The alternative complement pathway is important for clearing encapsulated bacteria from the body.

The component that is likely deficient in this patient is the C3b-binding protein, which is a key component of the alternative complement pathway. This protein is responsible for binding to C3b and activating the alternative complement pathway, which leads to the clearance of encapsulated bacteria from the body.

The correct answer is E) Induces the alternative complement pathway.

1236,"A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?
Options
A) 9/100
B) 1/10
C) 18/100
D) 81/100
E) 9/10","To solve this problem, we need to understand the genetic basis of the disease and the concept of carrier status. The disease described is likely Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which codes for a protein that regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells.

Since the patient was born with the disease, she is homozygous recessive for the CFTR gene mutation, meaning she has two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent). Her parents must be carriers of the disease, as they passed the mutated gene to her.

The patient's husband is not affected by the disease, but he could be a carrier. The probability that he is a carrier is 2pq, where p is the frequency of the recessive allele in the population (1/100) and q is the frequency of the dominant allele (99/100). So, the probability that he is a carrier is 2(1/100)(99/100) = 198/10000.

The probability that their child will have the disease is the product of the probability that the husband is a carrier and the probability that the wife is homozygous recessive (1/100). This is because the child must inherit one mutated gene from each parent to express the disease.

So, the probability that their child will have the disease is (198/10000)(1/100) = 198/1000000 = 99/500000 = 1/5000.

However, the question asks for the chance that their child will have the disease of interest, which is the chance that the child will be affected. This is the same as the chance that the child will be homozygous recessive for the CFTR gene mutation. 

To find this probability, we need to consider the possible genotypes of the child. The child can be either homozygous recessive (RR), homozygous dominant (rr), or heterozygous (Rr). The probability that the child will be homozygous recessive is the product of the probability that the husband is a carrier and the probability that the wife is homozygous recessive, which is (198/10000)(1/100) = 198/1000000 = 99/500000 = 1/5000.

The probability that the child will be homozygous dominant is the probability that the husband is not a carrier and the wife is homozygous dominant, which is (802/10000)(99/100) = 793802/1000000 = 396901/500000 = 397/2500.

The probability that the child will be heterozygous is the probability that the husband is a carrier and the wife is not homozygous recessive, which is (198/10000)(99/100) = 793802/1000000 = 396901/500000 = 397/2500.

The probability that the child will have the disease of interest is the probability that the child will be homozygous recessive, which is 1/5000.

The answer is {1/5000}."

C) Terbutaline
D) Mifepristone
E) Copper intrauterine device","To determine the best course of action for the 24-year-old woman who wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy, we need to consider the options provided.

A) Megestrol is a synthetic progestin used to treat breast cancer and promote weight gain in patients with cancer-related weight loss. It is not used for medical abortion.

B) Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used to treat breast cancer. It is not used for medical abortion.

C) Terbutaline is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions. It is not used for medical abortion.

D) Mifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a progesterone receptor antagonist used for medical abortion. It works by blocking the action of progesterone, which is necessary for pregnancy maintenance.

E) Copper intrauterine device (IUD) is a form of long-term birth control that can also be used for medical abortion. However, it is typically used for pregnancies up to 9 weeks, and the patient is already 6 weeks pregnant.

1204,"A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?
Options
A) Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption.
B) Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products.
C) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.
D) The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed.
E) This patient has no contraindications for bupropion and may safely use it.","The patient is a 36-year-old man who wants to quit smoking and has tried various nicotine replacement products without success. He has a history of head trauma and two seizure episodes, but is not currently taking any antiepileptic medication. He is interested in using an antidepressant to help with smoking cessation.

Bupropion is a medication that is commonly used to help people quit smoking. It is an antidepressant that works by affecting the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, which are involved in the brain's reward and pleasure centers. Bupropion can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation.

However, bupropion can lower the seizure threshold, which means that it may increase the risk of seizures in some people. This is particularly concerning for patients with a history of seizure disorder, such as the patient in this case. Therefore, option C is correct, as bupropion should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.

Options A and B are incorrect because omeprazole does not interfere with bupropion metabolism, and bupropion is effective even when used alone, without nicotine replacement products.

Option D is also incorrect because a full cardiac workup is not required before prescribing bupropion for smoking cessation.

Option E is incorrect because the patient's history of head trauma and seizure episodes is a contraindication for bupropion.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

590,"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, comes to the emergency department because of sudden-onset, severe right flank pain. She was in her aerobics class when the pain started but denies any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts. Menses occur regularly at 28-day intervals. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F). Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary. Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?
Options
A) Broad ligament
B) Round ligament of the uterus
C) Ovarian ligament
D) Cardinal ligament
E) Infundibulopelvic ligament","The 36-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset, severe right flank pain without any history of trauma, which is suggestive of a renal or ovarian issue. Her history of recurrent ovarian cysts and the presence of a large simple cyst on the right ovary on pelvic ultrasound support this possibility. However, the absence of flow in the right ovarian vein on Doppler imaging is a critical finding that points towards a specific diagnosis.

The absence of flow in the right ovarian vein suggests that the ovarian vein has been occluded, which is a common site for ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT). OVT is a condition where a blood clot forms in the ovarian vein, which can be caused by various factors, including pregnancy, ovarian torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease.

Given the anatomy of the female reproductive system, the ovarian vein drains into the inferior vena cava via the infundibulopelvic ligament. The infundibulopelvic ligament is a fibromuscular structure that connects the ovary to the pelvic sidewall and contains the ovarian vessels, including the ovarian vein. Therefore, the most likely ligament involved in this case is the infundibulopelvic ligament.

The infundibulopelvic ligament is a common site for ovarian vein thrombosis, and its involvement would explain the absence of flow in the right ovarian vein on Doppler imaging. This condition can cause severe pain, as seen in this patient, and can be a life-threatening emergency if not treated promptly.

In summary, the most likely ligament involved in this case is the infundibulopelvic ligament, which is responsible for transmitting the ovarian vein to the inferior vena cava.

912,"A previously healthy 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of depressed mood and fatigue. During this time, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. She reports trouble concentrating at her job as a preschool teacher and has missed work several times in recent weeks due to generalized fatigue. She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is actively trying to quit smoking. A drug is prescribed that will treat the patient's mood disturbance and support smoking cessation. This patient should be counseled about which of the following possible side effects of this drug?
Options
A) Decreased libido
B) Hypotension
C) Urinary retention
D) Tachycardia
E) QTc prolongation","To address this question, let's first identify the patient's condition and the medication that would be prescribed to treat it.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman presenting with a 2-month history of depressed mood and fatigue, accompanied by a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. She also reports trouble concentrating at work and has missed work due to generalized fatigue. These symptoms are indicative of major depressive disorder (MDD). Additionally, she is actively trying to quit smoking, which suggests that the prescribed medication should also support smoking cessation.

Given the patient's condition and the need for a medication that can treat MDD and support smoking cessation, a suitable option is bupropion. Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) that is commonly used to treat MDD and smoking cessation.

Now, let's evaluate the possible side effects listed in the options and determine which one is most relevant to bupropion:

A) Decreased libido: Bupropion is known to potentially decrease libido in some patients.

B) Hypotension: Bupropion is not typically associated with hypotension as a common side effect.

C) Urinary retention: This side effect is more commonly associated with anticholinergic medications, not bupropion.

D) Tachycardia: While bupropion can cause some cardiovascular effects, tachycardia is not the most commonly reported side effect.

E) QTc prolongation: Bupropion can cause some changes in cardiac function, but QTc prolongation is not the most significant concern.

Given the information above, the most relevant side effect for bupropion is decreased libido.

Options
A) Propofol
B) Ketamine
C) Fentanyl
D) Ketorolac
E) Midazolam","To determine the most likely recommended agent for this patient, let's analyze the information provided. The patient is a 65-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer who has been experiencing severe, unremitting pain. He has required escalating doses of oral morphine but is now experiencing dose-limiting side effects. The pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce his opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor.

The NMDA receptor is a subtype of glutamate receptor, and its activation is involved in the development of opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain). Medications that interact with the NMDA receptor can help reduce opioid requirements by blocking its activation.

Among the options provided, the medication that interacts with the NMDA receptor is B) Ketamine. Ketamine is an anesthetic medication that also has analgesic properties. It works by blocking the NMDA receptor, which can help reduce opioid requirements and alleviate pain. It is often used in the management of chronic pain, especially in patients who have developed tolerance to opioids.

The other options are not correct because:

A) Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic medication used for anesthesia, but it does not interact with the NMDA receptor.

C) Fentanyl is an opioid medication that can be used to treat pain, but it does not interact with the NMDA receptor.

D) Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can be used to treat pain, but it does not interact with the NMDA receptor.

E) Midazolam is a benzodiazepine medication used for sedation and anesthesia, but it does not interact with the NMDA receptor.

E) Respiratory alkalosis","Evaluating the patient's presentation, the 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism is experiencing intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrates abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that resemble ""folded envelopes."" This finding is characteristic of ethylene glycol poisoning, which can occur due to ingestion of antifreeze or other products containing ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to oxalic acid, which can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine.

The patient's presentation is consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, which can cause metabolic acidosis. The anion gap is typically elevated in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning due to the accumulation of organic acids. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is an anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Options
A) Spironolactone therapy
B) Gonadectomy
C) Testosterone therapy
D) Vaginal dilatory therapy
E) Prednisolone therapy","The 15-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea, characterized by the absence of menstrual periods in a female who has not yet reached the age of 16. The absence of personal or family history of serious illness and the patient's normal vital signs suggest that the cause of her condition is likely congenital. The examination reveals a secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola, sparse and lightly pigmented pubic hair, bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses, and a blind-ended vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries, indicating a condition known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the vagina and uterus.

In MRKH syndrome, the ovaries are typically present and functional, producing normal levels of sex hormones. Therefore, the patient will have normal secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development and pubic hair. The absence of a uterus and vagina can lead to issues with menstrual cycles and fertility.

Given the patient's condition, the most appropriate treatment is surgical intervention to create a functional vagina and possibly a uterus. However, this is not listed among the options provided.

Among the options, spironolactone therapy is used to treat conditions such as hirsutism and acne in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but it is not the primary treatment for MRKH syndrome. Gonadectomy is the surgical removal of the ovaries, which is not necessary in this case since the ovaries are likely functional. Testosterone therapy is not indicated for this patient as she has normal secondary sexual characteristics. Vaginal dilatory therapy is used to help women with vaginal narrowing or stenosis, but it is not the primary treatment for MRKH syndrome. Prednisolone therapy is used to treat various inflammatory conditions and is not relevant to this patient's condition.

Since the options provided do not include the most appropriate treatment for MRKH syndrome, the best answer is not among the provided options. However, based on the information provided and the need to select an answer, the closest option that might be considered in the management of MRKH syndrome is vaginal dilatory therapy, although it is not the primary treatment.

The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?
Options
A) Deep venous thrombosis
B) Endometrial cancer
C) Eruption of seborrheic keratoses
D) Increased bleeding
E) Osteoporosis","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. She is currently taking tamoxifen, which is an estrogen receptor antagonist. Tamoxifen is often used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, including estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, one of the potential side effects of tamoxifen is an increased risk of endometrial cancer, which is cancer of the lining of the uterus. This is because tamoxifen can stimulate the growth of the endometrium, leading to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.

Given the patient's history of a uterine leiomyoma (also known as a uterine fibroid), which is a type of non-cancerous tumor of the uterus, she is already at an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. The use of tamoxifen further increases this risk.

Therefore, the potential complication that could occur in this patient is an increased risk of endometrial cancer.

595,"A 38-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with the complaint of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain for the past 2 hours. She states that she has experienced similar pain in the past. These episodes occur mostly after meals and often subside several hours after she finishes eating. Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg. A physical abdominal exam is unremarkable, including examination of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Duodenal peptic ulcer
B) Choledocholithiasis
C) Pancreatitis
D) Gastric peptic ulcer
E) Gallbladder cancer","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 38-year-old woman presenting with epigastric discomfort and cramping pain, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Symptoms**: The patient experiences epigastric discomfort and cramping pain that occurs mostly after meals and subsides several hours after eating. This pattern suggests a relationship between food intake and the pain.

2. **Frequency and Duration**: The patient has experienced similar pain in the past, indicating a chronic condition. The episodes last for several hours, which is consistent with conditions that cause intermittent pain.

3. **Associated Symptoms**: The patient has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months, which could be related to decreased appetite due to pain or other underlying conditions.

4. **Lifestyle Factors**: The patient is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally, both of which are risk factors for gastrointestinal disorders.

5. **Physical Examination**: The abdominal exam is unremarkable, which does not support conditions that cause significant abdominal tenderness or masses.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is a **peptic ulcer**. Peptic ulcers are sores that develop on the inside lining of the stomach and the upper portion of the small intestine (duodenum). They often cause epigastric pain that worsens with food intake and improves with rest. The patient's symptoms of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain after meals, combined with her history of smoking and occasional alcohol consumption, make peptic ulcer a strong candidate for the diagnosis.

Between the options provided, **A) Duodenal peptic ulcer** is the most likely diagnosis, as it is a common cause of peptic ulcer disease and the symptoms described by the patient are consistent with this condition.

377,"A 3-month-old girl is brought to the physician because of a productive cough for 5 days. Over the past month, she has had several episodes of watery stools. She is exclusively breastfed every 3–4 hours for 15–20 minutes. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not yet been evaluated by a physician. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. The mother had no prenatal care. The infant is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. The infant has not received any immunizations. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Oral examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate. Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Options
A) Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes
B) DNA test for CFTR mutation
C) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test
D) Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes
E) T-cell receptor excision circle analysis","The 3-month-old girl presents with a productive cough for 5 days, watery stools for the past month, and a history of being exclusively breastfed. The mother had no prenatal care, and the infant is not gaining weight. The infant's temperature is elevated at 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Oral examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate, and rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present.

Considering the symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is congenital syphilis. The presence of white plaques on the tongue and palate, known as ""snuffles,"" is a classic sign of congenital syphilis. Additionally, the presence of rales on cardiopulmonary examination and cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy further supports this diagnosis.

The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test is a serological test used to diagnose syphilis. It detects antibodies against the Treponema pallidum bacterium, which causes syphilis. This test is highly specific but may remain positive for life, even after successful treatment.

Therefore, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of congenital syphilis is the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test.

388,"A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to a pediatrician’s office for persistent fever. His temperature has ranged from 38.6°C–39.5°C (101.5°F–103.1°F) over the past week. He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient’s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?
Options
A) Staphylococcus
B) Pseudomonas
C) Burkholderia
D) Influenza
E) Candida","The patient is a 6-year-old boy with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. He is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum and has been started on vancomycin. The pediatrician mentions that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree, which increases the patient's chances of future infections.

The patient's condition is likely Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which codes for a transmembrane protein responsible for regulating the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes.

As the patient grows older, he will be at increased risk of developing chronic lung infections, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the environment and can cause infections in people with compromised immune systems or respiratory conditions like CF.

In adulthood, the patient will likely experience repeated lung infections with Pseudomonas, which can lead to chronic lung damage and respiratory failure. The patient's family should be aware of the risks of Pseudomonas infections and work closely with his healthcare team to manage his condition and prevent future infections.

Therefore, the pathogen that will most likely infect this patient in adulthood is Pseudomonas.

383,"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?
Options
A) Duloxetine
B) Trazodone
C) Bupropion
D) Mirtazapine
E) Citalopram","The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of depression, difficulty sleeping, poor appetite, low concentration, low energy, and lost interest in activities she previously enjoyed. She has also had a history of binge eating and purging behavior in the past, which is indicative of bulimia nervosa. The physician is considering prescribing medication for her current symptoms.

Among the options provided, the medication that should most be avoided in this patient is Bupropion. Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) that can cause an increase in appetite and weight gain, which may exacerbate bulimia nervosa symptoms. Additionally, bupropion can also cause a decrease in the level of serotonin, which may worsen depressive symptoms.

The other options are not contraindicated in patients with a history of bulimia nervosa. Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that can help with depression and anxiety symptoms. Trazodone is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) that can help with depression and insomnia symptoms. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that can help with depression and anxiety symptoms by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can help with depression and anxiety symptoms.

Therefore, the medication that should most be avoided in this patient is Bupropion.

Options
A) Transplacental passage of thyroglobulin antibodies
B) Transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies
C) Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies
D) Transplacental viral infection
E) Opiate use in the mother","The 3-week-old male newborn is presenting with poor weight gain since birth, despite good latching and breastfeeding. His mother has a history of Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The mother underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy and is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The newborn's symptoms, including irritability, diaphoresis, and paucity of subcutaneous fat, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The swelling of the neck at the midline is likely due to a goiter, which is an enlargement of the thyroid gland.

The most likely cause of the newborn's symptoms is the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies from the mother to the fetus. TSH receptor antibodies are responsible for stimulating the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism. This is a known complication of Graves' disease in pregnancy, and it can cause symptoms in the newborn, including those described in this case.

The other options are not as likely to cause the newborn's symptoms. Transplacental passage of thyroglobulin antibodies or thyroid peroxidase antibodies may cause hypothyroidism in the newborn, rather than hyperthyroidism. Transplacental viral infection is not a known cause of hyperthyroidism in newborns. Opiate use in the mother is not related to the newborn's symptoms.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the newborn's symptoms is the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies, which is option {C}.

She reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse and has a physical examination revealing dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted, and the perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled.

Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is atrophic vaginitis. Atrophic vaginitis is a condition characterized by thinning and drying of the vaginal walls, often due to decreased estrogen levels after menopause. This condition can cause symptoms such as severe itching, burning, and pain during intercourse. The physical examination findings of dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area, atrophy of the labia minora, retracted clitoris, and pale and wrinkled perianal skin are consistent with atrophic vaginitis.

The other options are less likely:

A) Squamous cell hyperplasia is a condition characterized by thickening of the squamous epithelium, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

B) Lichen sclerosus is a condition characterized by thinning and scarring of the skin, often with white patches and atrophy of the affected area. While it can cause itching and pain, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with atrophic vaginitis.

C) Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is a type of cancer that can cause itching, pain, and bleeding, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest cancer.

D) Lichen planus is a condition characterized by inflammation of the mucous membranes, often with purplish, itchy patches. While it can cause itching and pain, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with atrophic vaginitis.

E) Atrophic vaginitis is the correct diagnosis.

Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?
Options
A) Lisinopril
B) Fluphenazine
C) Tolbutamide
D) Levothyroxine
E) Atorvastatin
""","Analyzing the situation, the 38-year-old man is presenting with altered mental status, lethargy, and a low body temperature of 32°C (89.6°F), which is indicative of hypothermia. The absence of deep tendon reflexes and the presence of dilated pupils that are poorly reactive to light suggest a neurological impairment. The patient's history of being started on a new drug 10 days ago and the presence of these symptoms suggest an adverse reaction to the medication.

Among the options provided, the most likely cause of these findings is a drug that affects the central nervous system and can cause hypothermia and neurological impairment. Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. It can cause a range of side effects, including hypothermia, sedation, and extrapyramidal symptoms such as rigidity and akathisia.

The patient's attempt to remove his clothing throughout the examination is also consistent with the extrapyramidal symptoms caused by fluphenazine. The medication's effects on the central nervous system and the patient's history of schizoaffective disorder make fluphenazine the most likely cause of these findings.

Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is {B} Fluphenazine."

When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men. The man’s actions are most consistent with which of the following psychological defense mechanisms?
Options
A) Displacement
B) Dissociation
C) Projection
D) Reaction formation
E) Repression","The 28-year-old man's behavior is indicative of a psychological defense mechanism where he attributes his own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. In this case, he accuses his wife of giving flirtatious looks to the waiter, which is actually a reflection of his own behavior of flirting with female co-workers. This is a classic example of projection, where an individual redirects their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings onto someone else.

Projection is a defense mechanism that helps individuals avoid taking responsibility for their own feelings or actions by attributing them to someone else. It is often used to deny or avoid dealing with one's own flaws or weaknesses.

The other options are not consistent with the man's behavior:

* Displacement refers to redirecting one's emotions or feelings from the original source to a more acceptable target.
* Dissociation refers to a disconnection from one's thoughts, feelings, or experiences.
* Reaction formation refers to the adoption of a behavior or attitude that is opposite to one's true feelings.
* Repression refers to the unconscious suppression of thoughts, feelings, or memories.

Therefore, the man's actions are most consistent with projection.

Options
A) Elevated serum homocysteine
B) Thrombin inhibitor deficiency
C) Deficiency in protein C
D) Auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids
E) Resistance to clotting factor degradation","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 35-year-old Caucasian female developed unilateral leg swelling with painful redness and swelling on the left side, which is consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She has a history of a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago, indicating a possible genetic predisposition to thrombosis. The genetic workup revealed an inherited condition. Considering the patient's history of recurrent DVT, the most likely pathophysiology is a deficiency in a protein that regulates blood clotting.

Among the options provided, the deficiency in protein C (Option C) is the most likely cause of this patient's condition. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays a crucial role in regulating blood clotting by inactivating factors V and VIII. A deficiency in protein C can lead to an increased risk of thrombosis, including DVT.

Protein C deficiency is an inherited condition that can be caused by mutations in the PROC gene. It is characterized by an increased risk of thrombosis, particularly in the young population. The patient's history of recurrent DVT and the genetic workup suggesting an inherited condition support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely pathophysiology of this patient's condition is a deficiency in protein C.

Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?
Options
A) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
B) Primary respiratory acidosis
C) Primary respiratory alkalosis
D) Compensatory respiratory acidosis
E) Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a 2-day history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough, shortness of breath for the past 6 months, and a history of smoking 30 pack-years. His symptoms and history are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The physical examination findings of diminished breath sounds bilaterally, a barrel-shaped chest, and pursed-lip breathing are consistent with COPD. The chest X-ray showing a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation further supports this diagnosis.

COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% in this patient is indicative of airflow limitation, which is a hallmark of COPD. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the pulmonary function testing results, suggest that he has a significant obstructive lung disease.

In COPD, the lungs are unable to fully exhale air, leading to hyperinflation of the lungs and a flattened diaphragm. This results in a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the arterial blood, leading to hypoxemia. The body attempts to compensate for this hypoxemia by increasing the respiratory rate and depth, which can lead to an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) in the arterial blood, resulting in hypercapnia.

The combination of hypoxemia and hypercapnia in COPD can lead to a mixed acid-base disorder. The primary disturbance is usually a respiratory acidosis due to the hypercapnia, but the body's compensatory mechanisms can lead to a mixed acid-base disorder.

Given the patient's symptoms and pulmonary function testing results, the arterial blood gases (ABG) are most likely to reveal a primary respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

However, in this case, the patient has a mixed condition of COPD and a recent viral infection, which might have caused a respiratory alkalosis. Therefore, the ABG is most likely to reveal an anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis.

The answer is {E}."

Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient’s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?
Options
A) Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
B) Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder
C) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
D) Goodpasture syndrome
E) Menetrier disease","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided:

1. The patient is a 61-year-old man with a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain and constipation.
2. He has a history of poorly controlled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 40 pack-year smoking history.
3. He drinks 3-4 beers per day and consumes a diet primarily consisting of fast food.
4. He has a history of multiple small, pedunculated polyps, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses on colonoscopy results from 1 year ago.

Considering these points, the patient's presentation and history suggest a possible diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum. FAP is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, the presence of multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings in the patient's colonoscopy results is more suggestive of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and an increased risk of certain cancers.

Now, let's consider the provided options and their associations with the patient's condition:

A) Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause liver disease and lung disease, but it is not strongly associated with the patient's condition.

B) Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder is a genetic disorder that causes cysts to form in the kidneys, leading to kidney failure, but it is not strongly associated with the patient's condition.

C) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of genetic disorders that affect the body's connective tissue, leading to skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility. While it is a genetic disorder, it is not strongly associated with the patient's condition.

D) Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs, but it is not strongly associated with the patient's condition.

E) Menetrier disease is a rare disorder characterized by large, fold-like mucosal outpouchings in the stomach, which can lead to protein loss and malnutrition. It is strongly associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer and is also characterized by an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

Considering the patient's history of multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, which is suggestive of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and the association between Menetrier disease and an increased risk of colorectal cancer, the most likely answer is:

Options
A) Immediate cardiac transplant
B) Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated
C) Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets
D) Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space
E) Surgical adhesive glue","To determine the best definitive surgical approach for the patient with a penetrating wound to the chest, we need to consider the severity of the injury and the patient's vital signs. The patient is unconscious, has a low blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, and a high pulse rate of 115/min, indicating hemodynamic instability. The transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full-thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall, which is a life-threatening condition.

The best definitive surgical approach in this case is to use interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures with supporting pledgets to repair the defect. This approach provides a secure closure of the wound and reduces the risk of further complications.

The use of interrupted sutures with pledgets is a common technique in cardiac surgery to repair defects in the myocardium. The pledgets provide additional support to the sutures, reducing the risk of suture failure and promoting healing.

The other options are not the best approach in this scenario:

* Immediate cardiac transplant (A) is not necessary, as the patient's primary issue is a penetrating wound to the right ventricular free wall, not a failed heart.
* Watchful waiting (B) is not an option, as the patient is hemodynamically unstable and requires immediate surgical intervention.
* Needle thoracostomy (D) is a procedure used to relieve tension pneumothorax, which is not the primary issue in this case.
* Surgical adhesive glue (E) is not a suitable option for repairing a full-thickness penetrating wound to the right ventricular free wall.

Therefore, the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient is to use interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures with supporting pledgets to repair the defect.

1108,"A 76-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She has a history of hypertension well controlled with diet and exercise. She has no history of smoking or illicit drug use. She walks one mile daily. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. When compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?
Options
A) Increased lung compliance
B) Increased vital capacity
C) Decreased residual volume
D) Increased chest wall compliance
E) Decreased A-a gradient","As we age, our respiratory function undergoes several changes that can affect lung mechanics and gas exchange. One of the key changes is a decrease in lung compliance, which refers to the ease with which the lungs expand and fill with air. This decrease in lung compliance is due to a loss of elasticity in the lung tissue and the airways, making it more difficult for the lungs to expand and fill with air.

In addition to decreased lung compliance, other changes that occur with aging include a decrease in the strength and efficiency of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles, leading to a decrease in vital capacity (the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a maximum inhalation). The residual volume (the amount of air left in the lungs after a maximum exhalation) may also increase due to a decrease in the efficiency of the lung's ability to empty air.

The A-a gradient (alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient) is a measure of the difference between the oxygen levels in the alveoli and the arterial blood. This gradient increases with age due to a decrease in the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs.

Given these changes, the correct answer is not A) Increased lung compliance, B) Increased vital capacity, D) Increased chest wall compliance, or E) Decreased A-a gradient. The correct answer is C) Decreased residual volume is incorrect because residual volume typically increases with age. However, the question asks for the change in respiratory function that is most likely present in this patient when compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman. Considering the options, the most likely change is a decrease in lung compliance, but this option is not available. Therefore, the best answer is C) Decreased residual volume is incorrect, but it is the closest option.

She has a history of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. The child is at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?
Options
A) Renal dysplasia
B) Meningocele
C) Teeth discoloration
D) Sensorineural hearing loss
E) Vaginal clear cell carcinoma","The 32-year-old woman is experiencing symptoms consistent with early pregnancy, including fatigue, breast tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and nausea, which are typical symptoms of early pregnancy. The presence of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine is relevant to the pregnancy, as carbamazepine is a known teratogen that can cause fetal abnormalities. The child is at greatest risk of developing a specific complication due to the maternal use of carbamazepine.

Carbamazepine is a known teratogen that can cause a range of fetal abnormalities, including neural tube defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and cardiac defects. However, one of the most significant risks associated with carbamazepine exposure in utero is an increased risk of neural tube defects, including meningocele.

Meningocele is a type of neural tube defect in which the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the spinal cord, protrude through a defect in the spinal column. This condition can result in a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, numbness, and difficulty with bladder and bowel control.

Given the information provided, the child is at greatest risk of developing meningocele due to the maternal use of carbamazepine during pregnancy.

Options
A) Lorazepam
B) Naltrexone
C) Methadone
D) Morphine
E) Naloxone
""","Analyzing the situation, the 24-year-old man presents with symptoms of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea for three days, along with dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection. These symptoms are indicative of opioid withdrawal. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (110/min) and hypertension (150/86 mm Hg), which are consistent with opioid withdrawal. The absence of any other abnormalities in the physical examination and laboratory studies further supports the diagnosis of opioid withdrawal.

In managing opioid withdrawal, the goal is to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. Among the provided options, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for opioid withdrawal is Naltrexone. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms by blocking the effects of opioids on the brain. It is often used in the management of opioid dependence and withdrawal.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is {B}.

However, the patient's symptoms are likely due to withdrawal from opioids, and the most appropriate initial step would be to administer an opioid agonist to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications. The correct answer is actually {C} Methadone, which is a long-acting opioid agonist that can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications.

The final answer is {C}."
565,"A 35-year-old man visits your office for his annual health checkup. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram.

His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?
Options
A) Lowering citalopram dose
B) Addition of bupropion
C) Switch to fluoxetine
D) Addition of sildenafil
E) Switch to selegiline","Considering the 35-year-old man's history of generalized anxiety disorder being treated with citalopram, he has experienced an improvement in symptoms. However, he has developed a new issue with weak tumescence and low libido, which is a common side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram. The appropriate step in the management of this patient would be to address the sexual dysfunction caused by the medication.

Lowering the citalopram dose (option A) may not be sufficient to alleviate the sexual side effects, as the dose may need to be adjusted to balance the efficacy of the medication with the side effects.

Adding bupropion (option B) may not be the best option, as bupropion can also cause sexual side effects and may interact with citalopram.

Switching to fluoxetine (option C) may not be necessary, as fluoxetine also has a similar side effect profile to citalopram.

Adding sildenafil (option D) may help alleviate the erectile dysfunction, but it does not address the underlying cause of the low libido, which is likely related to the SSRI.

Switching to selegiline (option E) may be a better option, as selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that can help alleviate sexual side effects associated with SSRIs. MAOIs can also be used as an adjunct to SSRIs to enhance their efficacy.

Therefore, the most appropriate step in the management of this patient is to switch to selegiline.

His physician is concerned about an abnormal fasting blood glucose and dyslipidemia. On further work-up with oral glucose tolerance test, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. Which of the following associations is consistent with this patient’s most likely form of diabetes?
Options
A) Strong HLA class II gene makeup
B) Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition
C) Pancreatic islet cell leukocyte infiltration
D) Auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens
E) Unrelated to his abdominal obesity","The patient is a 63-year-old man who presents with a slow and steady weight gain of 6 pounds over the past 6 months, despite attempts to control his diet and increase his level of exercise. He is obese (BMI 32), and his waist circumference is 43 inches. His physician is concerned about an abnormal fasting blood glucose and dyslipidemia. On further work-up with an oral glucose tolerance test, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes.

Given the patient's age, obesity, and abdominal obesity, the most likely form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which is often seen in individuals with central obesity. The presence of auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens is more commonly seen in type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune form of diabetes that typically presents in younger individuals.

Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes, particularly in individuals with a long-standing history of the disease. This deposition can lead to a progressive decline in pancreatic beta-cell function, contributing to the development of hyperglycemia.

The association between pancreatic islet cell leukocyte infiltration and type 1 diabetes is more relevant, as this is a hallmark of the autoimmune process that leads to the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells in type 1 diabetes.

A strong HLA class II gene makeup is associated with an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes, but it is not a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes is indeed related to abdominal obesity, as the accumulation of visceral fat can lead to insulin resistance and contribute to the development of the disease.

Therefore, the association that is consistent with this patient's most likely form of diabetes is B) Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition.

Patients are often treated with hydroxyurea, which has which of the following direct effects on their hemoglobin physiology?
Options
A) Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
B) Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)
D) Decreases levels of HgbS
E) Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)","Hydroxyurea is a medication used to treat sickle cell anemia by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF). Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin and is less prone to sickling. By increasing the levels of HgbF, hydroxyurea helps to reduce the frequency and severity of sickle cell crises. This is achieved by altering the production of HgbF through a mechanism that is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the inhibition of the enzyme that normally regulates the production of adult hemoglobin.

Therefore, the direct effect of hydroxyurea on hemoglobin physiology is to increase the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).

He has no history of similar episodes, takes no medications, and has no family history of abnormal bleeding. His vital signs are within normal limits, and the bleeding is localized to the left nostril. The most likely cause of this bleeding is a nasal septal hematoma or a vascular malformation. However, given the lack of other symptoms and the fact that the bleeding is self-limited, the most appropriate initial therapy would be to apply pressure to the bleeding site to control the bleeding.

The correct answer is {E} Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated. This is the most appropriate initial therapy as it is a simple and non-invasive method to control the bleeding. It is also a safe and effective way to manage epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children.

The other options are not the best initial therapy:

* Anterior packing and topical antibiotics (A) may be necessary if the bleeding is severe or does not respond to initial therapy, but it is not the first line of treatment.
* Oxymetazoline nasal spray (B) is a vasoconstrictor that can be used to reduce nasal congestion, but it is not effective in controlling bleeding.

He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months. Synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3. What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient’s most likely condition?
Options
A) Metabolic inhibitor
B) Cell wall inhibitor
C) Neutrophil migration inhibitor
D) Prostaglandin inhibitor
E) Uric acid synthesis inhibitor","To determine the mechanism of action of the drug indicated for the treatment of this patient's condition, we need to identify the most likely condition based on the provided information. The patient is a 23-year-old man presenting with swelling of the left knee, which he noticed a day ago while preparing for the college basketball game. He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months. The synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3, which is indicative of a significant inflammatory response.

Given the patient's history of multiple sexual partners and the sudden onset of knee swelling, it is likely that the patient has a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that has caused a reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that occurs as a reaction to an STI, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.

The treatment for reactive arthritis typically involves antibiotics to treat the underlying STI, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage the symptoms of arthritis.

The mechanism of action of NSAIDs is to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation. Prostaglandins are produced by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is present in the cells lining the joints. When prostaglandins are produced, they cause the blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood flow and swelling in the affected joint. NSAIDs work by inhibiting the COX enzyme, thereby reducing the production of prostaglandins and the resulting inflammation.

Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug indicated for the treatment of this patient's condition is to inhibit the production of prostaglandins.

859,"A 27-year-old female presents to her physician with a palpable thyroid nodule. Iodine uptake testing shows that the nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared with the rest of the thyroid gland. A fine-needle aspiration is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a neoplasm of the thyroid. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?
Options
A) Papillary carcinoma
B) Medullary carcinoma
C) Follicular carcinoma
D) Anaplastic carcinoma
E) Hurthle cell carcinoma","To approach this question, let's analyze the information provided. The patient is a 27-year-old female with a palpable thyroid nodule. Iodine-needle aspiration has confirmed the presence of a neoplasm. The key piece of information is that iodine uptake testing shows decreased iodine uptake in the nodule compared to the rest of the thyroid gland.

The thyroid gland has a unique function of concentrating iodine from the bloodstream, which is then used to produce thyroid hormones. Most thyroid neoplasms, including papillary and follicular carcinomas, retain the ability to concentrate iodine. However, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is an exception. Medullary carcinoma arises from the parafollicular cells (also known as C cells), which are responsible for producing calcitonin and do not play a role in iodine uptake or thyroid hormone production. As a result, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid typically shows decreased iodine uptake.

Given this information, the most likely diagnosis is medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. This diagnosis is also supported by the fact that fine-needle aspiration has confirmed the presence of a neoplasm, which is consistent with medullary carcinoma.

The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The end-tidal CO2 is 85 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?
Options
A) Propranolol
B) Dantrolene
C) Bromocriptine
D) Cyproheptadine
E) Surgical embolectomy","The patient's presentation of muscle rigidity, profuse diaphoresis, high fever, and increased heart rate, along with the end-tidal CO2 being elevated, suggests malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening medical emergency. MH is often triggered by certain anesthetic agents, such as succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics, which were likely used during the patient's laparoscopic appendectomy.

Malignant hyperthermia is characterized by an extreme elevation in body temperature, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death if not promptly treated. The primary treatment for malignant hyperthermia is dantrolene, a muscle relaxant that inhibits calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing muscle rigidity and heat production.

The other options are not appropriate for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia:

* Propranolol (A) is a beta-blocker that may be used to manage some of the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia, such as tachycardia, but it is not the primary treatment.
* Bromocriptine (C) is a dopamine agonist that may be used to manage some of the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia, such as muscle rigidity, but it is not the primary treatment.
* Cyproheptadine (D) is an antihistamine that may be used to manage some of the symptoms of malignant hyperthermia, such as muscle rigidity, but it is not the primary treatment.
* Surgical embolectomy (E) is a procedure used to remove an embolus from a blood vessel and is not relevant to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

C) Botryoid sarcoma
D) Verrucous carcinoma
E) Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)","Given the patient's history of postcoital vaginal bleeding and intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge, along with a family history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy, the most likely malignant tumor in this patient is clear cell adenocarcinoma. DES exposure is a known risk factor for clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina, which is a rare but aggressive type of cancer. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Clear cell adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that originates from the glandular cells of the vagina and is often associated with DES exposure during pregnancy. It typically presents with vaginal bleeding and discharge, and can be difficult to diagnose due to its rarity and nonspecific symptoms. The patient's history of exposure to DES and the presence of malignant cells in the tissue samples confirm the diagnosis of clear cell adenocarcinoma.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation and history. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is not typically associated with vaginal bleeding or DES exposure. Botryoid sarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the soft tissues and is not typically associated with vaginal bleeding or DES exposure. Verrucous carcinoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin and mucous membranes, but is not typically associated with vaginal bleeding or DES exposure. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that affects the skin and mucous membranes, but is not typically associated with vaginal bleeding or DES exposure.

C) Atopic dermatitis
D) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
E) Chediak-Higashi syndrome","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 3-year-old boy, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Recurrent skin lesions**: The boy has had multiple episodes of skin lesions since the age of 2 months. These lesions are described as raised, erythematous, and some of them secrete pus.
2. **Respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers**: The boy has had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. This suggests an underlying immunodeficiency.
3. **Ill appearance, fever, and tachycardia**: The boy appears ill, has a fever of 38°C (100.4°F), and a tachycardia of 100/min. These findings indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation.
4. **Immunizations are up-to-date**: The boy's immunizations are up-to-date, which makes primary immunodeficiency disorders more likely.
5. **Family history**: The boy's older brother has asthma, which may suggest a possible genetic predisposition to immune system disorders.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the provided options:

- **A) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)**: CGD is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent infections, particularly with catalase-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus species. The boy's symptoms, including recurrent skin lesions and respiratory tract infections, are consistent with CGD. Additionally, CGD often presents with granulomatous inflammation, which can lead to enlarged lymph nodes.

- **B) Ataxia-telangiectasia**: Ataxia-telangiectasia is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by ataxia, telangiectasias, and recurrent infections. However, the boy's presentation does not match this condition, as he does not have ataxia or telangiectasias.

- **C) Atopic dermatitis**: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy skin. While the boy has skin lesions, they are described as raised and erythematous, which is not typical of atopic dermatitis.

- **D) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome**: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. However, the boy's presentation does not match this condition, as he does not have eczema or thrombocytopenia.

- **E) Chediak-Higashi syndrome**: Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent infections, and a bleeding tendency. However, the boy's presentation does not match this condition, as he does not have oculocutaneous albinism.

Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis for the 3-year-old boy is **A) Chronic granulomatous disease**.

She is taking multiple medications, including memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium.

The patient's daughter reports difficulty locating objects, which could be indicative of cognitive decline or possibly related to her Alzheimer's dementia. However, this is not directly relevant to the current visit.

The patient's physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place, and year but not to month or day of the week. This indicates some degree of cognitive impairment. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop, which may indicate heart failure. There are mild crackles at the lung bases, which could be related to her congestive heart failure or centrilobular emphysema.

The previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter, and the urinalysis findings show leukocyte esterase positive, WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF, nitrites positive, RBCs 2 cell/HPF, epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF, and urine pH 5.7. These findings suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Given the patient's complex medical history and the presence of a UTI, the most appropriate next step is to select an antibiotic that is effective against Enterobacter and suitable for her current medical conditions.

Option A, TMP-SMX, is not the best choice because it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for UTIs, and the patient's medical history does not indicate a specific reason to use this combination.

Option B, Nitrofurantoin, is not suitable for this patient because it is not effective against Enterobacter and may not be tolerated by patients with renal impairment, which is a concern given her age and medical history.

Option C, Levofloxacin, is a reasonable choice because it is effective against Enterobacter and can be used in patients with complex medical histories, including those with heart failure and diabetes.

Option D, Cephalexin, is not the best choice because it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for UTIs, and the patient's medical history does not indicate a specific reason to use this antibiotic.

Option E, No treatment is necessary, is incorrect because the patient has a confirmed UTI and requires antibiotic treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start Levofloxacin (Option C).

The t(9;22) translocation is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as it is a marker for the Philadelphia chromosome, which is often associated with more aggressive disease and a lower chance of long-term survival.

The Philadelphia chromosome is a result of a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, leading to the creation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene. This gene produces a tyrosine kinase that is constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy. Patients with the Philadelphia chromosome have a lower chance of achieving complete remission and a higher risk of relapse, making cytogenetics a critical factor in determining prognosis.

Therefore, the factor that most strongly indicates a poor prognosis in this patient is the cytogenetics of the leukemia, specifically the presence of the t(9;22) translocation.

169,"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department. He was found unconscious on the street. The staff recognizes him as a local homeless man with a long history of alcoholism. At the hospital, his pulse is 95/min, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the respirations are 20/min, and the oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the unconscious man is covered in bloody vomit with small clots and food particles. He smells of alcohol. A digital exam reveals black tarry stool in the rectal vault. The patient is given oxygen, IV fluids, and an NG-tube is placed and set to intermittent suction. Labs are sent and the patient is prepared for a procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?
Options
A) Undergo colonoscopy
B) Undergo upper GI endoscopy
C) Selective mesenteric angiography
D) Proton pump inhibitors with anti-H.pylori regimen
E) Surgery for peptic ulcer disease","Analyzing the situation, the 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious on the street, with a long history of alcoholism. He is covered in bloody vomit with small clots and food particles, and has black tarry stool in the rectal vault. These symptoms suggest a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. The presence of black tarry stool is indicative of melena, which is a sign of a lower gastrointestinal bleed. However, the bloody vomit and food particles suggest that the bleed is likely from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Given the patient's history of alcoholism, a common cause of upper GI bleeding is peptic ulcer disease. The most appropriate next step in his management would be to undergo upper GI endoscopy to visualize the upper GI tract and identify the source of the bleeding.

The correct answer is {B}."
665,"A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient’s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
B) Hemophilia B
C) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
D) Von Willebrand disease
E) Hemophilia A","The patient is a 9-year-old boy presenting with bruising on his torso and limbs, along with petechiae. The complete blood count is normal, but the coagulation profile reveals an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60 seconds, with a normal prothrombin time (PT) of 12 seconds. This suggests a problem with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which is measured by the aPTT.

Hemophilia A is caused by a deficiency in factor VIII, which is a key component of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. This deficiency leads to an elevated aPTT, as seen in this patient.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A) is a type of cancer that can cause bleeding due to thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation, but it would likely affect the PT as well.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (C) is a condition characterized by low platelet count, which would not explain the elevated aPTT.

Von Willebrand disease (D) is a condition that affects the von Willebrand factor, which is involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. However, it would typically affect the PT as well.

Hemophilia B (B) is caused by a deficiency in factor IX, which is also involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. However, it would typically affect the aPTT as well.

Given the elevated aPTT and normal PT, the most likely diagnosis is Hemophilia A.

237,"A 7-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician by his mother. She reports that the child develops severe sunburns every time the infant is exposed to sunlight. She has applied copious amounts of sunscreen to the infant but this has not helped the problem. On examination, there are multiple areas of reddened skin primarily in sun exposed areas. The child’s corneas appear irritated and erythematous. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?
Options
A) Nucleotide excision repair
B) Non-homologous end joining
C) Homologous recombination
D) Mismatch repair
E) Base excision repair","The 7-month-old male infant is presenting with severe sunburns after exposure to sunlight, despite the application of sunscreen. This suggests that the infant's skin is unable to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. The symptoms of sunburned skin and irritated corneas are indicative of a condition that affects the body's ability to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation.

The process that is likely impaired in this patient is nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER is a DNA repair mechanism that is responsible for repairing DNA damage caused by UV radiation, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPs). These types of DNA damage are common in individuals who are exposed to UV radiation, and they can cause mutations and skin damage if not repaired properly.

In individuals with impaired NER, these types of DNA damage can accumulate and cause skin damage, including sunburns, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer. The symptoms described in the patient, such as severe sunburns and irritated corneas, are consistent with a diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes involved in the NER pathway.

Therefore, the process that is likely impaired in this patient is nucleotide excision repair.

997,"The only immunoglobulin found as a dimer has what primary function?
Options
A) Protect against invasive helminth infection
B) Protect against viral infections
C) Provide an initial humoral immune response to newly presenting bacterial antigens
D) Inhibiting bacterial adherance and colonization of mucous membranes
E) Provides the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream","To answer this question, let's consider the functions of different classes of immunoglobulins (Ig). IgA is the primary immunoglobulin found as a dimer and plays a crucial role in mucosal immunity. Its primary function is to protect against infections at mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, by inhibiting bacterial adherence and colonization. This is achieved through the presence of secretory component, which allows IgA to be secreted across epithelial cells and onto mucosal surfaces.

Therefore, the correct answer is {D}.

IgA is also involved in the initial humoral immune response to newly presenting antigens, but this is not its primary function as a dimer. IgM is the first antibody produced in response to an infection and is responsible for providing the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream. IgE is involved in protecting against invasive helminth infections, and IgG is involved in providing long-term immunity against a wide range of pathogens.

The other options are not correct because:

* A) IgE is involved in protecting against invasive helminth infections, not IgA.
* B) IgM is involved in providing the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream, not IgA.
* C) While IgA is involved in the initial humoral immune response, this is not its primary function as a dimer.
* E) IgM is involved in providing the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream, not IgA."
1203,"A 40-year old man presents to the clinic with vague upper abdominal pain that has been worsening for the last several days. He says that he often gets similar pain but less severe and that it worsens with meals. The pain sometimes radiates to his back. He recently lost 15 kg (33.6 lb) of weight secondary to his lack of appetite since his last visit 2 months ago. He admits to drinking alcohol almost every night since the age of 17. His temperature is 37.0° C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals moderate epigastric tenderness. An abdominal CT scan reveals calcifications as shown by the white arrows. Which of the following organs is affected in this patient?
Options
A) Pancreas
B) Jejunum
C) Duodenum
D) Large intestine
E) Gall bladder","The patient is a 40-year-old man presenting with vague upper abdominal pain that worsens with meals and radiates to his back. He has a significant history of alcohol consumption, having drunk almost every night since the age of 17. He has also experienced significant weight loss due to a lack of appetite. The physical examination reveals moderate epigastric tenderness, and the abdominal CT scan shows calcifications.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas that leads to scarring and calcification of the pancreatic tissue. The calcifications seen on the CT scan are consistent with this diagnosis.

The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach that produces digestive enzymes and hormones such as insulin. Chronic pancreatitis can cause symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, weight loss, and malnutrition due to the impaired production of digestive enzymes.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation. The jejunum is a part of the small intestine, and while it can be affected by chronic diseases such as Crohn's disease, it is not typically associated with calcifications. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine and can be affected by conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, but it is not typically associated with calcifications. The large intestine is not typically associated with calcifications, and the gallbladder is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the organ affected in this patient is the pancreas.

687,"A 3-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of somnolence, poor feeding, and one episode of vomiting. He is exclusively breastfed. His serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL and his serum ammonia concentration is 850 μmol/L (N<90). Urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio. Urinary ketones are absent. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?
Options
A) Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline
B) Orotic acid to uridine monophosphate
C) Pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A
D) Glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A to N-acetylglutamate
E) Arginine to urea and ornithine","The patient is a 3-day-old boy who presents with somnolence, poor feeding, and vomiting, accompanied by an elevated serum ammonia concentration of 850 μmol/L. The urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio, which is indicative of a disorder of pyrimidine metabolism. The absence of urinary ketones further supports this diagnosis.

The elevated serum ammonia concentration is a hallmark of disorders of the urea cycle, which is responsible for the conversion of ammonia to urea. The increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio in the urinalysis suggests a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for the conversion of orotic acid to uridine monophosphate.

390,"A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?
Options
A) Anterior cord lesion
B) Posterior cord lesion
C) Right cord hemisection
D) Left cord hemisection
E) Complete cord transection","To determine the type of lesion that would result in the syndrome described, let's analyze the patient's symptoms:

1. Weakness in the left lower extremity (2/5 strength)
2. Deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity
3. Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity

These symptoms suggest a lesion affecting the spinal cord, specifically the posterior columns and the lateral spinothalamic tract.

The posterior columns are responsible for transmitting vibration sense and light touch, which are affected in the left lower extremity.

The lateral spinothalamic tract is responsible for transmitting pain and temperature sensation, which is affected in the right lower extremity.

Given these symptoms, the lesion would need to affect the left posterior column and the right lateral spinothalamic tract.

This pattern of damage is consistent with a left cord hemisection, which would result in the syndrome described.

The left cord hemisection would damage the left posterior column, causing weakness and sensory deficits in the left lower extremity, and the right lateral spinothalamic tract, causing loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?
Options
A) Dry eyes
B) High-risk sexual behaviour
C) Oral ulcers
D) Sensory loss
E) Late preterm birth","To determine the most relevant additional history to obtain from the 29-year-old woman with blurred vision and pain around her right eye, let's analyze her symptoms and findings. The symptoms include blurred vision, pain around the right eye during eye movement, and decreased perception in the right eye, as indicated by the color vision test. The physical examination findings include bilateral pupillary constriction upon illumination of the left eye and mild bilateral pupillary dilation upon illumination of the right eye, suggesting a possible afferent pupillary defect. The fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye, which is indicative of optic neuritis.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is optic neuritis, which is an inflammatory condition affecting the optic nerve. The cause of optic neuritis can be infectious, autoimmune, or idiopathic. Among the options provided, the most relevant additional history to obtain is regarding high-risk sexual behavior, as it is associated with infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), which can cause optic neuritis.

Herpes simplex virus is a common cause of optic neuritis, particularly in young adults. The virus can cause inflammation of the optic nerve, leading to symptoms such as blurred vision, pain around the eye, and decreased perception of colors. The virus can be transmitted through high-risk sexual behavior, among other routes.

Therefore, the most relevant additional history to obtain regarding the 29-year-old woman with blurred vision and pain around her right eye is her high-risk sexual behavior.

E) Ectopic secretion of gastrin","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 50-year-old man has a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, accompanied by a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. The physical examination reveals bilateral pitting pedal edema. The endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus, and the biopsy shows parietal cell atrophy. These findings are indicative of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive gastrin secretion leading to hyperacidity and peptic ulcers.

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is ectopic secretion of gastrin, which is option {E}. This condition is often caused by a gastrin-producing tumor, such as a gastrinoma, which can be located in the pancreas or duodenum.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation:

A) Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor is associated with carcinoid syndrome, which typically presents with flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, and heart valve abnormalities, but not with the symptoms described.

B) Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells is not associated with the symptoms of excessive acid production and peptic ulcers.

C) Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue is associated with MALT lymphoma, which typically presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, but not with the symptoms described.

D) Excessive somatostatin secretion is associated with somatostatinoma, which typically presents with diabetes mellitus, gallstones, and steatorrhea, but not with the symptoms described.

556,"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options
A) Agree to his wish for no further treatment
B) Begin paroxetine therapy
C) Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents
D) Reassure the patient that he will feel better
E) Start outpatient psychotherapy","The 14-year-old boy is presenting with symptoms of depression, including loss of appetite, sleeplessness, irritability, social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation. He has a constricted affect, intact cognition, and a clear desire to end his life. This presentation is consistent with a major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation, which is a serious mental health condition that requires immediate attention.

The most appropriate next step in management is to ensure the patient's safety and well-being. Given the patient's suicidal ideation, it is not appropriate to agree to his wish for no further treatment (A), as this could lead to harm. Starting paroxetine therapy (B) may be helpful in the long term, but it is not the most immediate concern. Reassuring the patient that he will feel better (D) is not sufficient, as it does not address the underlying issue of suicidal ideation. Starting outpatient psychotherapy (E) may be helpful in the long term, but it is not the most immediate concern.

The most appropriate next step in management is involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents (C). This is because the patient is at risk of harming himself, and hospitalization can provide a safe and supportive environment for him to receive treatment. Involuntary hospitalization may be necessary to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.

E) Skin biopsy","The patient is a 48-year-old Caucasian female presenting with progressive weakness, shortness of breath, and difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. She has a history of progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. The neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally, and diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. This presentation is highly suggestive of dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disease characterized by skin rash and muscle weakness.

Among the options provided, the serum ANA (antinuclear antibody) titer is not the most relevant test for confirming the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis is associated with the presence of anti-Jo-1 antibodies, which are not directly tested by ANA titer.

The muscle biopsy is the most direct and specific test for diagnosing dermatomyositis. It involves examining muscle tissue under a microscope for signs of inflammation and damage.

The CT scan is not the most appropriate test for diagnosing dermatomyositis, as it is primarily used for imaging lung and other internal organs.

Pulmonary function tests may be helpful in assessing the extent of lung involvement in patients with dermatomyositis, but they are not the most direct test for confirming the diagnosis.

A skin biopsy may be helpful in diagnosing dermatomyositis, especially if the rash is not typical, but it is not as specific as a muscle biopsy.

Therefore, the most appropriate test for confirming the diagnosis of dermatomyositis is a muscle biopsy.

While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?
Options
A) Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor
B) Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor
C) Thromboxane synthase inhibitor
D) Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor
E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor","The 63-year-old man has been diagnosed with peripheral artery disease (PAD) with intermittent claudication, a condition characterized by leg pain during walking due to reduced blood flow to the muscles. Cilostazol is a medication prescribed to improve symptoms of PAD. To understand its mechanism of action, let's examine the options:

A) Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor: This class of drugs inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. However, this is not the primary mechanism of action of cilostazol.

B) Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor: These drugs inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. While this is an important mechanism for preventing blood clots, it is not the primary action of cilostazol.

C) Thromboxane synthase inhibitor: Thromboxane synthase is an enzyme involved in the production of thromboxane A2, a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator. Inhibiting this enzyme would reduce platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, but this is not the primary mechanism of cilostazol.

D) Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitor: ADP receptor inhibitors block the action of ADP on platelet receptors, preventing platelet aggregation. While this is an important mechanism for preventing blood clots, it is not the primary action of cilostazol.

E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor: Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, which means it inhibits the enzyme phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). This enzyme breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), two important second messengers involved in vasodilation and platelet inhibition. By inhibiting PDE3, cilostazol increases the levels of cAMP and cGMP, leading to vasodilation and reduced platelet aggregation.

Therefore, the mechanism of action of cilostazol is as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor.

350,"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?
Options
A) Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle
B) This patient has insulin resistance
C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient
D) The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
E) The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction","The patient is a 16-year-old female who presents with an absence of menstruation (amenorrhea) and a history of intentionally restricting her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercising intensively, and losing 18.0 kg (39.7 lb) over the past year and a half. She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active.

The patient's physical examination reveals good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. Her vital signs include a low blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, a low heart rate of 55/min, a normal respiratory rate of 12/min, and a low temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in).

A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits, which is consistent with osteoporosis, a condition often associated with amenorrhea in young women.

The patient's condition is likely caused by hypothalamic amenorrhea, a condition characterized by amenorrhea in the presence of normal levels of sex hormones. This condition is often seen in young women who engage in excessive exercise or have a very low body mass index (BMI).

The correct answer is:

C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient

This is because decreased adiposity (low body fat) contributes to decreased estrogen production, leading to hypoestrogenemia. Estrogen is produced in adipose tissue, and a low body fat percentage can lead to decreased estrogen production, which can contribute to amenorrhea.

The other options are incorrect because:

A) Hypertrophied muscles are not the source of additional androgens that interfere with the patient's menstrual cycle.

B) This patient has hypothalamic amenorrhea, not insulin resistance.

D) The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to decreased estrogen production, not increased liver metabolism.

E) The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction is not correct because the patient's condition is more likely caused by hypothalamic amenorrhea, not hyperthyroidism.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

873,"An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department trauma bay with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The patient undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, during which, it is discovered that his splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. The surgeon ligates the splenic artery at its origin. Which of the following arteries will now be hypoperfused as a result?
Options
A) Left gastric artery
B) Gastroduodenal artery
C) Right gastroepiploic artery
D) Left gastroepiploic artery
E) Common hepatic artery","To determine which artery will be hypoperfused as a result of the ligation of the splenic artery at its origin, we need to understand the vascular supply of the abdominal organs. The celiac trunk is a major artery that arises from the abdominal aorta and gives off three main branches: the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery, and the splenic artery.

The left gastric artery supplies the stomach, the common hepatic artery supplies the liver and the pylorus, and the splenic artery supplies the spleen and the pancreas.

When the splenic artery is ligated at its origin, it will no longer supply blood to the spleen and the pancreas. However, the splenic artery also gives off a branch called the short gastric arteries that supply the fundus of the stomach. The short gastric arteries are not mentioned in the options, but they are an important branch of the splenic artery.

Among the options provided, the left gastroepiploic artery (D) is a branch of the splenic artery. It runs along the greater curvature of the stomach and supplies the stomach. Since the splenic artery is ligated at its origin, the left gastroepiploic artery will no longer receive blood supply from the splenic artery and will be hypoperfused.

The other options are not directly related to the splenic artery. The left gastric artery (A) is a branch of the celiac trunk, but it is not a branch of the splenic artery. The gastroduodenal artery (B) is a branch of the common hepatic artery, and the right gastroepiploic artery (C) is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery. The common hepatic artery (E) is also a branch of the celiac trunk, but it is not a branch of the splenic artery.

Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."
300,"A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?
Options
A) 64
B) 16
C) 8
D) 4
E) 32","To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Poiseuille's law, which describes the relationship between the flow of fluid through a tube and the resistance to that flow. According to Poiseuille's law, the resistance to flow (R) is proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r) of the tube, and inversely proportional to the length (L) of the tube.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

R ∝ 1/r^4

Since the diameter of the left circumflex artery has been reduced by 50%, the radius (r) has also been reduced by 50%. Therefore, the new radius (r') is 0.5r.

We can now calculate the new resistance (R') using the formula:

R' ∝ 1/(r')^4
= 1/(0.5r)^4
= 1/(0.0625r^4)
= 16/r^4

Comparing this to the original resistance (R), we can see that the new resistance (R') is 16 times greater than the original resistance (R).

Therefore, the resistance to blood flow in the vessel with the 50% occlusion has increased by a factor of 16 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.

The final answer is {B}."
449,"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.

Options
A) Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound
B) Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months
C) Elective endovascular repair
D) Elective open surgical repair
E) Emergency open surgical repair","To determine the best course of treatment for this patient, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and high cholesterol, presenting with abdominal pain and bruising on his feet. The abdominal pain is described as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. The patient also has a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and a significant smoking history. The physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass in the lower umbilical region, and the contrast CT confirms the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of 4.1 cm.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, combined with the CT results, indicate that the AAA is large enough to warrant surgical intervention. However, the patient's overall condition and the size of the aneurysm need to be considered when determining the best course of treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, and the administration of morphine sulfate and metoprolol has helped to manage his pain and blood pressure. However, the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass and the risk of aneurysm rupture necessitate further action.

Given the patient's stable condition and the size of the aneurysm, elective endovascular repair is the most appropriate course of treatment. This approach is less invasive than open surgical repair and can be performed under local anesthesia, reducing the risk of complications and promoting a faster recovery.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is elective endovascular repair.

Her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?
Options
A) Dementia
B) Alcohol withdrawal
C) Opioid intoxication
D) Delirium
E) Urinary tract infection","The 79-year-old woman is experiencing agitation, confusion, and disorientation to person, place, and time, which are indicative of delirium. Delirium is a state of altered consciousness characterized by a disturbance in attention and awareness that develops over a short period. It can be caused by various factors, including medications, infections, metabolic disorders, and withdrawal from substances.

The patient's symptoms of being unarousable during the day and awake and impulsive during the night suggest a fluctuating course, which is typical of delirium. The absence of focal neurological deficits and the normal urine dipstick result make a urinary tract infection less likely.

The patient's use of oxycodone for pain and her history of drinking one to two glasses of wine weekly are potential contributing factors to her current condition. However, the primary cause of her delirium is likely related to the surgical repair of her hip fracture and the subsequent postoperative course.

The most likely cause of her current condition is delirium, which is a common complication in elderly patients after surgery.

She denies any recent trauma or other inciting events. Her family history is significant for a grandmother who suffered from fibromyalgia. The physical examination reveals erythematous and tender metacarpophalangeal joints.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and swelling. The presence of erythematous and tender joints, along with morning stiffness that improves as the day progresses, are classic symptoms of RA.

To diagnose RA, several tests can be performed. Among the options provided, the most helpful test for diagnosing RA would be the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody test. Anti-CCP antibodies are a type of autoantibody that is highly specific for RA and can be detected in the blood. The presence of anti-CCP antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis of RA and differentiate it from other forms of arthritis.

The other options are not as helpful for diagnosing RA. Synovial fluid analysis (A) may show inflammatory changes, but it is not specific for RA. Rheumatoid factor (C) is an autoantibody that can be present in RA, but it is not specific for the disease and can also be present in other conditions. CT scan (D) may show joint damage, but it is not a diagnostic test for RA. X-ray of cervical spine (E) may show joint damage, but it is not a diagnostic test for RA.

Therefore, the most helpful test for diagnosing this patient's condition is the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody test.

E) Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis","The patient is a 25-year-old female with Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with a several-day history of edema. Lab studies show hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin), which is a common complication in patients with malignancies, particularly those with lymphoma. The presence of 4+ proteinuria and fatty casts in the urinalysis indicates significant protein loss through the urine, which is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome.

Among the options provided, minimal change disease (C) is the most likely diagnosis. This condition is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, which are consistent with the patient's presentation. Minimal change disease is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and young adults, including those with underlying malignancies such as Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The pathogenesis of minimal change disease is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve immune complex deposition in the glomeruli, leading to damage and disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier. The disease is often responsive to corticosteroid therapy, which can help to reduce proteinuria and improve edema.

The other options are less likely:

A) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a cause of nephrotic syndrome, but it is more commonly associated with hypertension and obesity.

B) Membranous nephropathy is a cause of nephrotic syndrome, but it is more commonly associated with autoimmune disorders and infections.

D) Amyloidosis is a cause of nephrotic syndrome, but it is more commonly associated with chronic diseases such as multiple myeloma and rheumatoid arthritis.

* Myocardial infarction: Takayasu arteritis can cause aortic and coronary artery involvement, leading to myocardial infarction.
* Polyneuropathy: The inflammation and vascular insufficiency associated with Takayasu arteritis can damage the nerves, leading to polyneuropathy.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:

* Amaurosis fugax is a transient loss of vision, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.
* Tongue infarction is not a known complication of Takayasu arteritis.
* Palpable purpura is a skin manifestation of vasculitis, but it is not a common complication of Takayasu arteritis.

Therefore, the patient is at risk for myocardial infarction and polyneuropathy.

55,"A 61-year-old man with schizophrenia in a locked inpatient psychiatry unit was observed making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?
Options
A) Akathisia
B) Tardive dyskinesia
C) Acute dystonia
D) Pseudoparkinsonism
E) Palsy","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the patient's symptoms. The patient is making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient.

Akathisia (Option A) is characterized by restlessness and a feeling of inner tension, often accompanied by a desire to move. The patient's symptoms do not match this description.

Acute dystonia (Option C) is a sudden onset of muscle spasms, often involving the face, neck, or tongue. While the patient's symptoms involve facial movements, they are not sudden in onset and do not fit the typical description of acute dystonia.

Pseudoparkinsonism (Option D) is a side effect of antipsychotic medication that mimics the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. The patient's symptoms do not match this description.

Palsy (Option E) refers to a weakness or paralysis of a muscle or group of muscles. The patient's symptoms do not match this description.

Tardive dyskinesia (Option B) is a side effect of long-term antipsychotic medication, characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements of the face, trunk, or limbs. The patient's symptoms of smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively are consistent with tardive dyskinesia, especially given that they started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced.

Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."
255,"A 62-year-old man presents to the physician because of incomplete healing of a chest wound. He recently had a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 25 years.

Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient?
Options
A) Surgical debridement
B) Negative pressure wound management
C) Sternal dressings
D) Sternal wiring
E) Sternal fixation","The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, who recently underwent a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. He presents with incomplete healing of a chest wound, specifically wound dehiscence in the lower 3rd of the sternal region, with dead necrotic tissue and pus present on the wound surface. The CT scan shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues, indicating an infection.

Given the presence of infection and wound dehiscence, the most appropriate next step in management is to remove the dead tissue and bacteria to promote healing and prevent further complications. Surgical debridement is a procedure that involves the removal of dead tissue, bacteria, and other debris from the wound to promote healing and prevent further complications.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient is {A} Surgical debridement.

Note: While negative pressure wound management (option B) may also be considered in some cases of wound dehiscence, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the presence of dead necrotic tissue and pus. Sternal dressings (option C), sternal wiring (option D), and sternal fixation (option E) are not directly relevant to the management of the wound infection and dehiscence."
387,"A 28-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician with increased menstrual bleeding over the past three months. She also notes easy bruising and bleeding from her gums when brushing her teeth. She is sexually active with multiple partners and has no history of intravenous drug use. Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?
Options
A) Serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity
B) Vitamin B12 and folate levels
C) Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity
D) HIV and HCV testing
E) Bone marrow aspiration","To determine the best course of action for this patient, let's break down the key information provided:

1. The patient is a 28-year-old woman with no significant past medical history.
2. She presents with increased menstrual bleeding and easy bruising, which suggests a possible bleeding disorder.
3. Physical examination reveals petechiae and scattered ecchymoses, which are indicative of a bleeding tendency.
4. Laboratory results show:
   - Low platelet count (95,000/mL)
   - Prolonged PT (13.2s)
   - Normal aPTT (30s)
   - Normocytic, normochromic red blood cells on peripheral blood smear
   - No morphologic abnormalities on platelet morphology

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the primary concern is a bleeding disorder, particularly thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The normal PT and aPTT suggest that the coagulation cascade is intact, and the bleeding is likely due to a platelet-related issue.

Considering the patient's age, lack of significant past medical history, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune disease characterized by low platelet count due to immune system-mediated platelet destruction.

Among the provided options, the most relevant diagnostic study to perform next is HIV and HCV testing. ITP can be secondary to an underlying infection, such as HIV or HCV, which can trigger an autoimmune response leading to platelet destruction.

The answer is {D}."
1242,"An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman is found to have T-score of -2.6 SD on routine bone mineral density screening. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche started at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and PAP smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment is begun with a drug that prevents further bone resorption and reduces her risk of developing breast cancer. This drug puts her at an increased risk of which of the following adverse effects?
Options
A) Mandibular osteonecrosis
B) Skin infections
C) Osteosarcoma
D) Hypercholesterolemia
E) Deep vein thrombosis
""","Given the patient's history of osteoporosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and family history of breast cancer, the most likely treatment for this patient would be a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), such as tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a medication that can prevent further bone resorption, reduce the risk of breast cancer, and has a favorable effect on lipid profiles. However, it also carries a risk of increased deep vein thrombosis due to its estrogenic effects on the coagulation system.

Therefore, the correct answer is {E}.

Note: The other options are incorrect because:

* Mandibular osteonecrosis is associated with bisphosphonates, not SERMs like tamoxifen.
* Skin infections are not a known adverse effect of tamoxifen.
* Osteosarcoma is a rare side effect of denosumab, not tamoxifen.
* Hypercholesterolemia is actually a beneficial effect of tamoxifen, not an adverse effect.

In conclusion, the patient's treatment with tamoxifen puts her at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis."
1180,"A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision.

Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Cervical spine fracture
B) Intracranial hemorrhage
C) Syringomyelia
D) Brachial plexopathy
E) Conversion disorder","Analyzing the situation, the 17-year-old male was involved in a motor vehicle accident and presented to the emergency department. He was initially stable with a normal cardiopulmonary exam, strong distal pulses, and was breathing on his own. However, 4 months later, he presents with weakness in his upper extremities, reduced sensation, and normal strength and sensation in his lower extremities. This delayed presentation of symptoms suggests a possible injury to the cervical spine or a neurological condition.

Given the patient's history of a motor vehicle accident, the most likely diagnosis is a cervical spine injury, specifically a cervical spine fracture. This injury could have caused damage to the spinal cord, leading to the patient's symptoms of weakness and reduced sensation in his upper extremities.

However, the patient's initial presentation in the emergency department was stable, and no significant fractures or injuries were found. This raises the possibility of a delayed diagnosis of a cervical spine fracture or a different underlying condition.

Considering the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is a cervical spine fracture. However, the initial presentation and the lack of immediate findings suggest that the diagnosis may be more complex.

The most likely diagnosis is {A} Cervical spine fracture."

Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""
Options
A) Increase the FiO2
B) Extubate
C) Increase the tidal volume
D) Increase PEEP
E) Increase the respiratory rate","To determine the best next step in the management of this patient, let's analyze the provided information.

The patient is a 70-year-old woman who underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for a small bowel perforation. She was sedated, induced, and intubated for the surgery, and is now being maintained on nitrous oxide and isoflurane in the intensive care unit (ICU). The ventilator settings are as follows: FiO2 50%, tidal volume 1000 mL, respiratory rate 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 2.5 cm H2O.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse of 76/min, and blood pressure of 111/50 mm Hg. She is responsive to painful stimuli, and the lung examination shows bilateral rales. The abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions.

The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows:

pH 7.44
pO2 54 mm Hg
pCO2 31 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mm Hg

The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.44, indicating alkalosis. The pCO2 is 31 mm Hg, which is below the normal range (35-45 mm Hg), indicating hyperventilation. The pO2 is 54 mm Hg, which is below the normal range (75-100 mm Hg), indicating hypoxemia.

Considering the patient's stable vital signs, the presence of bilateral rales, and the ABG results, the best next step in management is to address the hypoxemia and hyperventilation.

A) Increasing the FiO2 would increase the oxygen concentration in the air, but the patient is already on 50% FiO2, which is a high concentration.

B) Extubation may not be appropriate at this time, as the patient is still intubated and the lung examination shows bilateral rales.

C) Increasing the tidal volume may worsen the hyperventilation and increase the risk of barotrauma.

D) Increasing the PEEP may help improve oxygenation, but the patient's pO2 is still low, and the PEEP is currently set at 2.5 cm H2O, which is a relatively low level.

E) Increasing the respiratory rate may worsen the hyperventilation and increase the risk of barotrauma.

Given the patient's hypoxemia and hyperventilation, the best next step is to address the underlying cause of these issues. Since the patient is already on a high concentration of FiO2, the next step would be to assess the patient's lung mechanics and consider adjusting the ventilator settings to improve oxygenation.

However, since the options provided do not include adjusting the ventilator settings or assessing lung mechanics, the best next step among the provided options would be to increase the PEEP, as it may help improve oxygenation.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to increase the PEEP."
759,"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, and mild intermittent abdominal pain that is not affected by eating. He reports that over the last 6 months he slept a lot more than usual and lost 14.9 kg (33 lbs) without trying to lose weight. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that is worse when he is working and in the yard. There is no significant family history. His long-standing male partner passed away 2 years ago in a fatal car accident. His blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 23/min, and the temperature is 38°C (100.5°F). On physical examination, he has pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. There is a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border. His head bobs with each heartbeat. There are small, painless, red macules on both palms. His spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. His laboratory results are shown below.

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings?
Options
A) Viridans streptococci
B) Treponema pallidum
C) Malignant colonic neoplasm
D) Collagen vascular disease
E) Group D streptococci","The patient is a 62-year-old man presenting with a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, mild intermittent abdominal pain, and significant weight loss over the last 6 months. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that worsens with physical activity. Physical examination reveals pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae on his lower extremities, a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur, and a palpable spleen. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytosis, and low serum ferritin and iron levels.

The presence of a palpable spleen and thrombocytosis suggests splenomegaly, which is often associated with hematological malignancies. The patient's laboratory results and colonoscopy findings showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon are consistent with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

The cardiac findings, including the high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur and the head bobbing with each heartbeat, are suggestive of tricuspid regurgitation. Tricuspid regurgitation is a common complication of right-sided heart failure, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including malignancies.

In this case, the most likely explanation for the cardiac findings is the malignant colonic neoplasm, which has likely metastasized to the liver and caused right-sided heart failure leading to tricuspid regurgitation.

The answer is {C}."
238,"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago.

""","The patient is a 21-year-old man presenting with pruritus and a hypopigmented rash on his upper body for 5 days, which started as a single lesion on his upper back and has since extended to his shoulders. The rash is accompanied by a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with an insulin pump and inconsistent condom use with multiple female partners. The patient's recent travel to the Bahamas and outdoor activities such as hiking and visiting beaches are also noted.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is a fungal infection, specifically tinea versicolor. Tinea versicolor is a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia species, which is commonly found on the skin and can cause hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules. The infection is often seen in young adults and is associated with warm and humid environments, such as beaches and tropical climates.

The diagnosis of tinea versicolor can be confirmed through several methods, including:

* Wood lamp examination: This is a simple and non-invasive method that can help diagnose tinea versicolor. When exposed to ultraviolet light, the affected skin area will appear yellowish or greenish due to the presence of the fungus.
* Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation: This is a laboratory test that involves applying a KOH solution to a skin scraping from the affected area. The KOH solution will dissolve the skin cells and reveal the presence of fungal elements, such as hyphae or spores.
* Skin culture: This involves taking a skin sample from the affected area and culturing it in a laboratory to identify the presence of the fungus.
* Skin biopsy: This involves taking a small sample of skin tissue from the affected area and examining it under a microscope to identify the presence of the fungus.

Among the options provided, the most likely method to confirm the diagnosis of tinea versicolor is the Wood lamp examination. This is because tinea versicolor is often diagnosed clinically, and the Wood lamp examination is a simple and non-invasive method that can help confirm the diagnosis.

1241,"A 3-year-old male was brought to the pediatrician with severe lip lacerations, with a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, as well as missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?
Options
A) X-linked recessive
B) X-linked dominant
C) Autosomal dominant
D) Autosomal recessvie
E) Maternally inherited mitochondrial defect","To determine the mode of inheritance for this disorder, let's analyze the information provided. The 3-year-old male patient presents with severe lip lacerations, a portion of his tongue bitten off, and missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A family history reveals two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. This pattern of inheritance suggests that the disorder is sex-linked, as it affects males more frequently and is passed down through the maternal line.

The presence of high levels of uric acid in the urinalysis is also a crucial clue. This is a characteristic feature of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine and guanine to their respective monophosphate derivatives, which are then used for DNA synthesis.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. Since the disorder is caused by a deficiency of a protein that is normally produced on the X chromosome, it is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that males are more frequently affected, as they have only one X chromosome, and a single mutation in the HPRT1 gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they would need to inherit two mutated copies of the HPRT1 gene (one from each parent) to express the disorder.

Therefore, the mode of inheritance for this disorder is X-linked recessive.

Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a “heavy feeling” in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?
Options
A) Rectouterine septum nodularity
B) Globular 10-week sized uterus
C) Adnexal mass
D) Irregular 14-week sized uterus
E) No remarkable physical exam finding","The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of five vaginal deliveries and now presents with symptoms of heavy and irregular menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and urinary frequency. These symptoms, combined with her history of obesity and type II diabetes, suggest a possible diagnosis of uterine fibroids.

Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that arise from the smooth muscle layer of the uterus and are common in women of reproductive age. They can cause a range of symptoms, including heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, and urinary frequency.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely physical exam finding would be a palpable uterus, which is consistent with the presence of uterine fibroids. The size of the uterus can vary depending on the size and number of fibroids present.

The options provided can be evaluated as follows:

A) Rectouterine septum nodularity - This is not a typical finding in uterine fibroids.

B) Globular 10-week sized uterus - This is a possible finding in uterine fibroids, as the uterus can become enlarged and globular due to the presence of multiple fibroids.

C) Adnexal mass - This is not a typical finding in uterine fibroids, as they are located within the uterine wall rather than in the adnexal region.

D) Irregular 14-week sized uterus - This is also a possible finding in uterine fibroids, as the uterus can become irregularly shaped and enlarged due to the presence of fibroids.

E) No remarkable physical exam finding - This is unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and history.

Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely physical exam finding is a palpable uterus, which is consistent with the presence of uterine fibroids. The size of the uterus can vary depending on the size and number of fibroids present.

The most likely finding is a globular 10-week sized uterus, as this is a common presentation of uterine fibroids.

399,"A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department from his home complaining of dyspnea. He is alert and oriented. The following arterial blood gas readings are drawn: pH: 7.33 (Normal: 7.35-7.45), pCO2: 70 mmHg (Normal: 35-45 mmHg), HCO3 33 (Normal: 21-26 mEq/L) Which of the following is most likely to have produced this patient’s condition?
Options
A) Panic attack
B) Mechanical ventilation
C) Diabetic ketoacidosis
D) Pulmonary embolus
E) Chronic obstructive bronchitis","To determine the cause of the patient's condition, we need to analyze the arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The patient has a pH of 7.33, which is slightly below the normal range of 7.35-7.45. The pCO2 is elevated at 70 mmHg, which is above the normal range of 35-45 mmHg. The HCO3 level is elevated at 33 mEq/L, which is above the normal range of 21-26 mEq/L.

These findings are indicative of respiratory acidosis, which occurs when the lungs are unable to remove enough carbon dioxide from the blood. This can be caused by various conditions, including mechanical ventilation, pulmonary embolus, and chronic obstructive bronchitis.

However, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is mechanical ventilation. The patient's ABG results show a high pCO2 level, which is a common complication of mechanical ventilation. This occurs when the ventilator is not set properly or when the patient is not breathing effectively.

The other options are less likely to have produced this patient's condition. A panic attack would not typically cause an elevated pCO2 level. Diabetic ketoacidosis would cause a metabolic acidosis, which is a different type of acid-base imbalance. A pulmonary embolus could cause respiratory failure, but it would not typically cause an elevated pCO2 level. Chronic obstructive bronchitis could cause respiratory acidosis, but it would not typically cause an elevated HCO3 level.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is mechanical ventilation.

E) Walled-off pancreatic fluid collection","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 36-year-old man has been experiencing multiple episodes of nonbilious emesis for 3 days, with undigested food and dark brown emesis. He has also had early satiety, progressive severe episodic epigastric pain, and dyspepsia for the past week. The pain is partially relieved with food or over-the-counter antacids, but worsens at night and several hours after eating. He has also had a weight gain of 2 kg (4.4 lbs) during this period. His father underwent surgery for colon cancer 3 years ago, and he has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. He drinks two to three beers daily. The physical examination shows a mildly tender abdomen in the left upper quadrant, a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium, and a succussion splash, which is a characteristic finding of gastric outlet obstruction. The positive test for occult blood in the stool also suggests a possible gastrointestinal issue.

The serum studies show elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function, likely due to dehydration from prolonged vomiting. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of gastric outlet obstruction, which can be caused by various underlying conditions.

Considering the options provided:

A) Inflammation and edema are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and findings.

B) Abnormal gastric rotation is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

C) Neoplastic growth, such as a gastric or pancreatic tumor, could cause gastric outlet obstruction.

D) Scarring and fibrosis are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and findings.

E) Walled-off pancreatic fluid collection is a possible cause of gastric outlet obstruction, but it is not the most likely cause in this case.

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely underlying cause of his vomiting is a neoplastic growth, such as a gastric or pancreatic tumor, which is causing gastric outlet obstruction.

Therefore, the answer is {C}."
254,"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
Options
A) Patent processus vaginalis
B) Dilation of the pampiniform plexus
C) Twisting of the spermatic cord
D) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis
E) Impaired lymphatic drainage","The patient is a 40-year-old man presenting with a painless right-sided scrotal swelling that has been present for several weeks. The swelling is described as a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender mass that transilluminates. The patient's medical history includes hypertension treated with enalapril and a family history of seminoma, which is a type of testicular cancer. However, the physical examination findings do not suggest testicular cancer, as the testis itself appears normal.

The key findings in this case are the presence of a scrotal mass that transilluminates and the absence of bowel sounds within the mass. Transillumination is a characteristic feature of a hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid in the scrotum. Hydroceles occur when there is an imbalance between the production and resorption of fluid by the tunica vaginalis, a layer of tissue that surrounds the testis and epididymis.

The patient's history of smoking and family history of seminoma may suggest an increased risk of testicular cancer, but the physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. The absence of bowel sounds within the mass and the presence of a soft, cystic mass that transilluminates are more consistent with a hydrocele.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the mass is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which is characteristic of a hydrocele.

982,"A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies. She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?
Options
A) Alpha-adrenergic antagonism
B) Beta-adrenergic antagonism
C) Muscarinic antagonism
D) Relative lipophobicity
E) Serotonergic antagonism","The patient is a 22-year-old woman with seasonal allergies who is currently taking diphenhydramine for symptom relief. However, she dislikes the sedating effects of diphenhydramine. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. Fexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine, and its characteristic that allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine is its relative lipophobicity.

Fexofenadine has a higher lipophilicity than diphenhydramine, which allows it to penetrate the brain more easily and cause sedation. However, fexofenadine is also more lipophobic than diphenhydramine, which means it has a lower affinity for lipids and is less able to cross the blood-brain barrier. As a result, fexofenadine is less likely to cause sedation than diphenhydramine.

The other options are not correct because:

A) Alpha-adrenergic antagonism is not a characteristic of fexofenadine that would make it less sedating.

B) Beta-adrenergic antagonism is not a characteristic of fexofenadine that would make it less sedating.

C) Muscarinic antagonism is a characteristic of anticholinergic medications, not antihistamines like fexofenadine.

E) Serotonergic antagonism is not a characteristic of fexofenadine that would make it less sedating.

432,"A 24-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate. She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?
Options
A) Head CT
B) Head MRI
C) Lumbar puncture
D) Post void residual volumes
E) Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors","The patient presents with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate, which is a urinary retention. This symptom, along with the patient's history of being sexually abused, raises concerns for a possible neurogenic bladder or other neurological conditions affecting the urinary system. The patient's history of trouble speaking, changes in vision, and facial pain, which have since resolved, could be indicative of a transient neurological event, such as a seizure or a transient ischemic attack. However, the patient's current inability to urinate and the physical exam finding of leftward gaze resulting in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward (abducens nerve palsy) suggest a more significant neurological issue.

The best initial test for this patient's chief complaint of urinary retention, along with the neurological symptoms, would be a test that evaluates the function of the urinary system and the potential neurological causes of the symptoms. The post-void residual volume (PVR) test measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination, which can help diagnose urinary retention and assess the bladder's ability to empty.

Therefore, the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint is the post-void residual volumes (D).

126,"A 33-year-old nurse is referred to an infectious disease specialist after she exhibited a PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration. She denies any cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, fevers, or night sweats over the last several months. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 120/81 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. An initial chest radiograph is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?
Options
A) Isoniazid
B) No management indicated
C) Quantiferon gold
D) Repeat PPD in 1 week
E) Rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol","To determine the most appropriate management for the 33-year-old nurse, we need to consider her PPD skin test results and her overall health status.

The patient's PPD skin test shows 17 mm of induration, which is considered a positive result. However, she denies any symptoms of active tuberculosis (TB), such as cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, fevers, or night sweats. Her chest radiograph is also unremarkable.

In this case, the patient's positive PPD result is likely due to latent TB infection (LTBI) rather than active TB disease. LTBI is a condition where the individual has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis but does not have active TB disease and is not contagious.

The most appropriate management for LTBI is to initiate treatment with isoniazid (INH) for 9 months. This is because INH is effective in preventing the progression of LTBI to active TB disease and is well-tolerated by most patients.

Option A, isoniazid, is the correct answer because it is the recommended treatment for LTBI.

Option B is incorrect because management is indicated for LTBI.

Option C, Quantiferon gold, is a blood test used to diagnose TB infection, but it is not a treatment option.

Option D, repeat PPD in 1 week, is not necessary because the patient's PPD result is already positive, and a repeat test would not provide any additional information.

Option E, rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, is the treatment regimen for active TB disease, not LTBI.

Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is isoniazid."
47,"A medical research study is evaluating an investigational novel drug (medication 1) compared with standard therapy (medication 2) in patients presenting to the emergency department with myocardial infarction (MI). The study enrolled a total of 3,000 subjects, 1,500 in each study arm. Follow-up was conducted at 45 days post-MI. The following are the results of the trial:
Endpoints Medication 1 Medication 2 P-Value
Primary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03
Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)
Options
A) 5
B) 16
C) 20
D) 30
E) 50","To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes, we first need to understand the concept of NNT. The NNT is the number of patients that need to be treated with the intervention (in this case, medication 1) to prevent one additional bad outcome (in this case, death from cardiac causes) compared to the control group (medication 2).

The primary endpoint is death from cardiac causes, with 134 events in the medication 1 group and 210 events in the medication 2 group. To calculate the NNT, we use the following formula:

NNT = 1 / (Risk reduction)

The risk reduction is calculated as the difference in event rates between the two groups divided by the event rate in the control group.

First, we need to calculate the event rates:

Event rate in medication 1 group = 134 / 1500 = 0.0893 (or 8.93%)
Event rate in medication 2 group = 210 / 1500 = 0.14 (or 14%)

Risk reduction = (Event rate in medication 2 group - Event rate in medication 1 group) / Event rate in medication 2 group
= (0.14 - 0.0893) / 0.14
= 0.0407 / 0.14
= 0.291

However, the p-value for the primary endpoint is 0.03, indicating that the difference in event rates is statistically significant, but the risk reduction is not directly provided. Since the p-value is significant, we can assume the risk reduction is at least 3% (1.5% on each side of the p-value).

To calculate the NNT, we can use the risk reduction as a proxy for the event rate in the medication 1 group:

NNT = 1 / (Risk reduction)
= 1 / (0.03)
= 33.33

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the NNT is approximately 33.

However, this is not among the options provided. We must calculate it using the formula for NNT with a risk reduction of 3%:

NNT = 1 / (Risk reduction)
= 1 / (0.03)
= 33.33
However, since the question asks for rounding to the nearest whole number, we round 33.33 to 33, but since that's not an option, we can calculate it using the formula with the provided data.

The formula for NNT is:
NNT = (Event rate in control group - Event rate in treatment group) / (Event rate in treatment group)

NNT = (0.14 - 0.0893) / 0.0893
NNT = 0.0507 / 0.0893
NNT = 0.567
Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 1 / (0.567) ≈ 1.76. However, this is the number needed to harm. To find the number needed to treat, we can use the formula:
NNT = 1 / (Event rate in treatment group - Event rate in control group)
NNT = 1 / (0.0893 - 0.14)
NNT = 1 / (-0.0507)
NNT ≈ -19.74

However, this is also incorrect. We can also use the formula:
NNT = 1 / (Risk difference)
First, we need to find the risk difference:
Risk difference = Event rate in control group - Event rate in treatment group
Risk difference = 0.14 - 0.0893
Risk difference = 0.0507
Now we can find the NNT:
NNT = 1 / (Risk difference)
NNT = 1 / 0.0507
NNT ≈ 19.74
Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 20.

Options
A) Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder
B) Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury
C) Trauma to the bile duct
D) Adverse effect of anesthetic
E) Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream","The patient is a 48-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She had an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia two weeks ago and received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells during the surgery. Her examination shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly, and serum studies show elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 760 U/L, and an enlarged liver on abdominal ultrasonography. The liver biopsy shows massive centrilobular necrosis.

Given the patient's history of recent surgery and transfusion, the most likely underlying cause of her condition is an adverse effect of the anesthetic or the transfusion. However, the presence of jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, along with the liver biopsy findings, suggests a more severe liver injury.

Among the options provided, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is not directly related to the choices A, C, or E. Choice A, acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings. Choice C, trauma to the bile duct, is also not supported by the patient's history or examination findings. Choice E, Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream, is not supported by the patient's laboratory findings, including the negative anti-HCV antibodies and the absence of sepsis symptoms.

However, choice B, virus-mediated hepatocellular injury, is a possible cause of the patient's condition, given the presence of anti-HAV IgG positive and anti-HBs positive. This suggests that the patient has been previously infected with hepatitis A virus (HAV) and has developed immunity. However, the patient's current symptoms and laboratory findings, including the elevated liver enzymes and liver biopsy findings, suggest a more severe liver injury.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a combination of factors, including the adverse effect of the anesthetic or the transfusion, and possibly a viral reactivation or a drug-induced liver injury.

However, considering the options provided and the information given in the question, the best answer is B) Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury."
872,"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation.

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
B) Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis
C) Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis
D) Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli
E) Interstitial cystitis","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 45-year-old man, let's analyze the provided information.

The patient has a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules.

The key points to consider are:

1. The patient's symptoms have persisted for 2 years, despite multiple courses of antimicrobial therapy.
2. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate.
3. The urine test results show a negative mid-stream urine culture, but a positive expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) culture.

Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis. This condition is characterized by persistent pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms, and a tender prostate, without evidence of a bacterial infection. The positive EPS culture is consistent with this diagnosis, as it suggests the presence of inflammatory cells in the prostate gland.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (A) typically presents with urinary retention, nocturia, and a palpable prostate, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.
* Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (C) would likely present with a positive urine culture and symptoms of a bacterial infection, which is not the case here.
* Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli (D) would also likely present with a positive urine culture and symptoms of a bacterial infection, which is not the case here.
* Interstitial cystitis (E) typically presents with bladder pain and frequency, but not necessarily with a tender prostate or a positive EPS culture.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

A) Trial of diphenhydramine
B) Complete caffeine cessation
C) Stop evening exercise
D) Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime
E) Scheduled afternoon naps","The patient is a 21-year-old college student presenting with daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep at night, and excessive daytime sleepiness. He has tried various methods to improve his sleep, including melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m., but has not seen any improvement. He also consumes a significant amount of caffeine throughout the day, which may be exacerbating his sleep issues.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or both, despite adequate opportunity to sleep, and associated with daytime fatigue, impaired cognitive function, and reduced quality of life.

The most appropriate recommendation for this patient would be to establish a consistent sleep schedule and improve sleep hygiene practices. This can include avoiding caffeine and electronic screens before bedtime, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment.

However, among the options provided, the most relevant recommendation would be to stop evening exercise, as exercise can actually interfere with sleep if done too close to bedtime. Exercise can stimulate the body and make it harder to fall asleep. It is recommended to finish exercise at least 2-3 hours before bedtime to allow the body to wind down and prepare for sleep.

Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation for this patient is {C}."

Her past medical, family, and social histories are all non-contributory. Which of the following is the appropriate management of a newly diagnosed CIN I in a 24-year-old patient?
Options
A) Close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months
B) Cryotherapy ablation
C) Laser ablation
D) Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP)
E) Hysterectomy","For a 28-year-old woman with a recent abnormal cervical biopsy demonstrating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, the management strategy should prioritize observation and monitoring rather than immediate intervention. This approach is based on the fact that CIN I is typically a low-grade lesion with a low risk of progression to invasive cancer. Close observation involves regular follow-up with Pap smear screening, HPV DNA testing, and clinical examination to monitor for any changes or progression of the lesion.

Option A, which includes close observation, Pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months, is the most appropriate management strategy for a newly diagnosed CIN I in a 24-year-old patient. This approach allows for regular monitoring of the patient's condition and timely intervention if the lesion progresses or if new lesions develop.

Option B, cryotherapy ablation, and Option C, laser ablation, are both treatment options for CIN II or more severe lesions. Option D, Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP), is also a treatment option, but it is typically reserved for more severe lesions or when there is a high suspicion of invasive cancer. Option E, hysterectomy, is a more invasive procedure that is generally reserved for patients with severe or recurrent cervical disease.

Therefore, the most appropriate management of a newly diagnosed CIN I in a 24-year-old patient is Option A.

D) Vinyl chloride
E) Radon","To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, let's symptoms and diagnostic findings need to be analyzed. The patient is a 68-year-old man with a 1-week history of painless hematuria, which is the presence of blood in the urine. A CT scan of the urinary tract shows areas of bladder wall thickening, and cystoscopy reveals several sessile masses with central necrosis arising from the bladder wall. A biopsy specimen of the bladder masses shows moderately differentiated urothelial cells with abundant mitotic figures and nuclear atypia.

These findings are indicative of bladder cancer, specifically urothelial carcinoma. The presence of multiple sessile masses with central necrosis and nuclear atypia in the biopsy specimen suggests a high-grade tumor.

The next step is to consider the potential causes of bladder cancer. The patient's age and gender are risk factors for bladder cancer, as it is more common in men over the age of 65.

Among the options provided, the most likely cause of the patient's bladder cancer is exposure to aromatic amines. Aromatic amines are a group of chemicals that are known to be carcinogenic and are commonly found in industrial dyes, paints, and other chemicals. Workers in industries that use these chemicals, such as textile and rubber manufacturing, are at increased risk of developing bladder cancer.

The other options are also potential causes of cancer, but they are less likely to be associated with bladder cancer specifically.

Ionizing radiation (A) is a known cause of cancer, but it is more commonly associated with other types of cancer, such as leukemia and lung cancer.

Aflatoxins (C) are a group of toxins produced by certain types of mold and are known to be carcinogenic, but they are more commonly associated with liver cancer.

Vinyl chloride (D) is a chemical that is known to be carcinogenic and is commonly associated with liver cancer and angiosarcoma of the liver.

Radon (E) is a radioactive gas that is known to be carcinogenic and is commonly associated with lung cancer.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's bladder cancer is exposure to aromatic amines.

She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options
A) Administration of lithium
B) Interpersonal therapy
C) Psychodynamic psychotherapy
D) Cognitive behavioral therapy
E) Motivational interviewing","The patient is a 35-year-old woman who is experiencing stress, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating due to her work and personal life. She has developed a maladaptive coping mechanism of shoplifting, which is causing her feelings of shame and guilt. This behavior is indicative of a psychological disorder known as kleptomania, which is characterized by a recurring inability to resist urges to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value.

Given the patient's symptoms and behavior, the most appropriate next step in management is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is particularly effective in treating anxiety disorders, depression, and other conditions that involve maladaptive coping mechanisms.

CBT can help the patient to:

1. Identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to her anxiety and stress.
2. Develop more adaptive coping mechanisms to manage stress and anxiety.
3. Address underlying issues that may be contributing to her shoplifting behavior.
4. Improve her relationships with her husband and coworkers.

The other options are not as appropriate for this patient's condition. Lithium is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder, which is not indicated in this case. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on improving relationships, but it may not be as effective in addressing the patient's shoplifting behavior. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a type of therapy that focuses on exploring unconscious thoughts and feelings, but it may not be as effective in addressing the patient's maladaptive coping mechanisms. Motivational interviewing is a type of therapy that focuses on helping individuals to change their behavior, but it may not be as effective in addressing the patient's underlying issues.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is cognitive behavioral therapy.

617,"A 31-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with fevers, chills, and night sweats. After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?
Options
A) Rapidly progresive glomerulonephritis
B) Amyloidosis
C) Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
D) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
E) Minimal change disease","To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and the pathological findings on the lymph node biopsy, as well as the new development of generalized swelling and proteinuria.

The patient initially presents with fevers, chills, and night sweats, which are suggestive of an infectious or inflammatory process. The lymph node biopsy (Image A) is likely to show evidence of a systemic infection or malignancy.

The development of generalized swelling and proteinuria (4+ protein in the urine) suggests kidney involvement. The most common causes of proteinuria in this context are glomerulonephritis or nephrotic syndrome.

Considering the patient's age and the presence of systemic symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a systemic infection or malignancy that has led to kidney involvement.

Among the options provided, the most likely pathological finding on renal biopsy is amyloidosis (B). Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in various tissues, including the kidneys. It can be caused by chronic infections, malignancies, or other systemic diseases. The presence of amyloid deposits in the kidneys can lead to proteinuria, kidney failure, and other complications.

Amyloidosis is a common complication of systemic infections, such as tuberculosis, and malignancies, such as lymphoma. The patient's lymph node biopsy and systemic symptoms suggest that he may have a systemic infection or malignancy that has led to amyloidosis.

Therefore, the most likely pathological finding on renal biopsy in this patient is amyloidosis.

718,"Two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis, a 63-year-old woman has severe pain in her lower back. The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg.

Options
A) Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism
C) Elder abuse
D) Pseudohypoparathyroidism
E) Primary hyperparathyroidism","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She is on several medications, including enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer, which are commonly used in patients with chronic kidney disease. The patient presents with severe lower back pain radiating down the legs, which is exacerbated by movement. The pain is localized to the L2 vertebra, and laboratory studies show hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated urea nitrogen levels, indicating worsening kidney function.

The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and the presence of a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra on x-ray are highly suggestive of osteoporosis. The most likely explanation for these findings is secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the kidneys are unable to convert vitamin D to its active form, leading to an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Elevated PTH levels can cause an increase in bone resorption, leading to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.

The patient's hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia are also consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism, as PTH levels can stimulate the release of potassium and phosphate from bone.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and laboratory findings. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a rare condition that occurs when the parathyroid glands become autonomously functioning, leading to an overproduction of PTH. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by resistance to PTH. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by an overproduction of PTH, but it is not typically associated with chronic kidney disease or osteoporosis.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's findings is secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Capillary refill is 2 seconds. Sensorimotor evaluation of the hand is without deficits. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient?
Options
A) Amoxicillin
B) Amoxicillin-clavulanate
C) Clindamycin
D) Doxycycline
E) Azithromycin","The patient is a 22-year-old man who was bitten by a stray dog 2 days ago. He presents with 2 clean puncture wounds and localized cellulitis. The patient's vitals are within normal limits, and there are no sensorimotor deficits in the hand. Given the nature of the injury, the most likely concern is the risk of rabies transmission from the dog. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest an immediate need for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

The presence of localized cellulitis indicates a bacterial infection. The most common bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in this context are Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species. Given the patient's presentation, a combination of antibiotics that cover both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria would be appropriate.

Among the options provided, Amoxicillin-clavulanate (B) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers a wide range of bacteria, including both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. It is an effective choice for treating skin and soft tissue infections, including cellulitis.

The other options are not as suitable for this scenario:

A) Amoxicillin is a narrower-spectrum antibiotic that may not be effective against all bacteria causing cellulitis.

C) Clindamycin is a good choice for anaerobic infections but may not be the best option for this case, as the primary concern is a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection.

D) Doxycycline is not typically used as a first-line treatment for skin and soft tissue infections.

E) Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that may not be as effective against the bacteria causing cellulitis in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient is Amoxicillin-clavulanate.

370,"A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness?
Options
A) 1st pharyngeal arch
B) 2nd pharyngeal arch
C) 3rd pharyngeal arch
D) 4th pharyngeal arch
E) 6th pharyngeal arch","To determine the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve causing the patient's hoarseness, we need to consider the anatomy of the larynx and the nerves that innervate it. The larynx is formed from the 4th to the 6th pharyngeal arches. The 4th pharyngeal arch gives rise to the cricoid cartilage, the 5th pharyngeal arch is not visible in adults, and the 6th pharyngeal arch gives rise to the arytenoid cartilages. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is responsible for innervating the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, including those that control voice production, arises from the 6th pharyngeal arch.

Given that the patient underwent a thyroidectomy and is experiencing hoarseness, it is likely that the recurrent laryngeal nerve was damaged during the surgery. This nerve is responsible for controlling the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, including those that control voice production. Damage to this nerve can result in hoarseness or a change in voice quality.

Therefore, the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness is the 6th pharyngeal arch.

hCG 0.4 IU/L (normal value < 0.5 IU/L)
Biopsy: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options
A) Classic seminoma
B) Choriocarcinoma
C) Teratoma
D) Embryonal carcinoma
E) Yolk sac tumor","The patient is a 10-year-old boy who presents with a painless mass in the left testicle. The tumor markers show an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 350 ng/mL, which is significantly above the normal value of < 10 ng/mL. The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level is within the normal range. The biopsy results reveal the presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.

The elevated AFP level is a key diagnostic feature in this case. Elevated AFP levels are typically associated with yolk sac tumors, also known as endodermal sinus tumors. These tumors are a type of germ cell tumor that typically occur in the testes or ovaries and are more common in children.

The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as the presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core is a characteristic feature of yolk sac tumors.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is a yolk sac tumor.

Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings?
Options
A) Gingival swelling, erythema, and pus drainage
B) Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques
C) Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution
D) Photophobia and phonophobia
E) Rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis","Analyzing the patient's presentation, the 36-year-old woman is experiencing intermittent stabbing face pain that occurs in waves, is bilateral but not simultaneous, and can be triggered by touching her face or brushing her teeth. Four months ago, she had an episode of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week. The presence of decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally, muscle weakness in the left upper extremity, and spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus suggests a neurological disorder.

The patient's symptoms, including the episodic nature of her pain, the presence of weakness and spasticity, and the family history of migrainous headaches, are most consistent with Trigeminal Neuralgia and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, the presence of weakness and spasticity, particularly in the lower extremities, is more indicative of MS.

Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques, which are characteristic of Multiple Sclerosis. These plaques are areas of demyelination in the central nervous system, which can cause a wide range of neurological symptoms, including weakness, spasticity, and sensory disturbances.

81,"A post-mortem lung examination of a 68-year-old male overweight male with evidence of chronic lower extremity edema, a 60 pack-year smoking history and daily productive cough would be most likely to reveal:
Options
A) Hypereosinophilia
B) Reid Index > 50%
C) Non-caseating granulomas
D) Evidence of a necrotizing infection
E) Keratin pearls","Evaluating the patient's presentation, the 68-year-old male with a history of chronic lower extremity edema, a 60 pack-year smoking history, and daily productive cough suggests a chronic respiratory condition. The presence of chronic lower extremity edema and productive cough may indicate congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Given the patient's smoking history, the most likely diagnosis is COPD. The post-mortem lung examination would likely reveal changes consistent with COPD, such as chronic inflammation and fibrosis. 

Option B, Reid Index > 50%, is the most likely finding in this scenario. The Reid Index is a measure of the thickness of the mucous gland layer in the airways, and a value greater than 50% is indicative of chronic bronchitis, a hallmark of COPD. This is consistent with the patient's chronic productive cough and smoking history.

The other options are not as likely. Hypereosinophilia (A) is a condition characterized by an increased number of eosinophils in the blood, which is not directly related to COPD. Non-caseating granulomas (C) are characteristic of sarcoidosis, a different respiratory condition. Evidence of a necrotizing infection (D) would suggest a more acute and severe condition, such as pneumonia or sepsis. Keratin pearls (E) are characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma, a type of lung cancer.

E) Schedule a follow-up in 6 months","The patient is a 42-year-old man with elevated liver function tests, a history of a severe car accident 30 years ago, and a family history of alcoholism and liver cancer. He is thin, and his laboratory studies show elevated glucose, AST, and ALT levels, with a positive HCV RNA test and HCV genotype 1. The liver biopsy shows mononuclear infiltrates limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis, which is consistent with chronic hepatitis C.

The most appropriate next step in management is to initiate antiviral therapy to treat the chronic hepatitis C infection. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is a combination of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that is effective against HCV genotype 1 and has a high cure rate. It is a preferred treatment option for patients with chronic hepatitis C, especially those with a history of liver disease or those who are at risk of developing liver disease.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in management:

* Tenofovir and velpatasvir is a combination of DAAs that is effective against HCV genotype 1, but it is not the preferred treatment option for this patient.
* Interferon and ribavirin is an older treatment regimen that is less effective and has more side effects than DAAs.
* Tenofovir and entecavir is a combination of antiviral medications that is used to treat HIV infection, not hepatitis C.
* Scheduling a follow-up in 6 months is not an appropriate next step in management, as it would delay treatment and potentially allow the disease to progress.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy.

His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?
Options
A) 30%
B) 15%
C) 35%
D) 25%
E) 20%","To determine the ejection fraction (EF) in this patient, we need to understand the concept of EF and how it is calculated. The EF is the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat. It is calculated by dividing the stroke volume (SV) by the end-diastolic volume (EDV) and multiplying by 100.

Given that the end-systolic volume (ESV) is 80 mL, we can calculate the stroke volume (SV) as follows:

SV = EDV - ESV

Since the EF is calculated by dividing the SV by the EDV, we need to know the EDV. However, the EDV is not directly provided. But we can use the given information to estimate it.

The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is given as 35 mm Hg × min/L. We can use the formula:

SVR = (Mean arterial pressure - Mean right atrial pressure) / Cardiac output

We are given the mean arterial pressure (MAP) as 90/60 mm Hg, which is approximately 90 mm Hg. We can assume the mean right atrial pressure (MRAP) to be around 5-10 mm Hg. For simplicity, let's assume MRAP = 7.5 mm Hg.

Cardiac output (CO) can be estimated using the formula:

CO = (SVR × Cardiac index) + 1

We are given the cardiac index as 2.5 L/min/m² (which is a reasonable estimate for a 72-year-old man). Therefore:

CO = (35 × 2.5) + 1
CO = 87.5 + 1
CO ≈ 88.5 L/min

Now, we can calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP) using the formula:

MAP = (2/3 × Systemic vascular resistance × Cardiac output) + Mean right atrial pressure

MAP = (2/3 × 35 × 88.5) + 7.5
MAP ≈ 94.5 mm Hg

The stroke volume (SV) can be estimated using the formula:

SV = (MAP - MRAP) / Heart rate

SV = (94.5 - 7.5) / 100
SV ≈ 0.87 L

Now, we can calculate the end-diastolic volume (EDV) using the formula:

EDV = SV + ESV
EDV = 0.87 + 0.08
EDV ≈ 0.95 L

Finally, we can calculate the ejection fraction (EF) using the formula:

EF = (SV / EDV) × 100
EF = (0.87 / 0.95) × 100
EF ≈ 91.6%

However, this is not among the options. The closest option is 90% which is a reasonable estimate for a healthy ejection fraction.

Options
A) Acting out
B) Sublimation
C) Reaction formation
D) Intellectualization
E) Projection","The 19-year-old man is experiencing conflicting desires and societal pressures. He has frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers, which suggests a same-sex attraction, but he lives in a conservative community where such desires may not be accepted. He joins a hate group and attacks a gay couple, which is a violent and aggressive behavior. This behavior is a way of denying or repressing his own same-sex desires and redirecting them towards hatred towards others who are different from him.

This behavior is an example of reaction formation, which is a psychological defense mechanism where an individual expresses an opposite behavior or attitude to hide their true feelings or desires. In this case, the man's behavior is a reaction to his own same-sex desires, and he is using hatred towards others as a way to deny or repress those desires.

The other options are not correct because:

* Acting out refers to expressing one's feelings or desires in a direct and often destructive way, but it doesn't necessarily involve denying or repressing one's true feelings.
* Sublimation refers to redirecting one's desires or impulses into more socially acceptable behaviors, but in this case, the man's behavior is not a healthy or positive redirection of his desires.
* Intellectualization refers to avoiding emotional involvement with a situation by focusing on abstract ideas or concepts, but it's not relevant to the man's behavior in this scenario.
* Projection refers to attributing one's own feelings or desires to someone else, but it's not what's happening in this situation.

119,"A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic for a check-up. He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Asbestosis
B) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
C) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
D) Bronchiectasis
E) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and the results of the pulmonary function test.

The patient presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He has a significant smoking history, with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, but no wheezing or crackles are auscultated.

The pulmonary function test shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%, which is below the normal value of 80%. This indicates airway obstruction. The FEV1 is 50% of the predicted value, which further supports the presence of airway obstruction. The lung volumes show an increased total lung capacity (110% of predicted value) and residual volume (115% of predicted value), which is consistent with air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs.

The DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide) is 60% of the predicted value, which indicates impaired gas exchange.

Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a progressive lung disease characterized by airflow limitation, which is not fully reversible, and is usually associated with smoking. The patient's symptoms, pulmonary examination, and pulmonary function test results are all consistent with COPD.

The other options are less likely:

* Asbestosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers, which can lead to scarring and fibrosis in the lungs. The patient's history of working in a steel mill may have exposed him to asbestos, but the pulmonary function test results do not support this diagnosis.
* Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is a condition characterized by impaired breathing and low oxygen levels in people who are overweight or obese. The patient's BMI is 31 kg/m2, which is in the obese range, but the pulmonary function test results do not support this diagnosis.
* Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease characterized by scarring and fibrosis in the lungs, which can lead to shortness of breath and other symptoms. The patient's pulmonary function test results do not support this diagnosis.
* Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by damage to the airways, which can lead to chronic cough and sputum production. The patient's pulmonary function test results do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Physically, he is also found to be significantly overweight with hypogonadism. Notably, the boy was limp when he was born and did not have a normal motor response to stimuli. Elevated levels of a gastrointestinal hormone are associated with the cause of this patient's weight gain. The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain is produced in which of the following cell types?
Options
A) D cells
B) G cells
C) I cells
D) P/D1 cells
E) L cells","The 4-year-old boy is presenting with delayed cognitive and social milestones, significant overweight, hypogonadism, and a history of being limp at birth with a poor motor response to stimuli. These symptoms are indicative of Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects multiple systems in the body. One of the characteristic features of Prader-Willi syndrome is excessive appetite and food-seeking behavior, leading to significant weight gain.

The hormone responsible for the weight gain in Prader-Willi syndrome is ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates appetite and increases food intake. Ghrelin is produced in the gastrointestinal tract by a specific type of cell.

Ghrelin is produced by P/D1 cells in the gastrointestinal tract. These cells are found in the duodenum and jejunum, and they release ghrelin into the bloodstream, where it can stimulate appetite and increase food intake.

Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
Options
A) Measurement bias
B) Recall bias
C) Lead-time bias
D) Selection bias
E) Length-time bias","To determine the type of bias that would be exemplified if the conclusion stated above was due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, let's analyze the situation.

The study found that initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations. However, if the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound was the reason for this finding, it would mean that the study detected the condition earlier than it would have been detected in the CT group.

This situation is an example of lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when the apparent benefit of an intervention (in this case, point-of-care ultrasound) is due to the earlier detection of a disease, rather than any actual improvement in outcomes. As a result, the intervention may appear more effective than it actually is.

In this scenario, the point-of-care ultrasound may have detected nephrolithiasis earlier than the CT scan, but it's unclear whether this earlier detection would lead to any actual benefits for the patients. Therefore, the observed benefit of point-of-care ultrasound may be due to lead-time bias.

359,"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient’s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?
Options
A) Immobilization
B) Moderate flexion then hyperpronation
C) Open reduction
D) Radiograph
E) Supination then maximal extension","The 3-year-old girl presents with an acute arm injury after being swung in the air by her father. The symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible radial head subluxation, also known as ""nursemaid's elbow."" This condition typically occurs when a child is lifted or swung by the hands, causing the radial head to dislocate from the annular ligament. The child usually cries and refuses to use the affected limb, and the pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow.

The next step in management for a suspected radial head subluxation is to reduce the dislocation. The most effective and recommended method for reducing radial head subluxation is the ""supination then maximal extension"" maneuver. This involves gently supinating the child's forearm and then extending the elbow maximally, which helps to reduce the radial head back into its normal position.

Therefore, the next step in management is to perform the supination then maximal extension maneuver to attempt to reduce the radial head subluxation.

966,"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This pain started acutely, and she describes the pain as sharp. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. She takes a number of medications but does not remember what they are. On physical exam, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. After resolution of this acute episode, the patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia. Which of the following describes the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case?
Options
A) Antibody to soluble factor
B) Inhibitor of microtubule polymerization
C) Inhibitor of proximal tubule reabsorption
D) Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase
E) Recombinant enzyme","To solve this question, let's break it down step by step.

The patient is a 52-year-old woman presenting with severe pain in her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, which started acutely and is described as sharp. Her medical history includes obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. On physical examination, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch.

Given the acute onset of severe pain in the first MTP joint, the most likely diagnosis is gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often the big toe.

The patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms after the acute episode resolves. One month later, on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia, which is a condition characterized by a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets.

Considering the patient's history of gout and the development of pancytopenia after starting a medication, the most likely drug prescribed is allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to prevent gout attacks by reducing uric acid production.

The mechanism of allopurinol involves the inhibition of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. By inhibiting this enzyme, allopurinol reduces uric acid production, thereby preventing gout attacks.

However, allopurinol can cause bone marrow suppression as a side effect, leading to pancytopenia. This is because allopurinol can inhibit the production of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets, by affecting the bone marrow.

Therefore, the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case is the inhibition of xanthine oxidase.

The final answer is {D}."
840,"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of thrombophlebitis. Physical examination shows multiple bruises on her limbs. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?
Options
A) Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation
B) Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin
C) Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis
D) Inhibition of stem cell differentiation
E) Restoration of the body's iron stores","The 48-year-old woman has a history of thrombophlebitis and is now presenting with lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, easy bruising, and a significantly elevated platelet count. These symptoms are indicative of polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by excessive production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid further support this diagnosis. The treatment with a medication used in the treatment of sickle cell disease is likely hydroxyurea.

In sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin, which is a type of hemoglobin that is present in the fetus but typically disappears after birth. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin and can help to reduce the severity of sickle cell disease by decreasing the number of red blood cells that become sickled.

Therefore, the mechanism most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease is the increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?
Options
A) Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin
B) Increased phosphorylation of myosin
C) Increased production of nitric oxide
D) Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
E) Decreased concentration of bradykinin","To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided and the possible answers.

The patient is a 56-year-old man who underwent a temporal artery biopsy to evaluate headache and blurry vision. He has a history of hypertension treated with lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor. The biopsy results show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells.

Arginine is an amino acid that serves as a precursor for the production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator that plays a crucial role in vascular tone regulation and blood pressure control.

Considering the patient's history of hypertension and the use of lisinopril, which inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor), it is likely that the patient's endothelial cells are producing more nitric oxide to counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II.

However, the biopsy results show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells, which would be expected to decrease nitric oxide production. This is not consistent with the expected increase in nitric oxide production in response to lisinopril.

The most likely explanation for this finding is that the decreased arginine concentration is due to increased production of nitric oxide, which consumes arginine as a substrate. This would lead to decreased arginine concentrations in the endothelial cells.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

E) Short acting beta-2 agonist","To determine the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question, let's consider the patient's symptoms and the provided options.

The patient is experiencing recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, which are indicative of allergic rhinitis. The medication is being prescribed to alleviate these symptoms as needed.

Option A, alpha-adrenergic agonist, is not typically used to treat allergic rhinitis. Alpha-adrenergic agonists are more commonly used to treat conditions such as hypertension, ADHD, and nasal congestion due to colds.

Option B, competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors, is a mechanism of action for anticholinergic medications, which are used to treat conditions such as overactive bladder, peptic ulcers, and Parkinson's disease. They are not typically used to treat allergic rhinitis.

Option C, disruption of disulfide bonds, is a mechanism of action for certain medications such as ACE inhibitors, which are used to treat hypertension and heart failure. This option is not relevant to the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Option D, inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5, is a mechanism of action for medications such as sildenafil, which are used to treat erectile dysfunction. This option is not relevant to the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

Option E, short-acting beta-2 agonist, is a mechanism of action for medications such as albuterol, which are used to treat conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. Short-acting beta-2 agonists work by relaxing the muscles in the airways, making it easier to breathe and alleviating symptoms such as wheezing and congestion.

Based on the patient's symptoms and the provided options, the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question is the inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5 is incorrect for this patient's condition, the correct answer is the one that is most likely to be used to alleviate the patient's symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

1149,"A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?
Options
A) Hyperplasia
B) Hypertrophy
C) Atrophy
D) Metaplasia
E) Dysplasia","To determine the process that caused the change in the breast tissue of pregnant women, let's analyze the information provided. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women.

Hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue, which can be caused by various factors, including hormonal changes. During pregnancy, the body undergoes significant hormonal changes, including an increase in estrogen and progesterone levels. These hormonal changes can stimulate the growth and proliferation of breast tissue, leading to an increase in the number of acinar glands.

Hypertrophy refers to an increase in the size of cells in an organ or tissue, but not an increase in the number of cells. Atrophy refers to a decrease in the size of cells in an organ or tissue. Metaplasia refers to a change in the type of cells in an organ or tissue, often in response to injury or irritation. Dysplasia refers to an abnormal development or maturation of cells in an organ or tissue.

Given the information provided, the increase in the number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation in the breast tissue of pregnant women is most likely due to an increase in the number of cells, which is consistent with hyperplasia.

26,"A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?
Options
A) Lymphocytes
B) Immunoglobulin class switching
C) Superoxide dismutase
D) Myeloperoxidase
E) Respiratory burst","Let's think step by step. The patient is a 5-year-old female with recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphyphlococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test, which is a diagnostic tool for assessing the function of the respiratory burst in neutrophils. The respiratory burst is a critical process by which neutrophils produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill ingested microorganisms.

The failure of the nitroblue tetrazolium test suggests that the patient's neutrophils are unable to produce ROS, which is essential for killing certain pathogens. Among the options provided, the most likely dysfunctional process is the respiratory burst, which is responsible for the production of ROS.

The respiratory burst involves the activation of NADPH oxidase, which generates superoxide (O2-) from oxygen. Superoxide is then converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutase. However, the primary defect in this patient is likely the inability of neutrophils to produce superoxide, which is a critical step in the respiratory burst.

The correct answer is {E}.

The other options are not directly related to the respiratory burst or the production of ROS. Lymphocytes (A) are a type of immune cell that plays a role in cell-mediated immunity, but they are not directly involved in the respiratory burst. Immunoglobulin class switching (B) is a process by which B cells switch from producing one type of antibody to another, but it is not related to the respiratory burst. Superoxide dismutase (C) is an enzyme that converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, but it is not the primary defect in this patient. Myeloperoxidase (D) is an enzyme that produces hypochlorous acid from hydrogen peroxide, but it is not directly involved in the respiratory burst."

She first noticed her symptoms after she got off a rollercoaster ride 2 months ago. The physical examination shows weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. The MRI of the head and neck is not provided, but based on the symptoms, it is likely that the patient has a cervical radiculopathy, specifically a compression of the C6 or C7 nerve root.

The symptoms of cervical radiculopathy can be caused by a variety of structures, including herniated discs, osteophytes, and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. The ligamentum flavum is a structure derived from the notochord, which is an embryologic layer that gives rise to the vertebral column and the intervertebral discs.

The notochord is a flexible rod-like structure that forms in the embryonic mesoderm and provides support and structure to the developing vertebral column. It eventually gives rise to the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs and the ligamentum flavum, which are both composed of notochordal cells.

The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?
Options
A) Interleukin 2
B) Interleukin 8
C) Interleukin 11
D) Erythropoietin
E) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma who has developed a severe anemia, as evidenced by a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dl and a hematocrit of 35%. He also has a significant thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 20,000/mm^3. The oncologist is concerned about the optimal dose and frequency of chemotherapy due to these laboratory results.

Given the patient's severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, the most appropriate recombinant version to use in this patient would be to stimulate the production of red blood cells and platelets.

Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. It is commonly used to treat anemia in patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.

Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a recombinant version of a protein that stimulates the production of white blood cells, particularly neutrophils. However, it is not typically used to treat anemia or thrombocytopenia.

Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a recombinant version of a protein that stimulates the production of white blood cells, particularly T cells. It is used to treat certain types of cancer, but it is not typically used to treat anemia or thrombocytopenia.

Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a recombinant version of a protein that stimulates the production of white blood cells, particularly neutrophils. It is not typically used to treat anemia or thrombocytopenia.

Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a recombinant version of a protein that stimulates the production of platelets. It is used to prevent thrombocytopenia in patients with cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.

Therefore, the most appropriate recombinant version to use in this patient is Erythropoietin, which is used to stimulate the production of red blood cells.

492,"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up vaccination 1 week after being bitten by a rodent while camping. She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner. The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?
Options
A) Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.
B) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because her case is uncomplicated and does not require decision-making on his part.
C) Inform the patient that dating her will never be appropriate even once the physician-patient relationship has been terminated.
D) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her, but that she will have to transfer her care to a different physician.
E) Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because she no longer requires his service as a physician.
""","Analyzing the situation, the 26-year-old woman has been under the physician's care for post-exposure prophylaxis following a rodent bite, and she has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The physician has been managing her care regimen. When she invites him on a date, it creates a conflict of interest and a potential breach of professional boundaries.

The American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics states that physicians should avoid exploiting their professional relationships for personal or financial gain, and that romantic relationships with current patients are generally considered unethical. This is because such relationships can compromise the physician's objectivity, create conflicts of interest, and potentially harm the patient.

Therefore, the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation is to inform her that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical. This maintains professional boundaries, avoids potential conflicts of interest, and upholds the principles of the AMA Code of Medical Ethics.

The correct answer is:

987,"A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options
A) Hypersensitivity reaction
B) Asbestos inhalation
C) Neoplastic transformation
D) Opportunistic colonization
E) Abscess formation","The 60-year-old man has a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood, inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area, and a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. The presence of a radiopaque mass suggests a possible foreign body or a tumor. The patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis is significant, but the absence of acid-fast bacteria in the sputum sample despite multiple cultures makes tuberculosis less likely. The patient is afebrile, which suggests that the condition may not be infectious in nature.

Considering the patient's symptoms and the presence of a radiopaque mass, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a neoplastic transformation, which refers to the process of normal cells becoming cancerous. The radiopaque mass is likely a tumor, and the patient's symptoms, such as cough and hemoptysis, are consistent with lung cancer.

The other options are less likely:

A) Hypersensitivity reaction: This refers to an overreaction of the immune system to a specific antigen, which can cause a range of symptoms, including respiratory problems. However, the presence of a radiopaque mass is not consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction.

B) Asbestos inhalation: Asbestos exposure can cause lung disease, including lung cancer, but the patient's symptoms and the presence of a radiopaque mass are not typical of asbestos-related lung disease.

D) Opportunistic colonization: This refers to the growth of microorganisms in a host with a compromised immune system. However, the patient is afebrile, and the sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria, making opportunistic colonization less likely.

E) Abscess formation: This refers to the collection of pus in a tissue or organ, which can cause symptoms such as fever and cough. However, the patient is afebrile, and the presence of a radiopaque mass is not consistent with abscess formation.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a neoplastic transformation, which refers to the process of normal cells becoming cancerous.

722,"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?
Options
A) Arachnoid villi
B) Interventricular foramen
C) Median aperture
D) Lateral apertures
E) Cerebral aqueduct","To determine the cause of the isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle, we need to consider the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced in the choroid plexus of the ventricles and flows through the ventricular system, including the lateral ventricles, into the fourth ventricle, and then into the subarachnoid space through various apertures and foramina.

The isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle suggests that there is an obstruction to the normal flow of CSF. The most likely cause of this obstruction is a blockade of the foramen of Monro, which is also known as the interventricular foramen. This foramen connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle and allows CSF to flow from the lateral ventricles into the third ventricle.

If the foramen of Monro is blocked, CSF will accumulate in the lateral ventricle, causing it to dilate. This condition is known as hydrocephalus.

Therefore, the dilatation of the left lateral ventricle is most likely caused by blockade of the interventricular foramen, which is option {B}.

Endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options
A) Total hysterectomy
B) Estrogen vaginal cream
C) Reassurance and follow-up
D) Progestin therapy
E) Surgical endometrial ablation","The 55-year-old nulligravid woman presents with a 3-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than 5 pads per day. She has a history of hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is postmenopausal. The physical examination shows mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix, with the uterus and adnexa being nontender to palpation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm, and endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia.

Given the patient's postmenopausal status and the findings of mild vaginal atrophy, the most likely cause of her heavy vaginal bleeding is estrogen deficiency. The endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands, which is consistent with estrogen effect on the endometrium.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to address the estrogen deficiency. Among the options provided, estrogen vaginal cream is the most appropriate choice. Estrogen vaginal cream can help to alleviate vaginal atrophy and reduce heavy vaginal bleeding by promoting endometrial atrophy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to prescribe estrogen vaginal cream.

1209,"Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?
Options
A) A 15-month-old girl who has had repeated otitis media, pneumonia, and progressive clumsiness since beginning to walk in the past three months
B) A 10-month-old boy who has had recurrent viral infections as well as hypocalcemia during neonatal period
C) A 4-year-old girl who has had repeated oral candidasis in the past nine months
D) A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months
E) A 7-month-old boy who has had recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, eczema, and easy bruising in the past four months","Analyzing the options provided, Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence or near-absence of all classes of immunoglobulins (antibodies) due to a mutation in the BTK gene, which is essential for B-cell development and function. This condition leads to recurrent infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis.

Option A describes a 15-month-old girl with repeated otitis media, pneumonia, and progressive clumsiness since beginning to walk. While this patient has had recurrent infections, the clumsiness and progressive symptoms suggest a neurological component, which is not typical of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.

Option B describes a 10-month-old boy with recurrent viral infections as well as hypocalcemia during the neonatal period. Hypocalcemia is not a typical feature of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, and recurrent viral infections are less common in this condition.

Option C describes a 4-year-old girl with repeated oral candidiasis in the past nine months. While this patient has had recurrent infections, oral candidiasis is more commonly associated with T-cell immunodeficiencies rather than Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.

Option D describes a 9-month-old boy with recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months. This patient has had recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria, which is consistent with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.

Option E describes a 7-month-old boy with recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, eczema, and easy bruising in the past four months. While this patient has had recurrent infections, the presence of eczema and easy bruising suggests a possible T-cell immunodeficiency rather than Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.

Considering the options provided, the patient presentation most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is Option D, a 9-month-old boy with recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months.

1272,"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Social anxiety disorder
B) Avoidant personality disorder
C) Schizotypal personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Schizophrenia","To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 19-year-old man, let's analyze his symptoms and behavior.

The patient has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer, which may be a sign of his attempt to fit in with a particular group or subculture. However, this behavior, combined with his difficulties fitting in, lack of friends, and poor academic performance, suggests that he may be struggling with social anxiety or feelings of inadequacy.

The patient spends most of his time in his room playing online games and reading up on paranormal phenomena, which may be a coping mechanism for his social anxiety or feelings of isolation. His belief in the presence of demons and his interpretation of natural phenomena as signs of demonic presence may be indicative of a distorted thinking pattern, which is often seen in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder.

The patient's mental status examination shows laborious speech and avoidance of eye contact, which are also consistent with schizotypal personality disorder. This disorder is characterized by a pattern of eccentric behavior and anomalies of thinking and speech, which are not severe enough to meet the criteria for schizophrenia.

Considering the options provided:

A) Social anxiety disorder: This disorder is characterized by a fear of social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. While the patient may exhibit some social anxiety symptoms, his behavior and thinking patterns are more consistent with schizotypal personality disorder.

B) Avoidant personality disorder: This disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection. While the patient may exhibit some avoidant behavior, his thinking patterns and eccentric behavior are more consistent with schizotypal personality disorder.

C) Schizotypal personality disorder: This disorder is characterized by a pattern of eccentric behavior and anomalies of thinking and speech, which are not severe enough to meet the criteria for schizophrenia. The patient's symptoms, such as his belief in the presence of demons, his interpretation of natural phenomena as signs of demonic presence, and his laborious speech and avoidance of eye contact, are consistent with this diagnosis.

D) Paranoid personality disorder: This disorder is characterized by a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others. While the patient may exhibit some paranoid thinking, his behavior and thinking patterns are more consistent with schizotypal personality disorder.

E) Schizophrenia: This disorder is characterized by a break from reality, which includes delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and catatonic behavior. The patient's symptoms, while eccentric, do not meet the criteria for schizophrenia.

The most likely diagnosis is {C} Schizotypal personality disorder."
272,"A 22-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Fasting glucose 97 mg/L
ALT 12 IU/L
AST 14 IU/L
Total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 µmol/L)
Plasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 µmol/L)
Which of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?
Options
A) HbA1c measurement
B) No tests required
C) Urinalysis
D) Oral glucose tolerance test
E) Random plasma glucose","To determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results, we need to consider the patient's presentation and laboratory results.

The patient is a 22-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation, presenting with a 1+ glucose result on a dipstick test. She has no significant co-morbidities and an unremarkable pregnancy course. Her BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2, and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy.

The dipstick test result is likely a false positive, as the patient's fasting glucose level is 97 mg/L, which is within the normal range. The patient's symptoms of increased urination frequency and possibly increased liquid consumption could be related to the normal physiological changes of pregnancy, such as increased glomerular filtration rate and increased renal blood flow.

The laboratory tests show normal liver enzymes (ALT and AST), normal total bilirubin, and normal plasma creatinine levels. These results suggest that there is no underlying liver or kidney disease that could be contributing to the abnormal dipstick test result.

Given the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step is to perform a random plasma glucose test to confirm the dipstick test result and rule out gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). If the random plasma glucose test is normal, no further testing would be required.

The answer is {E}."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options
A) Aortic valve regurgitation
B) Tricuspid valve stenosis
C) Mitral valve prolapse
D) Mitral valve stenosis
E) Aortic valve stenosis","The patient is a 75-year-old man presenting with progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month. He reports that he cannot climb more than one flight of stairs without experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and a long history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. His physical examination shows weak peripheral pulses, and the cardiac examination is notable for a diastolic murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space.

Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic valve stenosis. Aortic valve stenosis is a condition where the aortic valve, which allows blood to flow from the left ventricle to the aorta, becomes narrowed. This narrowing can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the body, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. The diastolic murmur heard at the right second intercostal space is a characteristic finding of aortic valve stenosis.

The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia may have contributed to the development of aortic valve stenosis. Additionally, his long history of smoking may have also played a role in the development of this condition.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis is aortic valve stenosis, which is a condition where the aortic valve becomes narrowed, leading to a decrease in blood flow to the body and symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness.
