Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?
A) Renal artery stenosis
B) Benign prostatic hyperplasia
C) Diabetic nephropathy
D) Common iliac artery aneurysm
E) Urethral stricture","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>68-year-old male</fact1> comes to the physician for evaluation of <fact2>right flank pain</fact2>. He has a history of <fact3>diabetes</fact3> and <fact4>peripheral artery disease</fact4>. His <fact5>blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg</fact5>. Physical examination shows <fact6>abdominal tenderness</fact6> and <fact7>right flank tenderness</fact7>. An <fact8>ultrasound shows dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis</fact8>. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>right flank pain</fact2> with <fact5>high blood pressure</fact5> and a history of <fact3>diabetes</fact3> and <fact4>peripheral artery disease</fact4> is suggestive of a vascular cause for the dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. The presence of <fact6>abdominal tenderness</fact6> and <fact7>right flank tenderness</fact7> on physical examination further supports this possibility. Among the options provided, <fact9>renal artery stenosis</fact9> is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition, as it is a common cause of renovascular hypertension and can lead to secondary complications such as ureteral dilation."
1004,"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss of 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the last 4 months. She has recently avoided drinking alcohol and eating spicy food because it worsens her diarrhea and causes episodes of heart palpitations and reddening of the face and neck. She takes lisinopril for hypertension. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 149/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show an increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration. Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show which of the following?
A) Proximal muscle wasting
B) Achlorhydria
C) Adrenal medullary mass
D) Multiple peptic ulcers
E) Pulmonic valve stenosis","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>45-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the physician because of <fact2>fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss of 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the last 4 months</fact2>.

C) <fact12>Adrenal medullary mass</fact12>
D) <fact13>Multiple peptic ulcers</fact13>
E) <fact14>Pulmonic valve stenosis</fact14>

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss of 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the last 4 months</fact2> is suggestive of a gastrointestinal issue. The avoidance of <fact3>drinking alcohol and eating spicy food</fact3> because it worsens her diarrhea and causes episodes of <fact3>heart palpitations and reddening of the face and neck</fact3> points towards a condition that is exacerbated by certain triggers. The laboratory finding of an <fact9>increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration</fact9> is indicative of a condition involving the breakdown of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is also involved in the regulation of bowel movements. This pattern is consistent with carcinoid syndrome, a condition caused by a carcinoid tumor secreting serotonin. The tumor can be located in the gastrointestinal tract, and the symptoms can include <fact2>fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss</fact2>. The increased serotonin can also cause flushing, which is consistent with the patient's <fact3>reddening of the face and neck</fact3>. Proximal muscle wasting is a common finding in carcinoid syndrome due to the serotonin's effect on the muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

859,"A 27-year-old female presents to her physician with a palpable thyroid nodule. Iodine uptake testing shows that the nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared with the rest of the thyroid gland. A fine-needle aspiration is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a neoplasm of the thyroid. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?
A) Papillary carcinoma
B) Medullary carcinoma
C) Follicular carcinoma
D) Anaplastic carcinoma
E) Hurthle cell carcinoma","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>27-year-old female</fact1> presents to her physician with a <fact2>palpable thyroid nodule</fact2>. <fact3>Iodine uptake testing</fact3> shows that the nodule has <fact4>decreased iodine uptake</fact4> compared with the rest of the <fact5>thyroid gland</fact5>. A <fact6>fine-needle aspiration</fact6> is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a <fact7>neoplasm of the thyroid</fact7>. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>27-year-old female</fact1> has a <fact2>palpable thyroid nodule</fact2> with <fact4>decreased iodine uptake</fact4> compared with the rest of the <fact5>thyroid gland</fact5>. This finding is characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which originates from the parafollicular cells (also known as C cells) of the thyroid gland. These cells are responsible for producing calcitonin, which is involved in calcium homeostasis. MTC is known to have decreased iodine uptake due to its origin from C cells, which do not take up iodine. The diagnosis of MTC is further supported by the presence of a <fact7>neoplasm of the thyroid</fact7> as confirmed by <fact6>fine-needle aspiration</fact6>. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is <fact8>medullary carcinoma</fact8>."
802,"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, breast tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and intermittent nausea for 2 weeks. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago.

A <fact6>urine pregnancy test is positive</fact6>. The child is at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?

Answer: The child is at greatest risk of developing <fact7>sensorineural hearing loss</fact7>. This is because the mother's use of carbamazepine, a medication used to treat seizure disorders, is a known teratogen that can cause congenital malformations, including sensorineural hearing loss. This condition is a result of the drug's effect on fetal development, particularly during the critical period of organogenesis."
1045,"A 4-year-old boy presents to the pediatrician’s office. His mother complains that he has been sleeping poorly, and she has noticed that he often scratches his perianal area. A scotch tape test is found to be positive and mebendazole is prescribed. Into which of the following subsets have the naïve T cells (TH0) developed due to the infection in this patient?
A) TH1 cells
B) TH2 cells
C) TH17
D) T0 cells
E) TREGS","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>4-year-old boy</fact1> presents to the pediatrician’s office.

Into which of the following subsets have the naïve T cells (TH0) developed due to the <fact5>infection in this patient</fact5>?

Answer: Considering the <fact1>4-year-old boy</fact1> has a positive <fact3>scotch tape test</fact3> and is prescribed <fact4>mebendazole</fact4>, it is likely that he has an infection caused by Enterobius vermicularis, also known as pinworms. The presence of pinworms leads to an allergic reaction and the development of a Th2 response, which is characterized by the production of IgE antibodies and the activation of eosinophils. The Th2 response is associated with the development of TH2 cells. Therefore, the answer is {B}."
999,"A 72-year-old woman with a 40 pack-year history of smoking presents to your office with jaundice. After a thorough workup, you determine that the patient has pancreatic cancer. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial statement to inform the patient of her condition?
A) ""Have you ever heard of pancreatic cancer?""
B) ""I have bad news I need to share with you. Please sit down so we can discuss.""
C) ""Have you designated a healthcare proxy?""
D) ""We just received your test results and we have bad news to share with you. The resident will be in to explain the diagnosis to you.""
E) ""Your test results are consistent with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.""","Reformatted Question: A 72-year-old woman with a 40 pack-year history of smoking presents to your office with jaundice. After a thorough workup, you determine that the patient has pancreatic cancer. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial statement to inform the patient of her condition?

Answer: The most appropriate initial statement to inform the patient of her condition is option {B}. This is because it is essential to break the news in a compassionate and empathetic manner, which is reflected in option {B}. The phrase ""I have bad news I need to share with you. Please sit down so we can discuss"" acknowledges the gravity of the situation and provides a supportive environment for the patient to receive the news. This approach helps to establish trust and sets the tone for a sensitive and empathetic conversation. Options {A}, {C}, and {D} are not suitable as initial statements because they either ask unnecessary questions, fail to acknowledge the gravity of the situation, or involve a third party (the resident) in the initial conversation. Option {E} provides a factual statement but lacks the emotional support and empathy that is crucial in this situation. Therefore, the most appropriate initial statement to inform the patient of her condition is {B}."

Answer: The patient's DEXA scan result shows a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip, which is indicative of osteoporosis. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the primary treatment for osteoporosis is pharmacotherapy (1). Among the options provided, Alendronate is a bisphosphonate, which is a first-line treatment for osteoporosis (2). It has been shown to increase bone mineral density and reduce the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (3). Therefore, the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy is to prescribe Alendronate.

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>abdominal pain</fact2> with <fact7>3 episodes of watery diarrhea</fact7> within <fact5>2 to 3 hours</fact5> of consuming food at a barbecue suggests a foodborne illness. The lack of <fact14>blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT)</fact14> and absence of <fact13>rebounding or guarding</fact13> on abdominal exam make conditions like appendicitis or a perforated ulcer less likely. The fact that the patient consumed food from a <fact4>buffet without refrigeration</fact4> increases the risk of foodborne illness from bacteria that can multiply rapidly at room temperature. Among the options provided, <fact3>Staphylococcus aureus</fact3> is a common cause of foodborne illness that can cause symptoms within a short time frame (typically 1-6 hours) and is often associated with contaminated food that has been left at room temperature for an extended period. This matches the patient's presentation, making <fact3>Staphylococcus aureus</fact3> the most likely cause of this patient's presentation. Therefore, the answer is {C}."
925,"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of left knee pain as well as stiffness upon waking for about 10–15 minutes.

Which of the following is the most likely finding on <fact31>imaging of the left knee</fact31>?

Answer: 
A) <fact32>Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray</fact32>

Explanation: 
The patient is a <fact1>58-year-old woman</fact1> with a <fact2>3-month history of left knee pain</fact2> and <fact3>stiffness upon waking</fact3>. The <fact4>pain is worse after standing a lot at work</fact4> and when she <fact5>climbs stairs</fact5>, which are classic symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). The patient's <fact7>hypercholesterolemia</fact7> and <fact8>hypertension</fact8> are not directly related to her knee pain, but her <fact9>mother died of metastatic breast cancer</fact9> at the age of <fact10>65 years</fact10> may suggest a possible genetic predisposition to OA. The patient's <fact21>BMI of 31.8 kg/m2</fact21> is in the obese range, which is a risk factor for OA. The examination of the <fact25>left knee</fact25> shows <fact26>tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line</fact26>, <fact27>crepitus</fact27>, and <fact28>pain with full flexion and extension</fact28>, all of which are consistent with OA. The <fact29>serum uric acid concentration of 8.0 mg/dL</fact29> is slightly elevated, but not high enough to suggest gout. The <fact30>erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 15 mm/h</fact30> is within the normal range, which makes an inflammatory cause of her knee pain less likely. Given these factors, the most likely finding on <fact31>imaging of the left knee</fact31> is <fact32>osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray</fact32>, which is characteristic of OA."

A <fact1>47-year-old woman</fact1> presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of her right hand. Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a <fact2>laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints</fact2>.

She has also had <fact4>pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years</fact4> and reports that this pain is <fact5>worse in the morning but improves over the day</fact5>. The cells that are present in this patient's <fact6>DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared</fact6>. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?

Answer: 
Given the information in the question, the patient has a <fact2>laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints</fact2> and <fact4>pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years</fact4>. The presence of <fact3>red and swollen</fact3> DIP joints and chronic pain in the PIP and MCP joints suggest an inflammatory process. The patient's symptoms are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints. In RA, the DIP joints are typically spared, and the PIP and MCP joints are more commonly affected. When analyzing the cells present in the DIP and PIP joints, it is likely that the PIP joints would have more neutrophils and monocytes due to the chronic inflammation associated with RA. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}.

Note: Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the acute inflammatory response, while monocytes are another type of white blood cell that matures into macrophages, which are involved in the chronic inflammatory response. In RA, the PIP and MCP joints are more likely to have an increased number of neutrophils and monocytes due to the chronic inflammation."

An <fact10>S4 is present</fact10>. What is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: Considering the <fact1>23-year-old man's</fact1> sudden loss of consciousness while <fact3>pitching in a baseball game</fact3>, it is essential to evaluate for potential cardiac causes. The presence of a <fact7>prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse</fact7> suggests increased pressure in the right atrium, which is often seen in conditions that cause obstruction to the outflow of blood from the left ventricle. The <fact8>double apical impulse</fact8> is also indicative of a condition that affects the left ventricle. Among the provided options, <fact6>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</fact6> is a condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to obstruction of blood flow and sudden loss of consciousness. The absence of <fact9>audible murmurs</fact9> does not rule out hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as the murmur may be absent or soft. The presence of an <fact10>S4</fact10> is also consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is <fact2>hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</fact2>."
1173,"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
A) Vaginal exam under anesthesia
B) Report to child protective services
C) Vaginal culture
D) Warm water irrigation of the vagina

Answer: Given the neonate's presentation with <fact2>vaginal discharge</fact2> and the absence of <fact17>bruises or marks on her skin</fact17>, the most likely diagnosis is congenital syphilis, which is a known complication of untreated maternal syphilis. However, the mother had a negative <fact10>test of cure</fact10> after being treated for <fact9>chlamydia in the first trimester</fact9>, and there is no mention of syphilis testing during pregnancy.

1126,"A 15-year-old female presents to her pediatrician’s office for severe menstrual cramping. The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being “really heavy” and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes.

Which of the following is the best next step for this patient’s <fact21>menstrual cramps</fact21>?

Answer: D) NSAIDs

Explanation: The patient is experiencing <fact2>severe menstrual cramping</fact2> that has been ongoing for several years, despite using <fact8>heating pads with limited relief</fact8>. Given her age and symptoms, it is likely that she is experiencing primary dysmenorrhea, a common condition characterized by painful menstrual cramps. The best next step in management would be to initiate treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, which are effective in reducing menstrual cramp pain [1]. This is supported by the fact that the patient's cramps are <fact6>intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen</fact6>, which is consistent with primary dysmenorrhea [2]. Additionally, the patient's mother has <fact16>endometriosis and heavy periods</fact16>, which may indicate a genetic predisposition to menstrual disorders, but this does not change the initial management approach [3].

Answer: E) Increased adenylate cyclase activity

Explanation: The child is started on a <fact14>nebulized bronchodilator</fact14>, which is a medication used to treat asthma symptoms. The medication most likely used in this scenario is a beta-2 agonist, such as albuterol, which works by stimulating the beta-2 receptors in the lungs. This stimulation leads to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which in turn activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to an increase in adenylate cyclase activity. This downstream effect of the medication helps to relax the smooth muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation and relief of asthma symptoms."

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?

Answer: D) Iron supplementation

Explanation: The patient presents with <fact2>fatigue for several weeks</fact2> and <fact3>low energy</fact3>, which are indicative of anemia. The laboratory results show a <fact10>low hemoglobin level</fact10> of 11.5 g/dL, a <fact11>mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 μm3</fact11>, which is below the normal range, and a <fact13>red cell distribution width (RDW) of 18%</fact13>, which is elevated. These findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The patient's <fact4>academic performance has declined recently</fact4> and <fact7>conjunctival pallor</fact7> further support this diagnosis. The patient's diet, consisting mainly of <fact9>bows of cereal</fact9>, is likely deficient in iron. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is iron supplementation."

Answer: E) Elevated serum creatine kinase

The patient's presentation suggests a severe overdose of opioids and cocaine, which can lead to rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue and the release of muscle fibers into the bloodstream. This can cause a significant increase in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. The patient's symptoms, including <fact7>blood coming from the mouth</fact7> and <fact8>tea-colored urine</fact8>, are consistent with rhabdomyolysis. The presence of <fact5>track marks on his forearms</fact5> and <fact17>positive urine toxicology for opiates and cocaine</fact17> further support the diagnosis of an overdose.

797,"While traveling abroad a physician is asked to attend a meeting regarding healthcare in the region. The rate of chlamydial infection is exceptionally high in the area, and the local government is wanting to test a new treatment for these infections. To test the new therapy, the physician is asked to oversee the operations of testing this new treatment. When asking what this would entail, the officials tell the physician that they plan to infect the local prison population with chlamydia and then test the new treatment on these individuals. Which of the following is the best response from the physician?
A) “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of autonomy.”
B) “I will accept your proposal.”
C) “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of justice.”
D) “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.”
E) “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of beneficence.”","Reformatted Question: A physician is asked to oversee the testing of a new treatment for chlamydial infections on the local prison population, which will be infected with chlamydia. Which of the following is the best response from the physician?

Answer: The best response from the physician is {A}.

Explanation: The physician should not assist in infecting the local prison population with chlamydia, as this would be a violation of the principle of autonomy. The principle of autonomy states that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and health. Infecting individuals with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) without their consent would be a clear violation of this principle. The physician should instead advocate for the use of existing ethical methods for testing the new treatment, such as using informed consent from volunteers or using animal models. The physician should not assist in the infection of the prison population, as this would be a violation of their autonomy and would also be unethical. 

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option B is incorrect because assisting in the infection of the prison population would be a violation of the principle of autonomy.
* Option C is incorrect because the principle of justice is not directly relevant to this situation. While the principle of justice does require that individuals be treated fairly and without bias, the issue here is the violation of autonomy and the potential harm to the individuals being infected.
* Option D is incorrect because the principle of nonmaleficence (do no harm) is relevant, but the primary concern here is the violation of autonomy.
* Option E is incorrect because the principle of beneficence (do good) is not directly relevant to this situation. While the goal of testing the new treatment may be to benefit society, the means of doing so should not involve violating the autonomy of individuals."

Four months ago, he was diagnosed with <fact5>Parkinson disease</fact5> and treatment was initiated. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient?

Answer: The patient's <fact1>51-year-old man</fact1> presentation of <fact2>abnormal behavior</fact2>, specifically being <fact3>preoccupied with gambling at the local casino</fact3> and becoming <fact4>restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling</fact4>, is indicative of impulse control disorders, which are a known side effect of certain medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. The most likely cause of this behavior is the use of dopamine agonists, which can stimulate the brain's reward system and lead to addictive behaviors. Dopamine agonists work by <fact5>direct activation of dopamine receptors</fact5>, mimicking the action of dopamine in the brain. This is in contrast to other medications used to treat Parkinson's disease, such as levodopa, which relies on <fact6>peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase</fact6> to increase dopamine levels in the brain.

The <fact10>physician suspects that one of the patient's medications may be the culprit for these symptoms</fact10>. Which of the following medications is NOT likely to be the cause?

Answer: Bromocriptine.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of <fact5>abnormal discharge from both nipples</fact5> and <fact9>diminished sexual drive</fact9> are suggestive of hyperprolactinemia, a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin. Among the provided options, <fact3>metoclopramide</fact3> (A), <fact3>haloperidol</fact3> (B), <fact3>fluphenazine</fact3> (D), and <fact3>risperidone</fact3> (E) are all known to cause hyperprolactinemia as a side effect. This is because they can block dopamine receptors in the pituitary gland, leading to an increase in prolactin secretion. On the other hand, <fact3>bromocriptine</fact3> (C) is a dopamine agonist that actually decreases prolactin levels. Therefore, it is NOT likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms."

Answer: 
Considering the <fact1>46-year-old woman's</fact1> symptoms of <fact2>3-day history of diarrhea</fact2>, <fact3>moderate abdominal pain</fact3>, and <fact4>weakness</fact4> that began on the return flight from a <fact5>2-week yoga retreat in India</fact5>, it is essential to evaluate the potential causes of her symptoms in the context of her travel history.

The <fact9>1-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease</fact9> and <fact10>allergy to shellfish</fact10> are less relevant to the current symptoms. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a bacterial or viral infection, but given the context of travel and foodborne illness, a bacterial pathogen is more likely. Among the options provided, <fact8>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)</fact8> is a common cause of foodborne illness, particularly in travelers to developing countries. ETEC produces toxins that cause diarrhea and vomiting, and it is often associated with contaminated food and water. The answer is {E}."

The physical examination shows a <fact10>0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule</fact10> that retracts when squeezed. These characteristics are most consistent with a dermatofibroma, which is a type of skin growth that typically presents as a small, firm, and hyperpigmented lesion that can be painful when pressed or squeezed. The retraction of the surface when squeezed is a characteristic feature of dermatofibroma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {B}."
708,"A 47-year-old woman presents to a physician for evaluation of vomiting and diarrhea for 2 days. Her symptoms began following a company picnic a few days ago. Initially, she was unable to tolerate any solids or liquids by mouth, but now has been able to drink sips of water. She had a mild headache, which was relieved with acetaminophen. The past medical history is unremarkable. She does not take any medications. The blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg and the heart rate is 60/min. On examination, the mucous membranes are dry and the eyes are slightly sunken. Where is most of the sodium reabsorbed in this patient’s kidneys?
A) Collecting duct
B) Distal tubule
C) Descending limb of loop of Henle
D) Proximal tubule
E) Ascending limb of loop of Henle","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>47-year-old woman</fact1> presents to a physician for evaluation of <fact2>vomiting and diarrhea</fact2> for <fact3>2 days</fact3>. Her symptoms began following a <fact4>company picnic a few days ago</fact4>. Initially, she was unable to tolerate any <fact5>solids or liquids by mouth</fact5>, but now has been able to drink <fact6>sips of water</fact6>. She had a <fact7>mild headache</fact7>, which was relieved with <fact8>acetaminophen</fact8>. The <fact9>past medical history is unremarkable</fact9>. She does not take any <fact10>medications</fact10>. The <fact11>blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg</fact11> and the <fact12>heart rate is 60/min</fact12>. On examination, the <fact13>mucous membranes are dry</fact13> and the <fact14>eyes are slightly sunken</fact14>. Where is most of the <fact15>sodium reabsorbed in this patient’s kidneys</fact15>?

Answer: Considering the patient's symptoms of <fact2>vomiting and diarrhea</fact2> for <fact3>2 days</fact3>, it is likely that she has experienced significant fluid and electrolyte loss. The inability to tolerate <fact5>solids or liquids by mouth</fact5> initially, but now being able to drink <fact6>sips of water</fact6>, indicates that she is trying to rehydrate. The presence of <fact13>dry mucous membranes</fact13> and <fact14>slightly sunken eyes</fact14> further supports the notion of dehydration. The kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance, and sodium reabsorption is a critical aspect of this process. In the kidneys, most of the sodium reabsorption occurs in the <fact16>proximal tubule</fact16>. The <fact17>proximal tubule</fact17> is responsible for reabsorbing approximately 65-70% of the filtered sodium load, which is a critical step in maintaining electrolyte balance and preventing excessive loss of sodium in the urine. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."

Administration of which of the following is most appropriate at this time?
A) Anti-A IgG
B) Anti-D IgG
C) Anti-B IgG
D) Anti-D IgM
E) Anti-A IgM","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>23-year-old woman</fact1>, <fact2>gravida 2, para 1</fact2>, at <fact3>28 weeks' gestation</fact3> comes to the physician for a routine prenatal examination. Her previous pregnancy was <fact4>uncomplicated</fact4> and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Her <fact5>blood group is A, Rh-negative</fact5>. The father's <fact6>blood group is B, Rh-positive</fact6>. Administration of which of the following is most appropriate at this time?

Answer: B) Anti-D IgG

Explanation: The patient is a <fact1>23-year-old woman</fact1> with a <fact2>gravida 2, para 1</fact2> status, indicating she has been pregnant twice and has given birth once. She is currently at <fact3>28 weeks' gestation</fact3> and has a <fact5>blood group of A, Rh-negative</fact5>. Her previous pregnancy was <fact4>uncomplicated</fact4>, and she gave birth to a healthy boy. The father's <fact6>blood group is B, Rh-positive</fact6>, indicating that he has an Rh-positive blood type. Given her Rh-negative status and the father's Rh-positive status, she is at risk for Rh sensitization if she is exposed to Rh-positive fetal blood cells during pregnancy. The administration of <fact7>Anti-D IgG</fact7> is a common practice in preventing Rh sensitization in Rh-negative pregnant women carrying an Rh-positive fetus. This immunoglobulin binds to and inactivates any Rh-positive fetal red blood cells that may enter the maternal circulation, thereby preventing the formation of antibodies against Rh-positive blood cells."
355,"A 35-year-old man returns to the clinic to follow up for his chronic stomach pain. At the last visit a few months ago, he explained that he had been experiencing discomfort in his upper abdomen for awhile. He had never vomited up any blood and had not had any substantial weight loss. He did not take any medications, did not smoke, and had no family history of gastric cancer. At that time, the doctor empirically started him on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Today, despite the PPI, the patient says he is still experiencing discomfort. Hearing this, the doctor decides to order a urease breath test. What is the most likely cause of this patient's chronic stomach pain?
A) Gastric neoplasm
B) Gastroesophgeal sphincter dysfunction
C) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

What is the most likely cause of this patient's <fact13>chronic stomach pain</fact13>?

Answer: The patient is a <fact1>35-year-old man</fact1> with <fact2>chronic stomach pain</fact2> that has not improved with <fact10>proton pump inhibitor (PPI)</fact10> treatment. The <fact3>discomfort in his upper abdomen</fact3> for a while, without <fact4>blood vomiting</fact4> or <fact5>substantial weight loss</fact5>, suggests a possible gastrointestinal infection. The doctor's decision to order a <fact12>urease breath test</fact12> is indicative of a suspected <fact14>H. pylori</fact14> infection, which is a common cause of chronic stomach pain. The <fact14>H. pylori</fact14> infection is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause peptic ulcers and gastritis. The <fact12>urease breath test</fact12> is a diagnostic tool used to detect the presence of <fact14>H. pylori</fact14> in the stomach. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's <fact13>chronic stomach pain</fact13> is <fact14>Heliobacter pylori infection</fact14>. The answer is {D}."

A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?
A) Using survival rates in the analysis
B) Using mortality rates in the analysis
C) Analyzing the results by age of diagnosis
D) Increasing the number of screened individuals

Relevant Key Phrases: 
- survival rates
- mortality rates
- age of diagnosis
- number of screened individuals
- bias in conclusions

Answer: The correct answer is {C} Analyzing the results by age of diagnosis.

Explanation: In this scenario, the study is an observational case-control study, and the results are likely biased due to the fact that patients who decline medical and surgical treatment are more likely to have advanced disease, which would affect their survival rates. Analyzing the results by age of diagnosis can help to account for this bias, as it allows researchers to compare the survival rates of patients who were diagnosed at the same age, regardless of whether they were screened or not. This can help to determine whether the screening test is actually responsible for the improved survival rates, or if other factors are at play."

Approx. 1 month ago, he had a radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and several rounds of chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer in Nicaragua and was discharged from the hospital with a suprapelvic catheter and a plan for more chemotherapy. He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?
A) Renal biopsy
B) Ultrasound
C) Abdominal-pelvic CT scan
D) Blood analysis
E) Urine analysis","Reformatted Question:

The treatment team concludes this patient has <fact12>urinary tract obstruction</fact12>. What is the best method to evaluate <fact12>urinary tract obstruction</fact12> in this patient?

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation with <fact10>no urine output over 24 hours</fact10> and <fact11>thick green-white puss</fact11> from the catheter tube, it is essential to evaluate the urinary tract obstruction. The best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient is <fact13>ultrasound</fact13>. 

This is because the patient has a <fact9>cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter</fact9>, which indicates that the urinary tract obstruction is likely related to the catheter or the surrounding tissues. Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide valuable information about the urinary tract, including the location and severity of the obstruction. It can also help identify any complications such as <fact11>thick green-white puss</fact11> or <fact7>tachycardia</fact7>. 

Furthermore, ultrasound is a safe and effective method for evaluating urinary tract obstruction in patients with <fact6>cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head</fact6>, as it does not require sedation or other invasive procedures. 

In contrast, <fact14>renal biopsy</fact14> is an invasive procedure that carries a risk of bleeding and infection, and is not typically used to evaluate urinary tract obstruction. <fact15>Abdominal-pelvic CT scan</fact15> is a more detailed imaging modality that can provide information about the urinary tract, but it is not necessary in this case as the patient's presentation is consistent with urinary tract obstruction. <fact16>Blood analysis</fact16> and <fact17>urine analysis</fact17> can provide information about the patient's overall health and the presence of infection, but they are not the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction."

One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation and progression of symptoms indicate a severe and life-threatening condition. The key findings include <fact3>unconsciousness</fact3>, <fact4>low blood pressure</fact5>, <fact6>irregular pulse</fact6>, <fact10>increased jugular venous pressure</fact10>, <fact11>bilateral crackles at the lung bases</fact11>, and <fact16>absent p-waves on the electrocardiogram</fact16>. These symptoms are consistent with cardiac tamponade, a condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, compressing the heart and impeding its ability to pump blood effectively. The absence of <fact12>murmurs, rubs, or gallops</fact12> on cardiac examination and the <fact13>soft abdomen</fact13> suggest that the primary issue is not with the heart valves or the abdominal organs, respectively. The <fact15>negative FAST</fact15> also rules out free fluid in the abdominal cavity, which could be indicative of a hemorrhage. The administration of <fact20>vasopressors</fact20> to support blood pressure further supports the diagnosis of a cardiac-related issue. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade."

Answer: The patient's presentation, including <fact10>unresponsiveness</fact10>, <fact11>petechial rash</fact11>, and <fact12>neck rigidity</fact12>, is highly suggestive of meningitis, a severe infection of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The <fact3>running nose</fact3> for the past few days, followed by rapid deterioration, could be indicative of a viral or bacterial infection progressing to meningitis. Given the patient's <fact5>vaccination records</fact5> are up to date, the likelihood of a vaccine-preventable disease causing meningitis is low. Among the options provided, <fact4>adrenocortical insufficiency</fact4> (D) is not directly related to meningitis. The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation or the scenario described. However, one option is related to the patient's low blood pressure. The patient's <fact7>low blood pressure</fact7> could be related to <fact4>adrenocortical insufficiency</fact4> (D) due to the fact that the patient is <fact10>unresponsive</fact10> and has a <fact11>petechial rash</fact11> and <fact12>neck rigidity</fact12> which can be indicative of severe infection and adrenal insufficiency."

Relevant Key Phrases: 
1. <fact2>blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL</fact2>
2. <fact4>C-peptide level was found to be decreased</fact4>
3. <fact5>family history of diabetes in her mother</fact5>
4. <fact6>difficult divorce over the past few months</fact6>

Answer:
The patient's <fact2>blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL</fact2> indicates hypoglycemia, which is further supported by the patient's return to baseline after glucose replacement. The decreased <fact4>C-peptide level</fact4> suggests that the hypoglycemia was not caused by an excess of insulin production, as seen in insulinomas. The patient's <fact5>family history of diabetes in her mother</fact5> is not directly relevant to the patient's acute presentation of hypoglycemia. However, the patient's <fact6>difficult divorce over the past few months</fact6> is a significant stressor that could lead to factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome. In factitious disorder, an individual fabricates or induces illness in themselves for attention and sympathy. The patient's presentation of hypoglycemia, which was not caused by an underlying medical condition, and the absence of any significant past medical history, suggest that the patient may have fabricated her illness. Therefore, the likely cause of this patient's condition is <fact7>factitious disorder</fact7>."

Answer: Based on the patient's presentation of <fact2>shortness of breath and cough of sudden onset</fact2> with <fact5>bipedal edema</fact5> and <fact6>jugular venous distention (JVD)</fact6>, it is likely that the patient is experiencing acute heart failure. The lab values show a slightly elevated <fact15>creatinine level</fact15> and a <fact14>glucose level of 120 mg/dL</fact14>, which is slightly elevated but not indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient's symptoms improved rapidly with <fact8>BIPAP and medical therapy</fact8>, which is consistent with treatment for acute heart failure. 

Given the patient's presentation and lab values, the best explanation for this patient's current presentation is <fact3>type II diabetes</fact3> with possible acute heart failure. However, there is no clear indication of renal tubular acidosis in the lab values provided. The patient's serum bicarbonate level is slightly elevated at <fact12>31 mEq/L</fact12>, which is not indicative of renal tubular acidosis type I or II. The patient's serum calcium level is slightly elevated at <fact16>10.9 mg/dL</fact16>, but there is no clear indication of renal tubular acidosis type IV. Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's current presentation is not clearly related to renal tubular acidosis.

However, the patient's presentation and lab values are most consistent with the effects of <fact4>lisinopril</fact4> and <fact8>BIPAP and medical therapy</fact8> for acute heart failure. The patient's symptoms improved rapidly with this treatment, and the lab values show no clear indication of renal tubular acidosis."

Answer: Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>gross hematuria</fact2> and <fact3>acute, colicky flank pain</fact3>, it is essential to evaluate for potential causes of these symptoms. The patient's history of taking high doses of <fact4>acetaminophen</fact4> and <fact5>aspirin</fact5> over several weeks due to <fact6>persistent upper back pain</fact6> is a significant factor. Acetaminophen and aspirin are both known to cause renal damage, particularly in individuals who take high doses for extended periods. The presence of <fact9>proteinuria</fact9> further supports renal involvement. The absence of <fact10>palpable flank masses</fact10> on physical examination makes conditions such as kidney stones or a kidney mass less likely. Among the provided options, <fact11>papillary necrosis</fact11> is a condition that can be caused by long-term use of analgesics, leading to renal damage and symptoms such as <fact2>gross hematuria</fact2> and <fact3>acute, colicky flank pain</fact3>.

Laboratory results are significant for the following: <fact22>Hb 6.1 g/dL</fact22>, <fact23>MCV 109 fL</fact23>, <fact24>Platelets 90,0000/mm3</fact24>, <fact25>Total count 3,000/mm3</fact25>, <fact26>Reticulocyte count 0.8%</fact26>. A <fact27>peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils</fact27>. <fact28>Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are negative</fact28>. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?

Answer: The patient's presentation, including <fact2>repeated falls</fact2>, <fact3>postural dizziness</fact3>, <fact4>progressive fatigue</fact4>, <fact5>generalized weakness</fact5>, and <fact6>weight loss</fact6>, along with <fact27>hypersegmented neutrophils</fact27> on the <fact27>peripheral blood smear</fact27>, suggests a megaloblastic anemia. The patient's <fact7>vegetarian diet</fact7> increases the likelihood of a vitamin B12 deficiency, as vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products. However, the presence of <fact28>negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies</fact28> makes pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disorder that causes a vitamin B12 deficiency due to the destruction of intrinsic factor, less likely. The patient's <fact9>significant behavioral changes</fact9> and <fact21>unstable, wide-based ataxic gait</fact21> also suggest a vitamin B12 deficiency, as this vitamin is essential for the synthesis of myelin and the maintenance of the nervous system. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient’s condition is a vitamin B12 deficiency."

Answer: 
Considering the <fact1>62-year-old woman</fact1> is coming in for a <fact2>routine health maintenance examination</fact2>, it's essential to assess her risk factors for various diseases and implement preventive measures accordingly. Given her family history of <fact11>myocardial infarction</fact11> at a relatively young age, her <fact14>smoking history</fact14>, and her <fact15>alcohol consumption</fact15>, she is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Her <fact17>medications</fact17> include <fact18>enalapril</fact18> and <fact19>low-dose aspirin</fact19>, which are commonly used to manage hypertension and prevent cardiovascular events. However, given her smoking history, a more aggressive approach to cardiovascular risk reduction may be warranted. Among the options provided, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a <fact20>low-dose chest CT</fact20> to screen for lung cancer, which is a common cause of cancer-related mortality, particularly in smokers. Additionally, given her family history of myocardial infarction, a <fact20>low-dose chest CT</fact20> may also provide valuable information about her cardiovascular health. The answer is {D}."

Answer: Based on the patient's symptoms of <fact2>difficulty falling asleep</fact2>, <fact4>discomfort in her legs when lying down at night</fact4>, and <fact8>anxiety</fact8>, along with a family history of similar symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is restless leg syndrome (RLS). The patient's symptoms are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for RLS, which include an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, and symptoms that worsen in the evening or at night and improve with movement. The patient's use of <fact5>diphenhydramine</fact5>, which worsened her symptoms, suggests that she may have been experiencing rebound insomnia. Among the options provided, <fact9>pramipexole</fact9> is a dopamine agonist that is commonly used to treat RLS. It is a dopamine agonist that works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, which helps to reduce the urge to move the legs and alleviate uncomfortable sensations. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is <fact10>pramipexole</fact10>."

Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?

Answer: 
Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, such as <fact9>mild respiratory distress</fact9>, <fact10>distended neck veins</fact10>, <fact11>bilateral pitting edema</fact11>, <fact12>increased respiratory rate</fact12>, <fact13>low SpO2</fact13>, <fact15>loud P2 component of the second heart sound</fact15>, and <fact16>S3 gallop rhythm</fact16>, the patient likely has congestive heart failure (CHF). The medication prescribed for CHF often includes diuretics, which increase urine production to reduce fluid overload. However, the question mentions that the medication changes the cardiac physiology, as depicted by the dashed line recorded post-medication. This suggests that the medication may be a positive inotrope or a vasodilator, which can change the cardiac physiology by affecting contractility or vascular resistance.

Considering the options provided:

A) Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential - This is not the primary mechanism of action for medications prescribed for CHF.

B) Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient - This is related to the mechanism of action of digitalis, which is not typically used as a first-line treatment for CHF.

C) Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels - This is the mechanism of action of nitrates, which can be used to reduce preload and decrease pulmonary congestion in CHF.

D) Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption - This is the mechanism of action of spironolactone, which is a potassium-sparing diuretic used in CHF.

E) Reduction in myocardial contractility - This is not the primary mechanism of action for medications prescribed for CHF.

Based on the information provided, the most likely mechanism of action of the prescribed medication is related to reducing preload and decreasing pulmonary congestion, which is consistent with option C) Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels.

Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?

Answer: The question describes a disorder characterized by severe lip lacerations, tongue biting, and missing fingers, with a family history of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. This pattern of inheritance is suggestive of an X-linked recessive disorder. In X-linked recessive disorders, the mutated gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome and is typically inherited by males, who have only one X chromosome. Females, who have two X chromosomes, are typically carriers of the mutated gene and may exhibit milder symptoms or be asymptomatic. The fact that the affected individuals are male cousins on the mother's side supports the X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

The <fact4>plasma clearance</fact4> of the drug is calculated as <fact5>15.0 L/h</fact5>. Oral <fact6>bioavailability</fact6> of the drug is <fact7>75%</fact7>. Sensitivity analysis of a <fact8>sputum culture</fact8> shows a <fact9>minimal inhibitory concentration</fact9> of <fact10>1 μg/mL</fact10> for the <fact11>causative pathogen</fact11>. The <fact12>target plasma concentration</fact12> is <fact13>2 mg/L</fact13>. If the drug is administered <fact14>twice per day</fact14>, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a <fact15>steady state</fact15>?

Answer: 
To determine the required dosage, we need to calculate the total daily dose and then divide it by the number of doses administered per day. The formula for calculating the required dose is:

Total Daily Dose = (Target Plasma Concentration x Volume of Distribution) / Clearance

However, since the volume of distribution is not provided, we can use the formula:

Total Daily Dose = (Target Plasma Concentration x Bioavailability) / Clearance

Given values are:
- Target Plasma Concentration = 2 mg/L
- Bioavailability = 75% or 0.75
- Clearance = 15.0 L/h

Plugging in the values, we get:

Total Daily Dose = (2 mg/L x 0.75) / 15.0 L/h
Total Daily Dose = 1.5 mg/L x 0.75 / 15.0 L/h
Total Daily Dose = 1.125 mg/L / 15.0 L/h
Total Daily Dose = 0.075 mg/L/h

Since the total daily dose is 0.075 mg/L/h, we need to convert this to milligrams per dose. Assuming the patient is administered the drug twice a day, we divide the total daily dose by 2:

Dose per administration = 0.075 mg/L/h / 2
Dose per administration = 0.0375 mg/L/h

To convert this to milligrams, we multiply by the volume of distribution (assuming it is approximately equal to the clearance for simplicity):

Dose per administration = 0.0375 mg/L/h x 15.0 L/h
Dose per administration = 0.5625 mg

However, this dose is per hour. To find the dose per administration, we need to convert it to milligrams per dose. Assuming a standard dose interval of 12 hours for twice-daily administration, we can calculate the dose as follows:

Dose per administration = 0.5625 mg/h x 12 h
Dose per administration = 6.75 mg

However, we need to convert this to milligrams per dose, which is typically administered every 12 hours. Assuming the patient is administered the drug twice a day, we can calculate the dose as follows:

Dose per administration = 6.75 mg / 2
Dose per administration = 3.375 mg

However, this dose is not among the options provided. To find the closest match, we can round the calculated dose to the nearest option.

The closest match is 3.375 mg, which is approximately equal to 3.375 mg or 3.375 mg. However, the options provided do not include 3.375 mg. The closest option is 3.4 mg, which is not available. The next closest option is 3.6 mg, which is also not available. The next closest option is 3.75 mg, which is also not available. The next closest option is 4 mg, which is also not available.

Answer: A) Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder

Explanation: The patient has not passed urine since arriving on the med-surg floor, and a bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. This suggests that the patient may have urinary retention, which is a common complication after surgery, especially in older adults. The patient's discomfort in the abdomen and pelvis may also be related to urinary retention. Inserting a straight catheter into the patient's bladder is the next best step in the treatment of this patient. This will help to relieve the urinary retention and alleviate the patient's discomfort."

Answer: 
D) Schizophrenia

Explanation:
The patient's recent <fact2>bizarre behavior</fact2>, hearing <fact4>voices</fact4>, and having <fact5>intrusive thoughts</fact5> are indicative of a psychotic disorder. The presence of <fact4>voices</fact4> that have <fact6>conversations about her</fact6> and <fact7>encourage her to kill herself</fact7> suggests a more severe psychotic disorder. The patient's inability to concentrate at work or at school and her <fact14>gaunt and anxious</fact14> appearance are also consistent with a severe psychotic disorder. The absence of any other medical or psychiatric illness and the <fact18>negative urine toxicology test</fact18> make a substance-induced psychotic disorder less likely. The patient's recent <fact3>stressful event</fact3> of her father's death may have triggered the onset of the psychotic disorder, but the severity and duration of the symptoms are more consistent with schizophrenia than a brief psychotic disorder or adjustment disorder. Schizophreniform disorder is also a possibility, but the patient's symptoms have been present for more than 6 weeks, which is the typical duration of schizophrenia. Bereavement is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a normal grief reaction."

Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a <fact5>hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL</fact5>?

Answer: To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a z-score and how it relates to a normal distribution. The z-score is calculated as (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we are interested in, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. In this case, we are interested in finding the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL.

First, we need to calculate the z-score for a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL. We can do this using the formula: z = (18 - 17) / 0.1 = 1.

Next, we need to find the probability that a subject will have a z-score greater than 1. This is equivalent to finding the area under the normal distribution curve to the right of z = 1.

Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find that the area to the left of z = 1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the area to the right of z = 1 is 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587.

So, the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL is approximately 15.87%. However, the question asks for the best representation of this probability among the given options. The closest option is 15%.

Therefore, the answer is {B}."

To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?

Answer: D) Spherocytes

The patient's presentation of gallstones, normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and negative Coombs test results, along with the osmotic fragility test showing increased fragility in hypotonic solution, is indicative of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). HS is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of red blood cells that are sphere-shaped rather than the normal biconcave disk shape. This abnormal shape leads to increased osmotic fragility and premature destruction of red blood cells, resulting in anemia.

The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

*   The patient's gallstones, which are often associated with HS due to the increased bilirubin production resulting from red blood cell destruction.
*   The mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis, indicating an increased production of new red blood cells to compensate for the loss of damaged cells.
*   The increased RDW, which suggests a variation in red blood cell size, consistent with the presence of spherocytes.
*   The indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is a result of the increased breakdown of red blood cells.
*   The negative Coombs test results, which rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia as a cause of the anemia.
*   The osmotic fragility test showing increased fragility in hypotonic solution, which is a characteristic feature of HS.

Given these findings, the most likely anticipation on a blood smear would be the presence of spherocytes, which are red blood cells that are sphere-shaped rather than the normal biconcave disk shape."

E) Columnar mucinous epithelium

Answer: Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>1-week history of diarrhea and abdominal bloating</fact2> with <fact3>bulky, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush stools</fact3>, it is suggestive of malabsorption. The patient's history of <fact5>recurrent dull epigastric pain that is triggered by meals and lasts for a few days</fact5> over the past <fact4>6 months</fact4> could be related to chronic pancreatitis, a condition often associated with excessive alcohol consumption, as indicated by the patient's daily consumption of <fact6>6 to 8 beers</fact6>. The presence of <fact7>mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding</fact7> further supports this possibility. The <fact9>structure indicated by the arrows</fact9> on the <fact8>CT scan of the abdomen</fact8> is most likely the pancreas, which is often affected in chronic pancreatitis. The pancreas is lined by <fact10>columnar mucinous epithelium</fact10>, which is responsible for the production of digestive enzymes and hormones. Therefore, the correct answer is {E}."

A <fact1>35-year-old woman</fact1> presents with an unsteady and broad-based gait, dysmetria, and intention tremor in the distal upper extremities. Her past medical history is relevant for <fact2>depression, personality changes, and declining work performance</fact2>, for which she has been put on leave from her current job as an elementary school teacher.

Ophthalmologic examination reveals <fact4>multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery</fact4> (findings shown in the photo). Sensation and motor functions are preserved. Which of the following would you expect to be abnormally accumulated in this patient’s tissues?

Answer: 
Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is <fact2>depression, personality changes, and declining work performance</fact2> associated with <fact3>ataxia, dysarthria, and dystonia</fact3>, which are characteristic of <fact4>ataxia-telangiectasia</fact4>. Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system, immune system, and other bodily systems. It is caused by a mutation in the ATM gene, which is responsible for repairing DNA damage. The accumulation of <fact5>abnormal DNA damage</fact5> in the patient's tissues is a hallmark of this disease. 

The patient's <fact4>multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery</fact4> are indicative of telangiectasias, which are dilated blood vessels that are a characteristic feature of ataxia-telangiectasia. The <fact3>dysarthria, dystonia, and ataxic gait</fact3> are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The abnormal accumulation of <fact5>abnormal DNA damage</fact5> in the patient's tissues is due to the deficiency of the ATM protein, which is responsible for repairing DNA damage. The ATM protein is a kinase that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response pathway. It is activated in response to DNA damage and phosphorylates various substrates, including p53, to initiate DNA repair or apoptosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options provided, but rather <fact6>abnormal DNA damage</fact6> due to the deficiency of the ATM protein.

However, if we are to choose from the provided options, the closest match would be <fact7>abnormal accumulation of copper</fact7>, as ataxia-telangiectasia is associated with an accumulation of copper in the liver and other tissues, which can lead to liver damage and other complications. 

But the most accurate answer would be <fact8>abnormal DNA damage</fact8> due to the deficiency of the ATM protein."

Answer: 
The patient's presentation suggests a diagnosis of cholangitis, an infection of the bile ducts, which is indicated by the patient's <fact2>altered mental status</fact2>, <fact4>high temperature</fact4>, <fact5>low blood pressure</fact5>, <fact9>icteric sclera and skin</fact9>, and <fact10>right upper quadrant tenderness</fact10>. The <fact33>common bile duct dilation</fact33> seen on ultrasound further supports this diagnosis. The best next step in the management of this patient is to perform an <fact34>Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</fact34> to drain the infected bile ducts and relieve the obstruction. ERCP is a minimally invasive procedure that allows for the direct visualization of the bile ducts and the removal of any blockages or infected material. It is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient because it allows for both diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. 

Note: The other options are not the best next step in the management of this patient. Close monitoring (B) may be necessary, but it is not sufficient to address the patient's underlying condition. MRCP (C) and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (D) are diagnostic procedures that may be useful in evaluating the bile ducts, but they do not provide a means of treating the infection. CT abdomen (E) may be useful in evaluating the extent of the infection, but it is not a necessary step in the management of this patient."
451,"A 17-year-old man presents to his family physician for an evaluation about the size of his penis. He feels increasingly anxious during physical education (PE) class as he has noticed that the size of his penis is significantly smaller when compared to his peers.

Which of the following explains the <fact13>pathophysiology</fact13> underlying this patient’s <fact14>disorder</fact14>?

Answer: The patient's presentation of anxiety about the size of his penis, being Tanner stage 1, and difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell suggests a potential issue with his sense of smell, which is often associated with Kallmann syndrome. Kallmann syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by delayed or absent puberty and anosmia (loss of sense of smell). It is caused by mutations in genes that affect the development of the hypothalamus, which regulates hormone secretion, including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The most relevant option to this patient's disorder is isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency, which is a common cause of Kallmann syndrome. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

E) Takayasu's arteritis

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>sudden onset of high blood pressure</fact2> and <fact3>red face</fact3> at times, along with the use of <fact4>blankets to cover her feet, even on the warmest days in the summer</fact4> despite her hands feeling <fact5>warm to the touch</fact5>, suggests a condition that affects blood vessels and blood flow. This pattern of symptoms is often associated with <fact6>Raynaud's phenomenon</fact6>, a condition that affects blood flow to the fingers and toes, and is often seen in patients with <fact7>autonomic dysfunction</fact7>. The absence of <fact7>family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes</fact7> makes conditions like <fact8>Turner syndrome</fact8> or <fact9>Marfan syndrome</fact9> less likely. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make <fact10>Takayasu's arteritis</fact10> and <fact11>Fibromuscular dysplasia</fact11> less likely. The sudden onset of high blood pressure and the presence of <fact12>Raynaud's phenomenon</fact12> are more consistent with <fact13>Pheochromocytoma</fact13>, a condition that affects the adrenal glands and can cause sudden episodes of high blood pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."

Which of the following ligaments must be cut in order to access this space?

Answer: The question describes a surgical procedure to access the pancreatic tumor located posterior to the stomach. To access this space, the surgeon needs to cut the ligament that separates the stomach from the posterior structures. The correct answer is the ligament that connects the stomach to the diaphragm.

The <fact7>space posterior to the stomach</fact7> is located between the stomach and the posterior abdominal wall. To access this space, the surgeon needs to cut the ligament that separates the stomach from the posterior structures. The <fact9>phrenoesophageal ligament</fact9> connects the esophagus to the diaphragm, and the <fact10>phrenicocolic ligament</fact10> connects the spleen to the diaphragm. However, the ligament that connects the stomach to the diaphragm is the <fact9>phrenoesophageal ligament</fact9>. The <fact11>gastrohepatic ligament</fact11> connects the stomach to the liver, the <fact12>ligamentum venosum</fact12> is a remnant of the ductus venosus, and the <fact13>falciform ligament</fact13> connects the liver to the anterior abdominal wall.

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>pruritus and a hypopigmented rash</fact2> on his upper body for <fact3>5 days</fact3> suggests a skin condition. The fact that he returned from a business trip in the <fact4>Bahamas</fact4> and visited a couple of <fact5>beaches</fact5> increases the likelihood of a skin condition caused by a parasite or a fungal infection.

D) Sensory loss
E) Late preterm birth

Answer: The patient presents with symptoms of a <fact1>blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days</fact1> and <fact2>pain around her right eye during eye movement</fact2>, which are indicative of an <fact3>acute vision problem</fact3>. The <fact4>illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction</fact4> while <fact5>illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation</fact5>, which is consistent with a third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy. The <fact6>fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye</fact6> and <fact7>color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye</fact7>, further supporting the presence of a third cranial nerve palsy. The <fact8>remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities</fact8>. Considering these findings, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to a third cranial nerve palsy, which can be caused by an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery. The patient's age and sex make her a candidate for this condition, and therefore, the physician should obtain specific additional history regarding <fact9>high-risk sexual behavior</fact9>, which could be a risk factor for aneurysms.

The reference to the question is the fact that aneurysms of the posterior communicating artery are associated with high-risk sexual behavior."

Physical exam of this patient reveals <fact7>mild hepatomegaly</fact7> and <fact8>dry mucous membranes</fact8>. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?

Answer: Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest that he may have ingested a medication that has caused liver damage and dehydration, leading to a decrease in kidney function. The effects of the medication on the nephron would likely be related to its impact on blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Considering the options provided:

A) Constriction of afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole: This would decrease blood flow to the glomerulus and reduce GFR, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels.

B) Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole: This would decrease blood flow to the glomerulus, but the efferent arteriole would still be able to regulate blood pressure, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

C) Dilation of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole: This would increase blood flow to the glomerulus, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms of decreased urine output.

D) No effect on afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole: This would decrease blood pressure in the glomerulus, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

E) No effect on afferent arteriole and dilation of efferent arteriole: This would increase blood pressure in the glomerulus, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Constriction of afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole."

A <fact1>25-year-old man</fact1> presents with <fact2>painless swelling of the neck</fact2> for the past <fact3>week</fact3>. He reports no recent <fact4>fevers</fact4>, <fact5>night sweats</fact5>, or <fact6>weight loss</fact6>. His <fact7>past medical history</fact7> is significant for <fact8>human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection</fact8>, which was diagnosed <fact9>last year</fact9>. He also experienced a <fact10>head trauma</fact10> 5 years ago, which has been complicated by <fact11>residual seizures</fact11>. His only <fact12>medication</fact12> is daily <fact13>phenytoin</fact13>, which was restarted after he had a <fact14>seizure</fact14> 3 months ago. His <fact15>temperature</fact15> is <fact16>36.8℃ (98.2℉)</fact16>. On physical examination, multiple non-tender <fact17>lymph nodes</fact17>, averaging <fact18>2 cm in diameter</fact18>, are found to be palpable in the <fact19>anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally</fact19>. No other <fact20>lymphadenopathy</fact20> is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin <fact21>14 g/dL</fact21>
Leukocyte count <fact22>8000/mm3 with a normal differential</fact22>
Platelet count <fact23>250,000/mm3</fact23>
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate <fact24>40 mm/h</fact24>
An <fact25>excisional biopsy</fact25> of one of the <fact26>cervical lymph nodes</fact26> is performed. The <fact27>histopathologic analysis</fact27> is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation of <fact2>painless swelling of the neck</fact2> for the past <fact3>week</fact3>, with no recent <fact4>fevers</fact4>, <fact5>night sweats</fact5>, or <fact6>weight loss</fact6>, it is essential to consider various differential diagnoses, including <fact8>HIV lymphadenopathy</fact8>, <fact9>mononucleosis</fact9>, and <fact10>phenytoin-induced adenopathy</fact10>. However, the patient's <fact7>past medical history</fact7> of <fact8>HIV infection</fact8> and the presence of multiple non-tender <fact17>lymph nodes</fact17> in the <fact19>anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally</fact19> make <fact8>HIV lymphadenopathy</fact8> a likely diagnosis. 

The patient's <fact15>temperature</fact15> is <fact16>36.8℃ (98.2℉)</fact16>, which is within the normal range, further supporting the diagnosis of <fact8>HIV lymphadenopathy</fact8>, as this condition often presents with lymphadenopathy without fever or other systemic symptoms.

The laboratory studies show a normal <fact21>hemoglobin</fact21>, <fact22>leukocyte count</fact22>, and <fact23>platelet count</fact23>, which does not indicate any acute infection or malignancy. The <fact24>erythrocyte sedimentation rate</fact24> of <fact24>40 mm/h</fact24> is mildly elevated, which can be seen in chronic infections or inflammation.

The <fact25>excisional biopsy</fact25> of one of the <fact26>cervical lymph nodes</fact26> is performed, and the <fact27>histopathologic analysis</fact27> analysis is shown in the image. However, without the actual image, it is challenging to provide a definitive diagnosis based on histopathology. Nevertheless, considering the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, <fact8>HIV lymphadenopathy</fact8> remains the most likely diagnosis.

Therefore, the answer is {C}."
135,"A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?

B) Decreased PTH, increased calcium, increased phosphate, increased calcitriol
C) Increased PTH, increased calcium, decreased phosphate, decreased calcitriol
D) Decreased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol
E) Normal PTH, normal calcium, normal phosphate, normal calcitriol","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>55-year-old man</fact1> man with a <fact2>history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy</fact2> presents to your office with <fact3>bone pain</fact3>. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>55-year-old man</fact1> has a <fact2>history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy</fact2>, which is a condition that affects the kidneys and can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is associated with abnormalities in mineral and bone metabolism, including disturbances in calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitriol levels. Specifically, patients with CKD often have secondary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by increased PTH levels. This is due to the kidneys' inability to convert vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol, which leads to decreased calcitriol levels. Additionally, the kidneys' impaired ability to excrete phosphate results in increased phosphate levels. The increased PTH levels stimulate the release of calcium from bones, leading to increased calcium levels. Therefore, the laboratory findings that would be most expected in this patient's serum are increased PTH, increased calcium, decreased phosphate, and decreased calcitriol. The answer is {C}."

An ECG shows the absence of <fact32>P-waves</fact32> with an irregular RR complex. A few hours later, his symptoms subside and he is discharged with an additional anticoagulation drug. Which of the following mechanisms explains how this new medication will exert its effects?

Answer: Based on the patient's presentation and the laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is <fact9>atrial fibrillation</fact9>. The absence of <fact32>P-waves</fact32> with an irregular RR complex on the ECG is characteristic of atrial fibrillation. The patient's symptoms of <fact2>racing heart</fact2> and <fact3>lightheadedness</fact3> are also consistent with this diagnosis. The new medication that was prescribed is likely an anticoagulant to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

The correct answer is D) Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. This mechanism is characteristic of anticoagulants such as warfarin, which is commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation. Warfarin works by inhibiting the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, such as factor II, VII, IX, and X, which are essential for blood clotting. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the production of thrombin, a key enzyme involved in blood clotting, and ultimately reduces the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation.

658,"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm.

Answer: 

The patient's presentation is significant for a history of <fact12>ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery</fact12> <fact13>1 month ago</fact13>, which is a <fact43>strong predictor of future CVAs</fact43>. The patient's current symptoms of <fact2>palpitations</fact2> and <fact32>new-onset irregular rate and rhythm</fact32> on <fact31>cardiac examination</fact31> suggest a possible arrhythmia, which is a <fact44>common cause of CVAs</fact44>.

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>unilateral leg swelling</fact2> and a <fact6>thrombus in the right femoral vein</fact6> one year ago suggests a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The presence of an inherited condition, as revealed by the <fact10>genetic workup</fact10>, is a key factor in this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and the ultrasound findings of a <fact9>thrombus in the left popliteal vein</fact9> are consistent with a hypercoagulable state. Among the options provided, the most likely pathophysiology is a <fact11>deficiency in protein C</fact11>, which is a known inherited condition that increases the risk of DVT. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in protein C, a protein that inhibits the coagulation cascade. A deficiency in protein C can lead to a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of DVT. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Answer: The patient's symptoms, such as <fact4>facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps</fact4> after consuming <fact5>alcohol</fact5>, are indicative of a disulfiram-like reaction. This reaction occurs when an individual with a history of metronidazole use consumes alcohol. Metronidazole inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for metabolizing acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism. As a result, acetaldehyde levels rise, causing the aforementioned symptoms. Therefore, serum levels of <fact7>acetaldehyde</fact7> are likely elevated in this patient following <fact6>alcohol consumption</fact6>."

Answer: C) Advanced sleep phase disorder

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of <fact4>unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening</fact4> and <fact7>rested when he awakes</fact7> suggest an early sleep phase, which is characteristic of advanced sleep phase disorder. This condition is often seen in older adults and is associated with a desire to go to bed early and wake up early, despite feeling rested. The patient's ability to fall asleep early and feel rested in the morning, despite his wife's disappointment, further supports this diagnosis. The absence of other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea or insomnia, and the normal neurological exam also support this diagnosis."

On physical exam the patient has <fact13>decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder</fact13>. Strength of the patient's upper extremity is <fact14>4/5</fact14>. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>stiffness in his arm</fact2> that interferes with <fact3>combing his hair</fact3> and <fact4>reaching objects that are high on the shelf</fact4> suggests a condition affecting the shoulder joint. The patient's past medical history of <fact5>diabetes mellitus type II</fact5>, <fact6>obesity</fact6>, and <fact7>hypertension</fact7> increases his risk for various musculoskeletal conditions. However, his <fact12>sedentary lifestyle</fact12> is a significant contributing factor to his condition. The patient's physical exam findings of <fact13>decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder</fact13> and <fact14>4/5 strength of the upper extremity</fact14> are indicative of a condition that restricts movement and affects muscle strength.

Among the options provided, <fact15>adhesive capsulitis</fact15> (B) is the most likely diagnosis. Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a condition characterized by <fact16>restricted shoulder movement</fact16> and <fact17>decreased muscle strength</fact17> due to inflammation and scarring of the shoulder joint capsule. This condition is often associated with <fact18>diabetes mellitus</fact18> and <fact19>sedentary lifestyle</fact19>, which are risk factors for the patient. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with adhesive capsulitis, making it the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: Given the patient's history of <fact6>family history of endocrine abnormalities</fact6> and <fact7>treatment is started</fact7> for <fact8>treatment will be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle</fact8>, it is likely that the patient is being treated for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age, often associated with irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, and endocrine abnormalities. A common treatment for PCOS is the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, which can be administered intermittently to regulate menstrual cycles and induce ovulation. GnRH agonists can also be used to treat other conditions, such as uterine fibroids and endometriosis. If GnRH agonists were administered in a different manner, they may also be used to treat conditions such as prostate cancer, which is sensitive to GnRH agonists. Therefore, the correct answer is {E}."

Answer: A) Aldose reductase

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of <fact7>narrowing of retinal arteries</fact7> and <fact8>microaneurysms</fact8> are indicative of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanism of diabetic retinopathy is the accumulation of sorbitol in the retina due to the enzyme aldose reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, which is then converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. The accumulation of sorbitol leads to osmotic damage to the retinal cells, causing the characteristic changes seen in diabetic retinopathy. The tissue-specific expression of aldose reductase in the retina is a key factor in the development of diabetic retinopathy."

A <fact1>14-year-old girl</fact1> comes to the physician because she has not yet had her period. She is at the 10th percentile for <fact2>height</fact2> and 25th percentile for <fact3>weight</fact3>. Examination shows a <fact4>broad chest with widely spaced nipples</fact4>, a <fact5>low posterior hairline</fact5>, <fact6>forearms angled 20° away from the body when fully extended</fact6>, and <fact7>shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally</fact7>. <fact8>Sexual development is Tanner stage 1</fact8>. Which of the following statements about this patient's <fact9>fertility</fact9> is most accurate?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation, the <fact1>14-year-old girl</fact1> with primary amenorrhea and <fact2>short stature</fact2> (10th percentile for height) is likely affected by Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome (45,X). Key features of Turner syndrome include a broad chest with widely spaced nipples (<fact4>broad chest with widely spaced nipples</fact4>), a low posterior hairline (<fact5>low posterior hairline</fact5>), forearms angled away from the body when fully extended (<fact6>forearms angled 20° away from the body when fully extended</fact6>), and shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally (<fact7>shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally</fact7>). Individuals with Turner syndrome typically have impaired ovarian function and are often infertile due to the absence or underdevelopment of ovaries. 

The statement about the patient's fertility that is most accurate is {C} Impaired tubal ciliary function will prevent natural fertilization. This is because the majority of women with Turner syndrome have streak ovaries or rudimentary ovaries, which are unable to produce functional gametes. As a result, natural conception is not possible. While assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) using donor oocytes, can help women with Turner syndrome achieve pregnancy, the use of a surrogate is not necessary due to the absence of a uterus, but rather because the patient's ovaries are not producing functional gametes."

The crying infant's <fact10>lungs are clear to auscultation</fact10>. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?

Answer: C) Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible.

The patient's symptoms of <fact2>noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress</fact2> thirty minutes after delivery, along with the need for <fact4>bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery</fact4>, suggest respiratory distress. The fact that the <fact6>bluish lip discoloration worsens when she fed and improves when she cried</fact6> indicates that the condition is exacerbated by feeding and improved by crying, which is consistent with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). However, CDH is typically associated with a scaphoid abdomen, which is not mentioned in the question. 

Given the context of the question, the correct answer is more likely related to the symptoms and the complications of the respiratory distress. The passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible (option C) is not directly related to the symptoms. However, it is related to the symptoms if we consider that the infant has a condition that affects the passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth, such as esophageal atresia. The esophageal atresia is a congenital condition where the esophagus is not fully developed, and it is often associated with respiratory distress. This condition is often diagnosed with a contrast study or an upper GI series, but the passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible is a symptom that can be related to this condition."

Answer: To determine the most appropriate loading dose for this patient, we can use the formula for calculating the loading dose:

Loading dose = Desired peak plasma concentration x Volume of distribution

Given that the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL and the volume of distribution is 60 mL/kg, we can calculate the loading dose as follows:

Loading dose = 0.5 units/mL x 60 mL/kg
Loading dose = 30 units/kg

Since the patient weighs 50 kg, we can multiply the loading dose per kilogram by the patient's weight to determine the total loading dose:

Total loading dose = 30 units/kg x 50 kg
Total loading dose = 1,500 units

Therefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient is 1,500 units."

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>29-year-old man</fact1> who has experienced a <fact2>motor vehicle accident</fact2> is found to have <fact3>scalp and trunk lacerations</fact3> that are still actively bleeding. He is also <fact10>anxious</fact10> but does not have any other visible injuries. In this situation, the body's response to the injury and stress would involve the activation of the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output to maintain blood flow to the injured areas. The increased <fact8>pulse of 82/min</fact8> and <fact7>blood pressure of 110/74 mmHg</fact7> indicate an elevated sympathetic tone. Therefore, the process that would most likely be seen in this patient is the release of <fact12>norepinephrine</fact12> at the sinoatrial node, leading to increased heart rate and cardiac output. This is consistent with the body's ""fight or flight"" response to stress and injury. The answer is {E}."

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>headaches</fact2> for the past <fact3>2 weeks</fact3> associated with <fact4>nausea and vomiting</fact4> suggests an issue with increased intracranial pressure. The patient's recent history of <fact5>fever, irritability, and neck rigidity</fact5> treated with <fact6>antibiotics</fact6> indicates a possible infection that could have led to complications such as meningitis. The <fact8>MRI of the brain</fact8> showing <fact9>bilateral ventricular enlargement</fact9> and <fact10>enlargement of the subarachnoid space</fact10> is consistent with hydrocephalus, which is often caused by impaired CSF drainage. Considering the patient's history and the MRI findings, the most likely explanation of the patient's condition is impaired CSF drainage into the subarachnoid space, which is a common complication of meningitis. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Answer: 
The patient is <fact1>25 years old</fact1> and <fact2>desires to terminate her pregnancy</fact2>. She has a <fact3>previous history of two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries</fact3>, indicating that she has had a previous uterine scar. Given this history, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends avoiding procedures that could potentially disrupt the uterine scar, such as vacuum aspiration or manual uterine aspiration. A more appropriate option for this patient would be <fact4>dilatation and evacuation (D&E)</fact4>, which is a procedure that is typically performed under general anesthesia and involves the use of a suction curette to remove the products of conception. This procedure is often preferred for patients with a previous uterine scar due to its lower risk of complications.

While there, he delivers a baby who he suspects has congenital hypothyroidism, most likely caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake. Which of the following signs and symptoms would NOT be expected to be observed in this child?

A) Hypotonia
B) Diarrhea
C) Umbilical hernia
D) Mild jaundice
E) Macroglossia

Answer: E) Macroglossia

Explanation: Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is underdeveloped or not functioning properly, leading to a deficiency of thyroid hormones. This condition can cause a variety of signs and symptoms, including hypotonia (A), umbilical hernia (C), and mild jaundice (D). However, macroglossia (E), or an enlarged tongue, is not typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism. In fact, the most common signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism include hypotonia, umbilical hernia, and jaundice, as well as other signs such as a large fontanelle, dry skin, and a poor response to stimuli. Macroglossia is more commonly associated with other conditions, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or Down syndrome. Therefore, macroglossia is the correct answer."

Answer: 
B) Proper diet and iron supplementation

Explanation:
The patient, a <fact1>9-month-old boy</fact1>, has a <fact18>Hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.1 g/dL</fact18>, which is lower than the normal range for his age. This indicates anemia. The <fact19>Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 65 fL</fact19>, which is below the normal range, indicating microcytic anemia. The <fact20>Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated at 550 μg/dL</fact20>, and the <fact21>Serum iron is low at 45 µg/dL</fact21>, suggesting iron deficiency anemia. The patient's <fact22>Serum lead level is normal</fact22>, which rules out lead poisoning as a cause of anemia.

Answer: B) Gynecomastia

The question mentions that the patient has a long-standing history of <fact2>chronic hepatitis C infection</fact2> and physical examination shows signs suggestive of <fact10>liver cirrhosis</fact10>. Liver cirrhosis is associated with hormonal imbalances, including <fact11>hyperestrinism</fact11>. Hyperestrinism refers to an excess of estrogen in the body. In cirrhotic patients, the liver's inability to metabolize estrogen leads to an accumulation of estrogen, resulting in <fact11>hyperestrinism</fact11>. One of the direct results of <fact11>hyperestrinism</fact11> in <fact12>cirrhotic patients</fact12> is the development of <fact13>gynecomastia</fact13>, which is the enlargement of breast tissue in males.

Given the patient's symptoms and oral examination findings, a medication that targets the cell membrane of the fungus is most appropriate. Specifically, <fact6>disruption of cell membrane permeability</fact6> is a mechanism of action that is effective against Candida albicans. Therefore, the most appropriate medication for this patient is one that disrupts cell membrane permeability, which is option {A}."

Echocardiography demonstrates an <fact12>ejection fraction of 55%</fact12>. Which of the following medications will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient?

Answer: 
Given the patient's history of <fact2>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)</fact2> and current presentation of <fact6>hypertension</fact6> and <fact11>bilateral lower extremity pitting edema</fact11>, the primary concern is to prevent further cardiovascular events. The <fact12>ejection fraction of 55%</fact12> indicates that the patient has heart failure, which is a significant risk factor for mortality. Among the provided options, <fact3>hypertension</fact3> management is crucial, and the use of an ACE inhibitor such as <D> Lisinopril</D> has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Answer: A) Aldosterone excess

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact3>progressive fatigue</fact3> and new onset <fact4>muscle cramps</fact4> in the context of a <fact2>history of hypertension</fact2> suggests an underlying endocrine disorder. The patient's laboratory values show a low <fact17>K+ level of 3.3 mEq/L, which is a common finding in primary aldosteronism due to aldosterone-mediated potassium excretion. Additionally, the patient's <fact10>high blood pressure of 174/111 mmHg</fact10> and <fact15>normal sodium level of 138 mEq/L</fact15> are consistent with primary aldosteronism, a condition characterized by aldosterone excess.

Answer: 
Given the information provided, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform the <fact16>oral glucose challenge test</fact16>. This is because the patient is at her <fact6>4th prenatal visit</fact6> and the question does not mention any specific risk factors for gestational diabetes. However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women with a history of a previous child with a birth weight above 4 kg, women with a previous history of gestational diabetes, or women with a family history of diabetes undergo screening for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24-28 weeks' gestation. In this case, the patient's earlier pregnancy was <fact5>uncomplicated</fact5> and there is no mention of a family history of diabetes, but it is still recommended to perform the oral glucose challenge test as a routine screening measure for GDM."

His <fact4>blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg</fact4>. Physical examination shows <fact5>2+ edema in both lower extremities</fact5>. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. This patient was most likely treated with which of the following drugs? Options: (A) Losartan (B) Lisinopril (C) Spironolactone (D) Hydrochlorothiazide (E) Amlodipine

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>swelling of his legs for 2 months</fact2> and <fact5>2+ edema in both lower extremities</fact5> suggests edema, a common side effect of certain antihypertensive medications. The patient was diagnosed with hypertension and started on a new medication <fact3>three months ago</fact3>, which is a crucial piece of information. Among the options provided, <fact4>Losartan</fact4> (A) is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, which is not typically associated with edema. <fact4>Lisinopril</fact4> (B) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which can cause cough but is less likely to cause edema. <fact4>Spironolactone</fact4> (C) is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which can cause edema in some cases. However, it is not the most likely cause of edema in this patient. <fact4>Hydrochlorothiazide</fact4> (D) is a thiazide diuretic, which can cause hypokalemia and edema. This makes it a likely candidate for the medication that caused the patient's edema. <fact4>Amlodipine</fact4> (E) is a calcium channel blocker, which can cause peripheral edema as a side effect. This is consistent with the patient's presentation of <fact2>swelling of his legs for 2 months</fact2> and <fact5>2+ edema in both lower extremities</fact5>. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's <fact21>hypotension</fact21>?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of <fact21>hypotension</fact21> (<fact19>blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg</fact19>) after receiving <fact15>epidural anesthesia</fact15> suggests a potential cause related to the positioning of the patient during the procedure. The patient is in <fact4>active labor</fact4> at <fact3>40 weeks' gestation</fact3> and is receiving <fact15>epidural anesthesia</fact15>. The most relevant factor to consider in this scenario is the <fact22>aortocaval compression</fact22> that occurs when a pregnant woman is in the supine position, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and hypotension. The patient's vital signs indicate a decrease in <fact17>pulse</fact17> and <fact19>blood pressure</fact19>, which are consistent with the effects of aortocaval compression. The initiation of <fact20>intravenous fluid resuscitation</fact20> is an appropriate response to hypotension, but it does not address the underlying cause.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>extreme fatigue for the past 2 days</fact2> and <fact3>skin looking yellow</fact3> is indicative of liver dysfunction, which is further supported by the elevated <fact12>ALT level of 2,000 IU/L</fact12>.

The <fact13>hepatitis viral panel</fact13> results show <fact15>HBsAg positive</fact15> and <fact17>IgM anti-HBc positive</fact17>, which are indicative of an acute hepatitis B infection. The presence of <fact15>HBsAg</fact15> indicates that the patient is infectious, while the <fact17>IgM anti-HBc</fact17> suggests that the infection is acute. The absence of <fact14>Anti-HAV IgM</fact14> and <fact18>Anti-HCV</fact18> antibodies makes acute hepatitis A and C infections less likely.

E) Dialectical behavioral therapy","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>35-year-old woman</fact1> presents with <fact2>severe fear reactions</fact2> to seeing <fact3>dogs</fact3> after moving into a new <fact4>suburban neighborhood</fact4>. She states that she has always had an <fact5>irrational and excessive fear</fact5> of <fact3>dogs</fact3> but has been able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the <fact4>city</fact4>. When she sees her <fact6>neighbors walking their dogs outside</fact6>, she is <fact7>terrified</fact7> and begins to feel <fact8>short of breath</fact8>. Recently, she has stopped <fact9>picking up her children from the bus stop</fact9> and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any <fact3>dogs</fact3>. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?

Answer: C) Systematic desensitization

Systematic desensitization is a type of behavioral therapy that is specifically designed to treat phobias, such as the patient's fear of dogs. This therapy involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object (in this case, dogs) in a controlled and safe environment, starting with small steps and gradually increasing the intensity of the exposure. This approach helps the patient to become desensitized to the feared object and to learn coping skills to manage their anxiety.

The patient's symptoms, such as <fact7>terrified</fact7> and <fact8>short of breath</fact8> when seeing dogs, are indicative of a phobic reaction. The fact that she has avoided seeing dogs in the past and has started to avoid certain activities (such as <fact9>picking up her children from the bus stop</fact9>) to avoid seeing dogs further supports the diagnosis of a phobia.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (option A) are a type of medication that can be used to treat anxiety disorders, but they are not a definitive treatment for phobias. Short-acting benzodiazepines (option B) can be used to treat acute anxiety, but they are not a definitive treatment for phobias and can have negative side effects. Cognitive behavioral therapy (option D) is a type of therapy that can be used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not as specifically tailored to treating phobias as systematic desensitization. Dialectical behavioral therapy (option E) is a type of therapy that is specifically designed to treat borderline personality disorder, not phobias.

In conclusion, systematic desensitization is the best definitive treatment for this patient's phobia of dogs."
818,"A multi-specialty physician practice is meeting to determine which compensation scheme would best serve the practice and its patient population. Which of the following are true in regards to physician compensation?
A) Capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians

C) Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality
D) Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians
E) Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits","Reformatted Question: A multi-specialty physician practice is meeting to determine which compensation scheme would best serve the practice and its patient population. Which of the following are true in regards to physician compensation?

A) Capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians
B) Fee-for-service pays physicians a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care
C) Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality
D) Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians
E) Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits

Answer: Evaluating the options provided, we can assess the truth of each statement regarding physician compensation schemes.

A) Capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians: This statement is false. Capitation involves a fixed payment per patient, which can result in financial losses if the actual healthcare costs exceed the capitated amount. This can pose significant financial risk to physicians.

B) Fee-for-service pays physicians a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care: This statement is false. Fee-for-service (FFS) is a payment model where physicians are reimbursed for each service provided, usually based on the complexity and duration of the service. It does not pay a set amount per unit time for every patient.

C) Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality: This statement is true. FFS can create a perverse incentive for physicians to order more tests and procedures, as they are reimbursed for each service provided. This can lead to increased healthcare utilization, regardless of the quality of care.

D) Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians: This statement is false. FFS can provide a predictable revenue stream for physicians, as they are reimbursed for each service provided. This can reduce financial risk, as they are not dependent on a fixed payment per patient.

E) Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits: This statement is true. Capitation can create a perverse incentive for physicians to focus on managing existing conditions rather than investing in preventive care, as they are not reimbursed for preventive services. This can lead to decreased preventive medicine visits.

Therefore, options C and E are true in regards to physician compensation."
850,"Two weeks after starting chemotherapy with etoposide, a 66-year-old man with small cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of persistent nausea and vomiting.

This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?

Answer: The patient's symptoms of <fact3>persistent nausea and vomiting</fact3> are indicative of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The improvement in symptoms after the administration of <fact5>metoclopramide</fact5>, a dopamine antagonist, suggests that the chemotherapy is affecting the central nervous system. Specifically, the <fact6>area postrema</fact6> is a part of the central nervous system that is responsible for detecting toxins in the blood and triggering nausea and vomiting. The effect of chemotherapy on the <fact6>area postrema</fact6> is a well-documented mechanism of CINV. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Answer: The histological examination of the kidney mass shows <fact8>primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli</fact8>, which is indicative of a Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer that typically affects children. The development of the kidney is closely related to the development of the urogenital system, which is derived from the intermediate mesoderm.

Urea nitrogen 45 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.2 mg/dL
The patient is prescribed a drug to treat the cause of his current symptoms. The drug's mechanism of action directly involves which of the following signaling pathways?

Answer: D) JAK/STAT

The patient's presentation is consistent with anemia, as indicated by the low <fact1>hemoglobin</fact1> level and <fact6>conjunctival pallor</fact6>. The <fact5>high pulse</fact5> and <fact6>bounding pulses</fact6> suggest a possible increase in erythropoietin (EPO) levels, which stimulates red blood cell production. The patient's <fact3>poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact3> and <fact1>chronic kidney disease</fact1> increase the risk of secondary polycythemia due to increased EPO production. The <fact4>serum ferritin</fact4> level is elevated, which is consistent with iron overload, a common complication of secondary polycythemia.

The drug prescribed to treat the cause of the patient's current symptoms is likely to be an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), such as erythropoietin or darbepoietin. These agents work by binding to the erythropoietin receptor on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and stimulating red blood cell production.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) JAK/STAT."

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?

Answer: C) Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins

Explanation: The patient is experiencing <fact4>sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension</fact4> after <fact5>rupture of membranes</fact5> and <fact6>combined spinal-epidural anesthesia</fact6>. The presence of <fact12>labored breathing and thready pulses</fact12> and <fact13>crackles at both lung bases</fact13> indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The <fact14>abdomen is nontender</fact14>, and <fact15>speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal</fact15>, which suggests that the patient is experiencing an amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). The <fact16>low hemoglobin concentration</fact16> and <fact17>undetectable fibrinogen concentration</fact17> further support this diagnosis. AFE is a known complication of rupture of membranes and can cause acute respiratory distress, hypotension, and coagulopathy. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition is amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins."

The <fact8>grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur</fact8> at the <fact9>cardiac apex</fact9> may be related to a cardiac condition. The <fact10>decreased strength</fact10> in the <fact11>right lower leg</fact11> with <fact12>normal strength</fact12> in the other extremities suggests a focal neurological deficit. The <fact13>multinodular, calcified lesions</fact13> in the <fact14>retina bilaterally</fact14> are consistent with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, which is responsible for the development of neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and other characteristic features of the disease. The patient's skin findings are likely to be consistent with NF1, and a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17 is the most likely cause of his condition."

In addition to an <fact5>influenza vaccine</fact5>, which <fact6>vaccine should be administered to this patient during this visit?</fact6>

Answer: Based on the patient's history of not receiving any vaccines in the past 13 years, he is in need of a tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine. This is recommended for adults who have not received a Tdap vaccine in the past 10 years (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Additionally, the patient's history of <fact3>intermittent, exercise-induced asthma</fact3> does not contraindicate the administration of the Tdap vaccine. The patient's <fact4>sexually active history</fact4> may be relevant for the administration of other vaccines, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, but this is not the most appropriate choice given the patient's current vaccination status. The pneumococcal vaccine is typically recommended for adults aged 65 years and older, or those with certain underlying medical conditions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). The meningococcal vaccine is recommended for certain high-risk groups, such as college students living in dormitories, but this patient's vaccination history does not indicate a need for this vaccine. The Haemophilus influenza B (HIB) vaccine is not typically recommended for adults. Therefore, the most appropriate vaccine for this patient is the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine.

Physical examination shows <fact3>bilateral saccadic eye movement in all directions</fact3> and <fact4>brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs</fact4>. There is an <fact5>ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen</fact5>. He undergoes <fact6>surgical resection of the tumor</fact6>. Histopathologic examination of this mass is most likely to show which of the following? Options: (A) Blastic skeletal muscle cells arranged in nests and sheets (B) Numerous immature lymphocytes in a starry sky pattern (C) Abortive glomeruli and tubules in a spindle cell stroma (D) Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil (E) Hepatocytes in fetal and embryonic stages of differentiation

Answer: The <fact1>2-year-old boy</fact1> presents with <fact2>10-day history of unsteady gait, frequent falls, and twitching of the extremities</fact2>, which suggests a neurological disorder. The <fact3>bilateral saccadic eye movement in all directions</fact3> and <fact4>brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs</fact4> further support this notion. The presence of an <fact5>ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen</fact5> indicates a possible tumor. The patient's age and symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that originates in the adrenal glands and can affect the nervous system. Histopathologically, neuroblastoma is characterized by <fact6>small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil</fact6>, which is a hallmark feature of this disease. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."
211,"An investigator is studying the effect of drug X on the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene on chromosome 13 in endometrial cells. Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene?
A) G1 phase arrest
B) Prophase I arrest
C) Initiation of S phase
D) Completion of G2 phase
E) Initiation of G0 phase","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>drug X</fact1> is being studied for its effect on the <fact2>retinoblastoma (Rb) gene</fact2> on <fact3>chromosome 13</fact3> in <fact4>endometrial cells</fact4>. The <fact5>cells are plated on growth media</fact5> and the <fact6>distribution of cell cycle phase</fact6> is measured with <fact7>flow cytometry</fact7>. The <fact8>drug X</fact8> is known to <fact9>activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4</fact9>, and it is administered to all the cells, and the <fact10>distribution of cell cycle phase</fact10> is measured again <fact11>1 hour later</fact11>. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of <fact8>drug X</fact8> on the <fact2>retinoblastoma (Rb) gene</fact2>?

Answer: The <fact1>retinoblastoma (Rb) gene</fact1> is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in the G1 phase (Bartek & Lukas, 2001). The <fact2>Rb protein</fact2> inhibits the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are essential for cell cycle progression (Sherr & Roberts, 1999). When <fact3>drug X</fact3> activates <fact9>cyclin-dependent kinase 4</fact9>, it would be expected to phosphorylate and inactivate the <fact2>Rb protein</fact2>, leading to the release of E2F transcription factors and the initiation of the S phase (DeGregori et al., 1997). Therefore, the most likely result of the action of <fact8>drug X</fact8> on the <fact2>retinoblastoma (Rb) gene</fact2> is the <fact10>initiation of S phase</fact10>.

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation of <fact2>right hand and leg weakness</fact2> with a <fact4>gradual increase</fact4> in the degree of weakness, along with <fact5>disorientation</fact5>, the most likely diagnosis is a stroke. The patient's medical history of <fact6>ischemic heart disease diagnosed 2 months ago</fact6>, <fact7>diabetes</fact7>, and <fact8>hypertension</fact8> increases the risk for vascular disease. The <fact10>hypertonic reflexes</fact10> and <fact11>positive Babinski reflex</fact11> are indicative of upper motor neuron damage, which is consistent with a stroke. The <fact12>CT scan</fact12> is not described, but in the context of a stroke, the most likely pathologic change is <fact13>coagulative necrosis</fact13> due to ischemia. Coagulative necrosis is a form of necrosis that occurs due to ischemia, which is consistent with the patient's presentation of stroke."

720,"An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells?
A) α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
B) Pyruvate kinase
C) Glutathione reductase
D) Lactic acid dehydrogenase
E) Carbonic anhydrase","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>subset of normal human cells</fact1> with an <fact2>elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase</fact2> is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be <fact3>absent in these cells</fact3>?
A) α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
B) Pyruvate kinase
C) Glutathione reductase
D) Lactic acid dehydrogenase
E) Carbonic anhydrase

Answer: The elevated intracellular concentration of <fact2>bisphosphoglycerate mutase</fact2> suggests that the cells are involved in the glycolytic pathway, particularly in the regulation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) levels. 2,3-BPG is a key regulator of hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, and its production is tightly linked to the activity of <fact2>bisphosphoglycerate mutase</fact2>. In red blood cells, the primary site of 2,3-BPG production, the <fact2>bisphosphoglycerate mutase</fact2> enzyme is crucial for regulating the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin. The absence of <fact3>carbonic anhydrase</fact3> would disrupt the regulation of pH and bicarbonate levels in red blood cells, which is essential for maintaining the proper function of hemoglobin. Carbonic anhydrase is involved in the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, which is necessary for maintaining the acid-base balance in red blood cells. Therefore, the most likely enzyme to be absent in these cells is <fact3>carbonic anhydrase</fact3>."

No <fact29>wheezing</fact29> is heard on repeat <fact30>pulmonary examination</fact30>. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer: 

Considering the patient's presentation of worsening <fact2>wheezing and shortness of breath</fact2> over the past day, which is a presumed <fact22>asthma exacerbation</fact22>, the child was given <fact20>nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments</fact20> and <fact21>intravenous methylprednisolone</fact21> in the emergency department. However, one hour later, the child became <fact23>limp and lethargic</fact23> and had no <fact29>wheezing</fact29> on repeat <fact30>pulmonary examination</fact30>. These symptoms are indicative of status asthmaticus, a severe and potentially life-threatening asthma exacerbation that requires immediate intervention. The administration of <fact24>magnesium sulfate</fact24> is a common treatment for status asthmaticus, but the child's continued decline necessitates further intervention.

The most appropriate next step in management is to <fact31>intubate with mechanical ventilation</fact31>. This is because the child is <fact32>limp and lethargic</fact32> and has no <fact29>wheezing</fact29> on repeat <fact30>pulmonary examination</fact30>, indicating a possible respiratory failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation will provide the necessary support to maintain the child's airway, breathing, and circulation until the asthma exacerbation is resolved.

Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

213,"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?
A) Lack of a comparison group
B) No prevalence assessment
C) Low number of patients
D) Ascertainment bias
E) Lack of risk calculation","Reformatted Question: A journal editor returned an article submitted as a cohort study to the authors, suggesting it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?

A) Lack of a comparison group
B) No prevalence assessment
C) Low number of patients
D) Ascertainment bias
E) Lack of risk calculation

Answer: C) Low number of patients

Explanation: The editor suggested that the article should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study. This is because the article describes a study involving 14 patients, which is a relatively small number of participants. A cohort study typically involves a larger sample size to establish associations between variables and to draw conclusions about a population. In contrast, a case series is a descriptive study design that reports on a small number of patients with a specific condition or outcome. The editor likely suggested changing the study design to a case series because the number of patients in the study is too small to establish a cohort, which is a characteristic of a case series."

This process occurs within the <fact8>lysosomes</fact8>, which are responsible for cellular digestion and recycling of cellular waste and foreign substances. Therefore, the cellular organelle significant in the formation of these cells is the <fact8>lysosomes</fact8>. The answer is {C}."
1162,"A 44-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician because she has been having fever, chest pain, and cough for the last several weeks. She presented to the physician because she discovered blood in her sputum after coughing. She recently returned from a year of traveling abroad, but has otherwise been healthy. Based on clinical suspicion, an acid fast stain is performed showing the causative organism, and she is started on appropriate therapy. Two weeks later, she returns with a skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion, and is given a factor to take in addition to the medications previously prescribed. Which of the following is a characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided?
A) Required for collagen hydroxylation
B) Required for dehydrogenase enzymes
C) Required for methionine processing
D) Required for methylmalonyl-CoA processing
E) Required for transketolase function","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>44-year-old woman</fact1> presents to her primary care physician because she has been having <fact2>fever, chest pain, and cough</fact2> for the last several weeks. She presented to the physician because she discovered <fact3>blood in her sputum after coughing</fact3>. She recently returned from a year of <fact4>traveling abroad</fact4>, but has otherwise been healthy. Based on <fact5>clinical suspicion</fact5>, an <fact6>acid fast stain</fact6> is performed showing the <fact7>causative organism</fact7>, and she is started on <fact8>appropriate therapy</fact8>. Two weeks later, she returns with a <fact9>skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion</fact9>, and is given a <fact10>factor to take in addition to the medications previously prescribed</fact10>. Which of the following is a characteristic of the <fact11>factor that was most likely provided</fact11>?

Answer: The patient's symptoms of <fact2>fever, chest pain, and cough</fact2> for several weeks, along with the discovery of <fact3>blood in her sputum after coughing</fact3>, suggest a pulmonary infection. The recent history of <fact4>traveling abroad</fact4> increases the likelihood of a travel-related illness. The <fact6>acid fast stain</fact6> showing the <fact7>causative organism</fact7> is indicative of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that is more common in individuals who have traveled to areas with high TB prevalence. The <fact8>appropriate therapy</fact8> for TB typically includes isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Two weeks later, the patient returns with a <fact9>skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion</fact9>, which are potential side effects of isoniazid therapy. Isoniazid is a vitamin B6 antagonist and requires pyridoxine supplementation to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the factor that was most likely provided is pyridoxine, which is required for <fact12>transketolase function</fact12>. The answer is {E}."
752,"A 1-day-old infant is in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia. The mother is a healthy 32-year-old woman who did not have regular prenatal exams.

Which of the following abnormalities is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>1-day-old infant</fact1> is experiencing <fact2>respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia</fact2>, which is indicative of a congenital condition affecting lung development. The mother's lack of regular <fact4>prenatal exams</fact4> suggests that the condition may be due to a genetic or chromosomal abnormality. The physical examination findings of <fact5>low-set ears</fact5>, <fact6>retrognathia</fact6>, and <fact7>abnormal extremity development</fact7> are consistent with a genetic syndrome. Among the options provided, <fact8>duodenal atresia</fact8> is a congenital anomaly associated with several genetic syndromes, including Down syndrome, which is characterized by <fact9>low-set ears</fact9> and <fact10>retrognathia</fact10>. Down syndrome is also associated with <fact11>abnormal extremity development</fact11>. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

When asked directly, the patient admits to <fact9>alcohol and marijuana use</fact9> but denies <fact10>illicit drug use</fact10>. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?

Answer: The patient's presentation, including <fact2>acute-onset chest pain</fact2>, <fact5>anxious and agitated</fact5> behavior, <fact6>dilated pupils</fact6>, and a <fact7>perforated nasal septum</fact7>, is indicative of a stimulant-induced psychosis. The patient's history of <fact9>alcohol and marijuana use</fact9> but denial of <fact10>illicit drug use</fact10> suggests that the patient may be using a stimulant without realizing it. The most likely agent responsible for this patient's presentation is a stimulant, such as cocaine. Cocaine is a powerful stimulant that can cause a range of symptoms, including <fact2>acute-onset chest pain</fact2>, <fact5>anxious and agitated</fact5> behavior, <fact6>dilated pupils</fact6>, and a <fact7>perforated nasal septum</fact7>. The mechanism of action of cocaine is to block the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to an increase in the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain. This can cause a range of effects, including euphoria, increased energy, and alertness, as well as more severe effects such as <fact2>acute-onset chest pain</fact2> and <fact5>anxious and agitated</fact5> behavior.

Therefore, the answer is {A}."
722,"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.

This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?
A) Arachnoid villi
B) Interventricular foramen
C) Median aperture
D) Lateral apertures
E) Cerebral aqueduct","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>23-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the physician because of a <fact2>2-month history of episodic headaches</fact2> associated with <fact3>with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting</fact3>. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An <fact4>MRI of the brain</fact4> shows <fact5>isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle</fact5>. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures? 
A) Arachnoid villi
B) Interventricular foramen
C) Median aperture
D) Lateral apertures
E) Cerebral aqueduct

Answer: The patient has a <fact2>2-month history of episodic headaches</fact2> associated with <fact3>symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and vomiting</fact3>, which suggests a possible intracranial process. The <fact4>MRI of the brain</fact4> reveals <fact5>isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle</fact5>, indicating hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is typically caused by an obstruction in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways. The <fact5>isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle</fact5> suggests that the obstruction is located between the lateral ventricle and the third ventricle. The most likely structure involved in this obstruction is the <fact6>interventricular foramen</fact6>, which connects the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle. Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."

Answer: D) Delirium

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of <fact3>unarousable during the day</fact3> and <fact4>reorientation</fact4> during the night, along with <fact7>distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time</fact7>, are indicative of delirium. The fact that she underwent <fact2>surgical repair of a hip fracture</fact2> six days prior and is currently on <fact6>oxycodone for pain</fact6> increases her risk for delirium, which is a common complication in elderly patients undergoing surgery and taking opioids. The absence of <fact9>urine dipstick abnormalities</fact9> makes a urinary tract infection less likely. The patient's <fact5>weekly</fact5> alcohol consumption is unlikely to be the primary cause of her current condition, making <fact8>alcohol withdrawal</fact8> less likely. <fact3>Opioid intoxication</fact3> is also unlikely given the patient's normal vital signs. <fact1>Dementia</fact1> is a chronic condition that would not explain the acute onset of symptoms."

Answer: 
The patient's symptoms of an <fact16>incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis</fact16> following a minor trauma, such as hitting his right leg against a chair <fact4>2 days ago</fact4>, suggest a possible underlying bone disorder. The presence of <fact13>joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities</fact13> further supports a diagnosis of a connective tissue disorder. The <fact12>blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae</fact12> is consistent with the presence of a condition known as blue sclerae, which is often associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). OI is a genetic disorder characterized by <fact17>insufficient production of procollagen type 1</fact17>, leading to fragile bones that are prone to fractures.

However, among patients with <fact9>CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm³</fact9>, no relationship was found between <fact10>DLBCL risk</fact10> and <fact11>cART adherence</fact11> (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains for the difference observed between the two <fact12>strata</fact12>?

Answer: The difference observed between the two strata can be explained by <fact13>effect modification</fact13>. In this case, the relationship between <fact7>cART adherence</fact7> and <fact8>DLBCL risk</fact8> is modified by the level of <fact4>CD4+T-lymphocyte count</fact4>. Specifically, among patients with <fact6>CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm³</fact6>, <fact7>cART adherence</fact7> is a significant predictor of <fact8>DLBCL risk</fact8>, whereas among patients with <fact9>CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm³</fact9>, no relationship is found between <fact8>DLBCL risk</fact8> and <fact11>cART adherence</fact11>. This suggests that the effect of <fact7>cART adherence</fact7> on <fact8>DLBCL risk</fact8> is dependent on the level of <fact4>CD4+T-lymphocyte count</fact4>, which is a classic example of effect modification."

A) CT of the hip
B) MRI of the hip
C) Radiograph of the hip
D) Radionuclide scan of the hip
E) Ultrasound of the hip","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>39-year-old African-American woman</fact1> presents to the emergency room with <fact2>hip pain</fact2>. She has a past medical history significant for <fact3>sarcoidosis</fact3> which was recently diagnosed <fact4>6 months ago</fact4> and is currently being treated. She reports that the pain started <fact5>2 weeks ago</fact5> and is localized to the <fact6>left hip and groin</fact6>. The pain has been getting progressively more intense. Her <fact7>temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C)</fact7>, <fact8>blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg</fact8>, <fact9>pulse is 80/min</fact9>, <fact10>respirations are 13/min</fact10>, and <fact11>oxygen saturation is 98% on room air</fact11>.

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>hip pain</fact2> with <fact12>pain with manipulation without restriction of range of motion of the hip</fact12> suggests a possible hip fracture. In patients with sarcoidosis, the risk of osteonecrosis (also known as avascular necrosis) is increased, which can lead to fractures. The most sensitive test for diagnosing osteonecrosis is the <fact13>MRI of the hip</fact13>. MRI is more sensitive than other imaging modalities, such as CT, radiograph, radionuclide scan, and ultrasound, in detecting early changes of osteonecrosis. Therefore, the most sensitive test for this condition is option {B}."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: C) Ichthyosis vulgaris

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>excessively dry skin</fact2> that is <fact5>worse in winter and better in summer</fact5> is characteristic of ichthyosis vulgaris. This condition is often associated with <fact3>dry, scaly skin</fact3> that is present from birth, as seen in this patient who had <fact3>dry, scaly skin</fact3> since he was <fact4>6 months old</fact4>. The absence of <fact6>itching, redness, or discharge</fact6> also supports this diagnosis. The physical examination findings of <fact7>generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body</fact7>, except in the <fact8>skin creases of the neck</fact8> and in the <fact9>cubital and popliteal fossae</fact9>, are also consistent with ichthyosis vulgaris.

Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient’s current condition?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>right-sided back pain</fact2>, <fact3>nausea</fact3>, and <fact4>dark urine</fact4> with <fact5>alternating episodes of decreased urine output</fact5> and <fact6>temporary increase in urine output</fact6> for the past <fact7>2 days</fact7> is suggestive of kidney stones causing obstruction. The presence of <fact8>two urinary tract infections</fact8> in the past year may also contribute to the formation of kidney stones. However, the patient's history of <fact9>Crohn disease</fact9> and <fact10>small bowel resection</fact10> is a significant risk factor for <fact24>malabsorption of fatty acids</fact24>, which is a known risk factor for the formation of kidney stones. This is because fatty acids can combine with calcium to form insoluble calcium soaps, which can precipitate out of solution and form stones. The patient's <fact14>family history of recurrent kidney stones</fact14> also supports the idea that genetic factors may play a role in the formation of kidney stones. However, among the provided options, the factor that has most likely contributed most to this patient’s current condition is <fact24>malabsorption of fatty acids</fact24>, which is a known complication of Crohn disease and small bowel resection."
857,"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for two weeks of low-grade fever and sore throat. Upon further questioning, the patient is found to have unprotected sex with both men and women with 3-5 partners per month. On workup, he is found to have an HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL with a CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3. He is started on medical therapy. What should be included in his medication regimen?
A) Azithromycin
B) Dapsone
C) Fluconazole
D) Folinic acid
E) Tetrahydrofolic acid","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>45-year-old man</fact1> presents to his primary care provider for <fact2>two weeks of low-grade fever and sore throat</fact2>. Upon further questioning, the patient is found to have <fact3>unprotected sex with both men and women with 3-5 partners per month</fact3>. On workup, he is found to have an <fact4>HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL</fact4> with a <fact5>CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3</fact5>. He is started on medical therapy. What should be included in his medication regimen?

Answer: Given the patient's <fact4>HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL</fact4> and <fact5>CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3</fact5>, which indicates that he is in the early stages of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the recommended treatment to suppress viral replication and prevent disease progression [1]. The goal of ART is to achieve viral suppression, defined as an HIV-1 RNA viral load of less than 200 copies/mL [2].

The preferred first-line regimen for ART in adults typically includes a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) [3]. However, given the patient's high-risk behavior, including <fact3>unprotected sex with multiple partners</fact3>, a regimen that includes tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) would be an effective option to prevent HIV transmission to his sexual partners [4].

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a preferred NRTI due to its high efficacy and safety profile, including its ability to reduce the risk of HIV transmission [5]. Emtricitabine (FTC) is another NRTI that is commonly used in combination with TDF to prevent HIV transmission and is also effective against hepatitis B [6].

Therefore, the medication regimen that should be included in the patient's treatment plan is a combination of TDF and FTC, which is a recommended first-line regimen for ART in adults with HIV.

Answer: Considering the patient's symptoms of <fact1>vertigo</fact1> and <fact2>unsteadiness while walking</fact2>, along with the presence of <fact3>tinnitus in her right ear</fact3> and <fact4>hearing loss in the right ear</fact4>, it suggests a possible vestibular schwannoma, a type of tumor that affects the vestibulocochlear nerve. The presence of <fact5>an MRI of the brain</fact5> further supports the need for a pathologic examination to determine the nature of the lesion. Among the options provided, choice A describes whorls of densely packed cells with areas of <fact6>lamellated calcification</fact6>, which is characteristic of meningiomas, a type of brain tumor that can cause vestibular symptoms. However, vestibular schwannomas are more likely to be associated with the described symptoms. Therefore, the answer is not A. 

However, vestibular schwannomas are typically composed of <fact13> Antoni A and Antoni B areas</fact13>, which are not listed among the options. But, among the options provided, choice E describes cells with <fact11>clear cytoplasm</fact11> and central round nucleus resembling a <fact12>fried egg</fact12>, which is characteristic of schwannomas, including vestibular schwannomas. Therefore, the answer is {E}."
