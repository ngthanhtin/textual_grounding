789,"A 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1 at 24 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. She has a history of preterm birth. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate 100/min; respiratory rate 13/min; and temperature 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered. Betamethasone stimulates which fetal cells?
A) Type I pneumocytes
B) Goblet cells
C) Bronchial epithelial cells
D) Type II pneumocytes
E) Vascular smooth myocytes","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>26-year-old gravida 2 para 1</fact1> at <fact2>24 weeks gestation</fact2> is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with <fact3>mild abdominal cramps</fact3>, <fact4>uterine contractions</fact4>, and a <fact5>watery vaginal discharge</fact5>. She has a history of <fact6>preterm birth</fact6>. The <fact7>vital signs are as follows</fact7>: <fact8>blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg</fact8>; <fact9>heart rate 100/min</fact9>; <fact10>respiratory rate 13/min</fact10>; and <fact11>temperature 36.6℃ (97.9℉)</fact11>. The <fact12>pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening</fact12>. <fact13>Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm</fact13>, which is consistent with <fact14>preterm labor</fact14>. A <fact15>tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered</fact15>. Betamethasone stimulates which <fact16>fetal cells?</fact16>

Answer: The administration of <fact15>betamethasone</fact15> in this scenario is intended to promote fetal lung maturity, particularly in the context of <fact2>24 weeks gestation</fact2> and a history of <fact6>preterm birth</fact6>. The primary mechanism of action of betamethasone is to stimulate the production of surfactant in the <fact17>fetal lungs</fact17>, which is essential for reducing the surface tension in the alveoli and facilitating gas exchange. Surfactant is produced by <fact18>type II pneumocytes</fact18> in the fetal lungs. Therefore, betamethasone stimulates <fact16>fetal cells</fact16> of type II pneumocytes, which are responsible for the production of surfactant."
862,"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin. One week ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
A) Malaria
B) Acute myelogenous leukemia
C) Cholecystitis
D) Renal papillary necrosis
E) Splenic sequestration crisis","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>3-year-old boy</fact1> is brought to the physician because of a <fact2>3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin</fact2>. One week ago, he had an <fact3>upper respiratory tract infection</fact3>. Examination shows <fact4>jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae</fact4>. The <fact5>spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin</fact5>. His <fact6>hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl</fact6> and his <fact7>mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell</fact7>. A <fact8>Coombs test is negative</fact8>. A <fact9>peripheral blood smear is shown</fact9>. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?

Answer: Based on the information provided, this patient is at greatest risk for <fact10>Acute myelogenous leukemia</fact10> (B). The patient's symptoms of <fact2>fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin</fact2> and the presence of <fact4>jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae</fact4> suggest a hemolytic anemia. The <fact5>splenomegaly</fact5> indicated by the palpable spleen tip is consistent with a hemolytic anemia. The patient's low <fact6>hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dl</fact6> and high <fact7>mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 39% Hb/cell</fact7> further support the diagnosis of a hemolytic anemia. The negative <fact8>Coombs test</fact8> rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear is not described, but in the context of a hemolytic anemia, it would likely show evidence of hemolysis, such as schistocytes or spherocytes. The risk factors for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) include a history of previous cancer, radiation exposure, and certain genetic disorders. In this case, the patient's history of <fact3>upper respiratory tract infection</fact3> one week prior to the onset of symptoms is unlikely to be directly related to the development of AML. However, the patient's age and the presence of a hemolytic anemia increase the risk for AML."

The presence of <fact18>Alkaline phosphatase 452 U/L</fact18> is also consistent with cholestasis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by cholestasis and destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. Cutaneous xanthomas are a common finding in patients with PBC."
996,"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
A) Polyhydramnios
B) Acute respiratory distress syndrome
C) Caudal regression syndrome
D) Meconium aspiration
E) Placental abruption","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>36-year-old woman</fact1>, <fact2>gravida 3, para 2</fact2>, at <fact3>42 weeks' gestation</fact3> comes to the physician for <fact4>induction of labor</fact4>.

Her only <fact8>medication is a prenatal vitamin</fact8>. She is <fact9>165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall</fact9> and weighs <fact10>86 kg (200 lb)</fact10>; <fact11>BMI is 33 kg/m2</fact11>. Her <fact12>temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F)</fact12>, <fact13>pulse is 90/min</fact13>, <fact14>respirations are 14/min</fact14>, and <fact15>blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg</fact15>. Examination shows a <fact16>nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation</fact16>. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?

Answer: The patient is a <fact1>36-year-old woman</fact1> at <fact3>42 weeks' gestation</fact3> with a history of <fact2>uncomplicated vaginal deliveries</fact2> at <fact7>41 and 42 weeks' gestation</fact7> for her previous two children. This information suggests that she is at risk for postdates pregnancy, which is defined as a pregnancy that extends beyond 42 weeks' gestation. Postdates pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of meconium aspiration syndrome in the newborn. Meconium aspiration syndrome is a condition that occurs when the newborn inhales meconium, which is a combination of intestinal and gastric secretions, into the lungs during delivery. This can cause respiratory distress, pneumonitis, and even death. Therefore, the child of this patient is at greatest risk for meconium aspiration. The answer is {D}."

Physical exam reveals <fact16>crackles on pulmonary exam</fact16> and <fact17>S4 on cardiac auscultation</fact17>. Which of the following is the next best step in management?

Answer: Based on the patient's presentation of <fact2>cough and fatigue</fact2> with a <fact3>nursing home</fact3> background and <fact4>confusion for the past day</fact4>, it is essential to consider the possibility of a <fact18>healthcare-associated pneumonia</fact18> or <fact19>urinary tract infection</fact19> as the cause of his symptoms. The patient's vital signs indicate a <fact11>fever of 102°F (38.9°C)</fact11>, an elevated <fact13>pulse of 120/min</fact13>, and increased <fact14>respirations at 15/min</fact14>, which are signs of an infection. The presence of <fact16>crackles on pulmonary exam</fact16> suggests a possible <fact20>lower respiratory tract infection</fact20>. The <fact17>S4 on cardiac auscultation</fact17> may indicate cardiac dysfunction. Given these factors, the next best step in management is to initiate antibiotic therapy. Among the options provided, choice D, <fact21>Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and admission to the intensive care unit</fact21>, is the most appropriate choice as it covers a broad spectrum of bacteria, including those commonly causing healthcare-associated pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Additionally, admission to the intensive care unit is warranted due to the patient's unstable condition and potential need for close monitoring and supportive care."

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability</fact2> with a <fact3>palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region</fact16> is indicative of pyloric stenosis, a condition characterized by the narrowing of the pyloric channel. This condition leads to <fact3>projectile vomiting after most feedings</fact3> due to the obstruction of the gastric outlet. The vomiting is often <fact4>forceful and projectile</fact4>, and the infant may appear <fact12>mildly dehydrated</fact12> and <fact13>irritable</fact13> due to the loss of fluids and electrolytes. The <fact15>abdomen is soft and nontender</fact15> in the early stages of pyloric stenosis, but a <fact16>palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region</fact16> may be felt as the condition progresses. The metabolic consequences of persistent vomiting in pyloric stenosis include the loss of hydrogen ions, leading to a decrease in hydrogen ion concentration in the blood, which results in <fact17>metabolic alkalosis</fact17>. Therefore, the acid-base disturbance most likely associated with this patient’s condition is metabolic alkalosis."

A) Can form an endospore
B) Has a rabbit reservoir
C) Has no cell wall
D) Is more common in parrot owners
E) Is transmitted by air conditioning

Answer: C) Has no cell wall

The patient's symptoms of <fact2>fever and diarrhea</fact2> after traveling abroad, combined with the presence of <fact9>cough</fact9> and <fact10>headache</fact10>, suggest an infectious etiology. The history of <fact4>kayaking</fact4> and <fact5>spas</fact5> suggests potential exposure to contaminated water, while <fact6>interacting with local animals</fact6> and <fact7>eating local foods</fact7> increases the risk of zoonotic transmission. The patient's <fact12>15-pack-year history of smoking</fact12> may also contribute to his susceptibility to infection.

The <fact13>temperature of 102.3°F (39.1°C)</fact13> and <fact17>O2 saturation of 91% on room air</fact17> indicate a systemic infection. The <fact18>chest exam revealing fine crackles on auscultation</fact18> and <fact19>chest radiograph showing patchy infiltrates in both lungs</fact19> suggest a respiratory infection.

Given these factors, the organism most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is Legionella pneumophila, which is associated with <fact21>characteristic C: Has no cell wall</fact21>. This bacterium is a gram-negative rod that lacks a cell wall, and it is commonly found in aquatic environments, including contaminated water sources such as those encountered during kayaking or spa activities. Legionella pneumophila is also known to be transmitted through aerosolized water droplets, which may be associated with <fact22>characteristic E: Is transmitted by air conditioning</fact22>. However, the most distinctive characteristic of Legionella pneumophila is its lack of a cell wall."
448,"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for recurrent vomiting that began 5 hours ago. He describes the vomitus as bloody and containing black specks. He drinks 10–12 beers daily and has not seen a physician in 15 years. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 122/min, and blood pressure is 85/59 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time.

He is <fact15>oriented to person but not to place or time</fact15>. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?

Answer: Given the patient's presentation of <fact2>recurrent vomiting</fact2> with <fact4>vomitus as bloody and containing black specks</fact4>, along with his history of <fact5>10–12 beers daily</fact5> and lack of medical attention for <fact6>15 years</fact6>, it is likely that he has developed a condition such as gastritis or esophageal varices, which can lead to <fact16>upper gastrointestinal bleeding</fact16>. The presence of <fact11>decreased radial pulses</fact11>, <fact12>delayed capillary refill</fact12>, and <fact14>distended abdomen</fact14> suggests that the patient may be experiencing shock, which can be caused by blood loss. The patient's altered mental status, as indicated by being <fact15>oriented to person but not to place or time</fact15>, is also consistent with shock. In a patient experiencing shock, the body's ability to maintain blood flow to vital organs is compromised, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance. This is because the body attempts to compensate for the loss of blood volume by constricting peripheral blood vessels, which increases systemic vascular resistance but ultimately fails to maintain adequate blood flow to vital organs. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?

Answer: B) Physostigmine

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of <fact4>muscle spasms</fact4>, <fact5>blurred vision</fact5>, <fact6>dry mouth</fact6>, and <fact7>hallucinations</fact7> are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, which is a common side effect of certain plant toxins. The physical exam findings of <fact9>dry red skin</fact9> and <fact10>enlarged pupils</fact10> further support this diagnosis. Physostigmine is an anticholinesterase inhibitor that is used to treat anticholinergic toxicity. It works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, which can help to reverse the effects of anticholinergic poisoning. In this case, physostigmine would be the most likely drug to be administered to treat the patient's symptoms."

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>63-year-old man</fact1> has a history of <fact5>myocardial infarction</fact5> <fact6>4 years ago</fact6> and is now experiencing <fact3>leg swelling</fact3> and <fact4>right upper abdominal tenderness</fact4>. His <fact17>blood pressure is elevated at 150/90 mm Hg</fact17>, and he has a <fact14>24-pack-year history of smoking</fact14>, which increases his risk for cardiovascular disease. The presence of <fact24>jugular vein distention</fact24> and <fact25>bilateral lower leg pitting edema</fact25> suggests right-sided heart failure. The cardiac <fact28>auscultation</fact28> findings of a decreased <fact29>S1</fact29>, <fact30>S3 gallop</fact30>, and <fact31>grade 3/6 systolic murmur</fact31> are consistent with left-sided heart failure. However, the presence of <fact34>ascites</fact34> and <fact38>hepatic margin 3 cm below the right costal margin</fact38> indicates liver congestion, which is more indicative of right-sided heart failure.

A) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
B) Western blot
C) Rapid HIV antibody test
D) Polymerase chain reaction

Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the <fact4>genetic material of HIV</fact4> if the child had been infected?

Answer: To detect the <fact4>genetic material of HIV</fact4> in the child, the hospital would use a <fact5>polymerase chain reaction</fact5> (PCR). This is because PCR is a molecular biology technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences, making it possible to detect the genetic material of HIV in the child. This is particularly useful in cases where the child may have been infected with HIV, as it allows for the detection of the virus's genetic material even if the child has not yet developed antibodies to the virus. 

PCR is a sensitive and specific technique that can detect even small amounts of HIV genetic material in the child's blood or other bodily fluids. It is commonly used in clinical settings to diagnose HIV infection in infants and children, particularly in cases where the mother's HIV status is unknown or where the child's symptoms suggest possible HIV infection.

The other options are not correct because:

* ELISA (A) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects antibodies to HIV, not the genetic material of the virus.
* Western blot (B) is a laboratory test that detects antibodies to HIV by separating proteins in a sample and detecting specific antibodies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
* Rapid HIV antibody test (C) is a quick test that detects antibodies to HIV in a person's blood, but it is not used to detect the genetic material of the virus.
* Southern blot (E) is a laboratory test that detects specific DNA sequences in a sample, but it is not commonly used to detect HIV genetic material in clinical settings."

Answer: 
The patient's presentation is suggestive of lead poisoning, which is consistent with the <fact11>small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling</fact11> found on the peripheral blood smear. Lead poisoning can occur due to ingestion of lead-containing substances, such as paint or contaminated water. In lead poisoning, the conversion of <fact12>ferrous iron to ferric iron</fact12> is impaired, leading to decreased heme synthesis and resulting in the production of abnormal red blood cells. Therefore, the process most likely impaired in this patient is the conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron, which is option {A}."

1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.","Reformatted Question: Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?

Answer: B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

Explanation: A type 1 error is a statistical error that occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis. In the context of the provided research abstract, a type 1 error would mean that the authors incorrectly concluded that mepolizumab significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and improved markers of asthma control when, in fact, the null hypothesis (i.e., that there is no significant difference between the study groups) is true. This is in line with option B, which states that a type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error."
301,"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling.

This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?
A) Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock
B) Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock
C) Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock
D) Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock
E) Inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>5-year-old boy</fact1> is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations? 
A) Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock
B) Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock
C) Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock
D) Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock
E) Inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock

Answer: The patient's symptoms, including an irregular gait and the left leg dropping when standing on the right leg, suggest a condition affecting the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down to the legs. The symptoms are most consistent with sciatic nerve palsy, which can be caused by the injection of a vaccine into the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve runs through the piriformis muscle in the buttock, and injections into the inferomedial quadrant of the buttock are more likely to cause sciatic nerve palsy. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}."

Despite <fact7>appropriate therapy</fact7>, the patient dies. A <fact8>photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is shown</fact8>. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow?

Answer: To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided. The patient has a <fact2>3-day history of a productive cough and shortness of breath</fact2>, indicating a respiratory infection. The presence of <fact3>crackles over the right upper and the entire left lung fields</fact3> further supports this, as crackles are often associated with consolidation or inflammation in the lungs. The <fact6>sputum culture confirms infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae</fact6>, a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia.

The question asks which mediator is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow in the photomicrograph of the lung section. The presence of an arrow in the photomicrograph suggests that the cell-type being pointed to is of particular interest. Given the context of the patient's infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, it is likely that the cell-type being pointed to is an inflammatory cell, such as a neutrophil.

Among the options provided, <fact1>Immunoglobulin E (IgE)</fact1> is a mediator associated with allergic reactions and is not directly related to the patient's respiratory infection. <fact2>Platelet activating factor (PAF)</fact2> is a mediator involved in inflammation and is associated with neutrophil activation, making it a strong candidate for the correct answer. <fact3>Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)</fact3> is a cytokine involved in the immune response to viral infections and is not directly related to the patient's bacterial infection. <fact4>Interleukin-10 (IL-10)</fact4> is an anti-inflammatory cytokine and is not typically associated with neutrophil activation. <fact5>Leukotriene D4 (LTD4)</fact5> is a mediator involved in allergic reactions and is not directly related to the patient's respiratory infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is {B} Platelet activating factor, as it is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow, which is likely a neutrophil."

He is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?

Answer: B) Gp Ib

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth</fact2> for the past week, along with the laboratory findings of decreased <fact8>Factor VIII activity</fact8> and <fact9>Ristocetin cofactor assay</fact9>, suggests a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD). VWD is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is a protein that plays a critical role in platelet adhesion and aggregation. The Ristocetin cofactor assay is a specific test for VWF activity, and a decreased result indicates a deficiency or dysfunction of VWF. The bleeding time of 6 minutes is also consistent with a platelet adhesion disorder, which is a hallmark of VWD.

In the coagulation cascade, Gp Ib is a receptor on platelets that binds to VWF, facilitating platelet adhesion and aggregation. A deficiency or dysfunction of Gp Ib would disrupt this process, leading to bleeding symptoms similar to those experienced by the patient. Therefore, the aspect of coagulation that would most likely be affected is Gp Ib.

References:

* The patient's symptoms of <fact2>bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth</fact2> for the past week are consistent with a bleeding disorder.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of <fact3>failed to gain weight</fact3>, <fact4>chronic diarrhea</fact4>, and <fact5>multiple bacterial and viral infections</fact5> since birth, along with an <fact6>absent thymic shadow</fact6> and a <fact7>lymph node biopsy demonstrating the absence of germinal centers</fact7>, is indicative of a severe immunodeficiency disorder. The absence of germinal centers in lymph nodes is characteristic of a disorder affecting the B-cell development. The absence of a thymic shadow suggests a problem with T-cell development. The combination of these findings points towards a condition affecting both T-cell and B-cell development. Among the options provided, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, which is a disorder that affects both T-cell and B-cell development, leading to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This condition is characterized by the absence of germinal centers in lymph nodes and an absent thymic shadow on imaging. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}."

Postpartum examination shows a <fact7>third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position</fact7>. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following complications?

Answer: C) Fecal incontinence

Explanation: The patient had a <fact7>third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position</fact7> following a <fact6>vacuum-assisted delivery</fact6>. This type of laceration involves damage to the anal sphincter and the perineal body, which can lead to fecal incontinence. This is a common complication of third- and fourth-degree perineal lacerations, which are often associated with vacuum-assisted deliveries (1). The patient's <fact3>pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes</fact3> and <fact4>fetal weight is estimated to be at the 90th percentile for gestational age</fact4>, which may have contributed to the difficulty in the <fact5>second stage of labor</fact5> and the subsequent laceration (2). The patient is most likely to experience fecal incontinence as a complication of her third-degree laceration.

On repeat exam, <fact24>lower extremity strength is 3/5</fact24> with <fact25>diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes</fact25>. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?

Answer: 

The patient's presentation of <fact2>4 days of intermittent vomiting</fact2> and <fact3>5-6 daily loose stools</fact3> with <fact4>bloody stools</fact4> and <fact5>decreased oral intake of food and water</fact5> over the last <fact6>24 hours</fact6> suggests a gastrointestinal infection. The <fact8>temperature of 102.2°F (39°C)</fact8> and <fact13>dry mucous membranes</fact13> further support this diagnosis. The patient's <fact24>lower extremity weakness</fact24> and <fact25>diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes</fact25> on the next day suggest a potential neurological complication.

The key phrase <fact22>lower extremity weakness</fact22> and <fact25>diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes</fact25> are most relevant to answering the question, which is about lab findings related to the neurological complication. 

The patient's symptoms of <fact22>lower extremity weakness</fact22> and <fact25>diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes</fact25> are indicative of a neurological complication. The most likely cause of this complication is a Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare autoimmune disorder that occurs after a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection. GBS is characterized by ascending paralysis and areflexia.

The correct answer is <D> Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count. This is because in GBS, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows an elevated protein level with a normal cell count, which is known as albuminocytologic dissociation."

The physician considers treatment with raloxifene. This medication would put her at increased risk of developing which of the following conditions?

Answer: A) Pulmonary embolism

Explanation: Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It has estrogen agonist effects on bone and lipid metabolism, but estrogen antagonist effects on breast and uterine tissue. One of the known side effects of raloxifene is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism. This is because estrogen agonist effects on blood clotting can increase the risk of blood clots. In this patient, the physician is considering treatment with raloxifene, which would put her at increased risk of developing pulmonary embolism."

Answer: The patient's symptoms, including <fact2>decreased urinary output and malaise</fact2> two weeks after undergoing an emergency <fact3>cardiac catheterization with stenting</fact3> for <fact4>unstable angina pectoris</fact4>, are suggestive of a renal complication. The presence of <fact23>intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles</fact23> on renal biopsy is a characteristic finding of cholesterol embolization syndrome (CES). This condition occurs when cholesterol crystals from atherosclerotic plaques are dislodged and embolize to the kidneys, leading to renal dysfunction. The patient's recent cardiac catheterization and stenting, as well as his history of <fact5>type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact5> and <fact6>osteoarthritis of the hips</fact6>, increase his risk for atherosclerosis and subsequent CES. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is <fact24>cholesterol embolization</fact24>."

683,"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated.

Answer: Based on the patient's history of <fact5>cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child</fact5> and <fact6>severe pneumonia when he was 9-years-old</fact6>, it is likely that he has a mutation in a protein class that affects the development and function of the respiratory and possibly the reproductive systems. The patient's <fact13>absence of a cardiac murmur</fact13> in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line is consistent with a possible mutation in a protein class that affects the development of the heart, specifically the ventricles. The combination of these symptoms points towards a mutation in a protein class involved in the development and function of cilia, which are essential for the development of the respiratory, reproductive, and cardiac systems. The most relevant class of proteins is the <fact14>microtubule-associated proteins</fact14>, specifically the dynein proteins, which are retrograde cytoskeletal motor proteins involved in the movement of cilia.

While observing <fact4>sinus tachycardia</fact4> on the patient's telemetry, you note that the <fact5>radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration</fact5>. What should be the next step in management of this patient?

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>34-year-old patient</fact1> who was involved in a motor vehicle accident has an EKG showing <fact2>sinus tachycardia</fact2> and a chest radiograph revealing an <fact3>enlarged cardiac silhouette</fact3>. These findings suggest cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, compressing the heart and impeding its function. The absence of a palpable <fact5>radial pulse during inspiration</fact5> further supports this diagnosis, as it is indicative of pulsus paradoxus, a hallmark of cardiac tamponade. Given this clinical picture, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform pericardiocentesis, a procedure to drain the accumulated fluid from the pericardial sac and relieve the compression on the heart. Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."

Which of the following routes describes the most likely <fact6>lymphatic route</fact6> for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?

Answer: The patient has ovarian cancer with distant metastases in the lungs and brain. To determine the most likely lymphatic route for metastasis, we must consider the lymphatic drainage of the ovaries. The ovaries primarily drain to the para-aortic lymph nodes via the lumbar lymphatic trunks. However, the lymphatic drainage of the thoracic duct is responsible for draining the lymph from the lower body, including the pelvic region, to the left subclavian vein. Given the metastasis to the brain, which is located in the head and neck region, it is more likely that the malignancy spread through the thoracic duct to the left subclavian vein. Therefore, the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain is <fact7>sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation</fact7>. The correct answer is {B}."

E) <fact6>Dependent personality disorder</fact6>

Answer: The daughter's behavior of being very shy and withdrawn, socially isolated, and extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family, suggests a pattern of behavior that is consistent with <fact4>avoidant personality disorder</fact4>. According to the DSM-5, avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The daughter's statement that she is ""too lame and ugly and I just know I'll end up getting rejected"" further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates a deep-seated fear of rejection and a lack of confidence in social interactions. This pattern of behavior is also consistent with the daughter's refusal to participate in extracurricular activities due to feelings of inadequacy and her tendency to burst into tears when encouraged to invite friends over. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the daughter's behavior is <fact4>avoidant personality disorder</fact4>."

In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?

Answer: C) The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine.

Explanation: The laboratory is investigating the ribosome's ability to recognize a mischarged amino acid. To do this, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine. This creates a situation where the tRNA has the wrong amino acid attached to it. The laboratory then inserts this tRNA into the cell and designs an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. This means that the ribosome will attempt to incorporate the mischarged tRNA into the growing peptide chain at lysine codons.

Given this setup, the most likely outcome is that the mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated into the codons that specify for lysine. This is because the ribosome does not have a built-in proofreading mechanism to recognize and remove mischarged tRNAs (1). The ribosome will simply follow the instructions encoded in the mRNA and attempt to incorporate the mischarged tRNA into the peptide chain at the lysine codons.

In this scenario, the mischarged tRNA will not be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase (E), as this enzyme is responsible for attaching the correct amino acid to the tRNA, not removing the incorrect one. The proteasome (D) is a cellular complex involved in protein degradation, but it is not directly involved in the proofreading of tRNA aminoacylation. The ribosome will not terminate protein translation (B) due to the mischarged tRNA, as this is not a typical mechanism for termination. The ribosome will not recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine (A), as the ribosome does not have a built-in proofreading mechanism to recognize and remove mischarged tRNAs.

Answer: 
C) Decreased cardiac output

The patient's presentation with <fact2>worsening upper abdominal pain for the past 8 hours</fact2> radiating to her <fact3>back</fact3> and associated with <fact4>nausea</fact4> suggests a possible gastrointestinal issue. Her vital signs, including a low <fact11>blood pressure of 84/58 mm Hg</fact11> and an elevated <fact12>pulse of 115/min</fact12>, indicate hypotension and tachycardia, respectively. These signs are often associated with decreased cardiac output.

A <fact1>newborn boy</fact1> is evaluated for <fact2>tachypnea</fact2> six hours after birth. He was delivered at <fact3>41 weeks' gestation</fact3> via Caesarian section and the <fact4>amniotic fluid was meconium-stained</fact4>. His <fact5>respiratory rate is 75/min</fact5>. Physical examination shows <fact6>increased work of breathing</fact6>. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows <fact7>elevated pulmonary artery pressure</fact7>. He is started on an inhaled medication that <fact8>increases smooth muscle cGMP</fact8>, and there is immediate improvement in his <fact9>tachypnea and oxygenation status</fact9>. Three hours later, the newborn is <fact10>tachypneic</fact10> and there is <fact11>blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes</fact11>. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's <fact12>cyanosis</fact12>?

A) Increase in concentration of serum myoglobin
B) Closure of the ductus arteriosus
C) Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+
D) Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
E) Allosteric alteration of heme groups

Answer: 
The <fact1>newborn boy</fact1> was experiencing <fact2>tachypnea</fact2> with <fact6>increased work of breathing</fact6>, and his <fact7>elevated pulmonary artery pressure</fact7> was improved with an inhaled medication that <fact8>increases smooth muscle cGMP</fact8>. This indicates that the initial issue was related to pulmonary hypertension. However, the <fact11>blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes</fact11> that occurred later suggests a new issue. This discoloration is indicative of cyanosis, which is a condition characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to inadequate oxygenation of the blood.

The <fact1>newborn boy</fact1> had been experiencing <fact2>tachypnea</fact2> and <fact6>increased work of breathing</fact6> due to <fact7>elevated pulmonary artery pressure</fact7>, which was likely caused by the <fact4>meconium-stained amniotic fluid</fact4> indicating possible fetal distress during delivery. The <fact8>improvement in tachypnea and oxygenation status</fact8> after the inhaled medication suggests that the initial issue was related to pulmonary hypertension. However, the <fact11>blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes</fact11> that occurred later suggests a new issue.

The <fact1>blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes</fact11> is indicative of cyanosis, which is a condition characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to inadequate oxygenation of the blood. This condition is often caused by issues related to the hemoglobin molecule, which is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. The <fact1>increase in concentration of serum myoglobin</fact1> (Option A) is not directly related to the <fact12>cyanosis</fact12> in this case.

The <fact1>closure of the ductus arteriosus</fact1> (Option B) is a normal process that occurs after birth, but it is not directly related to the <fact12>cyanosis</fact12> in this case.

The <fact1>oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+</fact1> (Option C) is a process that occurs in the mitochondria and is related to the production of ATP, but it is not directly related to the <fact12>cyanosis</fact12> in this case.

The <fact1>inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase</fact1> (Option D) is a process that can cause cyanosis, but it is not directly related to the <fact12>cyanosis</fact12> in this case.

The <fact1>allosteric alteration of heme groups</fact1> (Option E) is a process that can cause cyanosis, and it is related to the hemoglobin molecule, which is responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. The <fact1>allosteric alteration of heme groups</fact1> can cause a change in the shape of the hemoglobin molecule, which can lead to a decrease in the ability of the hemoglobin to carry oxygen, resulting in cyanosis.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this infant's <fact12>cyanosis</fact12> is the <fact1>allosteric alteration of heme groups</fact1> (Option E)."

Answer: Considering the <fact1>Beta-globin gene mutation</fact1> that affects the <fact2>translation of the Beta-globin mRNA</fact2>, it is associated with <fact3>thalassemia intermedia</fact3>. Thalassemia intermedia is characterized by a <fact4>mild to moderate reduction in hemoglobin production</fact4> due to the mutation in the Beta-globin gene. The <fact5>blood smear in a patient with thalassemia intermedia</fact5> typically shows <fact6>microcytic red blood cells</fact6> due to the reduced hemoglobin production.

The <fact14>bilateral disc hyperemia</fact14> found on fundoscopy indicates possible increased intracranial pressure. Among the options provided, demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus is a condition that affects the coordination of eye movements, leading to symptoms such as those described in the patient. This condition is consistent with the patient's symptoms and history. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is {A}."

What is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?

Answer: B) Antibodies directed against phospholipids

Explanation: 
The patient's presentation of <fact2>aching pain in her left leg</fact2> that has progressively gotten worse over several days, following an <fact3>unfortunate sporting incident</fact3> resulting in <fact4>large bruises along both legs and lower thighs</fact4>, is indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The presence of a <fact14>thrombus in the left popliteal vein</fact14> confirmed by <fact14>Doppler ultrasound</fact14> further supports this diagnosis. The patient's past medical history of <fact6>systemic lupus erythematosus</fact6> is a significant risk factor for developing antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antibodies directed against phospholipids. These antibodies can lead to the formation of blood clots, including DVT. The patient's lab results show a prolonged <fact17>Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) of 90 sec</fact17> and a mixing study (PTT) of 89 sec, which suggests the presence of an inhibitor of the coagulation cascade, consistent with APS. The presence of antibodies directed against phospholipids is the most likely cause of the patient's condition."

Answer: C) Cyclothymic disorder

Explanation: The patient's presentation of experiencing several periods of <fact4>depressed mood</fact4> over the past <fact3>3 years</fact3>, which resolve after <fact6>4-6 weeks</fact6>, is consistent with a diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder. Additionally, her reports of experiencing occasional episodes of <fact13>elevated mood</fact13> over the past <fact14>ten years</fact14> further supports this diagnosis. Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by periods of hypomanic symptoms that last for at least 2 years, with no more than 2 months of symptom-free periods, and periods of depressive symptoms that last for at least 2 years, with no more than 2 months of symptom-free periods. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with this diagnosis."

The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the <fact11>innate immune system</fact11>. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?

Answer: The patient's symptoms of <fact2>itching</fact2> and <fact3>frequent and painful urination</fact3> suggest a urinary tract infection, and the growth of <fact5>diplococci</fact5> on <fact7>Thayer-Martin agar</fact7> confirms the diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. The patient's history of <fact9>meningitis</fact9> and infection with <fact10>Streptococcus pneumoniae</fact10> suggests a deficiency in the innate immune system, specifically the complement system. The component that is likely deficient in this patient is C3, which plays a crucial role in the alternative complement pathway (E). C3 is an important opsonin (A) and is degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor (C), but these functions are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or history. The creation of pores in the cell membrane (D) is a function of the membrane attack complex, which is formed by the activation of C5-C9. Angioedema (B) is associated with a deficiency in C1 esterase inhibitor, but this is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or history.

Note: The complement system is a part of the innate immune system that helps to defend against infections. It consists of a series of small proteins that work together to help destroy pathogens. The alternative complement pathway is one of the three complement pathways and is activated by the presence of pathogens. C3 is a key component of the alternative complement pathway and plays a crucial role in the activation of the complement system. A deficiency in C3 can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Streptococcus pneumoniae."

What is the chance that their child will have the <fact9>disease of interest</fact9>?

Relevant Key Phrases: 
1. disease
2. recurrent upper respiratory infections
3. antibiotic prophylaxis
4. chest physiotherapy
5. pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy
6. without this disease phenotype
7. prevalence of this disease
8. 1/100
9. disease of interest

Answer: The disease of interest is cystic fibrosis, which is characterized by recurrent upper respiratory infections, requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy, as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The man does not have this disease phenotype, which means he is a carrier of the recessive allele. The prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the population is 1/100, which means the frequency of the recessive allele is also 1/100. Since the man is a carrier, he has one recessive allele and one normal allele, making the probability of passing the recessive allele to the child 1/2. The female has two recessive alleles, so the probability of passing two recessive alleles to the child is 1/4. The probability of the child having cystic fibrosis is the product of these probabilities, which is 1/2 x 1/4 = 1/8. However, the question asks for the chance that the child will have the disease of interest, which means the child can be either homozygous recessive (1/8) or heterozygous (1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4). Therefore, the total probability is 1/8 + 1/4 = 3/8."

Answer: The patient is a <fact1>24-year-old woman</fact1> who is <fact6>tearful about the pregnancy</fact6> and has decided to <fact8>medically abort her 6-week pregnancy</fact8>. Medical abortion is a process that involves taking medications to end an early pregnancy. The most commonly used medication for medical abortion is mifepristone, which is a <fact9>progestin receptor antagonist</fact9> that works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary to maintain pregnancy. This is followed by the administration of misoprostol, a <fact10>prostaglandin E1 analog</fact10> that causes the uterus to contract and expel the pregnancy. The combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is highly effective for medical abortion, with a success rate of over 95% for pregnancies up to 9 weeks of gestation. Therefore, the drug that should be administered to this patient for this purpose is {D} Mifepristone."

Menses occur <fact6>regularly at 28-day intervals</fact6>. Her <fact7>temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F)</fact7>. Abdominal examination shows <fact8>tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding</fact8>. Pelvic ultrasound shows a <fact9>large simple cyst on the right ovary</fact9>. Right ovarian artery flow is <fact10>detectable on Doppler</fact10>, but there is no flow detected in the <fact11>right ovarian vein</fact11>. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>sudden-onset, severe right flank pain</fact2> without <fact4>trauma to the region</fact4> and a <fact9>large simple cyst on the right ovary</fact9> suggests a possible ovarian torsion. The absence of <fact11>right ovarian vein flow</fact11> on Doppler further supports this diagnosis. Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists around its ligamentous attachment, cutting off blood flow. The <fact5>history of recurrent ovarian cysts</fact5> increases the risk of ovarian torsion. The most common ligament involved in ovarian torsion is the <fact12>infundibulopelvic ligament</fact12>, which attaches the ovary to the pelvic sidewall. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

1222,"A 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism was found lying unconscious on a bench at a local park and rushed to the emergency department. Upon arrival, the patient regained consciousness and complained of intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes."" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:
A) Metabolic alkalosis
B) Anion gap metabolic acidosis
C) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
D) Respiratory acidosis
E) Respiratory alkalosis","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>49-year-old female</fact1> with a <fact2>history of alcoholism</fact2> was found lying <fact3>unconscious on a bench at a local park</fact3> and rushed to the <fact4>emergency department</fact4>.

A) <fact7>Metabolic alkalosis</fact7>
B) <fact8>Anion gap metabolic acidosis</fact8>
C) <fact9>Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis</fact9>
D) <fact10>Respiratory acidosis</fact10>
E) <fact11>Respiratory alkalosis</fact11>

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact1>intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination</fact1> is suggestive of kidney stones. The <fact6>Urine microscopy demonstrating abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes.”</fact6> is consistent with the presence of calcium oxalate stones, which are a common type of kidney stone. The formation of calcium oxalate stones is often associated with conditions that lead to hypercalciuria (excessive calcium in the urine) or hyperoxaluria (excessive oxalate in the urine). One of the conditions that can lead to hyperoxaluria is primary hyperoxaluria type 1, a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive oxalate production in the liver. However, the question does not provide information about a genetic disorder. Instead, the patient has a <fact2>history of alcoholism</fact2>, which can lead to an increased risk of developing kidney stones due to several factors, including the excretion of excess oxalate in the urine. The increased oxalate excretion can occur due to the impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin B12, which is essential for the proper metabolism of oxalate. 

The patient's presentation of <fact1>intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination</fact1> is suggestive of kidney stones, and the <fact6>Urine microscopy demonstrating abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes.”</fact6> is consistent with the presence of calcium oxalate stones. Given the patient's history of alcoholism, the most likely finding is <fact9>Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis</fact9>, which is often seen in patients with kidney stones due to the increased excretion of acidic substances in the urine. This type of metabolic acidosis is characterized by a decrease in bicarbonate levels, but the anion gap remains normal because the decrease in bicarbonate is matched by a decrease in chloride levels. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Ultrasonography does not show a <fact9>uterus or ovaries</fact9>. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?

Answer: Based on the provided information, the patient is a <fact1>15-year-old girl</fact1> who has not had a menstrual period, indicating primary amenorrhea. The absence of personal or family history of serious illness, along with normal vital signs, suggests that the patient's condition is likely related to a congenital or developmental issue. The examination findings, including a <fact5>secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola</fact5> and <fact6>sparse and lightly pigmented pubic hair</fact6>, are consistent with a condition that affects sexual development. The presence of <fact7>bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses</fact7> and a <fact8>blind-ended vaginal pouch</fact8> further supports this, as these findings are characteristic of a condition where the patient has undescended gonads, such as Swyer syndrome. Swyer syndrome is a condition where individuals have a 46,XY karyotype but develop as female due to a mutation in the SRY gene, leading to a failure of testicular development. This condition is often associated with a lack of ovaries and a blind-ending vagina. The absence of a <fact9>uterus or ovaries</fact9> on ultrasonography supports this diagnosis. The most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is <B> Gonadectomy</B>."

A) Displacement
B) Dissociation
C) Projection
D) Reaction formation
E) Repression

Answer: The man's actions are most consistent with psychological defense mechanism C) Projection.

Explanation: The man is accusing his wife of giving the waiter flirtatious looks and infidelity, when in fact he is the one who has been flirting with female coworkers. This is a classic example of projection, where an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. The man is unconsciously projecting his own behavior onto his wife, rather than acknowledging and taking responsibility for his own actions. This defense mechanism allows him to avoid feelings of guilt or shame and maintain a sense of moral superiority."

A <fact26>48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial</fact26> shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?

Answer: C) MRI of the pituitary gland

Explanation: The patient's presentation and laboratory results are indicative of Cushing's syndrome, a condition characterized by excess cortisol production. The patient's high <fact2>fatigue and weakness</fact2>, <fact8>obesity with a significant pannus</fact8>, and <fact9>abdominal striae</fact9> are consistent with the physical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome. The laboratory results, including the elevated <fact20>24-hour urinary cortisol</fact20> and <fact22>serum cortisol</fact22> levels, and the low <fact24>serum ACTH</fact24> level, further support this diagnosis. The failure of the <fact26>48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial</fact26> to decrease serum cortisol levels indicates that the cause of Cushing's syndrome is likely due to an ACTH-independent process, such as an adrenal tumor.

The best next step in management is to perform an <fact27>MRI of the pituitary gland</fact27> to evaluate for a pituitary tumor, which is a common cause of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. This imaging study will help to identify any potential tumors or other abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's condition."

The presence of a <fact14>genetic workup</fact14> revealing an inherited condition supports this possibility. Among the options provided, choice C describes a deficiency in protein C, which is a common cause of hereditary thrombophilia. This condition leads to a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of DVT and other thrombotic events. The answer is {C}."
267,"A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough.

A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough. He reports having shortness of breath over the last 6 months, but he has felt worse since he contracted a cold that has been traveling around his office. Today, he reports body aches, headache, and fever along with this chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for prediabetes, which he controls with exercise and diet. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), and respiratory rate is 18/min.

A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough, a 30-pack-year smoking history, and a pulmonary function test showing an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%, the patient is likely suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, body aches, headache, and fever, are consistent with an exacerbation of COPD. The patient's use of pursed-lip breathing, a barrel-shaped chest, and a flattened diaphragm on the chest X-ray are also indicative of COPD.

In COPD, the FEV1/FVC ratio is decreased, indicating airway obstruction. The patient's ABG is likely to show primary respiratory acidosis, as the patient is experiencing chronic respiratory acidosis due to the prolonged obstruction of airways. This is consistent with the patient's history of shortness of breath over the last 6 months and the current exacerbation of symptoms.

The primary respiratory acidosis is likely due to the patient's inability to adequately ventilate, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels in the blood. This is a common finding in patients with COPD, particularly during exacerbations.

Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."

Answer: Based on the patient's presentation of <fact2>abdominal pain and constipation</fact2>, <fact3>4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain</fact3>, and <fact4>4 days without a bowel movement</fact4>, it is likely that he has a condition affecting the colon. The presence of <fact15>multiple small, pedunculated polyps</fact15> and <fact16>multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings</fact16> on colonoscopy suggests a condition characterized by the formation of polyps and mucosal outpouchings. This is most strongly associated with <fact5>poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia</fact5>, which are risk factors for atherosclerosis, a condition that can lead to the formation of polyps and mucosal outpouchings. However, the most relevant finding is the presence of <fact16>multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings</fact16>, which is characteristic of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a genetic disorder that leads to the formation of multiple polyps and mucosal outpouchings in the colon. FAP is associated with mutations in the APC gene, which is involved in the regulation of cell growth and division. The presence of <fact7>40 pack-year smoking history</fact7> and <fact8>3-4 beers per day</fact8> also increases the risk of colon cancer, but the most likely diagnosis is FAP.

Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?

Answer: Given the patient's presentation of a <fact3>penetrating wound to the chest</fact3> with a <fact18>full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall</fact18>, the best definitive surgical approach is to repair the injury to the right ventricular free wall. This can be achieved through an interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets. This approach is the most appropriate because it allows for a secure closure of the wound and minimizes the risk of further complications. 

The use of interrupted sutures with pledgets is a common technique in cardiac surgery for repairing penetrating injuries to the heart. It provides a secure closure of the wound and minimizes the risk of further complications, such as cardiac tamponade or arrhythmias. This approach is also supported by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS COT) guidelines for the management of penetrating cardiac injuries, which recommend surgical repair of the injury as the definitive treatment."

Physical examination shows no abnormalities. When compared to a healthy <fact10>20-year-old woman</fact10>, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?

Answer: Considering the <fact1>76-year-old woman</fact1> with a history of <fact2>hypertension</fact2> well controlled with <fact3>diet and exercise</fact3>, her <fact6>physical activity level</fact6> is relatively low compared to a healthy <fact10>20-year-old woman</fact10>. This decrease in physical activity can lead to a decrease in lung function over time. One of the key changes in respiratory function associated with aging is a decrease in lung elasticity and strength, which results in decreased vital capacity. Additionally, the residual volume increases with age due to the loss of lung elastic recoil, which makes it more difficult for the lungs to deflate. However, the most significant change in respiratory function is the decrease in lung elasticity, which affects the vital capacity and residual volume. Therefore, the change in respiratory function most likely present in this patient is a decrease in vital capacity. However, the most likely correct answer is {C} because the residual volume is more likely to increase with age."

Relevant Key Phrases: 
- generalized anxiety disorder
- citalopram
- weak tumescence
- low libido
- blood pressure
- heart rate
- respiratory rate
- regular heart and lung sounds

Answer: The patient is experiencing <fact4>weak tumescence</fact4> and <fact5>low libido</fact5> as side effects of <fact3>citalopram</fact3>, which is used to treat <fact2>generalized anxiety disorder</fact2>. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of SSRIs. The appropriate step in the management of this patient is to consider the addition of a medication that can help alleviate these side effects. 

Among the options provided, the addition of <fact10>bupropion</fact10> is a reasonable choice. Bupropion is an antidepressant that can help with sexual dysfunction and is often used in combination with SSRIs. It is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which may help reduce the risk of sexual side effects. 

The answer is {B}."

A) Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
B) Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)
D) Decreases levels of HgbS

A) Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
B) Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)
D) Decreases levels of HgbS
E) Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)

Answer: C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)

Explanation: The question states that patients with sickle cell anemia make a specific type of hemoglobin known as HgbS, which is a mutation that results in the sickling of their red blood cells when exposed to inciting factors such as hypoxic conditions. Hydroxyurea is a treatment for sickle cell anemia, and its direct effect on hemoglobin physiology is to increase levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF). This is because hydroxyurea has been shown to increase the production of HgbF, which is the normal hemoglobin found in newborns and is less likely to cause sickling of red blood cells (1). Therefore, the correct answer is C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of <fact2>persistent bleeding from his nose</fact2> over the past <fact3>hour</fact3> suggests a nosebleed, or epistaxis. Given the spontaneous onset and unilateral nature of the bleeding, with no signs of trauma or underlying abnormalities, the most likely cause is a minor bleed from a small vessel in the nasal septum. The most appropriate initial therapy for this scenario is to apply pressure to the nasal cavity to stop the bleeding. Among the options provided, the correct answer is <fact13>squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated</fact13>, which is a simple and effective method to control epistaxis. This technique helps to constrict the blood vessels in the nasal septum and promote clotting."

A <fact1>23-year-old man</fact1> presents with <fact2>swelling of the left knee</fact2>. He noticed the <fact2>swelling</fact2> a day ago while preparing for the college <fact3>basketball game</fact3>. He has had approximately <fact4>10 different sexual partners</fact4> in the past <fact5>3 months</fact5>. Synovial fluid tap shows a <fact6>WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3</fact6>. What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient’s most likely condition?

Answer: 
Based on the information provided, the patient has a high WBC count in the synovial fluid, which suggests an infectious or inflammatory cause for the knee swelling. The patient's recent sexual activity and the presence of a high WBC count are indicative of septic arthritis, which is an infection of the joint caused by bacteria. The most common cause of septic arthritis in young adults is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is transmitted through sexual contact.

The treatment for septic arthritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Ceftriaxone works by inhibiting cell wall synthesis in bacteria, which ultimately leads to the death of the bacterial cells. This is an example of a <fact7>cell wall inhibitor</fact7> mechanism of action.

Therefore, the mechanism of action of the drug indicated for the treatment of this patient's most likely condition is a <fact8>cell wall inhibitor</fact8>."

Answer: B) Dantrolene

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact15>muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis</fact15> after the <fact14>appendiceal base is ligated</fact14> is indicative of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening medical emergency. The key symptoms of MH include muscle rigidity, high fever, and tachycardia. The patient's <fact16>temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F)</fact16>, <fact17>pulse is 130/min</fact17>, and <fact18>blood pressure is 146/70 mm Hg</fact18> further support this diagnosis. The most effective treatment for MH is <fact22>dantrolene</fact22>, a muscle relaxant that can rapidly reverse the symptoms of MH. Dantrolene works by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing muscle contraction and heat production. The use of dantrolene in this scenario is consistent with the treatment guidelines for malignant hyperthermia, which emphasize the importance of prompt administration of dantrolene to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

He was initially diagnosed following workup for <fact4>fatigue and pancytopenia</fact4>. He is fully conscious. His <fact5>blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg</fact5>, <fact6>temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F)</fact6>, <fact7>pulse is 98/min</fact7>, and <fact8>respiratory rate is 14/min</fact8>. Physical examination including examination of the central venous catheter site shows no source of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following factors about this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?

Answer: B) Cytogenetics

Explanation: The patient's <fact3>t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia</fact3> is a type of leukemia that is associated with a poor prognosis due to the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is a result of a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. This translocation leads to the creation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, which is a potent oncogene that drives the growth and proliferation of leukemic cells. The presence of this genetic abnormality is a strong indicator of a poor prognosis in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)."

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>unconsciousness on the street</fact2> and <fact8>bloody vomit with small clots and food particles</fact8> suggests a severe gastrointestinal bleed. The presence of <fact10>black tarry stool in the rectal vault</fact10> further supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's history of <fact3>alcoholism</fact3> and the presence of <fact9>alcohol</fact9> on his breath, it is likely that the cause of the bleeding is related to the gastrointestinal effects of alcohol. The most common cause of upper GI bleeding in alcoholics is peptic ulcer disease. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to undergo an upper GI endoscopy to visualize the mucosa and identify the source of bleeding. This will allow for the possibility of endoscopic treatment and/or biopsy to determine the cause of the bleeding. The answer is {B}."

The child’s <fact7>corneas</fact7> appear <fact8>irritated and erythematous</fact8>. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?

Answer: The patient's symptoms, including severe <fact2>sunburns</fact2> and <fact8>irritated and erythematous</fact8> <fact7>corneas</fact7>, suggest a condition related to <fact3>sunlight</fact3> exposure. This is a classic presentation of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in DNA repair genes. XP patients are highly sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light and often develop severe sunburns, skin lesions, and eye damage. The most relevant DNA repair process impaired in XP is <fact9>nucleotide excision repair (NER)</fact9>, which is responsible for repairing DNA damage caused by UV light. NER is a complex process that involves the recognition and removal of UV-induced DNA lesions, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts. The impaired NER process in XP patients leads to an accumulation of DNA damage, resulting in the observed symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

B) Protect against viral infections
C) Provide an initial humoral immune response to newly presenting bacterial antigens
D) Inhibiting bacterial adherance and colonization of mucous membranes
E) Provides the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream","Reformatted Question: The only immunoglobulin found as a dimer has what primary function?

Answer: Evaluating the question, it is asking about the primary function of the only immunoglobulin found as a dimer. Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are proteins produced by the immune system to fight infections. They can be found in various forms, including monomers and dimers. Among the options provided, choice E describes providing the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream, which is a characteristic of IgM, the only immunoglobulin found as a dimer. IgM plays a crucial role in the initial humoral immune response, providing immediate protection against infections by recognizing and binding to specific antigens in the bloodstream. Therefore, the correct answer is {E}."

A 3-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a <fact1>4-hour history of somnolence</fact1>, <fact2>poor feeding</fact2>, and <fact3>one episode of vomiting</fact3>. He is exclusively <fact4>breastfed</fact4>. His <fact5>serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL</fact5> and his <fact6>serum ammonia concentration is 850 μmol/L</fact6> (<fact7>N < 90</fact7>). Urinalysis shows an <fact8>increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio</fact8>. <fact9>Urinary ketones are absent</fact9>. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation, including <fact1>4-hour history of somnolence</fact1>, <fact2>poor feeding</fact2>, and <fact3>one episode of vomiting</fact3>, suggests a severe metabolic disorder. The elevated <fact6>serum ammonia concentration</fact6> of 850 μmol/L (<fact7>N < 90</fact7>) is particularly concerning and indicates a possible urea cycle disorder. The presence of an <fact8>increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio</fact8> in the urinalysis further supports this suspicion, as orotic acid is a byproduct of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, which is also affected in certain urea cycle disorders. The absence of <fact9>urinary ketones</fact9> rules out a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketotic disorders.

Considering the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is a urea cycle disorder, specifically ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. OTC is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of <fact10>ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline</fact10>. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to the accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is then shunted towards pyrimidine synthesis, resulting in the production of orotic acid.

Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

E) Complete cord transection","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>27-year-old gentleman</1> is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the <2>back by a knife</2>. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of <3>weakness in his left leg</3>. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has <4>2/5 strength in the left lower extremity</4>. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in <5>vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity</5> as well as a loss of <6>pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity</6>. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?

Answer: The patient's presentation, including <3>weakness in his left leg</3>, <4>2/5 strength in the left lower extremity</4>, <5>deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity</5>, and <6>loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity</6>, is indicative of a specific type of spinal cord injury. The loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity suggests a lesion affecting the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for transmitting pain and temperature sensation. The deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity indicates a lesion affecting the posterior columns of the spinal cord, which are responsible for transmitting these sensations. Given these findings, the lesion is most likely a <7>right cord hemisection</7>, which would result in the syndrome described. This type of lesion would affect the right half of the spinal cord, including the spinothalamic tract and the posterior columns, resulting in the loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity and the deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}."

The <fact12>color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye</fact12>. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?

Answer: B) High-risk sexual behaviour

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>blurred vision of her right eye</fact2> and <fact4>pain around her right eye during eye movement</fact4> for <fact3>2 days</fact3> is suggestive of optic neuritis, which is an inflammation of the optic nerve. The presence of <fact11>optic disk swelling in the right eye</fact11> on fundoscopic examination further supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of <fact10>mild bilateral pupillary dilation</fact10> and <fact12>decreased perception in the right eye</fact12> are also consistent with optic neuritis. The most common cause of optic neuritis is multiple sclerosis (MS), but it can also be caused by viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster virus (HZV), or bacterial infections, such as Lyme disease. However, given the patient's age and sex, the most likely cause of her symptoms is a viral infection. Specifically, HSV and HZV are both common causes of optic neuritis in young adults, particularly in women. Therefore, specific additional history should be obtained regarding high-risk sexual behavior, which could be associated with HSV infection."

He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation is indicative of <fact2>loss of appetite</fact2>, <fact3>sleeplessness</fact3>, and <fact4>extreme irritability</fact4> for the past <fact5>3 weeks</fact5>, which are common symptoms of depression. The fact that he was recently kicked off of the school's <fact6>football team</fact6> and has been avoiding his family and friends due to <fact7>loneliness</fact7> further supports this diagnosis. The patient's <fact9>constricted affect</fact9> during the mental status examination and his statement that he would be better off dead are also indicative of depression. The fact that he refuses to be treated and has a plan to use a firearm to harm himself makes him a high-risk patient for suicide. In this situation, the most appropriate next step in management is to take immediate action to ensure the patient's safety. 

Option A, agreeing to his wish for no further treatment, is not appropriate as it would put the patient at risk for harm. Option B, beginning paroxetine therapy, may be a treatment option but it is not the most immediate step in management. Option D, reassuring the patient that he will feel better, is not sufficient as it does not address the patient's immediate risk for suicide. Option E, starting outpatient psychotherapy, may be a treatment option but it is not the most immediate step in management.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to conduct an involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents, as indicated in option C. This will ensure the patient's safety and allow for further evaluation and treatment."

While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his <fact3>calf muscles</fact3> that consistently appears after a <fact4>mile of walking</fact4>. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of <fact5>peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication</fact5> is made. To improve his symptoms, <fact6>cilostazol</fact6> is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?

Answer: The patient has been diagnosed with <fact5>peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication</fact5>, a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the <fact3>calf muscles</fact3> due to <fact2>a 45-year smoking history</fact2> and other risk factors. The prescribed medication, <fact6>cilostazol</fact6>, is used to improve symptoms of intermittent claudication. Cilostazol is a <fact7>phosphodiesterase inhibitor</fact7>, which works by inhibiting the phosphodiesterase enzyme, leading to increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells. This results in platelet aggregation inhibition and vasodilation, improving blood flow to the affected areas and alleviating symptoms of intermittent claudication. Therefore, the mechanism of action of cilostazol is {E}."

A) 64

E) 32","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>72-year-old woman</fact1> is admitted to the hospital for treatment of <fact2>unstable angina</fact2>. Cardiac catheterization shows <fact3>occlusion</fact3> that has caused a <fact4>50%50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery</fact4>. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?
Answer: To determine the factor by which resistance to blood flow has increased, we can use Poiseuille's law, which states that resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel (R ∝ 1/r^4). Given that the diameter of the left circumflex artery has been reduced by 50%, the radius has also been reduced by 50%. Since resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius, we can calculate the factor by which resistance has increased as follows:

Initial resistance (R1) = k / r1^4
Final resistance (R2) = k / r2^4

where k is a constant and r1 and r2 are the initial and final radii, respectively.

Since the radius has been reduced by 50%, r2 = 0.5r1.

R2 = k / (0.5r1)^4
= k / (0.0625r1^4)
= 16k / r1^4

Comparing R2 to R1, we can see that R2 is 16 times greater than R1.

Therefore, the resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by a factor of 16 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.

The answer is {B}."

Answer: Given the patient's presentation of a <fact24>pulsatile abdominal mass</fact24> and a <fact27>contrast CT revealing a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm)</fact27>, the best course of treatment for this patient is <fact29>elective endovascular repair</fact29>. This is because the patient's AAA is small and unruptured, and the patient's symptoms have not progressed to an emergency situation. Elective endovascular repair is a less invasive procedure compared to open surgical repair, and it has been shown to be effective in preventing rupture and reducing mortality in patients with small to medium-sized AAAs [1]. The patient's <fact11>30-pack-year smoking history</fact11> and <fact12>heavy alcohol use on the weekends</fact12> are also risk factors for AAA rupture, and elective endovascular repair can help to mitigate these risks [2].

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of <fact2>agitation and confusion</fact2> six days after undergoing <fact3>surgical repair of a hip fracture</fact3> suggests a possible postoperative complication. Her <fact4>unarousability during the day</fact4> and <fact5>impulsiveness during the night</fact5> with <fact6>frequent reorientation</fact6> are indicative of a fluctuating level of consciousness, which is a hallmark of delirium. The fact that she is <fact10>distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time</fact10> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, her <fact11>inattentiveness but no focal deficits</fact11> on neurologic examination is consistent with delirium. The absence of <fact12>abnormalities on urine dipstick</fact12> makes a urinary tract infection less likely. Therefore, the most likely cause of her current condition is <fact13>delirium</fact13>."

These symptoms started <fact7>slowly about 2 weeks ago</fact7> and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an <fact8>inpatient psychiatric facility</fact8> where he has been successfully treated with <fact9>haloperidol</fact9> for the past several months. His <fact10>physical exam</fact10> and <fact11>vitals</fact11> are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?

Answer: B) Tardive dyskinesia

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of <fact4>unusual smacking motion with his lips</fact4>, <fact5>pursing his mouth</fact5>, and <fact6>blinking excessively</fact6> are characteristic of tardive dyskinesia. This condition is often associated with long-term use of antipsychotic medications, such as <fact9>haloperidol</fact9>, which the patient has been taking for several months. Tardive dyskinesia typically starts slowly and can be asymptomatic, which aligns with the patient's presentation. The other options do not accurately describe the patient's symptoms. Akathisia is characterized by restlessness and agitation, which is not present in this case. Acute dystonia is a sudden onset of muscle contractions, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Pseudoparkinsonism is a side effect of antipsychotic medications that presents with parkinsonian symptoms, but it does not involve the unusual smacking motion or excessive blinking. Palsy is a general term that refers to weakness or paralysis of a muscle or group of muscles, which is not relevant to this case."

Which diagnostic study should be performed next?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>increased menstrual bleeding</fact2>, <fact3>easy bruising</fact3>, and <fact4>bleeding from her gums when brushing her teeth</fact4> is suggestive of a bleeding disorder. The laboratory results show a <fact11>significantly low platelet count</fact11> and prolonged coagulation times, <fact12>PT 13.2s</fact12> and <fact13>aPTT 30s</fact13>, which indicates a coagulopathy. Given the patient's age and lack of history of intravenous drug use, a bleeding disorder such as thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction is a more likely cause of her symptoms. The peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities, which is consistent with thrombocytopenia. Considering the patient's sexual activity with multiple partners, HIV and HCV testing is also a reasonable next step to rule out these infections as a cause of her thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the diagnostic study that should be performed next is <fact5>HIV and HCV testing</fact5>. The answer is {D}."

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a <fact30>neoplastic growth in the descending colon</fact30>. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his <fact31>cardiac findings</fact31>?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation of a <fact2>low-grade fever</fact2>, <fact3>worsening fatigue</fact3>, and <fact4>mild intermittent abdominal pain</fact4> that is not affected by eating, along with a significant weight loss of <fact6>14.9 kg (33 lbs)</fact6> over the last <fact5>6 months</fact5>, it is essential to evaluate for potential underlying malignancies. The presence of a <fact30>neoplastic growth in the descending colon</fact30> as identified by colonoscopy with biopsy supports this suspicion. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms of <fact7>chest pain</fact7> and <fact8>shortness of breath</fact8> that worsen with exertion, along with the new-onset <fact19>high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur</fact19> best heard over the <fact20>right upper sternal border</fact20>, are indicative of cardiac involvement.

On exam, he has a <fact22>firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid</fact22>. A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?

Answer: 

The patient's presentation of a <fact2>neck mass</fact2> with <fact6>occasional fatigue</fact6> and <fact7>weight gain</fact7> in the absence of other symptoms is suggestive of a thyroid disorder. The patient's family history of <fact16>medullary thyroid cancer</fact16> in his <fact17>maternal uncle</fact17> increases his risk for this condition. The patient's thyroid examination reveals a <fact22>firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid</fact22>, which is consistent with medullary thyroid cancer. 

Medullary thyroid cancer is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells, also known as C cells, of the thyroid gland. These cells produce calcitonin, a hormone that helps regulate calcium levels in the blood. The cancer is often associated with a genetic mutation in the RET proto-oncogene, which can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. 

Given the patient's family history and thyroid examination, the most likely diagnosis is medullary thyroid cancer. The biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate <fact23>stromal amyloid deposition</fact23>, which is a characteristic feature of medullary thyroid cancer. 

Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Answer: Based on the patient's presentation of <fact2>pruritus and a hypopigmented rash</fact2> on his upper body for <fact3>5 days</fact3> after returning from a business trip to the Bahamas, where he visited beaches and went hiking, the most likely diagnosis is a fungal infection.

The patient's <fact4>history of type 1 diabetes mellitus</fact4> controlled with an insulin pump and his <fact12>hemoglobin A1C was 7.8%</fact12> suggest that he has a good control over his diabetes, which reduces the likelihood of a fungal infection caused by a compromised immune system. However, the patient's <fact6>sexual activity with three female partners over the past year</fact6> and his use of condoms inconsistently increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including those caused by fungi. The patient's <fact7>physical characteristics</fact7> and <fact8>BMI</fact8> do not suggest any underlying conditions that would increase his risk of a fungal infection. The patient's <fact9>temperature is normal</fact9>, <fact10>pulse is within normal limits</fact10>, and <fact11>blood pressure is within normal limits</fact11>, which suggests that the infection is not severe. Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis is a fungal infection, and the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis is a <fact13>potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation</fact13>. The KOH preparation is a simple and effective method for diagnosing fungal infections, and it can be performed in the office or clinic. The answer is {C}."

A family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?
A) X-linked recessive
B) X-linked dominant
C) Autosomal dominant
D) Autosomal recessvie
E) Maternally inherited mitochondrial defect","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>3-year-old male</fact1> was brought to the pediatrician with severe lip lacerations, with a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, as well as missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A <fact2>family history</fact2> is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A <fact3>urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid</fact3>. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?

Answer: The question describes a <fact1>3-year-old male</fact1> with severe physical injuries and a family history of similar cases in male relatives. The presence of a <fact2>family history</fact2> with multiple affected males on the mother's side suggests an X-linked pattern of inheritance. Furthermore, the <fact3>high level of uric acid</fact3> in the urinalysis is consistent with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This disorder is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, as the gene responsible for HGPRT is located on the X chromosome and males are more frequently affected due to having only one X chromosome. Therefore, the mode of inheritance for this disorder is {A}."

Options: (A) Rectouterine septum nodularity (B) Globular 10-week sized uterus (C) Adnexal mass (D) Irregular 14-week sized uterus (E) No remarkable physical exam finding

Answer: Based on the patient's symptoms, including <fact2>six months of increasingly heavy periods</fact2>, <fact4>intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months</fact4>, <fact5>significant dysmenorrhea</fact5>, and <fact7>mild dyspareunia with intercourse</fact7>, along with her medical history of <fact11>obesity and type II diabetes on metformin</fact11>, the most likely diagnosis is uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are a common cause of heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pressure, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of a “<fact8>heavy feeling</fact8>” in her pelvis. The presence of <fact9>increased urinary frequency</fact9> is also consistent with uterine fibroids, as they can cause pressure on the bladder. Therefore, the physical exam finding most likely to be present in this patient is an <fact14>irregularly sized uterus</fact14>, which is option (D)."

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>65-year-old male</fact1> is experiencing <fact2>dyspnea</fact2> and has abnormal arterial blood gas readings, including a <fact3>low pH of 7.33</fact3> and a <fact4>high pCO2 of 70 mmHg</fact4>. These findings are indicative of respiratory acidosis, a condition characterized by an elevated pCO2 and decreased pH. The presence of a <fact5>high HCO3 level of 33 mEq/L</fact5> suggests that the body is attempting to compensate for the acidosis by increasing bicarbonate levels. Among the options provided, <fact2>dyspnea</fact2> can be caused by various conditions, but the abnormal blood gas readings point towards a respiratory cause. A <fact2>dyspnea</fact2> caused by a <fact6>mechanical ventilation</fact6> would likely have a different set of blood gas readings, and a <fact2>dyspnea</fact2> caused by <fact7>diabetic ketoacidosis</fact7> would have a different acid-base disturbance. A <fact2>dyspnea</fact2> caused by a <fact8>pulmonary embolus</fact8> would likely have a different set of symptoms and blood gas readings. However, a <fact2>dyspnea</fact2> caused by <fact9>chronic obstructive bronchitis</fact9> is consistent with the patient's presentation and the abnormal blood gas readings, as the condition is characterized by airway obstruction and impaired gas exchange, leading to respiratory acidosis. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Which of the following is the underlying cause of this patient's vomiting?

Answer: C) Neoplastic growth

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact3>vomitus consisting of undigested food</fact3> and <fact4>dark brown emesis</fact4> suggests a possible obstruction or malignancy. The <fact6>progressive severe episodic epigastric pain and dyspepsia</fact6> is partially relieved with food or antacids but worsens at night and several hours after eating, which is indicative of a possible gastric outlet obstruction. The <fact9>weight gain of 2 kg (4.4 lbs)</fact9> during this period and the presence of a <fact18>tympanitic mass in the epigastrium</fact18> with a <fact19>succussion splash</fact19> are consistent with a gastric tumor. The <fact22>positive test for occult blood</fact22> in the stool further supports the presence of a malignancy. The patient's family history of <fact10>colon cancer</fact10> also increases his risk for gastrointestinal malignancies. Therefore, the underlying cause of this patient's vomiting is neoplastic growth."
254,"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril.

Answer: The <fact1>40-year-old man</fact1> presents with a <fact2>painless right-sided scrotal swelling</fact2> that is <fact6>10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender</fact6> and <fact7>transilluminates</fact7>. These characteristics are indicative of a hydrocele, a fluid collection in the scrotum that can be caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the <fact11>tunica vaginalis</fact11>. The <fact11>tunica vaginalis</fact11> is a serous membrane that surrounds the testis and epididymis. The <fact11>tunica vaginalis</fact11> produces fluid that helps to lubricate the scrotum and facilitate the movement of the testes. When there is an imbalance in the production and absorption of this fluid, it can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the scrotum, resulting in a hydrocele. Therefore, the most likely cause of the mass is an <fact12>imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis</fact12>."
982,"A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies.

Answer: The characteristic of <fact17>fexofenadine</fact17> that allows it to be less sedating than <fact5>diphenhydramine</fact5> is its <fact18>relative lipophobicity</fact18>. This is because <fact5>diphenhydramine</fact5> is a <fact19>lipophilic</fact19> drug, which means it easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and can cause <fact6>drowsiness</fact6>.

Answer: The patient's <fact2>PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration</fact2> indicates a positive result, which is a sign of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination do not suggest active tuberculosis (TB). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, a positive PPD result in a healthy individual without symptoms of TB should be confirmed with a <fact10>Quantiferon gold test</fact10> (also known as an interferon-gamma release assay, IGRAs) or a <fact11>repeat PPD in 1-3 months</fact11> (2). The patient's <fact9>unremarkable chest radiograph</fact9> further supports the absence of active TB. Therefore, the most appropriate management of this patient is to perform a <fact10>Quantiferon gold test</fact10> to confirm the diagnosis of LTBI.

Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)

Answer: To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and then divide 1 by the ARR.

First, we need to calculate the risk of death from cardiac causes in each study arm. The risk in the medication 1 arm is 134/1500 = 0.089 (or 8.9%), and the risk in the medication 2 arm is 210/1500 = 0.14 (or 14%).

The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference between the two risks: 0.14 - 0.089 = 0.051 (or 5.1%).

The NNT is then calculated by dividing 1 by the ARR: 1 / 0.051 = 19.6.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the NNT is approximately 20."

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an <fact18>enlarged liver</fact18>. A biopsy of the liver shows <fact19>massive centrilobular necrosis</fact19>. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain</fact2> following a <fact4>transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells</fact5> during an emergency <fact4>appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia</fact4> suggests a possible transfusion-related complication. The laboratory findings, including elevated <fact10>Aspartate aminotransferase</fact10> and <fact11>Bilirubin</fact11> levels, along with the presence of <fact8>jaundice and tender hepatomegaly</fact8>, are indicative of liver dysfunction. The patient's <fact13>Anti-HAV IgG positive</fact13> and <fact14>Anti-HAV IgM negative</fact14> status, as well as <fact15>Anti-HBs positive</fact15> and <fact16>HBsAg negative</fact16> status, rules out hepatitis A and B as the cause of liver dysfunction. The <fact17>Anti-HCV antibodies negative</fact17> status also rules out hepatitis C. The <fact18>enlarged liver</fact18> on ultrasonography and <fact19>massive centrilobular necrosis</fact19> on liver biopsy suggest a direct toxic injury to the liver. Given the patient's recent transfusion and the lack of evidence for a viral cause, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is an adverse effect of the <fact20>anesthetic</fact20> used during the surgery."

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

A) Administration of lithium
B) Interpersonal therapy
C) Psychodynamic psychotherapy
D) Cognitive behavioral therapy
E) Motivational interviewing

Answer: 
The patient's behavior of stealing small items while shopping and feeling relieved immediately thereafter, followed by feelings of shame and guilt, is indicative of kleptomania. Kleptomania is characterized by a recurrent inability to resist urges to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value. The patient's behavior is also accompanied by feelings of anxiety and guilt, which are common symptoms of kleptomania. Given this diagnosis, the most appropriate next step in management is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that is effective in treating kleptomania by helping the patient identify and change their negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is also a non-pharmacological approach that can be used to manage the patient's symptoms without the use of medication. 

In this case, CBT would involve helping the patient to identify the triggers for her behavior, develop coping skills to manage stress and anxiety, and learn new behaviors to replace her kleptomania. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of kleptomania and improving quality of life for individuals with this condition. 

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is D) Cognitive behavioral therapy."

Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on <fact6>renal biopsy</fact6> in this patient?</fact6>

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>fevers, chills, and night sweats</fact2> suggests an infectious or inflammatory process. The subsequent <fact3>lymph node biopsy</fact3> indicates that the process is likely affecting the lymphatic system. The development of <fact4>generalized swelling</fact4> and <fact5>4+ protein in his urine</fact5> three days later suggests the onset of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Among the options provided, <fact6>minimal change disease</fact6> is the most likely diagnosis, as it is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and is often associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, such as lymphoma, which may have been suggested by the lymph node biopsy. Minimal change disease is characterized by the loss of foot processes of the podocytes and is typically diagnosed by renal biopsy, which shows normal glomeruli under light microscopy but effacement of the podocyte foot processes under electron microscopy.

Answer: Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely explanation for the <fact35>wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra</fact35> is <fact36>secondary hyperparathyroidism</fact36>.

Explanation: The patient's <fact37>chronic kidney disease</fact37> and <fact38>end-stage renal disease (ESRD)</fact38> (as indicated by her need for dialysis) are key factors in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The elevated <fact39>calcium level</fact39> and <fact40>phosphate level</fact40> are consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism, as the kidneys are unable to convert vitamin D to its active form, leading to increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The elevated <fact41>PTH level</fact41> is further supported by the patient's <fact42>low calcium level</fact42> and <fact43>low phosphate level</fact43>, which are typical of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The patient's <fact44>osteoporosis</fact44> and <fact45>osteopenia</fact45> are also consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the <fact35>wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra</fact35> is <fact36>secondary hyperparathyroidism</fact36>."

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient?

Answer: The patient has been <fact2>bit in the hand by a stray dog</fact2> 2 days ago, which puts him at risk for <fact12>rabies</fact12> and other infections such as <fact13>capnocytophaga</fact13>, <fact14>pasturella</fact14>, and <fact15>anaerobic infections</fact15>.

Note: The other options are not the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient. Amoxicillin (option A) is a narrower-spectrum antibiotic that may not cover all the possible pathogens. Clindamycin (option C) is a good choice for anaerobic infections, but it is not the first-line treatment for skin and soft tissue infections. Doxycycline (option D) is a good choice for tick-borne illnesses, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Azithromycin (option E) is a good choice for certain types of bacterial infections, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient."

The recurrent laryngeal nerve arises from the <fact7>6th pharyngeal arch</fact7>, which is also known as the laryngeal arch. This arch is responsible for the development of the laryngeal cartilages and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Therefore, the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness is the <fact8>6th pharyngeal arch</fact8>. The answer is {E}."

A <fact1>10-year-old boy</fact1> is brought to his pediatrician after discovering a <fact2>painless mass in the left testicle</fact2>. Results from <fact3>tumor markers</fact3> and a <fact4>biopsy</fact4> are as follows:
<fact5>AFP 350 ng/mL</fact5> (<fact6>normal value < 10 ng/mL</fact6>)
<fact7>hCG 0.4 IU/L</fact7> (<fact8>normal value < 0.5 IU/L</fact8>)
<fact9>Biopsy: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells</fact9>.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation, a <fact2>painless mass in the left testicle</fact2> in a <fact1>10-year-old boy</fact1>, is highly suggestive of a testicular tumor. The elevated <fact5>AFP 350 ng/mL</fact5> with a <fact6>normal value < 10 ng/mL</fact6> is indicative of a tumor that produces alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a protein typically elevated in certain types of germ cell tumors. The <fact7>hCG 0.4 IU/L</fact7> with a <fact8>normal value < 0.5 IU/L</fact8> is within normal limits, suggesting that the tumor is not producing human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone typically elevated in choriocarcinoma. The <fact9>biopsy findings</fact9> of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells, are characteristic of yolk sac tumors, also known as endodermal sinus tumors. These tumors are a type of germ cell tumor that produce AFP and are more common in children. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is a <fact3>yolk sac tumor</fact3>, also known as an <fact4>endodermal sinus tumor</fact4>. The answer is {E}."
957,"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician for intermittent stabbing face pain. The pain typically occurs in waves of several individual episodes lasting about one second. It is bilateral, but rarely occurs on both sides simultaneously. Touching her face or brushing her teeth can trigger an attack. Four months ago, she had an episode of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week. Family history is notable for migrainous headaches in her mother and brother. Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings?
A) Gingival swelling, erythema, and pus drainage
B) Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques
C) Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution
D) Photophobia and phonophobia

Answer: The patient's symptoms of <fact2>intermittent stabbing face pain</fact2> and <fact6>weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week</fact6> suggest a neurological condition. The <fact9>decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally</fact9> and <fact10>muscle weakness in the left upper extremity</fact10> further support this. The presence of <fact11>spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus</fact11> indicates upper motor neuron involvement.

Relevant Key Phrases: 
- <fact1>10-year-old girl</fact1>
- <fact2>1 week of difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers</fact2>
- <fact3>shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth</fact3>
- <fact6>HIV-positive since birth</fact6>

- <fact17>CD4 count of 100/mm3</fact17>
- <fact18>viral load of 25,050/mL</fact18>

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers</fact2> accompanied by <fact3>shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth</fact3> suggests a severe opportunistic infection, likely Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive individuals. The patient's <fact6>HIV-positive status since birth</fact6> and the fact that she is being treated with <fact7>HAART</fact7> with a <fact8>baseline viral load of <50/mL</fact8> indicate that her HIV infection is well-managed. However, the recent increase in <fact18>viral load to 25,050/mL</fact18> and a <fact17>CD4 count of 100/mm3</fact17> suggest that the patient's immune system is compromised, making her susceptible to opportunistic infections. The lack of responsiveness to therapy is likely due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of a resistant strain of PCP. Among the options provided, the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy is ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity, as the patient's immune system is unable to effectively respond to the infection."

His <fact6>pulse is 100/min</fact6>, and <fact7>blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg</fact7>. Further evaluation shows a <fact8>systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L</fact8> with an <fact9>end-systolic volume of 80 mL</fact9>. Which of the following describes the <fact10>ejection fraction</fact10> in this patient?

Answer: To determine the ejection fraction, we need to use the formula: ejection fraction = (stroke volume / end-diastolic volume) × 100. However, we are given the end-systolic volume instead of the end-diastolic volume. We can use the relationship between the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes to estimate the ejection fraction. The relationship between the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes is given by the formula: end-systolic volume = end-diastolic volume - stroke volume. Rearranging this formula to solve for stroke volume, we get: stroke volume = end-diastolic volume - end-systolic volume. We can then use the stroke volume and end-diastolic volume to estimate the ejection fraction. However, we are not given the end-diastolic volume. We can use the relationship between the systemic vascular resistance and the stroke volume to estimate the end-diastolic volume. The relationship between the systemic vascular resistance and the stroke volume is given by the formula: systemic vascular resistance = (end-diastolic pressure - end-systolic pressure) / stroke volume. We can use this formula to estimate the end-diastolic pressure and then use the relationship between the end-diastolic pressure and the end-diastolic volume to estimate the end-diastolic volume.

C) Reaction formation
D) Intellectualization
E) Projection","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>19-year-old man</fact1> in a <fact2>3-month relationship</fact2> with a <fact3>woman</fact3> experiences <fact4>frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers</fact4> of the opposite sex, specifically <fact5>male coworkers</fact5>. He lives in a <fact6>conservative community</fact6> and does not know any openly <fact7>gay men</fact7>. Two days ago, he joined a <fact8>local group considered by many organizations to be a hate group</fact8>. Together with the other members, he attacked a <fact9>gay couple</fact9> on their way home from dinner. Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is he demonstrating?

Answer: The <fact1>19-year-old man</fact1> is exhibiting a psychological defense mechanism in response to his <fact4>frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers</fact4>. He is trying to suppress these fantasies by engaging in behaviors that are in direct conflict with his desires. This is evident in his joining a <fact8>local group considered by many organizations to be a hate group</fact8> and attacking a <fact9>gay couple</fact9>. This behavior is an attempt to compensate for his own same-sex desires by engaging in aggressive behavior against the gay community. This is an example of <fact10>reaction formation</fact10>, which is a defense mechanism in which an individual expresses an opposite emotion or behavior to hide their true feelings.

Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which an individual expresses an opposite emotion or behavior to hide their true feelings. In this case, the <fact1>19-year-old man</fact1> is expressing homophobic behavior to hide his own same-sex desires. This is a classic example of reaction formation, as he is trying to suppress his true feelings by engaging in behaviors that are in direct conflict with them.

The other options do not accurately describe the <fact1>19-year-old man</fact1>'s behavior. Acting out (A) refers to the expression of unconscious feelings or impulses in a direct and uncontrolled manner, which is not the case here. Sublimation (B) refers to the channeling of unconscious feelings or impulses into more socially acceptable behaviors, which is not the case here. Intellectualization (D) refers to the tendency to think about emotional experiences in a detached and abstract way, which is not the case here. Projection (E) refers to the attribution of one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to another person, which is not the case here."

E) L cells

Answer: Let's think step by step. The patient's symptoms of being significantly overweight with hypogonadism and delayed cognitive and social milestones are suggestive of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a genetic disorder characterized by a range of physical, mental, and behavioral problems. One of the hallmark features of PWS is hyperphagia, an insatiable appetite that leads to significant weight gain. The hormone most responsible for causing weight gain in PWS patients is ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates appetite and increases food intake. Ghrelin is produced in the stomach by a specific type of cell called P/D1 cells."

E) Neuron-specific enolase

Explanation: 
The patient's presentation of a <fact1>cough for 6 months</fact1>, <fact3>bloody sputum</fact3> the previous night, and <fact5>fatigue after little physical exertion</fact5> suggests a possible lung malignancy. The presence of <fact12>localized rhonchi over the interscapular region</fact12> and a <fact13>coin-like opacity in the right lung</fact13> on chest radiograph further supports this diagnosis. The confirmation of <fact14>small cell carcinoma of the lung</fact14> is consistent with a highly aggressive and metastatic tumor.

Options: (A) <fact2>bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma</fact> (B) <fact3>bilateral hand tremors of indeterminate etiology</fact> (C) <fact4>urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia</fact> (D) <fact5>nasal congestion due to a viral infection</fact> (E) <fact6>blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision</fact>

Answer: The <fact1>53-year-old man</fact1> was prescribed a <fact2>selective alpha-1 agonist</fact>, which is typically used to treat <fact3>urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia</fact>. This condition is characterized by the enlargement of the prostate gland, which can cause urinary retention and other symptoms. The use of a selective alpha-1 agonist helps to relax the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow and reducing symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}."
906,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
A) Measurement bias
B) Recall bias
C) Lead-time bias
D) Selection bias
E) Length-time bias","Reformatted Question: If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?

Answer: C) Lead-time bias

Explanation: The question mentions that the conclusion was due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound. This implies that the diagnosis was made earlier than it would have been without the use of point of care ultrasound. Lead-time bias occurs when the earlier detection of a disease is mistakenly attributed to the effectiveness of a diagnostic test or treatment, when in fact the disease would have been diagnosed at a similar point in time even without the test or treatment. In this case, the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound may be due to lead-time bias, as the disease would have been diagnosed at a similar point in time even without the use of point of care ultrasound."

Her current anti-TB regimen includes <fact3>rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol</fact3>. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?

Answer: The patient is taking oral contraceptives but still became pregnant, which suggests that the oral contraceptives were ineffective. The patient is also taking rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for pulmonary tuberculosis. The mechanism by which rifampin can affect the efficacy of oral contraceptives is through the induction of CYP3A4, which is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, the active components of oral contraceptives. This induction leads to increased metabolism and <fact4>decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone</fact4>, resulting in reduced efficacy of the oral contraceptives. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

D) Inhibition of stem cell differentiation
E) Restoration of the body's iron stores","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>48-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the physician because of a <fact2>4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising</fact2>. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of <fact3>thrombophlebitis</fact3>. Physical examination shows <fact4>multiple bruises on her limbs</fact4>. Laboratory studies show a <fact5>platelet count of 900,000/mm3</fact5> and <fact6>elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid</fact6>. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7>. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7>?

Answer: Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising</fact2> with <fact5>thrombocytosis</fact5> (elevated platelet count of 900,000/mm3), the patient is likely experiencing a myeloproliferative disorder such as essential thrombocythemia. The elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid suggest a high rate of red blood cell turnover, which is consistent with this diagnosis. The treatment with a medication used in the treatment of <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7> is likely hydroxyurea, which is also used to treat myeloproliferative disorders such as essential thrombocythemia. The beneficial effect of hydroxyurea in <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7> is primarily due to its ability to increase the production of <fact8>fetal hemoglobin</fact8>, which is a major component of the hemoglobin in red blood cells and has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. This increase in <fact8>fetal hemoglobin</fact8> helps to reduce the frequency of painful crises and may also reduce the risk of other complications of sickle cell disease. Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?
A) Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin
B) Increased phosphorylation of myosin
C) Increased production of nitric oxide
D) Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
E) Decreased concentration of bradykinin","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>56-year-old man</fact1> comes to the physician for a follow-up examination <fact2>1 week after a temporal artery biopsy was performed to evaluate <fact3>headache and blurry vision</fact3>. He has a <fact4>12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril</fact4>. Results of the testing show <fact5>decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells</fact5>. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?

Answer: Considering the <fact1>56-year-old man</fact1> who underwent a temporal artery biopsy for <fact3>headache and blurry vision</fact3>, the decreased concentrations of <fact5>arginine in vascular endothelial cells</fact5> are likely related to the underlying condition that led to the biopsy. The patient has a <fact4>12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril</fact4>, a medication that affects the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The decreased arginine levels could be related to the increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in response to the elevated levels of bradykinin, a peptide that is also increased by lisinopril. This increase in NO production would lead to the decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this finding is {C}.

However, this explanation is not accurate because it does not directly relate to the decreased arginine levels. The most likely explanation is related to the decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) due to the decreased availability of arginine, which is a substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by NOS and reacts with soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP. The decreased arginine levels would lead to decreased NO production, which in turn would result in decreased cGMP production. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this finding is {D}."

The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?
A) Hyperplasia
B) Hypertrophy
C) Atrophy
D) Metaplasia
E) Dysplasia","Reformatted Question: A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change was caused by?
Answer: A) Hyperplasia

Explanation: The key phrase that is most relevant to answering the question is ""epithelial proliferation"". Epithelial proliferation refers to an increase in the number of cells in an epithelial tissue, which is a characteristic of hyperplasia. The question states that the breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women, which suggests that the change was caused by an increase in cell number, rather than an increase in cell size (hypertrophy), a decrease in cell number (atrophy), a change in cell type (metaplasia), or abnormal cell growth (dysplasia)."

Answer: The patient's <fact6>neutrophils</fact6> <fact7>fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test</fact7>, which is a diagnostic tool used to assess the function of the <fact8>respiratory burst</fact8> in neutrophils. The respiratory burst is a critical component of the innate immune response, allowing neutrophils to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are essential for killing pathogens. The failure of neutrophils to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test suggests a dysfunction in the <fact8>respiratory burst</fact8>, which is most likely caused by a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for generating ROS, such as NADPH oxidase. Among the options provided, the most relevant enzyme associated with the respiratory burst is not listed, but among the options, <fact8>respiratory burst</fact8> is the correct answer because the question specifically states that the patient's neutrophils fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test, which is used to assess the respiratory burst."

Options: (A) Hypersensitivity reaction (B) Asbestos inhalation (C) Neoplastic transformation (D) Opportunistic colonization (E) Abscess formation

Answer: Considering the patient's <fact1>2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood</fact1> and the presence of <fact5>inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area</fact5>, it suggests a possible pulmonary infection. The <fact3>history of pulmonary tuberculosis</fact3> indicates that the patient is susceptible to other pulmonary infections. The <fact4>afebrile</fact4> state of the patient and the lack of growth of <fact7>acid-fast bacteria</fact7> in the <fact7>sputum sample</fact7> despite multiple cultures make it less likely that the patient is experiencing a recurrence of tuberculosis. The presence of a <fact6>radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning</fact6> on the chest x-ray indicates a possible mass or tumor. Given the patient's age and the presence of a mass in the lung, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is <fact2>neoplastic transformation</fact2>, which is the process by which normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>23-year-old woman</fact1> is experiencing <fact2>episodic headaches</fact2> accompanied by <fact3>dizziness, nausea, and vomiting</fact3> for the past <fact2>2 months</fact2>. The failure of <fact4>over-the-counter pain medications</fact4> to alleviate her symptoms suggests a more complex underlying issue. The <fact5>isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle</fact5> observed on the <fact4>MRI of the brain</fact4> is indicative of hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the brain. The most likely cause of this dilation is a blockade of the cerebral aqueduct, which is responsible for the flow of CSF from the third to the fourth ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct is a narrow passage that connects the third and fourth ventricles, and its blockade can lead to hydrocephalus. Therefore, the correct answer is {E}."

Answer: Given the patient's presentation of <fact2>heavy vaginal bleeding</fact2> requiring more than <fact3>5 pads per day</fact3> and a <fact4>history of menopause 1 year ago</fact4>, the most likely cause is postmenopausal bleeding (PMB). PMB is defined as vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal woman, and it is a common symptom that requires thorough evaluation to rule out malignancy. The patient's physical examination reveals <fact10>mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix</fact10>, which is consistent with the expected changes in the postmenopausal period. The <fact11>uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation</fact11>, which suggests that there is no acute pelvic pathology. The <fact12>transvaginal ultrasonography shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm</fact12>, which is within the normal range for postmenopausal women. However, the <fact13>endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia</fact13>, which indicates endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. Given this information, the most appropriate next step in management is to reassure the patient and follow up, as the risk of malignancy in this case is low. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

The patient is referred to another physician for a more thorough workup including laboratory work and CT imaging. Which of the following is the best <fact17>long-term prophylaxis</fact17> for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms?

Answer: A) Alendronate

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>confusion</fact2>, <fact5>somnolence</fact5>, and <fact6>polyuria</fact6> in the context of <fact3>Alzheimer dementia</fact3> and significant <fact7>weight loss</fact7> suggests a diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy. The laboratory values reveal a <fact15>high calcium level</fact15> with a <fact16>low PTH level</fact16>, which is consistent with this diagnosis. The most common cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy is the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by a tumor. The best long-term prophylaxis for this condition is the use of bisphosphonates, such as alendronate, which can help to reduce bone turnover and prevent hypercalcemia."
1209,"Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?
A) A 15-month-old girl who has had repeated otitis media, pneumonia, and progressive clumsiness since beginning to walk in the past three months
B) A 10-month-old boy who has had recurrent viral infections as well as hypocalcemia during neonatal period
C) A 4-year-old girl who has had repeated oral candidasis in the past nine months

Answer: The question asks for the patient presentation most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia. This condition is characterized by the absence or marked reduction of B cells and, consequently, the absence of immunoglobulins. Patients with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia are prone to recurrent infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The presentation of <fact11>recurrent otitis media</fact11> and <fact12>pneumococcal pneumonia</fact12> in the past three months (option D) is most consistent with this diagnosis, as it reflects the impaired ability to produce antibodies against encapsulated bacteria."
1272,"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Social anxiety disorder
B) Avoidant personality disorder
C) Schizotypal personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Schizophrenia","Reformatted Question:

Answer: C) Schizotypal personality disorder

Explanation: The patient's behavior, such as dressing in black, avoiding social interactions, and spending most of his time reading about paranormal phenomena, is consistent with <fact3>schizotypal personality disorder</fact3>. The patient's <fact7>laborious speech</fact7> and avoidance of eye contact are also characteristic of this disorder. The patient's preoccupation with <fact5>demons</fact5> and the interpretation of everyday events as signs of their presence is a classic example of <fact6>magical thinking</fact6>, which is a hallmark of schizotypal personality disorder.

Which of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?

Answer: D) Oral glucose tolerance test

Explanation: The patient's <fact1>concern about the results of a dipstick test</fact1> showing <fact3>1+ glucose</fact3> suggests the possibility of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, the <fact12>fasting glucose of 97 mg/L</fact12> is within the normal range. To determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is indicated. The OGTT is a standard diagnostic test for GDM, which involves measuring the patient's blood glucose levels after consuming a sugary drink. This test can help diagnose GDM, even if the fasting glucose level is normal. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."

E) <fact20>Aortic valve stenosis</fact20>

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>progressive shortness of breath and fatigue</fact2> over the past <fact3>month</fact3> is concerning for a cardiac condition. His history of <fact5>hypertension</fact5> and <fact6>hyperlipidemia</fact6> increases his risk for cardiovascular disease. The patient's <fact7>50-year history of smoking</fact7> also contributes to his risk for cardiovascular disease. The physical examination finding of <fact15>weak peripheral pulses</fact15> suggests a potential issue with cardiac output. The cardiac examination is not explicitly described, but based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is <fact20>Aortic valve stenosis</fact20>. This is because aortic valve stenosis can lead to decreased cardiac output, which can cause <fact4>shortness of breath and dizziness</fact4> upon exertion. Additionally, aortic valve stenosis is a common cause of <fact2>progressive shortness of breath and fatigue</fact2> in older adults."
