""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants

Answer: 
Given that the cardiologist is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study, and the data collected includes changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups is Analysis of variance (ANOVA). 

This is because ANOVA is a statistical method used to compare means among three or more groups to determine if there is a significant difference between them. In this case, the cardiologist has three groups: Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, and Placebo, and he wants to compare the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores among these groups. ANOVA is the most appropriate method to do this, as it can help determine if there are any significant differences between the means of the three groups.

Additionally, the fact that the data is approximately normally distributed (as stated in the abstract) also supports the use of ANOVA, as this method assumes normality of the data."
1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.","Reformatted Question: Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error? 

Answer: B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

Explanation: In the context of the research abstract, a type 1 error refers to the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis (which states that there is no significant difference between the study groups) when it is actually true. This occurs when the study results are due to chance rather than a real effect. In this case, the authors reported a significant reduction in asthma exacerbations and improvements in markers of asthma control among patients receiving mepolizumab compared to those receiving placebo. If the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that the observed differences were due to chance rather than a real effect of mepolizumab. This would imply that the null hypothesis is true, but the authors mistakenly rejected it in error."
906,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
A) Measurement bias
B) Recall bias
C) Lead-time bias
D) Selection bias
E) Length-time bias","Reformatted Question: If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of <fact1>nephrolithiasis</fact1> in patients undergoing <fact2>point-of-care ultrasonography</fact2>, what type of <fact3>bias</fact3> would this exemplify?

Answer: This scenario would exemplify <fact4>Lead-time bias</fact4>.

Explanation: Lead-time bias occurs when the apparent benefit of an intervention, such as earlier detection of a disease, is due to the earlier detection rather than the actual effect of the intervention. In this case, if the conclusion that initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure was due to the earlier detection of <fact1>nephrolithiasis</fact1> in patients undergoing <fact2>point-of-care ultrasonography</fact2>, it would mean that the apparent benefit of ultrasonography was due to the earlier detection of the disease, rather than the actual effect of the intervention.

Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?

Answer: 
The patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including <fact6>tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities</fact6>, <fact7>excessively somnolent</fact7>, and <fact8>forgetful</fact8>, can be explained by the impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids. This is supported by the patient's laboratory results, which show a <fact32>mean corpuscular volume of 142 µm^3 (142 fL)</fact32>, indicating macrocytic anemia. The patient's symptoms are consistent with subacute combined degeneration (SACD), a condition caused by impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids due to vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's history of <fact9>acute hepatitis B 20 years ago</fact9> and the current laboratory results showing a <fact42>HbA1C of 4.3%</fact42> and <fact43>fasting plasma glucose of 4.6 mmol/l (82.9 mg/dL)</fact43> suggest that the patient's symptoms are not due to chronic hyperglycemia or chronic acetaldehyde influence. The patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms are best explained by impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids due to vitamin B12 deficiency."

His past medical history is significant for an <fact12>ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery</fact12> <fact13>1 month ago</fact13>, status post <fact14>intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)</fact14> with still some <fact15>residual neurologic impairment</fact15>, and long-standing <fact16>gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia</fact16>, managed medically. The patient reports a <fact17>15-pack-year smoking history</fact17>, but no <fact18>alcohol</fact18> or <fact19>recreational drug use</fact19>. The vital signs include: <fact20>temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F)</fact20>, <fact21>blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg</fact21>, <fact22>pulse 105/min</fact22>, and <fact23>respiratory rate 16/min</fact23>. On physical examination, <fact24>muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right</fact24>, along with <fact25>sensory loss on the left</fact25>, all of which is improved from his previous exam <fact26>3 weeks ago</fact26>. There is a <fact27>loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally</fact27> which is stable from the previous exam. <fact28>Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm</fact28>. No <fact29>rubs</fact29>, <fact30>thrills</fact30> or <fact31>murmurs</fact31>. A <fact32>noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan</fact32> shows evidence of an area of <fact33>infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery</fact33> showing <fact34>normal interval change</fact34> with no evidence of new <fact35>hemorrhage</fact35> or <fact36>expansion of the area of infarction</fact36>. An <fact37>electrocardiogram (ECG)</fact37> is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future <fact38>cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs)</fact38> in this patient?

Answer: Based on the patient's history of <fact12>ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery</fact12> and the new-onset <fact28>irregular rate and rhythm</fact28> on cardiac examination, the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future <fact38>cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs)</fact38> in this patient is to begin <fact39>aspirin therapy</fact39>. Aspirin is a common antiplatelet agent used to prevent the formation of blood clots, which can reduce the risk of future ischemic strokes in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1). The patient's history of <fact17>15-pack-year smoking history</fact17> also increases his risk for cardiovascular disease, and aspirin therapy can help to mitigate this risk (2). Additionally, the patient's current symptoms of <fact2>palpitations</fact2> and <fact28>irregular rate and rhythm</fact28> may be indicative of atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke (3). Aspirin therapy can help to reduce this risk by preventing the formation of blood clots in the heart (4). Therefore, the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future <fact38>cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs)</fact38> in this patient is to begin <fact39>aspirin therapy</fact39>.

73,"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission).

The patient is experiencing <fact27>oliguria</fact27> despite receiving <fact22>intravenous fluids</fact22>, indicating a possible issue with renal perfusion or function. The <fact33>low urine sodium level</fact33> suggests that the kidney is trying to conserve sodium, which is consistent with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a complication of cirrhosis. HRS is characterized by a decrease in renal function in the setting of cirrhosis, often precipitated by an infection. The patient's medical history of <fact7>alcohol use disorder</fact7> and <fact9>cirrhosis</fact9> puts him at risk for HRS.

Answer: 
B) Abnormal CFTR protein

Explanation: 
The patient is a <fact1>4-month-old boy</fact1> with symptoms of <fact2>fever, dyspnea, and cough</fact2> and <fact4>poor weight gain despite a good appetite</fact4> as well as <fact6>frequent stools with an unpleasant smell</fact6>.

The patient also has a <fact32>high chloride concentration in sweat</fact32>, which is a diagnostic marker for cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is caused by mutations in the <fact32>CFTR gene</fact32>, which encodes for a chloride channel. The abnormal <fact32>CFTR protein</fact32> leads to thick and sticky mucus production in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, causing the symptoms observed in this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."
1133,"A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless.

Answer:
The patient's headache is likely related to her <fact20>stage 1 arterial hypertension</fact20> and <fact22>stable angina pectoris</fact22>, which suggests a possible link to her <fact54>cardiovascular system</fact54>.

However, the <fact56>headache</fact56> gets worse when the patient <fact15>coughs</fact15> or <fact16>laughs</fact16>, which suggests a possible connection to her <fact57>respiratory system</fact57>. The <fact58>palpation</fact58> of the <fact46>paranasal sinuses</fact46> is <fact47>painless</fact47>, which makes it less likely that the headache is related to <fact59>sinus pressure</fact59>.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches is <fact62>vascular dilation</fact62>, which is related to her <fact20>stage 1 arterial hypertension</fact20> and <fact22>stable angina pectoris</fact22>.

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation with a <fact1>small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm)</fact1> and the initiation of <fact36>high flow supplemental oxygen</fact36> and <fact37>fluid resuscitation</fact37>, it is essential to consider the best course of treatment for this patient. The patient's <fact2>longstanding history of hypertension</fact2> and <fact3>high cholesterol</fact3> increase the risk of AAA expansion and rupture. The presence of a <fact30>pulsatile abdominal mass</fact30> in the lower <fact31>umbilical region</fact31> is a significant finding consistent with AAA. Given the patient's stable vital signs and the absence of <fact40>rupture or severe symptoms</fact40>, the best course of treatment is elective <fact41>endovascular repair</fact41> of the AAA. This approach is preferred due to its lower risk of mortality and morbidity compared to open surgical repair.

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s <fact44>glucosuria</fact44>?

Answer: C) Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules

Explanation: The patient's <fact1>urinalysis</fact1> shows a <fact29>glucose level of 199 mg/dl</fact29>, which is indicative of glucosuria. The presence of <fact43>yeast</fact43> in the urine is likely due to the patient's <fact23>HbA1c level of 9%</fact23>, which suggests poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The kidneys reabsorb glucose from the filtrate back into the bloodstream in the proximal renal tubules. In a healthy individual, the <fact45>proximal renal tubules</fact45> reabsorb glucose through <fact46>secondary active transport</fact46>, which is driven by the sodium-potassium pump. However, in a patient with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, the <fact47>secondary active transporters</fact47> may fail to completely reabsorb glucose, leading to glucosuria. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}."
549,"A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm × 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

IRIS is a condition that occurs when the immune system begins to recover after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, leading to an inflammatory response to the existing infection, including tuberculosis. In this case, the patient's <fact22>Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm</fact22>, which is indicative of an immune response to the tuberculosis infection. The most appropriate initial step in treatment is to <fact25>continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change</fact25>, as discontinuing antiretroviral therapy would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and changing the antitubercular therapy would not be necessary at this time."

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a <fact20>normal uterus and ovaries</fact20>. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: 
A) <fact21>Hypothalamic amenorrhea</fact21>

Explanation: The patient is a <fact1>16-year-old female</fact1> who presents with <fact2>lack of menstruation</fact2>. Her <fact3>breasts began developing when she was 13</fact3>, and she had a <fact4>growth spurt around the same time</fact4>, indicating normal pubertal development. However, she has never had a period, and her mother and older sister both underwent <fact10>menarche at age 15</fact10>, suggesting a possible delay in menarche. The patient's <fact15>body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2</fact15>, which is within the normal range, and her laboratory studies show a <fact21>normal FSH level</fact21> of 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml) and a <fact22>normal estrogen level</fact22> of 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL), indicating that her ovaries are functioning normally. The abdominal ultrasound shows a <fact20>normal uterus and ovaries</fact20>, ruling out any anatomical abnormalities. The patient's symptoms of <fact5>headaches every few months over the last year</fact5> with some <fact6>photosensitivity and nausea each time</fact6> are relieved by ibuprofen, suggesting a possible migraine disorder. The patient's mother has a history of <fact8>migraine headaches</fact8>, and her older sister has a history of <fact9>bipolar disorder</fact9>. The patient is a <fact7>competitive ice skater</fact7> and has never been sexually active, which may contribute to her delayed menarche. Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is <fact21>Hypothalamic amenorrhea</fact21>, which is a condition characterized by delayed or absent menarche due to hypothalamic dysfunction, often associated with excessive exercise, stress, or other factors that disrupt the normal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis."

She has a <fact29>low-frequency tremor</fact29> in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

Answer: B) Delirium

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with delirium, which is characterized by an acute onset of <fact30>disorientation</fact30> to <fact31>time and place</fact31>, <fact32>fluctuating level of consciousness</fact32>, and <fact33>difficulty with attention and memory</fact33> [1]. The patient's inability to recall <fact34>0/3 words</fact34> after <fact35>5 minutes</fact35> suggests impaired short-term memory [2]. The presence of a <fact36>low-frequency tremor</fact36> in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement is also consistent with delirium [3]. The patient's history of <fact37>worsening anxiety</fact37> and <fact38>increased urinary urgency</fact38> may be contributing factors to her delirium, but these symptoms do not explain her acute cognitive decline [4]. The patient's <fact39>disorganized house</fact39> and <fact40>avoidance of driving long distances</fact40> may indicate a decline in her <fact41>activities of daily living</fact41>, but these symptoms are not specific to delirium [5]. The patient's <fact42>history of hypertension</fact42>, <fact43>hyperlipidemia</fact43>, and <fact44>type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact44> may increase her risk for delirium, but these conditions do not explain her acute cognitive decline [6]. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is delirium.

His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard.

Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): <fact13>5 mm Hg</fact13>. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?

Relevant key phrases: 
- <fact7>85%</fact7> oxygen desaturation
- <fact9>crackles</fact9>
- <fact10>4 mmHg</fact10> CVP
- <fact11>20/5 mmHg</fact11> RVP
- <fact12>20/5 mmHg</fact12> PAP
- <fact13>5 mm Hg</fact13> PCWP

Answer: The patient's <fact7>85%</fact7> oxygen desaturation despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at <fact8>15 breaths/minute</fact8> and the presence of <fact9>crackles</fact9> suggest a problem with gas exchange in the lungs. The Swan-Ganz catheter readings show low CVP (<fact10>4 mmHg</fact10>), low RVP (<fact11>20/5 mmHg</fact11>), and low PAP (<fact12>20/5 mmHg</fact12>), indicating that the problem is not with the heart's ability to pump blood. The low PCWP (<fact13>5 mm Hg</fact13>) suggests that the problem is not with the left side of the heart. The combination of low CVP, low RVP, low PAP, and low PCWP, along with the patient's oxygen desaturation and crackles, is most consistent with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), also known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, the most likely direct cause of his death is <A> Diffuse alveolar damage."
212,"A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:

This diagnostic step will help identify the specific subtype of lymphoma, which is crucial for determining the treatment plan. The answer is {D}."
375,"A 50-year-old man presents to his physician with chronic cough, aching joints in his hips and lower back, and malaise over the past 2 months. He describes himself as being “generally healthy” before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues.

She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering.

Answer: The most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is <B>Increased tryptophan intake</B>.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>fever</fact2>, <fact3>worsening malaise and diaphoresis</fact3>, and <fact4>diaphoresis and shivering</fact4> suggests a systemic infection or inflammation. The patient's past medical history of <fact6>major depressive disorder</fact6> and <fact7>obesity</fact7> is relevant, as she has been taking <fact12>citalopram</fact12> for her depression and has been trying to <fact16>lose weight</fact16> by following a <fact19>low-carbohydrate diet</fact19> and taking an <fact17>amino acid supplement</fact17>. The increased intake of tryptophan, an amino acid, can lead to the production of serotonin, which can cause a range of symptoms including <fact3>worsening malaise and diaphoresis</fact3>, <fact25>diaphoresis</fact25>, and <fact26>shivering</fact26> (Ref 1). Additionally, the patient's symptoms of <fact27>increased patellar and brachioradialis reflexes</fact27> and <fact28>increased tone in her bilateral upper and lower extremities</fact28> suggest a neurological component to her condition, which is consistent with the effects of excessive tryptophan intake (Ref 2). Therefore, the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is <B>Increased tryptophan intake</B>.

683,"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?
A) Isoniazid
B) Fluconazole
C) Caspofungin

Answer: 
E) Vascular dementia

Explanation: 
The patient's symptoms of <fact2>memory issues</fact2> that have progressively worsened over the last several years, along with the recent acute worsening, suggest a neurodegenerative disorder. His medical history of <fact3>diabetes mellitus type 2</fact3> and <fact4>hypertension</fact4> increases his risk for vascular dementia. The patient's history of <fact5>left basal ganglia hemorrhage</fact5> 12 years ago and a <fact6>right middle cerebral artery infarction</fact6> 4 years ago further supports the diagnosis of vascular dementia. The patient's physical examination findings, including <fact20>Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side</fact20> and <fact21>exaggerated reflexes</fact21> on the right side, are consistent with a vascular cause of dementia. The <fact22>hemiparetic gait</fact22> also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is vascular dementia."

Answer: The patient is a <fact1>14-year-old obese boy</fact1> with <fact2>severe right hip and knee pain</fact2> due to <fact29>displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck</fact29>, which is indicative of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). This condition is more common in obese children and adolescents, particularly those with a <fact17>high BMI</fact17>. The most appropriate course of treatment for this patient is <fact30>surgical pinning of the right hip</fact30>. This is because SCFE is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent further displacement and potential complications such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Surgical pinning is the preferred treatment for SCFE to stabilize the femoral head and allow for proper healing [1]. Therefore, the correct answer is {E}.

Answer: 

Given the patient's presentation with worsening <fact2>abdominal pain</fact2> and <fact4>nausea and vomiting</fact4> after initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with <fact26>ceftriaxone and metronidazole</fact26>, the patient's condition has not improved, indicating a possible complication. The ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows <fact23>dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts</fact23> and <fact24>multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder</fact24>, which suggests a possible biliary obstruction or cholecystitis. The patient's <fact28>acute illness</fact28> and altered mental status may be due to sepsis or other complications related to the biliary obstruction.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an <fact33>Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</fact33> to assess the biliary system and potentially relieve the obstruction. ERCP is a minimally invasive procedure that allows for visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts and can be used to perform sphincterotomy, stone extraction, or stent placement to relieve obstruction.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?

Answer: E) Congestive heart failure

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>2-month history of a non-productive cough and fatigue</fact2>, <fact3>4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss</fact3>, and <fact15>dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base</fact15> suggests a possible pulmonary issue. The patient's history of <fact4>congestive heart failure and hypertension</fact4> increases her risk for heart failure-related complications. The presence of a <fact19>x-ray of the chest showing nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion</fact19> and <fact20>Thoracentesis showing 250 ml of turbid fluid</fact20> further supports the presence of a pleural effusion. The analysis of the <fact21>pleural fluid aspirate</fact21> shows a high <fact22>protein level of 3.8 g/dL</fact22> and <fact23>lactate dehydrogenase of 248 U/L</fact23>, which are indicative of an exudative effusion. Given the patient's history of <fact4>congestive heart failure and hypertension</fact4> and the presence of an exudative effusion, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion is congestive heart failure."
389,"An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

Explanation: The patient is an <fact1>8-week-old male</fact1> presenting with <fact5>regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds</fact5>, which has been ongoing for <fact4>two weeks</fact4>. The mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which has reduced the frequency of the regurgitation.

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a <fact31>neoplastic growth in the descending colon</fact31>. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his <fact32>cardiac findings</fact32>?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of a <fact20>high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border</fact20> is indicative of aortic regurgitation. The presence of <fact21>a head that bobs with each heartbeat</fact21> further supports this diagnosis, as it is a characteristic sign of aortic regurgitation. Given the patient's <fact31>neoplastic growth in the descending colon</fact31>, the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings is a <fact33>malignant colonic neoplasm</fact33> causing aortic regurgitation through a paraneoplastic syndrome. The patient's <fact17>pale mucous membranes</fact17>, <fact18>conjunctival hemorrhages</fact18>, and <fact19>petechiae on his lower extremities</fact19> suggest a possible diagnosis of anemia and thrombocytopenia, which could be secondary to the malignancy. The patient's laboratory results show a <fact24>low hemoglobin</fact24> and <fact28>low serum ferritin</fact28>, which further support the diagnosis of anemia. The patient's <fact26>high platelet count</fact26> could be secondary to a myeloproliferative disorder or a paraneoplastic syndrome. Therefore, the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings is a malignant colonic neoplasm causing aortic regurgitation through a paraneoplastic syndrome. The answer is {C}."

423,"A 49-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and cough which she developed approx. 8 hours ago. 2 weeks ago she had a prophylactic ovariectomy because of a family history of ovarian cancer. She is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1 hypertension, but she does not take her antihypertensives because she is not concerned about her blood pressure. Also, she has a history of opioid abuse. She takes metformin 1000 mg and aspirin 81 mg. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years.

Based on the given data, which of the following could cause <fact36>respiratory failure</fact36> in this patient?

Answer: 
A) <fact37>Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli</fact37> is not supported by the information in the question. The question does not mention any specific information about the patient's lungs or alveoli. The patient's <fact38>blood saturation on room air is 89%</fact38>, which indicates that the patient is experiencing hypoxemia. However, the question does not provide any information about the patient's lung function or the presence of any lung disease that could cause increased alveolar dead space.

B) <fact39>Ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons</fact39> is not supported by the information in the question. The question does not mention any specific information about the patient's neurological examination or any signs of neurological damage. The patient's <fact30>neurological examination</fact30> is within normal limits.

C) <fact40>Alveolar fibrosis</fact40> is not supported by the information in the question. The question does not mention any specific information about the patient's lungs or the presence of any lung disease that could cause alveolar fibrosis.

D) <fact41>Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation</fact41> is supported by the information in the question. The patient has a <fact11>history of opioid abuse</fact11>, which could cause respiratory depression and respiratory failure. The patient's <fact32>pH 7.49</fact32> and <fact33>PaCO2 30 mm Hg</fact33> indicate respiratory alkalosis, which is consistent with opioid-induced respiratory depression.

E) <fact42>Decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction</fact42> is not supported by the information in the question. The question does not mention any specific information about the patient's lungs or the presence of any lung disease that could cause bronchial obstruction."
914,"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?
A) Affinity maturation
B) Random assortment
C) Random nucleotide addition
D) VDJ recombination

Answer: The process that this sequence typically undergoes in immunocompetent individuals is <fact24>VDJ recombination</fact24>. This is evident from the fact that the <fact17>protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition</fact17>, which suggests that the protein is an antibody. The <fact18>amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated</fact18> and a <fact19>fluorescent marker is added to the sequence</fact19>, and then the labeled sequence is added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own <fact21>neutrophils and macrophages</fact21>, which indicates that the sequence is being used to identify a specific antigen. This process is characteristic of VDJ recombination, which is the process by which the variable region of an antibody is formed through the recombination of V, D, and J gene segments. This process is essential for the development of a diverse repertoire of antibodies in immunocompetent individuals."
608,"A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following?
A) The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population
B) The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group
C) The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population
D) The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths
E) The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year","Reformatted Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period.

E) The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year

Answer: D) The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths

Explanation: The primary measure used in this study is the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), which is a statistical measure used to compare the observed number of deaths in a population to the expected number of deaths based on a standard population. This is calculated by dividing the observed number of deaths by the expected number of deaths (option D). The SMR is a widely used measure in epidemiological studies to assess the mortality rates of different populations. In this study, the SMR was used to compare the mortality rates of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting to the expected mortality rates in a standard population."

Answer: 
The patient had a history of <fact2>asthma</fact2> and <fact3>cocaine use</fact3>, and he was treated with <fact4>albuterol</fact4> and <fact5>ibuprofen</fact5>. The patient's sudden worsening after the administration of <fact24>hydromorphone</fact24> and the onset of <fact25>short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement</fact25> are indicative of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. The patient's history of <fact3>cocaine use</fact3> and the administration of <fact24>hydromorphone</fact24> are significant factors in this scenario. Cocaine can cause mast cell degranulation, leading to the release of histamine and other mediators, which can cause an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Hydromorphone is a common cause of anaphylaxis due to its opioid properties. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient's history is related to a history of <fact3>cocaine use</fact3> and the administration of <fact24>hydromorphone</fact24>, which is not explicitly listed in the options provided. However, based on the information given, the closest answer would be (C) <fact30>Irregularly irregular heart rhythm</fact30>, as cocaine use is associated with irregularly irregular heart rhythms, but it is not the most direct answer."

The abdominal ultrasonography shows an <fact30>enlarged liver</fact30>, and the liver biopsy shows <fact31>massive centrilobular necrosis</fact31>. These findings suggest a liver injury, which is consistent with <fact32>hemolysis</fact32> due to the transfusion of <fact5>1 unit of packed red blood cells</fact5>. The patient's condition is most likely caused by <fact33>excessive lysis of red blood cells</fact33>, leading to liver dysfunction and the observed laboratory abnormalities."

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation, the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction would be an <fact24>Abdominal-pelvic CT scan</fact24>. This is because the patient has a <fact8>suprapelvic catheter</fact8> with a <fact19>red and swollen</fact19> <fact18>cystotomy incision</fact18> and the catheter tube produces no urine over <fact21>24 hours</fact21> with only thick <fact22>green-white puss</fact22> expressed, indicating a possible obstruction. A CT scan would provide detailed images of the urinary tract, allowing for the identification of any potential obstructions, such as stones, tumors, or other abnormalities. This would be a more accurate method than a <fact25>Renal biopsy</fact25>, which would be more invasive and not as informative in this scenario. A <fact26>Urine analysis</fact26> may provide some information, but it would not be sufficient to evaluate the extent of the obstruction. A <fact27>blood analysis</fact27> may also provide some information, but it would not be directly related to the evaluation of urinary tract obstruction. An <fact28>Ultrasound</fact28> may provide some information, but it would not be as detailed as a CT scan in this scenario."

Answer: Considering the patient's <fact2>productive cough</fact2> with <fact5>sputum production increased in volume</fact5> and <fact6>yellow-green sputum color</fact6>, the patient is likely experiencing a respiratory infection. The patient's medical history of <fact13>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</fact13> and <fact15>smoking approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years</fact15> increases his risk for bacterial infections. The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that the patient is experiencing a bacterial respiratory infection, such as pneumonia. Given the patient's <fact3>cough has been increasing in frequency and severity</fact3> over the course of <fact4>3 days</fact4> and the presence of <fact5>sputum production has increased in volume</fact5>, empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted. The patient is already on <fact26>ipratropium</fact26>, <fact27>albuterol</fact27>, and <fact28>methylprednisolone</fact28>, which are typical treatments for acute exacerbations of COPD. However, these medications do not cover the patient's likely bacterial infection. Therefore, the most appropriate antibiotic to add to this patient's treatment regimen is <fact29>Levofloxacin</fact29>, which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those commonly causing respiratory infections in patients with COPD."

Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?

Answer: A) Administer anti-D immunoglobulin now and repeat antibody screening shortly before delivery.

Explanation: The patient is <fact1>23 years old</fact1> and <fact2>gravida 2, para 1</fact2> at <fact3>20 weeks of gestation</fact3>. She has a past medical history of a <fact5>blood transfusion after a car accident</fact5> with a <fact6>complex femur fracture</fact6> about <fact7>3 years ago</fact7>. The patient's <fact8>anti-D antibody screen</fact8> is <fact19>Negative</fact19>, which indicates that she is not currently sensitized to RhD. However, because she received a <fact5>blood transfusion</fact5> in the past, there is a risk that she may have developed antibodies to RhD. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), women who have received a blood transfusion and have an unknown or negative anti-D antibody screen should receive anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and again after delivery if the newborn is RhD positive [1]. Therefore, the best next step in management of this patient is to administer anti-D immunoglobulin now and repeat antibody screening shortly before delivery.

Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>54-year-old man</fact1> has been experiencing <fact5>memory changes</fact5> that have progressed from <fact3>misplacing objects</fact3> to <fact4>forgetting the names of their children</fact4> over the past <fact2>6 weeks</fact2>.

506,"A 42-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with decreased consciousness and convulsions. His wife reports that 30 min following the onset of her husband’s condition, which started approximately 6 hours ago, he treated his garden bed with pesticides against mice. He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications.

Answer: B) Citrate

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including <fact2>decreased consciousness and convulsions</fact2>, <fact6>nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps</fact6>, and <fact7>facial muscle twitching</fact7>, suggest a toxic effect of the pesticide. The use of <fact25>sodium fluoroacetate</fact25> as a pesticide is known to form <fact26>fluorocitrate</fact26> in the cells of aerobic organisms. Fluorocitrate is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase, which catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle. As a result, citrate will accumulate in the patient's cells because it cannot be further metabolized due to the inhibition of aconitase by fluorocitrate."

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>fever, abdominal pain, and confusion</fact2> along with <fact10>temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F)</fact10>, <fact11>pulse of 101/min</fact11>, and <fact12>blood pressure of 104/68 mm Hg</fact12> suggests a severe infection. The <fact13>confusion and oriented only to person</fact13> indicates altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy. The presence of <fact14>scleral icterus and spider angiomas</fact14> is consistent with liver disease, and the <fact16>abdomen is distended and shifting dullness is present</fact16> indicates ascites. Laboratory studies show elevated <fact20>leukocyte count</fact20> and <fact23>total bilirubin</fact23>, which are indicative of an infectious process. The ascitic fluid analysis shows a low <fact27>albumin concentration of 0.8 g/dL</fact27> and a high <fact29>leukocyte count of 1900/mm3 with 60% neutrophils</fact29>, which suggests a bacterial infection. Among the options provided, choice D describes bacterial translocation, which is the most likely explanation for these findings. The patient's liver disease and ascites make him susceptible to bacterial translocation, leading to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis."
713,"A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?
A) Pedunculated cervical growth
B) Inflammation of the cervix
C) Cervical trauma

Answer: 
Given the patient's <fact1>29-year-old woman</fact1> age and her <fact2>gravida 3, para 2</fact2> status, the most likely cause of her <fact33>antepartum bleeding</fact33> is related to her <fact7>in vitro fertilization</fact7> pregnancy, which was achieved due to <fact8>azoospermia in her partner</fact8>. This condition is associated with an increased risk of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders, including placenta previa and placental abruption. The presence of <fact9>uncomplicated</fact9> and <fact10>regular prenatal visits</fact10> does not rule out the possibility of PAS disorders. The patient's <fact12>sexual activity</fact12> resumed at <fact13>week 22 of gestation</fact13> may have contributed to the development of placenta previa. The patient's history of <fact15>nonreassuring fetal heart rate</fact15> during her previous pregnancy and <fact17>abnormal Pap smears</fact17> due to <fact18>HPV</fact18> in the past may also be relevant. However, the most likely cause of her <fact33>antepartum bleeding</fact33> is the uniformly echogenic placenta located at the <fact32>fundal end of the posterior uterine wall</fact32> as seen on ultrasound, which is consistent with placenta previa."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: C) Borderline personality disorder

Explanation: The patient's reaction to the news of her spontaneous abortion is a key indicator of her underlying mental health condition. Initially, she is grateful for the care she is receiving, but upon hearing the news, she becomes angry and aggressive, accusing her physician and the medical staff of incompetence and evil. This sudden change in behavior and her threat to sue the medical staff suggest a lack of emotional regulation and impulsivity, which are characteristic of borderline personality disorder. Additionally, the patient's history of substance abuse and anxiety also supports this diagnosis. The presence of new lacerations on her wrists further indicates self-harm behavior, which is also consistent with borderline personality disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C) Borderline personality disorder."

Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient’s condition?

Answer: B) Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission

Explanation: The patient presents with <fact2>6 days of lower abdominal pain</fact2>, <fact3>feverish</fact3>, and <fact4>nonbloody diarrhea</fact4>, which are indicative of a potential pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The patient's <fact10>irregular periods</fact10> and <fact11>last menstrual period 6 weeks ago</fact11> suggest that she may be pregnant, which increases the risk of PID. The presence of <fact25>moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault</fact25>, <fact26>cervical motion tenderness</fact26>, and a <fact27>tender adnexal mass on the right side</fact27> further supports the diagnosis of PID. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the potential for complications, such as tubo-ovarian abscess or infertility, the best next step is to initiate intravenous antibiotics and admit the patient to the hospital. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline are recommended for the treatment of PID, as they cover a broad spectrum of bacteria, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, which are common causes of PID."

Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?

Answer: B) Choledocholithiasis.

Explanation: The patient is a <fact1>38-year-old woman</fact1> with <fact2>three 1-hour episodes of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant</fact2>, which is suggestive of biliary colic. The presence of <fact3>nausea and vomiting</fact3> during these episodes further supports this diagnosis. The <fact4>absence of diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria</fact4> and being <fact5>asymptomatic between episodes</fact5> makes other causes of abdominal pain less likely. Her medical history of <fact6>hypertension and hyperlipidemia</fact6> and <fact7>resection of the terminal ileum because of severe Crohn's disease</fact7> is not directly relevant to her current symptoms. The <fact8>physical examination</fact8> reveals <fact12>mild scleral icterus</fact12> and <fact13>tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound</fact13>, which is consistent with biliary colic. The <fact14>abdominal ultrasonography</fact14> shows a <fact23>normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm)</fact23>, and a gallbladder with <fact23>multiple gallstones</fact23>, which is a common cause of biliary colic. The laboratory studies show elevated <fact20>alkaline phosphatase</fact20>, <fact21>AST</fact21>, and <fact22>ALT</fact22>, which are indicative of liver dysfunction, but not specific to any particular cause. Given the patient's symptoms and ultrasonography findings, the most likely cause of her findings is <fact2>choledocholithiasis</fact2>, which is the presence of a gallstone in the common bile duct."
684,"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fever (41.5℃ (106.7℉)) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of <fact2>prickling in his hands and feet</fact2> and <fact7>severe weakness in both lower extremities</fact7> along with the absence of <fact9>Knee and ankle jerk reflexes</fact9> suggests a neurological disorder. The <fact3>fever, dry cough, and a sore throat</fact3> three weeks prior to the current symptoms may be a prodromal phase of the illness. The laboratory studies show a normal <fact10>Hemoglobin</fact10>, <fact11>Leukocyte count</fact11>, and <fact16>Platelet count</fact16>, which suggests that the patient is not suffering from a hematological disorder. The <fact17>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate</fact17> is elevated, indicating inflammation. The <fact26>cerebrospinal fluid analysis</fact26> shows a <fact27>leukocyte count of 2/mm3</fact27>, a <fact28>glucose concentration of 60 mg/dL</fact28>, and a <fact29>protein concentration of 91 mg/dL</fact29>, which is indicative of a non-infectious process. 

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder that can occur after a viral infection. The patient's symptoms, such as <fact2>prickling in his hands and feet</fact2> and <fact7>severe weakness in both lower extremities</fact7>, are consistent with GBS. The <fact26>cerebrospinal fluid analysis</fact26> showing a <fact27>leukocyte count of 2/mm3</fact27> and a <fact29>protein concentration of 91 mg/dL</fact29> supports this diagnosis.

The most appropriate next step in treatment for GBS is the administration of <fact30>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)</fact30>. IVIG has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity and duration of GBS. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

Given the information provided, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is <fact32>Bernard-Soulier disease</fact32>. The key indicators include: 

- <fact2>nose bleeding without trauma</fact2> and <fact3>1-month history of multiple bruising</fact3> without prior <fact6>bleeding history</fact6> or relevant <fact7>family history</fact7>, suggesting an underlying coagulation disorder.
- The physical exam findings of <fact12>pale skin color</fact12>, <fact13>petechiae in the soft palate and in the upper and lower extremities</fact13>, and <fact14>ecchymosis in the back of the hands and feet</fact14> are indicative of a bleeding disorder.
- The laboratory results, including a normal <fact24>Platelet count</fact24>, slightly prolonged <fact25>Partial thromboplastin time (activated)</fact25>, and normal <fact26>Prothrombin time</fact26> and <fact28>Fibrinogen</fact28> levels, suggest a platelet-related disorder.
- The presence of <fact29>hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets</fact29> on the blood smear, along with a normal <fact30>platelet aggregation test with ristocetin</fact30>, points towards a platelet function disorder.
- The increased <fact31>bleeding time</fact31> further supports the diagnosis of a bleeding disorder.

Bernard-Soulier disease is a rare bleeding disorder characterized by large platelets, thrombocytopenia, and a prolonged bleeding time. The disease is caused by mutations in the GP1BA gene, which encodes for the platelet glycoprotein Ib-alpha subunit. This mutation leads to impaired platelet adhesion and aggregation, resulting in the clinical manifestations observed in this patient.

The other options are less likely because:
- <fact32>Von Willebrand disease</fact32> is a bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the VWF gene, which encodes for von Willebrand factor. While it can present with similar symptoms, the laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.
- <fact33>Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia</fact33> is a bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the ITGA2B or ITGB3 genes, which encode for the platelet glycoproteins IIb and IIIa. The platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is abnormal in this disease, which is not the case here.
- <fact34>Aspirin</fact34> is not a cause of this patient's condition, as the symptoms and laboratory results suggest a congenital bleeding disorder rather than an acquired one.
- <fact35>Scurvy</fact35> is a condition caused by vitamin C deficiency, which can lead to bleeding gums and easy bruising. However, the laboratory results do not support this diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a bleeding disorder."

Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?

Answer: A

Explanation: The patient's presentation is suggestive of a psychotic episode, which is a common manifestation of <fact2>schizophrenia</fact2>. The patient's <fact11>poorly kempt</fact11> appearance, <fact12>odd body odor</fact12>, and <fact13>multiple ulcers in the oropharynx</fact13> are indicative of poor self-care and possibly malnutrition. The presence of a <fact14>friction rub</fact14> on cardiac exam may indicate cardiac involvement, which is a known complication of <fact2>schizophrenia</fact2>. The patient's lab values show a <fact28>slightly elevated platelet count</fact28> and a <fact25>low hemoglobin</fact25>, which may be indicative of a <fact2>hematologic abnormality</fact2>. However, the most relevant finding is the patient's <fact29>normal leukocyte count</fact29>, which rules out an acute infection as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of <fact2>schizophrenia</fact2>. The most appropriate next step in management is to administer <fact30>IM haloperidol</fact30>, a typical antipsychotic medication that is effective in treating acute psychotic episodes. Haloperidol is a good choice because it is available in an IM formulation, which allows for rapid administration in an emergency setting. The patient's <fact5>history of medication non-compliance</fact5> makes oral medication less effective, and the IM formulation can help ensure adherence to treatment.

In addition to administering haloperidol, it is also important to address the patient's <fact4>obesity</fact4> and <fact3>anxiety</fact3> through a comprehensive treatment plan that includes lifestyle modifications and psychotherapy. The patient's <fact2>depression</fact2> should also be addressed through a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

The other options are not the best next step in management. <fact31>Haloperidol depot</fact31> is a long-acting formulation of haloperidol that is used to maintain treatment adherence in patients with schizophrenia, but it is not the best choice for acute management. <fact32>Clozapine</fact32> is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is used to treat treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it is not the best choice for acute management. <fact33>Urine toxicology</fact33> may be useful in ruling out substance-induced psychosis, but it is not the best next step in management. <fact34>ANA and anti-dsDNA levels</fact34> may be useful in ruling out autoimmune disorders, but they are not relevant to the patient's presentation."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: C) Craniopharyngioma

Explanation:
The <fact1>8-year-old boy</fact1> presents with <fact2>short stature</fact2>, <fact3>headaches at night</fact3>, and <fact4>increased thirst and urination</fact4>, which are indicative of diabetes insipidus. His laboratory studies show a low <fact28>Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) level</fact28>, which is a marker of growth hormone deficiency. The combination of diabetes insipidus and growth hormone deficiency suggests a central cause, such as a <fact5>craniopharyngioma</fact5>, which is a type of brain tumor that can affect the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. The presence of <fact6>short stature</fact6> and <fact7>low IGF-1 level</fact7> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's mother has <fact8>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</fact8> and had <fact9>precocious puberty</fact9>, which suggests a possible genetic component to the patient's condition. The <fact10>absence of axillary hair</fact10> and <fact11>patellar reflexes</fact11> are also consistent with a pituitary gland disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is <fact12>craniopharyngioma</fact12>."

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation, the most appropriate next step in management is to assess for potential internal injuries, particularly in the chest and abdomen. The patient's <fact13>decreased breath sounds over the right lung base</fact13> and <fact14>tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall</fact14> suggest possible thoracic injuries. The <fact15>abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound</fact15>, which could indicate internal bleeding or organ damage. 

Considering these factors, the most appropriate next step is to perform a <fact20>focussed assessment sonography for trauma (FAST)</fact20> to quickly evaluate for free intraperitoneal fluid or pericardial effusion, which would indicate internal bleeding.

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?

Answer: The patient's laboratory findings are indicative of rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue. This is supported by the patient's <fact19>low hemoglobin</fact19> and <fact20>low hematocrit</fact20>, suggesting anemia, as well as the <fact27>high BUN</fact27> and <fact29>high creatinine</fact29>, indicating renal impairment. The <fact30>high AST</fact30> and <fact31>high ALT</fact31> suggest liver injury, but the patient's <fact32>blood alcohol level</fact32> is only <fact32>.15 g/dL</fact32>, which is not sufficient to cause such severe liver injury (A). The patient's <fact35>positive cocaine test</fact35> is consistent with the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, as cocaine use is a known risk factor for this condition (D). The patient's <fact34>positive protein</fact34> in the urine and <fact33>yellow urine color</fact33> are also consistent with rhabdomyolysis, as this condition can cause myoglobinuria, which is the presence of myoglobin in the urine (E). The patient's <fact21>normal leukocyte count</fact21> with normal differential and <fact22>normal platelet count</fact22> make an immune response or protein deposition less likely (B and C)."

Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?

Answer: This question involves a complex medical ethics scenario where the patient's daughter is being asked to make a decision about her father's medical treatment, despite the fact that he is unable to make decisions for himself. The patient's daughter is hesitant to consent to a life-saving operation because of her father's past behavior and her desire to ""live in peace."" However, the physician is concerned about the patient's well-being and the potential consequences of not performing the operation.

In this scenario, the most appropriate course of action is to refer the case to the court (option B). This is because the patient has no written advanced directive, and his daughter is unwilling to make a decision on his behalf. The court can then make a decision about the patient's medical treatment based on his best interests and the principles of medical ethics.

The other options are not appropriate in this scenario. Option A is incorrect because it would involve withholding a life-saving treatment from the patient, which would be unethical. Option C is incorrect because contacting another family member for consent may not be possible or may not be in the patient's best interests. Option D is incorrect because performing the surgery without consent would be a violation of the patient's autonomy and would be unethical. Option E is incorrect because reporting the daughter to the police is not relevant to the patient's medical treatment and would not address the ethical dilemma at hand.

Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to refer the case to the court, which would allow for a thorough evaluation of the patient's situation and a decision that is in his best interests."

The patient is <fact21>intubated</fact21> and <fact22>mechanical ventilation is begun</fact22>. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer: 

The patient has a <fact3>gunshot wound</fact3> with <fact5>hypotension</fact5> and <fact6>tachycardia</fact6>, indicating possible internal bleeding. The <fact11>1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding</fact11> on the <fact12>right side of the chest</fact12> in the <fact13>6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line</fact13> suggests a possible pneumothorax or hemothorax. However, the <fact16>focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium</fact16>, which makes cardiac tamponade less likely. The <fact18>x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe</fact18>, which could indicate a pulmonary contusion. Given these factors, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a <fact23>CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis</fact23> to further evaluate the extent of the internal injuries and guide further management. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

Answer: 

Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is <B> Dengue hemorrhagic fever</B>.

The patient's symptoms, such as <fact3>fever</fact3>, <fact4>persistent headache</fact4>, <fact5>nausea</fact5>, and <fact6>abdominal discomfort</fact6> for <fact7>1 week</fact7>, suggest a severe infection.

Urine and blood samples for culture and sensitivity tests are obtained. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer: 
A) Inpatient treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin

Explanation: 
The patient presents with <fact2>lower back pain, fever, and chills</fact2>, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) given the presence of <fact24>blood in the urine</fact24> and <fact25>protein in the urine</fact25>. The <fact26>leukocyte count is elevated at 19,000/mm3</fact26>, suggesting a bacterial infection. The patient's <fact21>urea nitrogen is elevated at 65 mg/dL</fact21> and <fact22>creatinine is elevated at 2.4 mg/dL</fact22>, indicating impaired renal function. The presence of <fact27>nitrite in the urine</fact27> and <fact28>wBC casts</fact28> further supports a UTI. Given the patient's <fact4>hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact4>, the patient is at increased risk for complications from UTI, such as sepsis.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?

Answer: 
A) Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

Explanation: 
This patient's symptoms of <fact2>bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters</fact2> and <fact3>severe right leg pain</fact3> six days after undergoing an <fact4>aortic valve replacement surgery</fact4> are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The presence of <fact15>multiple hematomas on the upper extremities around the peripheral intravenous access sites</fact15> further supports this diagnosis. The laboratory results show a significantly low <fact22>platelet count of 48,000/mm3</fact22>, which is a key indicator of thrombocytopenia. Additionally, the <fact23>prothrombin time of 15 seconds</fact23> and <fact24>activated partial thromboplastin time of 40 seconds</fact24> are elevated, suggesting a coagulopathy. The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which is a common cause of bleeding disorders in patients on anticoagulant therapy such as <fact10>prophylactic unfractionated heparin</fact10>."

A) Overflow proteinuria
B) Transient (functional) proteinuria
C) Tubular proteinuria
D) Orthostatic proteinuria
E) Isolated proteinuria

Answer: The patient's proteinuria best fits in the category of isolated proteinuria. This is because the patient's urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells, which is a characteristic of isolated proteinuria. Isolated proteinuria is defined as the presence of proteinuria in the absence of hematuria, pyuria, or other urinary abnormalities [1]. The patient's proteinuria is not accompanied by any other urinary abnormalities, making isolated proteinuria the most likely category.

Note: The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results. Overflow proteinuria is typically seen in conditions such as multiple myeloma or nephrotic syndrome, which are not indicated in this patient's presentation. Transient (functional) proteinuria is typically seen in children and is not relevant to this patient's age and presentation. Tubular proteinuria is typically seen in conditions such as acute tubular necrosis or tubulointerstitial disease, which are not indicated in this patient's presentation. Orthostatic proteinuria is typically seen in young adults and is not relevant to this patient's age and presentation."
609,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child’s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents’ death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests.

Answer: The best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure is {A} The patient’s closest relatives (spouse, child or parent), who must be brought to the hospital as fast as possible.

Explanation: In emergency situations, patients may be unable to provide informed consent for medical procedures. According to the American Medical Association (AMA), in such cases, informed consent can be obtained from a surrogate decision-maker, typically a family member or close relative (AMA, 2018). This is in line with the principle of autonomy, which is one of the four principles of medical ethics (Beauchamp & Childress, 2019). The surrogate decision-maker should be brought to the hospital as fast as possible to provide informed consent for the emergency procedure.

706,"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits.

Answer: The patient's symptoms of <fact2>progressive urinary leakage</fact2> that occurs even when she <fact5>laughs or coughs</fact5> suggest a condition known as stress urinary incontinence. The patient's history of <fact15>drinking at least 6 glasses of water a day</fact15> and <fact16>drinking more on days she goes for a long run</fact16> may contribute to her symptoms, but it is not the primary cause. The patient's <fact11>bipolar syndrome</fact11> and <fact12>lithium use</fact12> are not directly related to her urinary symptoms. The patient's <fact13>uncomplicated vaginal delivery</fact13> and <fact14>cesarean section</fact14> do not explain her symptoms. The patient's <fact21>Valsalva maneuver</fact21> results in <fact22>leakage of urine</fact22>, which is consistent with stress urinary incontinence. The patient's <fact23>urinalysis, including specific gravity</fact23>, is within normal limits, which rules out other potential causes of urinary incontinence such as diabetes mellitus or primary polydipsia. The patient's <fact24>negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin</fact24> test rules out pregnancy as a cause of her symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is <fact25>urethral hypermobility</fact25>, which is a common cause of stress urinary incontinence."

Physical exam is notable for a patient with <fact30>skin that appears yellow/orange</fact30>. Cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?

Answer: B) Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>skin color change</fact2> and laboratory findings of <fact28>total bilirubin of 11.3 mg/dL</fact28> and <fact29>direct bilirubin of 7.8 mg/dL</fact29> suggest a diagnosis of jaundice. The patient's <fact16>low hemoglobin of 10 g/dL</fact16> and <fact17>low hematocrit of 32%</fact17> also support this diagnosis. The most likely underlying pathology is a liver disorder, specifically a condition that affects the metabolism of bilirubin. Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity is associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of bilirubin, leading to jaundice. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase, which is responsible for converting bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted by the kidneys. The patient's presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis."

Plasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2–9 ng/dL)

What is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: 
A) Renal artery stenosis

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of <fact2>generalized weakness</fact2>, <fact3>increased urination</fact3>, and <fact4>increased thirst</fact4> is suggestive of a condition affecting electrolyte balance and renal function. The patient's <fact6>frequent episodes of constipation</fact6> since birth and <fact7>frequent cravings for salty foods</fact7> may be related to his renal condition. The patient's <fact8>low pulse</fact8> and <fact9>normal blood pressure</fact9> are not indicative of a severe hypertensive crisis, but the <fact10>normal respiratory rate</fact10> does not provide much information about his condition. The patient's <fact11>short stature</fact11> and <fact12>low weight</fact12> for his age may be related to his renal condition.

The lab results show <fact13>normal serum sodium</fact13> and <fact14>low serum potassium</fact14>, which is consistent with a condition causing potassium wasting. The <fact15>normal plasma renin activity</fact15> and <fact16>high plasma aldosterone concentration</fact16> suggest that the patient's condition is related to an overproduction of aldosterone, which is a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance. The patient's <fact17>elevated urinary calcium excretion</fact17> is consistent with a condition affecting the kidneys' ability to reabsorb calcium.

Based on the patient's presentation and lab results, the most likely diagnosis is renal artery stenosis, which is a condition where the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys are narrowed, leading to an overproduction of aldosterone and a loss of potassium."

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer: Considering the patient's presentation, the <fact1>67-year-old man</fact1> is scheduled for elective <fact2>femoropopliteal bypass surgery</fact2> of his left leg. He has a history of <fact4>peripheral arterial disease</fact4> and has smoked <fact9>1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years</fact9>, which increases his risk for atherosclerotic disease. The presence of a <fact22>bruit</fact22> on auscultation of the <fact21>right side of the neck</fact21> suggests the presence of a vascular stenosis or occlusion. Given the patient's history and the presence of a bruit, the most appropriate next step in management is to evaluate the extent of the atherosclerotic disease. Among the options provided, digital subtraction angiography of the neck (E) is the most appropriate next step in management as it will provide detailed images of the arterial vasculature and help identify the location and severity of the stenosis or occlusion. This information is crucial for planning the femoropopliteal bypass surgery and ensuring the patient's safety during the procedure."

He also has <fact19>moderate splenomegaly</fact19>, which, when palpated, elicits <fact20>pain</fact20>. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?

Answer:
Given the patient's presentation with <fact15>swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes</fact15>, <fact16>unintentional weight loss</fact16>, and <fact17>rib pain</fact17>, along with the presence of <fact18>cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy</fact18> and <fact19>moderate splenomegaly</fact19> with pain, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) progression. CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the production of an excessive number of immature white blood cells, known as lymphocytes. CLL can progress to a more aggressive form of the disease, which is often accompanied by the development of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.

The best treatment for CLL progression involves targeted therapies that can help manage the disease and improve the patient's quality of life. Among the options provided, <fact21>Imatinib</fact21> is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is commonly used to treat various types of cancer, including CLL. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for CLL progression.

A more appropriate treatment for CLL progression would be a chemotherapy regimen that is specifically designed to target the cancer cells. One such option is <fact22>Fludarabine</fact22>, a purine analog that is commonly used to treat CLL. Fludarabine has been shown to be effective in managing CLL progression and can help improve the patient's quality of life.

In conclusion, the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis of CLL progression is <fact23>Fludarabine</fact23>."

Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?

Answer: B) Lipodystrophy

Explanation: The patient is being treated for HIV with a combination of tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, he develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so it is replaced with ritonavir. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that is known to cause lipodystrophy, a condition characterized by abnormal fat distribution, including lipoatrophy (loss of fat in the face, arms, and legs) and lipohypertrophy (accumulation of fat in the abdomen, buttocks, and breasts). This condition is a known side effect of protease inhibitors, including ritonavir. The patient's risk of lipodystrophy is increased due to his history of cocaine abuse, which can also cause lipodystrophy. The patient's history of well-controlled asthma and motorcycle accident are not directly related to his risk of lipodystrophy. The patient's HIV status and treatment with antiretroviral therapy are the primary factors contributing to his risk of lipodystrophy."

Six hours later, the <fact19>activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds</fact19>. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?

Answer: 
The patient's symptoms of <fact2>swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg</fact2> that started <fact3>2 hours ago</fact3> are indicative of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The presence of <fact16>positive fibrin split products</fact16> and <fact17>ultrasonography findings of incompressibility of the popliteic vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow</fact17> further support this diagnosis. The patient's <fact4>father has a history of pulmonary embolism</fact4>, which increases his risk for DVT. Additionally, his <fact5>history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago</fact5> is a significant risk factor for DVT. The patient's laboratory studies show a <fact14>prothrombin time of 11 seconds</fact14> and an <fact15>activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds</fact15>, which are within normal limits. However, the patient is administered a <fact18>5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion</fact18>, which suggests that the patient's symptoms are likely due to a thrombotic event. Among the provided options, <fact19>activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds</fact19> after 6 hours of heparin therapy is within the therapeutic range, indicating that the patient is responding to anticoagulation therapy. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a <fact20>thrombophilic disorder</fact20>. The options provided include several genetic disorders that increase the risk of thrombosis. However, the patient's age and sex, along with the presence of a family history of pulmonary embolism, make <fact21>Factor V Leiden</fact21> the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms."

A <fact1>24-year-old woman</fact1> presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with <fact2>meningococcal meningitis</fact2>. She was told by her friend that she needs to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any <fact3>headaches</fact3>, <fact4>vision changes</fact4>, <fact5>nausea or vomiting</fact5>, or <fact6>neck stiffness</fact6>. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed <fact7>rifampin</fact7> for <fact8>prophylaxis</fact8> with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of <fact9>pregnancy</fact9>, she mentioned that she uses <fact10>combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)</fact10> for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use <fact11>condoms</fact11> for contraception as she requires <fact12>antibiotic therapy</fact12>. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?

Answer: 
The <fact1>24-year-old woman</fact1> is prescribed <fact7>rifampin</fact7> for <fact8>prophylaxis</fact8> due to her exposure to <fact2>meningococcal meningitis</fact2>. To assess the impact of <fact7>rifampin</fact7> on her <fact10>combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)</fact10>, we need to understand how <fact7>rifampin</fact7> interacts with the contraceptive. Rifampin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly <fact13>CYP3A4</fact13>. As a result, rifampin can lead to the increased metabolism of various drugs, including <fact14>estrogens</fact14> and <fact15>progestins</fact15> found in OCPs. Specifically, rifampin can induce the metabolism of <fact16>progestins</fact16> by <fact17>CYP3A4</fact17>, leading to decreased levels of progestins in the body. This decreased level of progestins can compromise the effectiveness of OCPs, increasing the risk of pregnancy. Therefore, the physician suggested that her husband should use <fact11>condoms</fact11> for contraception as she requires <fact12>antibiotic therapy</fact12> to prevent the development of meningococcal meningitis. The correct answer is {B}"

Answer: 
Given the patient's history of <fact1>42-year-old man</fact1> with <fact2>elevated liver function tests</fact2> and <fact28>positive Hepatitis C antibody</fact28> with <fact29>positive HCV RNA</fact29> and <fact30>HCV genotype 1</fact30>, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate antiviral therapy. Considering the patient's <fact4>30 years ago</fact4> car accident and the lack of other potential causes for liver disease, such as <fact10>alcoholism</fact10> or <fact7>illicit intravenous drug use</fact7>, the patient's liver disease is most likely due to chronic hepatitis C infection. The patient's <fact31>liver biopsy</fact31> showing <fact32>mononuclear infiltrates</fact32> that are limited to <fact33>portal tracts</fact33> and <fact34>periportal hepatocyte necrosis</fact34> is consistent with chronic hepatitis C.

Among the options provided, the combination of <fact8>medications</fact8> sofosbuvir and ledipasvir is a recommended treatment for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1, as it has been shown to be highly effective in achieving sustained virogression of the virus (SVR) [1]. The combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir has been shown to have a high cure rate, with SVR rates of up to 95% in clinical trials [2]. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy.

The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?

Answer: Let's think step by step. The patient is a <fact1>13-year-old boy</fact1> with a presentation of <fact2>confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting</fact2> accompanied by <fact3>weight loss of 6 kg (13.2 lb)</fact3> over the past 20 days, <fact4>increased urination and thirst</fact4>, and <fact5>labored breathing</fact5>. His laboratory results show a <fact12>low pH of 7.19</fact12> and a significantly elevated <fact13>blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL</fact13>. These symptoms are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketosis, often resulting from a deficiency of insulin. The hormone most relevant to this condition is insulin, which regulates glucose uptake by cells. In the context of DKA, the decreased levels of insulin lead to increased glucose levels in the blood. Therefore, the most likely effect of this hormone deficiency is <fact14>increased glucose levels in the blood</fact14>, which is consistent with option E, <fact15>increased glucose uptake by brain cells</fact15> is not correct because in DKA, the brain cells are not able to uptake glucose properly due to the lack of insulin."

This is because the patient has <fact2>severe menstrual cramping</fact2> that is <fact6>intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen</fact6>, and there is usually accompanying <fact7>back pain</fact7>. The patient has tried <fact8>heating pads with limited relief</fact8>, but NSAIDs are a more effective treatment for menstrual cramps. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, which is a common cause of menstrual cramps in adolescents."

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?

Answer: Based on the presence of <fact2>pain in his right toe</fact2> and the <fact15>appearance of the synovial fluid as cloudy, dense yellow</fact15>, along with the presence of <fact16>30,000 cells/µL</fact16> and <fact17>needle-shaped birefringent crystals</fact17> in the joint aspirate, the patient is likely suffering from gout. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often the big toe. It is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to the formation of urate crystals in the joints. The most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition is related to the formation of urate crystals. 

Considering the provided options, option A) Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion is a mechanism that can contribute to the development of hyperuricemia, but it is not the most direct cause of gout. Option B) Increased renal reabsorption of urate is also a mechanism that can lead to hyperuricemia, but it is not the most direct cause of gout. Option C) Lysis of large numbers of cells can release uric acid into the bloodstream, but it is not the most direct cause of gout. Option D) Deficiency of HGPRT is a genetic disorder that leads to the accumulation of uric acid in the body, which can cause gout. Option E) High-purine diet can lead to the production of uric acid, but it is not the most direct cause of gout.

Based on the information provided, the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition is related to the formation of urate crystals, which is directly related to the accumulation of uric acid in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Deficiency of HGPRT."

Explanation: The patient has a <fact9>history of head trauma</fact9> and had two <fact10>seizure episodes</fact10> afterwards, but he is not currently on any <fact11>antiepileptic medication</fact11>. Bupropion is known to lower the seizure threshold, but the risk of seizures is significantly reduced when the medication is used at the recommended dose and in patients without a history of seizure disorder (<fact19>seizure disorder</fact19>). In this case, the patient does not have any other contraindications for bupropion, such as a history of eating disorders, alcohol or drug abuse, or a history of glaucoma (<fact20>glaucoma</fact20>). Therefore, the patient may safely use bupropion for smoking cessation."

Answer: Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the necessary treatment is hormone replacement therapy.

The patient's symptoms of <fact2>frequent headaches</fact2> and <fact3>excessive fatigue</fact3> during soccer practice, along with his mother's observation that he has gained a lot of weight despite a healthy diet, suggest hypothyroidism (option E). The physical exam findings of <fact4>nonpitting edema</fact4> and <fact6>decreased reflexes</fact6> are also consistent with hypothyroidism.

The laboratory findings support this diagnosis: the <fact10>BUN is within normal limits</fact10>, <fact11>pCO2 is slightly low</fact11>, <fact12>Creatinine is within normal limits</fact12>, <fact13>Glucose is low</fact13>, <fact14>Serum chloride is low</fact14>, <fact15>Serum potassium is low</fact15>, <fact16>Serum sodium is low</fact16>, <fact17>Bicarbonate (HCO3) is low</fact17>, <fact18>TSH is low</fact18>, and <fact19>Free T4 is low</fact19>. These findings are consistent with primary hypothyroidism.

Therefore, the necessary treatment is hormone replacement therapy (option E)."

Answer: 
The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by his low oxygen saturation (<fact14>73%</fact14>) and high respiratory rate (<fact12>20/min</fact12>). His arterial blood gas analysis shows a low pH (<pH 7.32</p>), low PCO2 (<PCO2 33 mm Hg</PCO2>), and low PO2 (<PO2 73 mm Hg</PO2>), indicating hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis. Given his unresponsiveness and failure to improve with supplemental oxygen, the best next step in management is to reintubate the patient to secure his airway and provide mechanical ventilation. This will allow for more effective oxygenation and ventilation, and will help to improve his pH and PCO2 levels. The answer is {C}."

If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?

Answer: D) Pedal edema and flushing

Explanation: The class I anti-arrhythmic drug prescribed for the patient with Brugada syndrome is likely to be a sodium channel blocker, such as flecainide or propafenone. These drugs can cause various side effects, including anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and urinary retention, as well as alpha-blocking effects such as orthostatic hypotension. In high doses, these drugs can also cause peripheral vasodilation, leading to pedal edema and flushing (D). The other options are not directly related to the side effects of class I anti-arrhythmic drugs."

Which of the following is most likely to be found on histology?

Answer: C) PAS-positive material in the small intestine.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact2>abdominal pain</fact2> that <fact3>comes and goes</fact3> throughout the day, with the pain localized to <fact5>1-2 inches above the umbilicus</fact5>, suggests a condition that affects the upper gastrointestinal tract. The patient's relief of pain with eating more frequently and the use of <fact9>ibuprofen</fact9> with food also point towards a condition related to food intake. The presence of <fact18>bowel sounds</fact18> and a positive <fact19>stool guaiac test</fact19> indicate that the condition is not causing a complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's <fact14>alcohol use</fact14> and <fact15>smoking history</fact15> are risk factors for certain gastrointestinal conditions. Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis is celiac disease, a condition characterized by an immune reaction to gluten that leads to inflammation and damage in the small intestine. The hallmark histological feature of celiac disease is the presence of PAS-positive material in the small intestine, which is indicative of the deposition of mucin and the formation of villous atrophy. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}."

Answer: 

Given the patient's presentation of <fact2>fever, chills, and generalized weakness</fact2> with a history of <fact8>intravenous cocaine and heroin use</fact8> and <fact4>neck abscess 6 months ago</fact4>, the presence of <fact17>multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve</fact17> and <fact30>tricuspid regurgitation</fact30> on <fact28>transthoracic echocardiography</fact28> is highly suggestive of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures are essential in diagnosing the causative organism. However, the question asks for the most appropriate next step in management. 

The most critical step in managing infective endocarditis is to start appropriate antibiotic therapy as soon as possible. According to the guidelines, the initial antibiotic therapy should be broad-spectrum, covering both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Given the patient's presentation, the most likely causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus, which is commonly associated with intravenous drug use. 

The initial antibiotic therapy should include vancomycin and gentamicin. However, the question does not provide gentamicin as an option. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to start intravenous vancomycin therapy. 

Answer: B) Intravenous vancomycin therapy"

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of <fact2>severe pain in her lower back</fact2> after dialysis, along with laboratory findings of <fact22>hypercalcemia</fact22> and <fact23>hyperphosphatemia</fact23>, suggests hyperparathyroidism. The patient's history of <fact5>chronic kidney disease</fact5> is a well-known risk factor for secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response to chronic kidney disease. This condition can lead to an increase in calcium levels, which can cause bone resorption and potentially lead to <fact26>wedge compression fractures</fact26> of the spine. The patient's history of <fact4>laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago</fact4> does not directly relate to the current presentation. The patient's mental health history and family dynamics do not directly relate to the current presentation. The patient's laboratory findings do not suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, or tertiary hyperparathyroidism."

Which of the following is the most likely finding on <fact25>imaging of the left knee</fact25>?

Answer: A) <fact26>Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray</fact26>

Explanation: The patient presents with a <fact2>3-month history of left knee pain</fact2> accompanied by <fact3>stiffness upon waking for about 10–15 minutes</fact3>. These symptoms are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA), which is a degenerative joint disease often characterized by <fact20>tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line</fact20>, <fact21>crepitus</fact21>, and <fact22>pain with full flexion and extension</fact22>. The patient's <fact4>history of standing a lot at work</fact4> and <fact5>climbing stairs</fact5> may exacerbate the symptoms. The presence of <fact7>hypercholesterolemia</fact7> and <fact8>hypertension</fact8> may also contribute to the development of OA. The patient's <fact9>family history of metastatic breast cancer</fact9> is not directly relevant to the diagnosis of OA. The patient's <fact16>high BMI</fact16> may also contribute to the development of OA. The patient's <fact23>serum uric acid concentration is 8.0 mg/dL</fact23>, which is within the normal range, making gout less likely. The patient's <fact24>erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h</fact24>, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly, making inflammatory arthritis less likely. The most likely finding on <fact25>imaging of the left knee</fact25> is <fact26>osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray</fact26>, which is characteristic of OA."
782,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?
A) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
B) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
C) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
D) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
E) A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.","Reformatted Question: A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?

Answer: The researcher wants to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. This involves understanding the role of HIF-1a and its regulation under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. In normoxia, HIF-1a is hydroxylated by VHL, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. However, RCC can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia.

To detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions, the researcher should use a Western blot. Western blot is a technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample, and it is suitable for detecting HIF-1a. A Northern blot, on the other hand, is used to detect specific RNA sequences, which is not relevant to detecting HIF-1a protein. A Southern blot is used to detect specific DNA sequences, which is also not relevant to detecting HIF-1a protein.

Considering the researcher's goal of detecting HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions, the most likely true statement is that a Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control. This is because Western blot is a suitable technique for detecting HIF-1a protein, and RCC can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia.

Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Answer: The patient's presentation of <fact2>poor feeding</fact2>, <fact3>irritability</fact3>, and <fact4>frequent vomiting</fact4> with <fact5>greenish-colored vomit</fact5> is suggestive of an intestinal obstruction. The <fact6>spitting up or refusal to eat</fact6> and <fact7>first bowel movement at 50 hours of life</fact7> further support this diagnosis.

What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?

Answer: 

Given the patient's presentation of primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and normal testosterone levels, the most likely diagnosis is <fact2>Müllerian agenesis</fact2>. This condition is characterized by the congenital absence of the upper vagina and uterus, often presenting with primary amenorrhea. The patient's normal FSH and estradiol levels, within the normal ranges for the follicular phase, support the diagnosis of Müllerian agenesis. In Müllerian agenesis, the ovaries are usually normal, and FSH and estradiol levels are typically within the normal range for the follicular phase, as seen in this patient. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's normal secondary sexual characteristics, including breast development and pubic hair, which are consistent with Tanner stage 5. The normal testosterone levels also rule out androgen insensitivity syndrome. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Müllerian agenesis."

Answer: The patient is experiencing <fact2>chest pain</fact2> that is described as <fact3>excruciating</fact3> and <fact4>ripping</fact4>, with radiation to the back. This presentation is suggestive of a <fact6>heart murmur</fact6> related to a possible cardiac condition. The patient's <fact7>height</fact7> and <fact18>joint hypermobility</fact18> are relevant factors, as they are often associated with Marfan syndrome, a condition that can lead to aortic root dilatation and aortic regurgitation.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?

Answer: 

The patient's presentation of <fact2>7-day history of nausea and vomiting</fact2>, <fact4>weak and tired</fact4>, <fact5>dizzy</fact5>, and <fact6>a normal amount</fact6> of urination despite increased frequency suggests a possible issue with fluid balance. The patient's <fact8>hypertension</fact8> and <fact9>hydrochlorothiazide</fact9> use indicate a potential diuretic effect. However, the patient's <fact11>9 glasses of water per day</fact11> intake and <fact15>normal temperature</fact15> make dehydration less likely. The laboratory findings of <fact22>hypernatremia</fact22>, <fact23>hyponatremia</fact23>, <fact24>normal potassium</fact24>, <fact25>alkalosis</fact25>, and <fact26>normal serum osmolality</fact26> suggest a complex fluid balance issue. The <fact28>high urine osmolality</fact28> indicates concentrated urine, which is not consistent with a diuretic effect. Considering the patient's <fact27>high Hemoglobin A1C</fact27>, the most likely explanation is <fact29>osmotic diuresis</fact29> caused by the glucose in the urine. This is supported by the patient's <fact20>slowed speech</fact20> and <fact21>orientation</fact21>, which are indicative of hypoglycemia. The <fact18>whitening of the tongue</fact18> and <fact19>skin retraction</fact19> are also consistent with hypoglycemia. The answer is {B}."

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a <fact2>swelling of his right jaw</fact2> for the past <fact3>2 months</fact3>, despite treatment with different <fact4>antibiotics</fact4>, and his recent emigration from <fact9>Nigeria</fact9> suggest a possible infectious etiology.

However, the <fact27>oral examination</fact27> showing the <fact28>disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth</fact28> and <fact29>oral mucosa</fact29> points towards a more complex pathology. The <fact32>histopathologic analysis</fact32> is crucial for determining the exact diagnosis. Among the options provided, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is known to be associated with Burkitt lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that often presents as a jaw mass. The patient's symptoms and recent emigration from Nigeria, where Burkitt lymphoma is endemic, make EBV a likely causative agent."

Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?

Answer: D) Increase PEEP

Explanation: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy for a small bowel perforation. She is currently being ventilated with an FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2.5 cm H2O. Her arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.44, pO2 of 54 mm Hg, pCO2 of 31 mm Hg, and HCO3- of 22 mm Hg. The patient's oxygenation is compromised, as indicated by a low pO2 of 54 mm Hg. The presence of bilateral rales on lung examination suggests pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to the patient's hypoxemia.

The best next step in the management of this patient is to increase the PEEP to improve oxygenation. This is because the patient's current PEEP of 2.5 cm H2O is likely not sufficient to prevent atelectasis and improve oxygenation. Increasing the PEEP will help to recruit alveoli and improve gas exchange, which should lead to an improvement in the patient's oxygenation.

Option A, increasing the FiO2, may not be the best next step because the patient's oxygenation is already compromised, and increasing the FiO2 may not provide significant benefits. Option B, extubation, is not appropriate at this time because the patient is still at risk for respiratory complications and requires close monitoring. Option C, increasing the tidal volume, may not be the best next step because the patient's current tidal volume of 1000 mL is already high, and increasing it may lead to barotrauma. Option E, increasing the respiratory rate, may not be the best next step because the patient's current respiratory rate of 12/min is already high, and increasing it may lead to respiratory alkalosis."

The absence of <fact26>abnormalities</fact26> on cardiac examination, <fact27>normal chest x-ray</fact27>, and <fact28>normal ECG</fact28> without signs of ischemia suggests that further testing is required to rule out cardiac disease.

Answer: Considering the patient's history of intentionally restricting her diet at the expense of <fact3>carbohydrates</fact3> and exercising intensively, she likely has an eating disorder, specifically anorexia nervosa. This condition is characterized by a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight, leading to significant weight loss.

186,"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?
A) Help the parents to arrange supportive care at home
B) Refer the patient to another oncologist
C) Recommend for parents to take 2 weeks to think about decision
D) Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy
E) Attempt surgical resection of the tumor","Reformatted Question: A previously healthy <fact1>18-month-old boy</fact1> is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an <fact2>abdominal mass</fact2> noticed a few days ago.

A <fact26>peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes</fact26>. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?

Answer: 
Based on the provided information, the most likely underlying cause of these findings is <fact27>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</fact27>. This diagnosis is supported by several laboratory findings, including:
1. <fact28>Low hemoglobin of 8 g/dL</fact28>, indicating anemia.
2. <fact29>Mean corpuscular volume of 82 fL</fact29>, which is within the normal range, indicating normocytic anemia.
3. <fact30>Leukocytosis with a count of 17,000/mm3</fact30>, indicating an inflammatory response.
4. <fact31>Thrombocytopenia with a count of 49,000/mm3</fact31>, indicating a low platelet count.
5. <fact32>Prothrombin time of 12 seconds and partial thromboplastin time of 34 seconds</fact32>, which are within the normal range, indicating normal coagulation.
6. <fact33>Urea nitrogen of 42 mg/dL and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL</fact33>, indicating impaired renal function.
7. <fact34>High bilirubin levels with a total of 3 mg/dL and indirect of 2.8 mg/dL</fact34>, indicating hemolysis.
8. <fact35>Lactate dehydrogenase of 300 U/L</fact35>, which is elevated, indicating hemolysis.
9. <fact36>Presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear</fact36>, which is a hallmark of TTP.
10. The patient's symptoms, including <fact37>pallor and <fact38>rash</fact38> for <fact39>2 days</fact39>, and <fact40>diffuse abdominal tenderness with hyperactive bowel sounds</fact40>, are consistent with TTP.

These findings are consistent with TTP, which is a rare blood disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. The exact cause of TTP is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a deficiency of ADAMTS13, a protein that regulates von Willebrand factor. TTP is often associated with other conditions, such as infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer.

The other options are less likely:
A) <fact41>Escherichia coli infection</fact41> is unlikely because there is no mention of symptoms consistent with a bacterial infection, such as fever, chills, or abdominal pain.
B) <fact42>Parvovirus B19 infection</fact42> is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings do not suggest a viral infection.
C) <fact43>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</fact43> is unlikely because the patient's prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are within the normal range.
D) <fact44>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)</fact44> is unlikely because the patient's platelet count is low, but the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear suggests a more severe condition."

Which of the following is the best next step in management?

Answer: C) Vaginal culture

Explanation: The neonate's presentation with <fact2>vaginal discharge</fact2> for the last two days, along with a <fact3>blood-tinged discharge</fact3>, suggests a possible infection. The <fact7>history of chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester</fact7> increases the risk of neonatal chlamydial infection. However, the mother and her partner were both treated with a negative <fact8>test of cure</fact8>, which makes congenital chlamydia less likely. The absence of <fact15>vulvar irritation or skin changes</fact15> makes a diagnosis of vaginal irritation or trauma less likely. The presence of <fact16>scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus</fact16> suggests a possible infection. Given these factors, the best next step in management is to perform a <fact17>vaginal culture</fact17> to identify the causative pathogen and guide appropriate treatment."

281,"A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?
A) Alprazolam

Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?

Answer: B) Cognitive behavioral therapy

Explanation: The patient's fear of flying is a specific phobia that has been present since adolescence. He has avoided flying for many years, which has resulted in significant distress and impairment in his social and occupational functioning. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for specific phobias, including fear of flying. CBT involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the phobia, as well as learning relaxation techniques and coping strategies to manage anxiety. In this case, CBT would be an effective treatment for the patient's fear of flying, as it would help him to address the underlying causes of his phobia and develop skills to manage his anxiety in a more adaptive way."

This patient should be started on which of the following medications?

Answer: A) Sofosbuvir and simeprevir

Explanation: The patient has a history of <fact7>intravenous drug use</fact7> and is <fact25>positive for Hepatitis C IgG</fact25> with a high viral load of <fact26>100,000,000 IU/ml</fact26>, indicating an active Hepatitis C infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the preferred treatment for chronic Hepatitis C is direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which include Sofosbuvir and simeprevir (A) [1]. This combination has been shown to be highly effective in treating Hepatitis C, with cure rates exceeding 90% [2]. Interferon-alpha (B) and interferon-gamma (C) are older treatments for Hepatitis C, but they have been largely replaced by DAAs due to their lower efficacy and higher side effect profile [3]. Ribavirin (D) is a nucleoside analog that can be used in combination with interferon-alpha or DAAs, but it is not a standalone treatment for Hepatitis C [4]. Lamivudine (E) is an antiviral medication used to treat Hepatitis B, not Hepatitis C [5].

Which of the following is the best course of action for the newborn child?

Answer: 
D) Check hepatitis B serology

Explanation: 
The newborn child is at risk for hepatitis B transmission from the mother, but the mother has made it to all of her prenatal appointments and taken the recommended dose of folic acid since conception. This suggests that the mother is likely being managed for her hepatitis B infection, and the newborn child may be at risk for vertical transmission. However, the newborn child's APGAR scores are normal, and there are no signs of immediate distress or illness. The best course of action is to check the newborn child's hepatitis B serology to determine their status and whether they require post-exposure prophylaxis. This will help determine whether the newborn child needs to be administered hepatitis B vaccine and/or hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG)."

Answer:
The key phrases that are most relevant to answering the question are <fact11>mild respiratory distress</fact11>, <fact12>distended neck veins</fact12>, <fact13>bilateral pitting edema is evident on the lower third of his legs</fact13>, <fact14>respiratory rate is 33/min</fact14>, <fact15>SpO2 is 93% in room air</fact15>, <fact16>coarse crepitations are heard over the lung bases</fact16>, <fact17>P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space</fact17>, and <fact18>S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex</fact18>. These symptoms and signs suggest that the patient has congestive heart failure (CHF), which is characterized by the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The prescribed medication is likely a diuretic, which is a class of medications that increase urine production and help to reduce fluid buildup in the body. The mechanism of action of diuretics is to inhibit the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys, leading to a decrease in the amount of fluid in the body. This is consistent with option D) Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption, which is the mechanism of action of loop diuretics such as furosemide."

Answer: The patient's symptoms of <fact2>recurrent nonbilious vomiting</fact2> that occurs almost immediately after most feeds, accompanied by <fact3>irritability while feeding and refusal to finish the bottle</fact3>, suggest a possible obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. The presence of an <fact17>epigastric mass</fact17> further supports this suspicion. Given the patient's age and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is pyloric stenosis, a condition characterized by the thickening of the pyloric muscle, which leads to obstruction of the gastric outlet. The <fact7>Down syndrome</fact7> diagnosis is also relevant, as infants with Down syndrome are at increased risk for pyloric stenosis. Therefore, the diagnostic evaluation is most likely to show an <fact18>elongated and thickened pylorus</fact18> on abdominal ultrasound, which is a characteristic feature of pyloric stenosis. The answer is {D}."

542,"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?
A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
B) The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.
C) The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.
D) One can not comment, as the p-value is not given.
E) The association is statistically significant, and low education is a risk factor.","Reformatted Question: A study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years) recruited 30 young patients with the condition into the study group and 60 similar but healthy individuals into the control group. Educational status was considered an important variable, and 2 groups were formed: low educational status and high educational status.

What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?

Answer: Given that the odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7, the association between young age MI and educational status is statistically significant. This is because the confidence interval does not contain 1, which is the value that would indicate no association between the variables. Therefore, the correct answer is {E}."
883,"A 72-year-old man develops reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL three days after being hospitalized for acute diverticulitis.

Answer: Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely intoxication is <fact14>phencyclidine (PCP)</fact14>. The patient's <fact9>anxious</fact9> and <fact10>agitated</fact10> behavior, <fact11>delayed responses</fact11>, and <fact12>difficulty processing thoughts</fact12> are consistent with PCP intoxication. Additionally, the patient's <fact13>dry mouth</fact13> and <fact14>conjunctival injection</fact14> are also consistent with PCP use. PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause a range of symptoms, including anxiety, agitation, and hallucinations. It is often associated with a ""bad trip"" or a psychotic episode, which can be triggered by the patient's anxiety and agitation. The patient's <fact15>past medical history of psoriasis</fact15> and treatment with <fact16>topical steroids</fact16> does not provide any clues to the cause of his current symptoms. Therefore, the most likely intoxication in this patient is PCP. The answer is {E}."

Answer: The best next step in management for this patient is to perform an <fact11>inferior petrosal sinus sampling</fact11> (option E).

Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is a diagnostic procedure used to differentiate between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent causes of Cushing's syndrome. It involves sampling the blood from the inferior petrosal sinus, which drains the pituitary gland, to measure the ACTH level. This can help to determine if the cause of Cushing's syndrome is a pituitary adenoma (ACTH-dependent) or an adrenal tumor (ACTH-independent)."

Which of the following physiological <fact29>pregnancy changes</fact29> is causing the change in this patient’s <fact30>condition</fact30>?

Answer: The physiological pregnancy change causing the change in this patient's condition is an <fact31>increase in cardiac output</fact31>. 

During pregnancy, the maternal cardiovascular system undergoes significant changes to meet the increased metabolic demands of the fetus and the mother. One of the primary changes is an <fact32>increase in cardiac output</fact32> of approximately 40-50% above pre-pregnancy levels by the end of the third trimester [1]. This increase in cardiac output is necessary to meet the increased oxygen and nutrient demands of the fetus and to support the growth of the placenta. The increase in cardiac output is achieved through a combination of increases in heart rate and stroke volume [2]. 

In this patient, the <fact33>fixed splitting of S2</fact33> and the <fact34>grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur</fact34> best heard over the <fact35>left upper sternal border</fact35> suggest a possible patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect. The <fact36>increase in cardiac output</fact36> during pregnancy may exacerbate these conditions, leading to symptoms such as <fact37>cyanosis</fact37> and <fact38>dyspnea</fact38>. 

In conclusion, the physiological pregnancy change causing the change in this patient's condition is an <fact39>increase in cardiac output</fact39>.

1002,"A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A) Testing for serum Ca and PTH
B) Calcium and Vitamin D prescription

The patient refuses an examination of his genitals. Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?

Answer: 
Given the patient's refusal of a genital examination, it is crucial to choose a diagnostic test that does not require direct access to his genital area. The patient's laboratory values and urine analysis reveal abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes and the presence of marijuana, amphetamines, and cocaine in the urine. These findings suggest substance use, which may be contributing to his symptoms of fatigue and nausea. However, the patient's refusal of a genital examination raises concerns about potential sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 

Considering the patient's behavior of having <fact5>unprotected sex with multiple partners</fact5> and the presence of STIs in the differential diagnosis, a diagnostic test that does not require a genital examination is necessary. 

The best diagnostic test among the provided options is the <fact11>Uretheral swab and culture</fact11>. This test allows for the collection of a sample from the urethra without requiring a genital examination, making it a suitable option for this patient."

Answer: The most appropriate initial response by the physician is {A} ""I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you.""

This response acknowledges the patient's loss and shows empathy, which is essential in providing emotional support during a traumatic event. It is also a simple and direct statement that does not minimize the patient's feelings or provide false reassurance. Options B, C, and D are inappropriate because they either downplay the significance of the loss (B), focus on the physician's experience rather than the patient's feelings (D), or attempt to move the conversation forward too quickly (C). Option E is also inappropriate because it attempts to treat the patient's emotional response with a prescription, rather than acknowledging and validating her feelings."

826,"A 16-year-old female presents to her physician’s office after noticing a round lump in her left breast 2 months ago. She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?
A) This mass will likely require excision
B) This mass will decrease in size if the patient starts oral contraceptives
C) This mass slightly increases this patient’s risk of breast cancer in the future
D) This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time
E) If this mass grows rapidly to greater than 5 cm, radiation and chemotherapy are indicated","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>16-year-old female</fact1> presents to her physician’s office after noticing a <fact2>round lump</fact2> in her left breast <fact3>2 months ago</fact3>.

Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?

Answer: Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely outcome of her condition is that the mass will likely require excision. This is because the mass is described as a <fact2>round lump</fact2> that has <fact4>enlarged and become tender</fact4>, which is a common presentation of a breast mass. The fact that the mass is <fact13>3-cm round, mobile</fact13> and located in the <fact14>upper outer quadrant of the left breast</fact14> suggests that it may be a benign lesion, but further evaluation is needed to confirm this. The patient's age and family history of breast cancer also increase her risk of having a malignant lesion, so excision is likely the most appropriate course of action. Therefore, the answer is {A}."
556,"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact.

Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?

Answer: The best response to the patient's daughter's request is to inform the patient of her diagnosis. The patient has a right to autonomy and the right to receive information about her own health. The patient's daughter's request to withhold the diagnosis from the patient may be motivated by a desire to protect her, but it is ultimately the patient's decision whether or not to receive this information. The patient's daughter is also the patient's health care proxy, but the health care proxy's role is to make decisions on the patient's behalf, not to withhold information from the patient. Therefore, the best response is to tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis.

Despite these initial measures, his symptoms persist. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation is indicative of <fact2>belligerent behavior</fact2> followed by <fact13>muscle rigidity</fact13> and altered mental status, which are characteristic symptoms of <fact22>neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)</fact22> [1]. NMS is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. The patient's initial response to <fact10>IV fluids</fact10>, <fact11>analgesics</fact11>, and <fact12>anti-emetics</fact12> suggests that the initial symptoms may have been related to <fact9>vomiting</fact9> and <fact8>emesis</fact8>. However, the subsequent development of <fact13>muscle rigidity</fact13> and altered mental status indicates the progression to NMS. The best next step in management is to administer <fact23>dantrolene</fact23>, which is the primary treatment for NMS [2]. Dantrolene works by inhibiting calcium ion release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing muscle rigidity and other symptoms of NMS [3].

Answer: 
C) Vitamin B12 deficiency 

Explanation: 
The patient presents with a <fact2>6-month history of repeated falls</fact2>, <fact3>postural dizziness</fact3>, <fact4>progressive fatigue</fact4>, <fact5>generalized weakness</fact5>, and a <fact6>13.6 kg (30 lb) weight loss</fact6>, which are indicative of a systemic illness. His <fact7>vegetarian diet</fact7> may be contributing to a deficiency in certain nutrients. The patient's <fact9>behavioral changes</fact9> over the past year, including <fact19>irritability, paranoia, and delusions</fact19>, suggest a neurological component to his condition. The physical examination reveals an <fact21>unstable, wide-based ataxic gait</fact21>, which is consistent with a neurological disorder. Laboratory results show a <fact22>low hemoglobin level</fact22>, <fact23>macrocytic anemia</fact23> (MCV 109 fL), and <fact24>thrombocytopenia</fact24>, which are all indicative of a megaloblastic anemia. The presence of <fact28>hypersegmented neutrophils</fact28> on the <fact27>peripheral blood smear</fact27> is a hallmark of megaloblastic anemia. The absence of <fact29>anti-intrinsic factor antibodies</fact29> makes pernicious anemia less likely, but a <fact7>vegetarian diet</fact7> may still contribute to a <fact31>Vitamin B12 deficiency</fact31>. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a <fact31>Vitamin B12 deficiency</fact31>."

Answer: Based on the provided information, the patient's symptoms and autopsy results suggest a myocardial infarction (MI) involving the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST elevations in leads I and aVL, which is indicative of an MI involving the left circumflex artery (LCx). The LCx typically supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle, including the posterior wall, which is consistent with the autopsy findings. Therefore, the most likely affected vessel is the <fact26>left circumflex artery</fact26>, which is option {B}."

239,"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?
A) Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.
B) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.
C) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.
D) The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.
E) The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.","Reformatted Question: A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data.

Answer: A

Explanation: The question explores the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the context of administrative data analysis. The researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis and prevalent cases as those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time. The correct answer, A) Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates, is based on the understanding that prevalence rates are influenced by the duration of the study period. As the study period lengthens, more incident cases will become prevalent cases, leading to an increase in prevalence estimates. Conversely, examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates, as more incident cases will have become prevalent cases and will no longer be counted as incident cases."

43,"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?

Answer: Considering the <fact1>one-day-old male</fact1> who has <fact2>bilious vomiting</fact2> and has not yet passed <fact4>meconium</fact4>, it is essential to evaluate the underlying cause of these symptoms. The patient's <fact3>urination multiple times since birth</fact3> suggests normal renal function, but the absence of <fact4>meconium</fact4> passage points towards an intestinal obstruction. The <fact5>38 weeks gestation</fact5> and the absence of any congenital anomalies in the siblings suggest that the condition is likely a congenital anomaly rather than a postnatal acquired condition. The <fact8>gestational diabetes</fact8> and the <fact10>quadruple screen</fact10> results are also crucial in this case. The decreased <fact12>maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)</fact12> and increased <fact13>beta-hCG</fact13> suggest a possible neural tube defect or an open neural tube defect. However, the patient's presentation does not indicate a neural tube defect. The decreased <fact14>unconjugated estriol</fact14> and increased <fact15>inhibin A</fact15> suggest a possible chromosomal abnormality or a condition that affects fetal growth. The <fact17>amniotic fluid index (AFI)</fact17> of <fact18>28 cm</fact18> indicates oligohydramnios, which is often associated with renal agenesis or obstructive uropathy. However, the patient's normal renal function makes this less likely. The most likely explanation for the patient's presentation is an intestinal obstruction, which is supported by the <fact2>bilious vomiting</fact2> and the absence of <fact4>meconium</fact4> passage. Considering the options provided, the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation is <fact8>intussusception</fact8>, <fact9>ileal atresia</fact9>, or <fact10>meconium ileus</fact10>. However, the absence of <fact4>meconium</fact4> passage makes <fact10>meconium ileus</fact10> less likely. Among the options provided, <fact11>ileal atresia</fact11> is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation."

The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?

Answer: The patient's symptoms of <fact2>sudden onset of blurry vision</fact2> and <fact3>double vision</fact3> suggest a problem with the nerves controlling eye movement. The presence of <fact4>fixed pupillary dilation</fact4> and <fact10>difficulty depressing both eyes</fact10> further supports this. The patient's history of <fact4>nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea</fact4> after eating certain foods at a picnic points towards food poisoning. The foods listed, including <fact5>potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor</fact5>, are all potential sources of contamination. The patient's symptoms and the fact that his friend developed similar symptoms after eating the same foods suggest a common cause. The pathogenesis of this patient's presentation is most likely related to the release of <fact11>botulinum toxin</fact11>, a neurotoxin produced by <fact12>Clostridium botulinum</fact12>, which can cause food poisoning. The toxin works by <fact13>inhibiting the release of acetylcholine</fact13>, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction. This leads to the symptoms of blurred vision, double vision, and difficulty moving the eyes. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

Answer: C) Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.

Explanation: The patient's <fact2>6-month history of shortness of breath</fact2> and <fact8>breathing with pursed lips</fact8> are indicative of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The physical exam findings of <fact9>decreased breath sounds on auscultation</fact9>, <fact10>increased chest diameter</fact10>, and <fact11>hyperresonance to percussion</fact11> are consistent with hyperinflation of the lungs, a hallmark of COPD. In COPD, the airways are narrowed, making it difficult for air to leave the lungs, resulting in air trapping and hyperinflation. This leads to an <fact12>increased residual volume</fact12>, as the lungs are unable to fully deflate. Additionally, the patient's <fact6>long history of smoking</fact6> and <fact7>exposure to other lung irritants</fact7> have likely damaged the lung tissue, leading to a <fact13>decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume (FEV1)</fact13>.

Repeat blood cultures are <fact28>negative</fact28>. A <fact29>chest X-ray shows no abnormalities</fact29>. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?

Answer: 
E) Treating the underlying illness

Explanation:
The patient is a <fact1>34-year-old woman</fact1> with persistent <fact2>hypotension</fact2> three days after admission to the intensive care unit for <fact3>septic shock</fact3> and <fact4>bacteremia from a urinary tract infection</fact4>. Her blood cultures are positive for <fact5>Escherichia coli</fact5>, for which she has been receiving appropriate <fact6>antibiotics</fact6> since admission. The current medications include <fact8>norepinephrine</fact8>, <fact9>ceftriaxone</fact9>, and <fact10>acetaminophen</fact10>. The laboratory studies show a decrease in leukocyte count from <fact17>18,500/mm3</fact17> to <fact18>10,300/mm3</fact18> and a decrease in serum creatinine from <fact21>1.4 mg/dL</fact21> to <fact22>0.9 mg/dL</fact22>, indicating an improvement in her condition. However, she still has <fact14>hypotension</fact14> and <fact15>costovertebral tenderness bilaterally</fact15>, suggesting that the underlying illness is not yet fully resolved.

Treating the underlying illness is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. The patient's condition is still critical, and she requires ongoing treatment for her <fact3>septic shock</fact3> and <fact4>bacteremia from a urinary tract infection</fact4>. The use of <fact8>norepinephrine</fact8> and <fact9>ceftriaxone</fact9> is appropriate for managing her hypotension and infection, respectively. However, the patient's <fact2>hypotension</fact2> and <fact15>costovertebral tenderness bilaterally</fact15> suggest that the underlying illness is not yet fully resolved, and she requires ongoing treatment.

The other options are not the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Bromocriptine (A) is a medication used to treat hyperprolactinemia, which is not indicated in this patient's condition. Levothyroxine (B) is a medication used to treat hypothyroidism, and the patient's thyroid function tests are normal. Removing toxic drugs (C) is not indicated, as the patient's current medications are appropriate for her condition. Thiamine therapy (D) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of thiamine deficiency in this patient."

He has a <fact4>history of major depressive disorder</fact4> and <fact5>seasonal allergies</fact5>. His mother has a <fact6>history of anxiety</fact6>. He drinks <fact7>5 beers on the weekends</fact7>. Current medications include <fact8>amitriptyline</fact8> and <fact9>diphenhydramine</fact9>. The patient does not respond to questions and repeatedly says, """"<fact10>The government is following me everywhere.""</fact10> His <fact11>temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F)</fact11>, <fact12>pulse is 115/min</fact12>, <fact13>respirations are 24/min</fact13>, and <fact14>blood pressure is 160/89 mm Hg</fact14>. He is <fact15>diaphoretic</fact15>. He is not oriented to <fact16>place or time</fact16>. Neurologic examination shows <fact17>dilated pupils bilaterally</fact17> and <fact18>diffuse hyperreflexia</fact18>. His <fact19>feet are cold</fact19>, and <fact20>capillary refill time is 3 seconds</fact20>. After the examination, the patient starts <fact21>screaming</fact21> and tries to <fact22>bite the physician</fact22>. <fact23>Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide</fact23>. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?

Answer: 
The patient's presentation is characterized by <fact2>unusual behavior</fact2>, <fact17>dilated pupils bilaterally</fact17>, <fact18>diffuse hyperreflexia</fact18>, <fact19>cold feet</fact19>, and <fact20>capillary refill time of 3 seconds</fact20>. These symptoms, combined with the patient's <fact21>screaming</fact21> and attempt to <fact22>bite the physician</fact22>, suggest a severe and potentially life-threatening condition. The presence of <fact23>positive urine toxicology screening for ethyl glucuronide</fact23> indicates recent alcohol consumption, but this does not fully explain the patient's symptoms. 

The patient's <fact12>pulse is 115/min</fact12> and <fact14>blood pressure is 160/89 mm Hg</fact14>, which are indicative of sympathetic nervous system activation. The <fact15>diaphoretic</fact15> state and <fact16>unorientation to place or time</fact16> further support this interpretation. The patient's symptoms are most consistent with <fact24>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</fact24>, a rare but life-threatening condition caused by an adverse reaction to certain medications, including <fact8>amitriptyline</fact8> and <fact9>diphenhydramine</fact9>. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with the <fact25>diagnosis of NMS</fact25> in the context of the provided options."

Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?

Answer: C) Avoidant personality disorder

Explanation: The patient's behavior is characterized by her reluctance to engage in social interactions, as evident from her <fact7>social life</fact7> and her tendency to make excuses to avoid <fact8>parties and social gatherings</fact8>. This is consistent with avoidant personality disorder, which is marked by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection. The patient's <fact20>regular heart rhythm</fact20> and <fact22>clear lungs</fact22> bilaterally on physical examination do not suggest any underlying medical condition that could be contributing to her behavior. Her <fact5>work as a web graphic designer</fact5> for <fact6>20 years</fact6> from home is not inconsistent with avoidant personality disorder, as individuals with this disorder may avoid social interactions but still be able to function in their daily lives. The patient's <fact9>desire to be in a relationship</fact9> also suggests that she is not completely isolated, but rather, she is struggling with social anxiety and avoidance. Therefore, the most consistent diagnosis is avoidant personality disorder."
1118,"A 68-year-old man presents with difficulty breathing for the last 3 hours. Upon asking about other symptoms, he mentions that he had a cough for the last 4 months which he attributes to his smoking. He says he had frequent nasal stuffiness and headaches over the last 3 months, for which he takes over-the-counter cold medications and analgesics. Over the last 2 months, he often felt that his face was mildly swollen, especially in the morning hours, but he did not consider it to be anything serious. No significant past medical history. He reports a 20-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 96/min, blood pressure is 108/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.

Answer: Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely clinical sign that would be present is <fact20>rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung</fact20>. However, since the question asks for a clinical sign that would most likely be present, we need to consider other signs that are commonly associated with lung conditions. 

One possible clinical sign that could be present in this patient is <fact21>distended veins over the lower abdomen</fact21>. This is because the patient has a <fact12>20-pack-year smoking history</fact12> and a <fact19>chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung</fact19>, which could indicate a lung cancer. Lung cancer can lead to superior vena cava syndrome, which is characterized by distended veins over the lower abdomen due to obstruction of the superior vena cava.

However, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided. The options provided are more related to cardiovascular and neurological signs, which are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

A) <fact22>Bilateral pedal edema</fact22> is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
B) <fact23>Distended veins over lower abdomen</fact23> is a possible clinical sign that could be present in this patient, but it is not among the options provided.
C) <fact24>Papilledema</fact24> is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
D) <fact25>Positive Adson test</fact25> is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
E) <fact26>Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of right forearm and right hand</fact26> is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options provided."
213,"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?
A) Lack of a comparison group
B) No prevalence assessment
C) Low number of patients
D) Ascertainment bias
E) Lack of risk calculation","Reformatted Question: A journal editor suggested that a study submitted as a cohort study should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?

Answer: C) Low number of patients

Explanation: A case series is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a specific condition or outcome (1). It is typically used to describe the characteristics of a group of patients and can be used to generate hypotheses for further research (2). A cohort study, on the other hand, is an observational study that follows a group of individuals over time to examine the development of outcomes (3).

The key characteristics of a case series include a small number of patients, a descriptive design, and no comparison group (4). In this scenario, the study described in the question has a small number of patients (14) and is a descriptive study that reports on the outcomes of cerclage wiring in femur fractures (5). The editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series because it meets the criteria for a case series, including a low number of patients.

Answer: Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely cause of this patient's illness is <fact34>Babesia babesia</fact34>.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including <fact2>painful ankles</fact2>, <fact8>maculopapular rash</fact8>, <fact11>abdominal pain</fact11>, <fact12>nausea</fact12>, <fact13>vomiting</fact13>, and <fact14>headaches</fact14>, are consistent with a tick-borne illness.
