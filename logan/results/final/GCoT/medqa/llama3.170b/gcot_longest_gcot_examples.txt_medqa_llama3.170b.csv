""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants

Answer: D) It reflects a smaller sample size

Explanation: 
The increased standard error in the <fact1>pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group</fact1> can be attributed to the smaller sample size of this group. As shown in the results, the <fact1>pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group</fact1> had only 202 participants at 12-month follow-up, compared to 388 participants in the <fact3>pulmharkimab 75 mg/day group</fact3> and 395 participants in the <fact2>placebo group</fact2>. This smaller sample size would lead to a larger standard error, as the standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size."

1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
A) A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
C) A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
D) A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
E) A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.","Reformatted Question: Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a <fact1>type 1 error</fact1>?

A) A <fact1>type 1 error</fact1> means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
B) A <fact1>type 1 error</fact1> occurs when the <fact2>null hypothesis</fact2> is true but is rejected in error.

Answer: B) A <fact1>type 1 error</fact1> occurs when the <fact2>null hypothesis</fact2> is true but is rejected in error.

Explanation: In the context of the research abstract, which discusses the efficacy of mepolizumab in reducing asthma exacerbations, a type 1 error would occur if the null hypothesis that mepolizumab has no effect on asthma exacerbations were true, but the study results led to the rejection of this hypothesis in error. This would mean that the observed reductions in exacerbations and improvements in markers of asthma control were due to chance rather than a real effect of the treatment."
906,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.

Answer: This scenario exemplifies {C} lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test appears to prolong survival or improve outcomes simply because it detects the disease earlier in its course, rather than actually altering the disease's natural history. In this case, if the conclusion that <fact2>point of care ultrasound</fact2> is associated with better outcomes is due to the <fact3>earlier detection of nephrolithiasis</fact3>, it would mean that the apparent benefit is solely due to the earlier detection, rather than any actual change in the disease's progression or treatment efficacy."

73,"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?
A) Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen
B) Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen
C) Liver transplantation
D) Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone
E) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting","Reformatted Question:

Urine studies are significant for a <fact23>low urine sodium level</fact23>, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact20>oliguria</fact20> despite constant fluid intake and the development of <fact22>increased creatinine levels</fact22> from 0.9 mg/dL on admission to 1.8 mg/dL, along with a <fact23>low urine sodium level</fact23>, it suggests the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a type of kidney dysfunction that occurs in individuals with advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis (<fact7>acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis</fact7>). The best treatment option for HRS is the use of vasoconstrictors such as dopamine, but given the options, the most suitable treatment for this patient, who is already receiving <fact16>intravenous cefotaxime and albumin</fact16>, would be to add a medication that can help manage the oliguria and prevent further kidney damage. However, none of the provided options directly address HRS. Among the given options, adding dopamine (Option A) could potentially help manage the oliguria by improving renal perfusion, although it is not the first-line treatment for HRS. The other options are not directly relevant to the management of oliguria or HRS in this context. Therefore, the best answer is {A}."

The presence of <fact28>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</fact28> in the sputum culture further supports this diagnosis, as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in CF patients. The pathogenesis of CF is related to the abnormal CFTR protein, which is a chloride channel that regulates the components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. Therefore, the correct answer is {B} Abnormal CFTR protein."
1133,"A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless.

Answer: 
The patient's headache, described as <fact4>bilateral, “band-like,” and extending to the neck</fact4> with an onset approximately <fact3>3 weeks ago</fact3>, and linked to a <fact15>recent acute illness</fact15> characterized by a <fact14>runny nose with a temperature elevation</fact14>, suggests a tension-type headache. The fact that the headache is not accompanied by <fact6>nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia</fact6> and is not aggravated by <fact7>movements</fact7> further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the headache's characteristic worsening when the patient <fact8>coughs or laughs</fact8> and its persistence throughout the day, especially in the morning after <fact9>breakfast and taking medications</fact9>, are consistent with a tension-type headache. The patient's medical history, including <fact10>stage 1 arterial hypertension</fact10> and <fact11>stable angina pectoris</fact11>, and her current medications, including <fact12>aspirin, rosuvastatin, lisinopril, and isosorbide mononitrate</fact12>, do not directly suggest an alternative headache mechanism. Furthermore, the physical examination findings, such as <fact17>S2 accentuation</fact17> and <fact18>painless paranasal sinuses</fact18>, along with the absence of <fact19>focal symptoms, pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and meningeal symptoms</fact19>, do not indicate a more serious underlying condition. Therefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is <fact20>dilation of the intracerebral arterioles</fact20>, which is a characteristic feature of tension-type headaches."

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?

Answer: The patient's glucosuria, as indicated by the presence of <fact4>glucose 199 mg/dl</fact4> in the urinalysis, is most likely due to an inability of the kidneys to reabsorb glucose. Given the patient's high <fact3>HbA1c of 9%</fact3> and the presence of <fact2>microaneurysms</fact2> in the fundoscopic examination, which are indicative of diabetic retinopathy, it is clear that the patient has uncontrolled <fact1>type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact1>. In diabetes, the high blood glucose levels exceed the reabsorption capacity of the renal tubules, leading to glucosuria. The correct answer is C) Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules."
549,"A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm × 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL.

A <fact1>24-year-old man</fact1>, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a <fact2>2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss</fact2>. His <fact3>sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis</fact3>. His <fact4>Mantoux test is 2 mm × 3 mm</fact4>, and his <fact5>chest radiograph is normal</fact5>. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His <fact6>CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL</fact6> and <fact7>HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL</fact7>. He is started on a <fact8>4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol</fact8> in appropriate doses.

What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?

Answer: Considering the patient's recent initiation of <fact11>antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine)</fact11> and the subsequent development of <fact12>fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days</fact12> along with <fact13>generalized lymphadenopathy</fact13> and <fact14>pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on chest radiograph</fact14>, the clinical presentation is suggestive of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This condition occurs when the immune system begins to recover due to antiretroviral therapy, leading to an exaggerated response to a previously acquired opportunistic infection, in this case, tuberculosis. Given the patient's <fact17>significantly increased CD4+ T cell count to 370/μL</fact17> and <fact18>decreased HIV RNA to 2,900 copies/mL</fact18>, it is clear that the antiretroviral therapy is effective. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to <fact19>continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change</fact19>, as discontinuing antiretroviral therapy could lead to a decline in the patient's immune status and worsening of HIV disease. The answer is {E}."

Which of the following statements best describes the pathogenesis of this patient’s condition?

Answer: B) The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including <fact2>fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, and profuse sweating</fact2>, along with the physical examination findings of a <fact12>reddish maculopapular rash</fact12>, <fact13>diminished lung and heart sounds</fact13>, <fact14>tenderness to palpation in his abdomen</fact14>, and <fact15>rotational bilateral nystagmus</fact15>, suggest a systemic and severe reaction to the consumed substance. The patient's total blood count shows a normal <fact17>erythrocyte count</fact17>, <fact18>hemoglobin level</fact18>, and <fact25>platelet count</fact25>, but a low <fact19>total leukocyte count</fact19> with a relatively normal differential. The most significant clue is the patient's report of taking <fact6>2 foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills</fact6> instead of the usual <fact7>1 pill</fact7>, which suggests an overdose or an adverse reaction to the substance. Considering the symptoms and the laboratory findings, the most plausible explanation is that the drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a severe systemic reaction. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of hyperthermia (<fact11>temperature is 39.9°C or 103.8°F</fact11>), tachycardia (<fact9>heart rate is 137/min</fact9>), and tachypnea (<fact10>respiratory rate is 26/min</fact10>), as well as the presence of bilateral cataracts (<fact16>bilateral cataracts</fact16>)."

Answer: 

Analyzing the patient's presentation, the <fact1>construction accident</fact1> and subsequent surgical intervention suggest a high-risk scenario for complications. The patient's initial stability post-surgery was followed by a significant <fact3>oxygen desaturation of 85%</fact3> and the presence of <fact4>crackles</fact4> on auscultation, indicating acute respiratory distress. The Swan-Ganz catheter readings show low CVP and PCWP, which do not support a diagnosis of left heart failure.

Considering these factors, the most likely direct cause of death is <fact5>diffuse alveolar damage</fact5>, also known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a common complication of severe trauma and surgical interventions. The answer is A."

He describes himself as being “generally healthy” before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 12.9 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 9,300/mm3
Platelet count 167,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm/hr
Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine Positive
Acid-fast stain Negative

Answer:

Considering the <fact1>50-year-old man's</fact1> symptoms of <fact2>chronic cough, aching joints in his hips and lower back, and malaise</fact2> over the past <fact3>2 months</fact3>, along with the <fact6>hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago</fact6>, suggests exposure to a specific pathogen. The <fact7>temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F)</fact7>, <fact8>heart rate of 102/min</fact8>, <fact9>respirations of 20/min</fact9>, and <fact10>blood pressure of 120/82 mm Hg</fact10> indicate a systemic infection. The <fact11>mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side</fact11> found during the chest exam, along with the <fact12>chest X-ray and chest CT findings</fact12>, suggest a pulmonary infection. The <fact14>lung biopsy</fact14> revealing <fact15>necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues</fact15> is highly indicative of a fungal infection. The laboratory results showing <fact20>positive Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine</fact20> and <fact21>negative Acid-fast stain</fact21> further support this diagnosis.

747,"A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus.

Answer: 
Based on the patient's symptoms of <fact3>worsening malaise and diaphoresis</fact3>, <fact18>diaphoretic and shivering</fact18>, increased tone in her bilateral upper and lower extremities, and <fact20>3 beats of clonus</fact20> upon rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle, it is likely that the patient is experiencing serotonin syndrome.

Given that the patient recently started taking an <fact12>amino acid supplement</fact12> and has been taking <fact9>citalopram</fact9> for her major depressive disorder, the combination of these two may have led to excessive serotonin levels. However, the most likely inciting factor is the <fact12>amino acid supplement</fact12>, which may contain tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted into serotonin in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is {B} Increased tryptophan intake."
867,"An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg.

578,"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive.

Answer:

Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>nausea, vomiting, fever, and pain in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen</fact2> and the laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile duct. The presence of a <fact14>dilated common bile duct stone</fact14> and the patient's symptoms suggest that the stone is causing an obstruction, leading to infection. Given the patient's <fact8>fever</fact8>, <fact9>elevated pulse</fact9>, and <fact10>increased respirations</fact10>, indicating a possible sepsis, the most appropriate next step in management would be to relieve the obstruction and clear the infection. Therefore, the correct answer is {D} <fact14>Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</fact14>, which is a procedure used to diagnose and treat problems in the bile and pancreatic ducts, including removing stones and relieving obstructions."

Transabdominal ultrasonography shows a <fact18>mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver</fact18>. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these liver abnormalities?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation, the most relevant information includes his <fact7>height and weight, resulting in a BMI of 36.3 kg/m2</fact7>, indicating obesity. Additionally, his laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, specifically <fact15>aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 92 U/L</fact15> and <fact16>alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 144 U/L</fact16>, which are indicative of liver damage. Furthermore, the transabdominal ultrasonography reveals a <fact18>mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver</fact18>, consistent with fatty liver disease. Given these findings, the most likely underlying cause of these liver abnormalities is <fact11>insulin resistance</fact11>, which is commonly associated with obesity and can lead to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Answer: 
The patient in the scenario is experiencing symptoms of a lung infection, including fever, malaise, dyspnea, productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain. The presence of focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe on chest radiograph further supports the diagnosis of a lung infection. Given the context of an immune response to a lung infection, the protein identified in the patient's serum is likely an antibody or immunoglobulin. The amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein, which binds to a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages, is likely a complementarity-determining region (CDR). In immunocompetent individuals, the process that this sequence typically undergoes is {D} VDJ recombination. VDJ recombination is a process by which the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments of immunoglobulin genes are rearranged to generate a diverse repertoire of antibodies. This process occurs in B cells during their development in the bone marrow and allows for the generation of a vast array of antibodies with different specificities."

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an <fact21>enlarged liver</fact21>. A biopsy of the liver shows <fact22>massive centrilobular necrosis</fact22>. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?

Answer: The patient's condition is most likely caused by an adverse effect of the anesthetic used during the emergency appendectomy. The patient's symptoms, including <fact1>low-grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain</fact1>, along with laboratory results showing elevated liver enzymes (<fact17>alkaline phosphatase 102 U/L</fact17> and <fact18>aspartate aminotransferase 760 U/L</fact18>) and <fact22>massive centrilobular necrosis</fact22> on liver biopsy, are indicative of liver damage. Additionally, the patient's <fact6>jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae</fact6> and <fact7>moderate tenderness over the liver</fact7> further support liver involvement. Given that the patient received general inhalational anesthesia during surgery, it is possible that the anesthetic caused an adverse reaction leading to liver damage. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."
769,"An unresponsive 92-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance and is quickly followed by his grand-daughter.

His <fact15>lung sounds are normal</fact15>, <fact16>cardiac sounds are decreased</fact16>, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals <fact17>epigastric tenderness</fact17>. Neurological examination shows <fact18>rapid downbeating nystagmus</fact18>, <fact19>facial muscle twitching</fact19>, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using <fact20>sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide</fact20>, which is known to form <fact21>fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms</fact21>. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?
A) Fumarate
B) Citrate
C) Isocitrate
D) Malate
E) Succinate

Answer: B) Citrate. This is because, as mentioned in the question, the patient was using <fact20>sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide</fact20>, which is known to form <fact21>fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms</fact21>. Fluorocitrate is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase, which is involved in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). When aconitase is inhibited, citrate cannot be converted to isocitrate, leading to an accumulation of citrate in the cells."

Answer: Considering the patient's presentation with <fact2>fever, abdominal pain, and confusion</fact2>, along with a history of <fact3>hepatitis C</fact3> and <fact4>acute pancreatitis</fact4>, the findings suggest a severe infection. The presence of <fact9>scleral icterus</fact9> and <fact10>spider angiomas</fact10> indicates liver disease, and the <fact11>shifting dullness</fact11> is consistent with ascites. The ascitic fluid analysis showing a high leukocyte count with 60% neutrophils and low albumin concentration is indicative of a bacterial infection. Given these factors, the most likely explanation for these findings is bacterial translocation, which occurs when bacteria from the gut enter the bloodstream and cause infection in other parts of the body, including the ascitic fluid. Therefore, the answer is {D}."

Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's laboratory results, the <fact8>LDL-cholesterol level of 186 mg/dL</fact8> is significantly elevated, which is an indication for treatment. Elevated LDL-cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and given the patient's family history of heart disease (his father had a heart attack at age 54), it is essential to manage this risk factor to prevent future cardiovascular events. The patient's other lab abnormalities, such as <fact6>serum glucose (fasting) of 105 mg/dL</fact6>, <fact7>HDL-cholesterol of 35 mg/dL</fact7>, and <fact9>triglycerides of 170 mg/dL</fact9>, are also notable but not as directly indicative of the need for immediate treatment as the elevated LDL-cholesterol. The patient's <fact2>blood pressure of 130/90 mm Hg</fact2> is also a concern but is not as directly related to the laboratory results as the LDL-cholesterol level. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."

What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation with <fact2>abdominal distension and persistent somnolence</fact2>, and his past medical history of <fact5>alcoholic liver cirrhosis</fact5>, the most likely precipitating factor is <fact16>hyperammonemia</fact16> (elevated ammonia level of 100 µg/dL). This condition is often associated with hepatic encephalopathy, which is further supported by the patient's altered mental status, <fact11>asterixis</fact11>, and <fact10>ascites</fact10> on physical examination. While the patient has <fact8>fever</fact8> and <fact21>ascites</fact21>, there is no clear evidence of <fact22>spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</fact22> (SBP), which would typically require a positive ascitic fluid culture. The presence of <fact23>gastric varices</fact23> without active bleeding makes variceal gastrointestinal bleeding (option C) less likely. Metabolic alkalosis (option B) is not present as the patient's <fact17>pH</fact17> and <fact20>HCO3</fact20> levels are within normal limits. Portal vein thrombosis (option D) and hypoglycemia (option E) are not supported by the provided laboratory findings.

Answer: 
Considering the <fact1>4-month-old infant's</fact1> presentation of <fact2>sudden nose bleeding without trauma</fact2>, <fact3>multiple bruising</fact3>, and <fact4>tiny red spots</fact4> without trauma, along with the physical exam findings of <fact6>pale skin color, petechiae, and ecchymosis</fact6>, a bleeding disorder is suspected. The laboratory results show a normal <fact16>platelet count</fact16> but an increased <fact23>bleeding time</fact23>, indicating a possible platelet function disorder. The <fact21>blood smear showing large platelets</fact21> and the normal <fact22>platelet aggregation test with ristocetin</fact22> point towards a specific platelet disorder. Among the options provided, Bernard-Soulier disease is characterized by large platelets and a normal platelet count, as well as an increased bleeding time due to impaired platelet function. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is {D}."

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?

Answer: 
Given the patient's history of <fact9>impetigo</fact9> one month ago and the presence of <fact4>bloody diarrhea</fact4>, along with the laboratory findings, the best explanation for this patient's condition is an <fact33>immune response to streptococcal infection</fact33>, which is associated with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) and potentially hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The patient's <fact19>low hemoglobin</fact19>, <fact20>low hematocrit</fact20>, and <fact29>elevated creatinine</fact29> are consistent with HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. The presence of <fact34>proteinuria</fact34> in the urine further supports renal involvement. While the patient's <fact32>positive blood alcohol level</fact32> and <fact10>history of cocaine use</fact10> could contribute to liver injury, the liver enzymes (<fact30>AST</fact30> and <fact31>ALT</fact31>) are not significantly elevated to suggest severe liver damage as the primary cause of her symptoms.

A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state.

Answer: In this situation, the patient is in a <fact8>comatose state</fact8> and unable to make decisions for himself, and there is <fact10>no written advanced directive</fact10> to guide the decision-making process. The daughter, as the patient's eldest child, is being asked to provide consent for a non-emergent, life-saving operation. However, she refuses to consent, citing the patient's past behavior of being <fact9>abusive and neglectful to his children</fact9>. Given the life-saving nature of the operation and the absence of a clear directive from the patient, it is essential to consider the patient's best interests. In this case, the most appropriate course of action would be to refer this case to the court (option B) to obtain a judicial decision regarding the patient's care. This approach respects the patient's autonomy while also ensuring that their best interests are protected. Options A, C, D, and E are not appropriate, as they either prioritize the daughter's wishes over the patient's well-being (A), involve contacting another family member without a clear justification (C), involve performing the surgery without proper consent (D), or involve reporting the daughter to the police without a clear legal basis (E)."

During this time, she has also noticed that <fact4>her gums bleed while brushing her teeth</fact4>. A month ago, she returned from a <fact5>camping trip to Sri Lanka</fact5>. Her <fact6>temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°F)</fact6>, <fact7>pulse is 104/min</fact7>, <fact8>respirations are 24/min</fact8>, and <fact9>blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg</fact9>. Examination shows <fact10>pallor and mild scleral icterus</fact10> and <fact11>scattered petechiae over the trunk and back</fact11>. Laboratory studies show: <fact12>Hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL</fact12>, <fact13>Leukocyte count 10,000/mm3</fact13>, <fact14>Platelet count 18,000/mm3</fact14>, <fact15>INR 1.0</fact15>, <fact16>Coomb's test negative</fact16>, <fact17>Fibrin split products negative</fact17>, and <fact18>positive test for occult blood in stool</fact18>. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A) HELLP syndrome
B) Dengue hemorrhagic fever
C) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
D) Hemolytic uremic syndrome
E) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia

Answer:

Considering the patient's symptoms, including <fact3>fever, persistent headache, nausea, and abdominal discomfort</fact3>, along with <fact4>gum bleeding</fact4> and the laboratory findings of <fact12>low hemoglobin</fact12>, <fact14>thrombocytopenia</fact14>, and <fact18>positive test for occult blood in stool</fact18>, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that affects the blood and can cause hemorrhaging. The patient's recent travel to <fact5>Sri Lanka</fact5>, an area where dengue fever is prevalent, and the presence of <fact10>pallor and mild scleral icterus</fact10> and <fact11>petechiae</fact11> support the diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Additionally, the <fact16>negative Coomb's test</fact16> and <fact17>negative fibrin split products</fact17> help rule out other conditions such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {B}."

Answer: 

Analyzing the patient's presentation, the <fact1>26-year-old nurse</fact1> with a <fact2>2-month history of fatigue</fact2> and several episodes of <fact5>lower abdominal pain</fact5> suggests an underlying condition that could be related to her previous diagnosis of <fact7>peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago</fact7>. However, the patient's <fact9>pale</fact9> appearance, <fact14>pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes</fact14>, and <fact20>low hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL</fact20> indicate a possible anemia. The presence of <fact15>numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins</fact15> and <fact22>high reticulocyte count of 13.3%</fact22> suggests self-induced bleeding or blood letting. Given these findings, the patient's request for a <fact6>diagnostic laparoscopy</fact6> despite <fact27>no abnormalities on abdominal ultrasonography</fact27> and the <fact26>negative test for occult blood</fact26> raises concerns about factitious disorder, where the patient fabricates or induces symptoms to gain attention and sympathy.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?

Answer: 
The patient's symptoms, including <fact2>bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters</fact2> and <fact3>severe right leg pain</fact3>, along with laboratory findings such as a <fact21>significantly low platelet count</fact21> and prolonged <fact22>prothrombin time</fact22> and <fact23>activated partial thromboplastin time</fact23>, are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The use of <fact10>prophylactic unfractionated heparin</fact10> post-surgery suggests an increased risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is an immune-mediated disorder that can lead to a deficiency of platelets due to their destruction by antibodies. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is the <fact21>phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets</fact21>, which is consistent with HIT. The answer is {B}."

Urinalysis shows <fact23>proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells</fact23>. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?

Answer: A) Overflow proteinuria

Explanation: 
The patient's laboratory results show a low <fact4>hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL</fact4>, which is indicative of anemia. Additionally, the patient's <fact21>calcium level is elevated at 12.1 mg/dL</fact21>. These findings, combined with the presence of <fact23>proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells</fact23> in the urinalysis, are suggestive of multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. In multiple myeloma, the excessive production of light chains can lead to overflow proteinuria, where the excess proteins are excreted in the urine. Therefore, the patient's proteinuria best fits in the category of overflow proteinuria."
609,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day.

A <fact1>10-year-old boy</fact1> is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child’s parents died in a car accident <fact2>1 month ago</fact2>. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents’ death, including <fact3>multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam</fact3>. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting <fact4>facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements</fact4> for the past few days.

An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?

Answer: 

The patient's symptoms, including <fact4>facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements</fact4>, along with the history of taking <fact3>allopurinol</fact3> (a medication used to treat gout and high levels of uric acid) and the absence of teeth since early childhood (<fact5>no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2</fact5>), suggest a condition related to purine metabolism. Allopurinol is used to treat conditions associated with excessive uric acid production, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which is involved in the purine metabolism pathway. This deficiency leads to an accumulation of uric acid, resulting in various symptoms including severe gout, kidney disease, and neurological dysfunction characterized by self-mutilation and involuntary movements. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a deficiency in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway. The answer is {D}."

Answer: D) Informed consent is not needed in this case

The patient is <fact7>unconscious with a GCS of 9/15</fact7> and requires immediate treatment for a life-threatening condition (<fact16>tension pneumothorax</fact16>). Given the emergency nature of the situation, there is no time to obtain informed consent from the patient or their relatives. In such cases, the doctrine of ""implied consent"" applies, which allows healthcare providers to perform emergency treatments without explicit consent. Therefore, option D is the correct answer."

She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use.

Answer: 
The patient's symptoms of <fact2>progressive urinary leakage</fact2> that occurs with <fact5>laughs or coughs</fact5> and the observation of <fact12>leakage of urine when asked to Valsalva</fact12> suggest stress urinary incontinence. The fact that she had an <fact9>uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago</fact9> may have weakened her pelvic floor muscles, contributing to this condition. Additionally, the absence of other symptoms such as <fact7>dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge</fact7> makes other options less likely. Urethral hypermobility is a common cause of stress urinary incontinence, especially in women with a history of childbirth. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is {D}."

Physical exam is notable for a patient with skin that appears <fact24>yellow/orange</fact24>. Cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation with <fact24>yellow/orange skin</fact24> and laboratory findings of <fact22>total bilirubin of 11.3 mg/dL</fact22> and <fact23>direct bilirubin of 7.8 mg/dL</fact23>, it suggests a condition leading to increased bilirubin levels. The patient's <fact3>past medical history of marijuana use, IV drug use, and alcohol use</fact3> may contribute to liver dysfunction, but the primary clue lies in the patient's <fact2>recent long hike</fact2> and the specific pattern of bilirubin elevation. However, none of the provided options directly relates to the information given in the question, except for one that might be tangentially related to liver function or bilirubin metabolism. Among the options, choice D) Increased consumption of beta-carotene is known to cause carotenemia, a condition characterized by a yellow/orange discoloration of the skin due to the accumulation of beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A, in the skin. Although the question does not directly mention beta-carotene consumption, this option is the most plausible explanation for the patient's skin appearance, given the absence of other clear indications of liver disease or alternative explanations for the yellow/orange skin."

Answer: 
The correct answer is A) Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. The <fact1>24-year-old woman</fact1> is prescribed <fact4>rifampin</fact4> for prophylaxis due to her exposure to <fact2>meningococcal meningitis</fact2>. However, the use of <fact4>rifampin</fact4> necessitates additional contraception methods for women taking <fact5>combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)</fact5>. This is because <fact4>rifampin</fact4> is known to induce hepatic enzymes that increase the metabolism of estrogens, leading to decreased estrogen levels.

Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a <fact5>3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop</fact5>. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of <fact6>> 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter</fact6>. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
<fact7>Leukocyte esterase  positive</fact7>
<fact8>WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF</fact8>
<fact9>Nitrites positive</fact9>
<fact10>RBCs 2 cell/HPF</fact10>
<fact11>Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF</fact11>
<fact12>Urine pH 5.7</fact12>
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
A) TMP-SMX
B) Nitrofurantoin
C) Levofloxacin
D) Cephalexin
E) No treatment is necessary

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact6>previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter</fact6>, along with the presence of <fact7>leukocyte esterase positive</fact7>, <fact8>WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF</fact8>, and <fact9>nitrites positive</fact9> on urinalysis, it is clear that the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI). Given the patient's <fact3>medical history</fact3> and <fact4>current medications</fact4>, it is essential to choose an antibiotic that is effective against Enterobacter and has minimal interactions with her existing medications. Nitrofurantoin is typically not effective against Enterobacter. TMP-SMX (A) is a reasonable option but may not be the best choice due to potential interactions with her medications and the risk of hyperkalemia. Levofloxacin (C) is effective against Enterobacter but may not be the best option due to the patient's <fact5>heart condition</fact5> and the potential risk of QT prolongation. Cephalexin (D) is not typically effective against Enterobacter. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to consider an alternative antibiotic not listed here or further evaluation to determine the best course of treatment. However, among the provided options, TMP-SMX (A) might still be considered with careful monitoring, making it the most appropriate choice given the options."

Answer: Analyzing the patient's presentation, the <fact1>13-year-old boy</fact1> exhibits symptoms of <fact2>confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting</fact2>, along with <fact6>urinating frequently</fact6> and <fact7>drinking a lot of water</fact7>, which are indicative of hyperglycemia. The laboratory results show a <fact19>blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL</fact19> and a <fact18>pH of 7.19</fact18>, suggesting diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by <fact20>decreased levels of insulin</fact20>, a hormone regulating glucose metabolism. In DKA, the body relies on fat for energy due to the inability to use glucose effectively, leading to increased lipolysis and ketone production. The expected outcome would be an increase in lipoprotein lipase activity to facilitate the breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol for energy production. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."

Answer: 
The patient's condition, characterized by <fact2>pain in his right toe</fact2>, a tender and swollen metatarsophalangeal joint, and the presence of <fact6>needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate</fact6>, is indicative of gout. Gout is often associated with hyperuricemia, which can result from various factors including diet, lifestyle, and underlying medical conditions. Among the provided options, a <fact4>high-purine diet</fact4> is a known risk factor for developing gout, as it can lead to increased uric acid production. Additionally, the patient's history of <fact3>smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years</fact3> and <fact4>binge drinking alcohol</fact4> may also contribute to his condition, as these habits can increase uric acid levels. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is {E}."
1107,"A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks.

On exam, she is quiet with a <fact11>flattened affect</fact11>, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly.

Answer: 

The patient's symptoms of <fact3>depressed mood</fact3>, <fact5>sleep disturbances</fact5>, and <fact6>poor appetite</fact6> that resolve after <fact4>4-6 weeks</fact4> suggest a mood disorder. Additionally, the patient reports experiencing episodes of <fact7>elevated mood</fact7> over the past <fact8>ten years</fact8>, during which she is very productive and requires <fact9>less sleep than usual</fact9>. However, the patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for a manic episode, as she does not exhibit any psychotic symptoms or require hospitalization. The patient's <fact11>flattened affect</fact11> and occasional inability to enjoy time with her children and husband also suggest a mood disorder. Given the patient's symptoms of both depressed and elevated mood, the most likely diagnosis is <fact12>Bipolar II disorder</fact12>, which is characterized by at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. Therefore, the answer is B."

Answer: 
The patient's situation is critical, with an <fact19>oxygen saturation of 73%</fact19> despite being on a <fact20>non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%</fact20> for three minutes. His <fact22>arterial blood gas analysis</fact22> shows severe hypoxemia with a PO2 of 73 mm Hg. Given his <fact9>unresponsiveness</fact9> and the failure of supplemental oxygen to improve his oxygenation, the best next step is to secure his airway. Therefore, the correct answer is {C}, as <fact4>reintubation</fact4> is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation."
447,"A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?
A) Headache and tinnitus
B) Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits
C) Dyslipidemia and hypoglycemia unawareness
D) Pedal edema and flushing
E) Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>36-year-old man</fact1> presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night.

The drug also has <fact6>mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity</fact6>. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?

Answer: Considering the <fact4>class I anti-arrhythmic drug</fact4> has <fact6>mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity</fact6>, if taken in high doses, the most likely side effects would be related to these properties. The anticholinergic effects can cause dry mouth, constipation, and urinary retention, but among the options provided, the closest match related to anticholinergic effects is not explicitly listed. However, the alpha-blocking activity can lead to vasodilation, which may cause side effects such as orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and reflex tachycardia. Among the options, the closest match related to alpha-blocking activity is not explicitly listed either. However, considering the options provided, the most likely side effects related to the overall pharmacological profile of the drug, including its effects on potassium channels and sodium channels, would be more systemic. Therefore, the best match among the options provided, considering the general pharmacological profile of a drug with such properties, would be option {D}, which mentions pedal edema and flushing, both of which could be related to the drug's effects on vascular tone and fluid balance."
242,"A 41-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with abdominal pain. He says that the pain “comes and goes” throughout the day and usually lasts 20-30 minutes per episode. He can point to the spot 1-2 inches above the umbilicus where he feels the pain. He denies any feeling of regurgitation or nighttime cough but endorses nausea. He reports that he used to eat three large meals per day but has found that eating more frequently improves his pain. He tried a couple pills of ibuprofen with food over the past couple days and thinks it helped. He has gained four pounds since his past appointment three months ago.

782,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?
A) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
B) A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
C) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
D) A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
E) A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.","Reformatted Question: 
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (<fact1>HIF-1a</fact1>) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular <fact2>hypoxia</fact2>. In <fact3>normoxia</fact3>, von Hippel-Lindau (<fact4>VHL</fact4>) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1>, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by <fact4>VHL</fact4> is inhibited under <fact2>hypoxic</fact2> conditions, allowing <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> to escape degradation, dimerize with <fact5>HIF-1ß</fact5>, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of <fact6>hypoxic response elements</fact6>, leading to <fact7>angiogenesis</fact7>. Renal cell carcinoma (<fact8>RCC</fact8>) can mimic the <fact2>hypoxic</fact2> state to promote <fact7>angiogenesis</fact7> by inhibiting <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> hydroxylation, even in the absence of <fact2>hypoxia</fact2>. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> in <fact8>RCC</fact8> under <fact3>normoxic</fact3> conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?

Answer: 
Considering the experiment's goal is to detect <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> in <fact8>RCC</fact8> under <fact3>normoxic</fact3> conditions, and knowing that <fact8>RCC</fact8> can mimic the <fact2>hypoxic</fact2> state to promote <fact7>angiogenesis</fact7> by inhibiting <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> hydroxylation, we can infer that the level of <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> will be increased in <fact8>RCC</fact8> even under <fact3>normoxic</fact3> conditions. Since the question asks about the comparison to a <fact3>normoxic control cell</fact3>, we are looking for an answer that reflects an increase in <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> in <fact8>RCC</fact8> compared to a normal cell under the same conditions. The correct answer must involve a technique that can detect proteins, as <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> is a protein. Therefore, the answer is {E} A Western blot will show increased <fact1>HIF-1a</fact1> compared to a <fact3>normoxic</fact3> control."
991,"A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week.

Answer: Analyzing the patient's presentation, the <fact1>18-year-old daughter</fact1> has not menstruated yet, but has normal secondary sexual characteristics, including <fact2>axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5</fact2>. Her lab results show normal <fact3>FSH</fact3> and <fact4>estradiol</fact4> levels, which suggests that her ovaries are functioning normally. Additionally, her <fact5>testosterone</fact5> level is within the normal range, ruling out androgen insensitivity. Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis is Muellerian agenesis, a condition where the Mullerian ducts fail to develop, resulting in the absence of the upper vagina and uterus, but normal ovarian function and secondary sexual characteristics. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

D) Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
E) Systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space

Answer: 
Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection. The patient's <fact4>excruciating chest pain</fact4> described as <fact5>ripping and radiating to the back</fact5> is a classic presentation of aortic dissection. Additionally, the patient's <fact12>tall stature and joint hypermobility</fact12> are risk factors for aortic dissection, as they can be associated with conditions such as Marfan syndrome. The patient's <fact14>weak distal pulses</fact14> also support this diagnosis. Aortic dissection can cause a <fact6>heart murmur</fact6>, but it is not typically associated with a specific type of murmur. However, option E, a systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space, could be related to aortic regurgitation, which can occur in the setting of aortic dissection. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Answer: The patient's presentation, including a <fact2>7-day history of nausea and vomiting</fact2>, feeling <fact4>weak and tired</fact4>, and experiencing <fact5>dizziness</fact5> upon standing, suggests dehydration. However, the key finding is the high <fact26>urine osmolality of 400 mOsm/kg</fact26>, which indicates that the kidneys are concentrating urine appropriately. This rules out options such as <fact8>diuretic overdose</fact8> (A) and <fact9>insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone</fact9> (E), as both would lead to low urine osmolality. The presence of <fact17>whitening of the tongue</fact17> and skin that retracts after <fact18>5 seconds</fact18> when pinched also supports dehydration. Given the patient's <fact7>hypertension</fact7> and the use of <fact8>hydrochlorothiazide</fact8>, one might consider <fact8>diuretic overdose</fact8> (A), but the high urine osmolality and the fact that the patient has been taking the medication for <fact9>6 months</fact9> without issue make this less likely. The patient's <fact25>Hemoglobin A1C of 10.5%</fact25> suggests uncontrolled diabetes, which can lead to <fact2>nausea and vomiting</fact2> due to hyperglycemia. The high <fact20>serum glucose</fact20> level (implied by the high Hemoglobin A1C) can cause <fact2>nausea and vomiting</fact2> and lead to dehydration. The most likely explanation for these findings is therefore <fact2>osmotic diuresis</fact2> (B) due to uncontrolled diabetes."

Answer: 
Given the patient's history of recent <fact2>hernia surgery</fact2> and the absence of urination since the surgery, combined with the <fact11>inconclusive bladder scan due to body habitus</fact11>, the primary concern is urinary retention. The patient's discomfort in the abdomen and pelvis, as well as the lack of urination, points towards a possible postoperative urinary retention. Considering the patient's <fact9>obese</fact9> status, which may complicate some diagnostic approaches, the most direct and effective method to address this issue is to insert a 'straight cath' into the patient's bladder. This will help to immediately relieve any urinary retention and provide a clear diagnosis of the issue. Therefore, the best answer is {A}."
350,"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago.

D) The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
E) The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction

Answer: The correct answer is C) Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient.

Explanation: Given the patient's <fact4>restricted diet</fact4>, <fact5>intensive exercise</fact5>, and <fact6>significant weight loss</fact6>, along with the physical examination findings of <fact15>good muscle development</fact15> and <fact16>decreased adiposity</fact16>, it is clear that her body fat percentage has decreased substantially. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in estrogen production, as it is the primary site for the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens. With decreased adiposity, the patient's estrogen levels are likely to be affected, leading to hypoestrogenemia. This is further supported by the fact that she has not menstruated in 6 months (<fact3>last period was 6 months ago</fact3> and <fact2>absence of menstruations</fact2>), which is a common consequence of low estrogen levels."
186,"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects.

He says this started <fact3>abruptly about 6 hours ago</fact3>. He says that he has not noticed that anything that makes his pain better or worse. He also denies any other symptoms. He works as a <fact4>long-haul truck driver</fact4>, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for <fact5>gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child</fact5>. He currently <fact6>smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day</fact6>, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: <fact7>temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F)</fact7>, <fact8>blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg</fact8>, <fact9>heart rate 98/min</fact9>, and <fact10>respiratory rate 23/min</fact10>. His physical examination shows <fact11>minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination</fact11>. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation with <fact2>sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration</fact2> and his risk factors for thromboembolism, including being a <fact4>long-haul truck driver</fact4> and having a history of <fact5>hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking 2 packs of cigarettes/day</fact5>, it is essential to evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE). Considering the patient's low-risk status and the need for a quick, non-invasive initial assessment, the most reasonable first step would be to perform a <fact13>D-dimer test</fact13> (option C). The D-dimer test is a sensitive but not specific test for thrombus formation and can be used to rule out PE in low-risk patients. A negative D-dimer result would make PE unlikely, while a positive result would necessitate further evaluation with imaging studies such as a CT pulmonary angiogram."
1173,"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus.

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact2>progressive muscle weakness</fact2> with specific involvement of the muscles in her <fact3>shoulders and hips</fact3>, along with <fact4>difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair</fact4>, and <fact5>new difficulty with swallowing solid foods</fact5>, a muscle disorder is likely. The patient's <fact7>maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy</fact7>, suggesting a possible genetic component. The laboratory findings of elevated <fact14>creatine kinase</fact14> and <fact15>lactate dehydrogenase</fact15> support muscle damage. The most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory muscle disease, such as polymyositis. Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy is characteristic of dermatomyositis, but given the absence of skin manifestations, polymyositis is more likely. The presence of <fact9>moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally</fact9> and the absence of skin involvement make option {C} less likely, but it is the closest to what would be expected in polymyositis, which is often characterized by endomysial inflammation.

Phenytoin-induced adenopathy (E) is also unlikely given the patient's long history of phenytoin use without previous lymphadenopathy. The normal differential in the <fact13>leukocyte count</fact13> and the lack of other abnormalities in the laboratory studies make acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (A) and mononucleosis (D) less likely. The histopathologic analysis from the <fact16>excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes</fact16> is not described, but given the clinical presentation, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) (B) is the most likely diagnosis."

He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for <fact4>iron deficiency anemia</fact4>, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a <fact5>40 pack-year smoking history</fact5>. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient’s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Results from a complete blood count are shown below:
<fact6>Hemoglobin: 11.9 mg/dl</fact6>
<fact7>Hematocrit: 35%</fact7>
<fact8>Leukocyte count: 5,000/mm^3</fact8>
<fact9>Platelet count: 20,000/mm^3</fact9>

The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?
A) Interleukin 2
B) Interleukin 8
C) Interleukin 11
D) Erythropoietin
E) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact2>metastatic small cell lung carcinoma</fact2> and current chemotherapy regimen of <fact3>etoposide and cisplatin</fact3>, along with the laboratory results showing a low <fact9>platelet count of 20,000/mm^3</fact9> and <fact8>leukocyte count of 5,000/mm^3</fact8>, it is essential to address the issue of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia to continue chemotherapy effectively. The recombinant version of Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is most appropriate in this patient as it stimulates the production of white blood cells, helping to mitigate the effects of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Answer: Considering the patient's presentation with <fact3>new bilateral blisters on her hands</fact3> and <fact6>flaccid blisters of the bilateral dorsal hands</fact6> with <fact7>hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation</fact7>, along with <fact8>increased hair growth</fact8> on the bilateral malar cheeks, these symptoms are suggestive of porphyria cutanea tarda, a condition associated with blistering skin lesions and hypertrichosis. The fact that she works in the <fact5>adult entertainment industry</fact5> and recently spent time at the beach could indicate exposure to triggers such as sunlight or hepatitis C, which are known to precipitate the condition. Furthermore, the patient's laboratory results, including a normal <fact14>Na+</fact14>, <fact15>K+</fact15>, <fact16>Cl-</fact16>, <fact17>HCO3-</fact17>, <fact18>BUN</fact18>, <fact19>Creatinine</fact19>, and <fact20>Glucose</fact20>, along with a normal <fact21>Leukocyte count</fact21>, <fact22>Hemoglobin</fact22>, and <fact23>Platelets</fact23>, do not point towards a systemic infection or other acute conditions. The elevated <fact24>Anti-nuclear antibody titer</fact24> could be related to her history of <fact2>systemic lupus erythematosus</fact2>, but it is not directly relevant to the current skin symptoms. Given these considerations, the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis would be to measure <fact25>urine porphyrin levels</fact25>, as porphyria cutanea tarda is characterized by a specific pattern of porphyrin abnormalities. Therefore, the answer is {D}."

Which of the following is the best course of action for the newborn child?

Answer: C) Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG

Explanation: Considering the child was born to a <fact3>gravida 2, para 0 mother with known hepatitis B</fact3>, the risk of hepatitis B transmission to the newborn is high. The mother's adherence to <fact4>prenatal appointments</fact4> and taking the recommended dose of <fact5>folic acid since conception</fact5> indicate proper prenatal care, but the key factor here is the mother's hepatitis B status. To prevent hepatitis B transmission to the newborn, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend administering both hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth if the mother is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. Although the mother's HBsAg status is not explicitly mentioned in the question, the fact that she has ""known hepatitis B"" implies that she is likely HBsAg positive. Therefore, the best course of action for the newborn child is to administer both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG to prevent hepatitis B transmission."

Answer: 
Given the patient's symptoms of <fact2>difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling</fact2> and physical examination findings of <fact7>mild respiratory distress, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema</fact7>, he is likely experiencing heart failure. The <fact12>P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space</fact12> and the presence of an <fact13>S3 gallop rhythm at the apex</fact13> further support this diagnosis. The medication prescribed would aim to alleviate these symptoms and improve cardiac function. Among the options provided, the most likely mechanism of action is {C} Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels. This action would help reduce venous return to the heart, thereby decreasing the preload and alleviating the symptoms of heart failure."

Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows mildly increased echogenicity of the liver. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be found in this patient?

A) Inferior vena cava thrombosis
B) Cutaneous xanthomas
C) Butterfly-shaped vertebrae
D) Increased CA 19-9 levels
E) Kayser-Fleischer rings

Answer:

Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>3-month history of fatigue</fact2>, <fact3>generalized itchiness</fact3>, <fact4>yellowing of her eyes</fact4> (jaundice), and laboratory results showing elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), high alkaline phosphatase, and direct hyperbilirubinemia, the most likely diagnosis is Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). The patient's <fact5>dryness of the eyes</fact5> and <fact6>jaundice of the conjunctivae and skin</fact6> are also consistent with PBC. A common finding in patients with PBC is the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are due to copper accumulation in the cornea. Given the patient's clinical presentation and the absence of other liver disease markers (e.g., hepatitis B and C), the most likely additional finding is Kayser-Fleischer rings. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

542,"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?
A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
B) The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.
C) The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.

What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?

Answer: 
The correct answer is A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor. 

Explanation: 
The study found an <fact6>odds ratio of 2.1</fact6> for the association between low education and the risk of MI, but the <fact7>confidence interval of 0.9–9.7</fact7> crosses 1, indicating that the association is not statistically significant. In a confidence interval for an odds ratio, if the interval includes 1, it suggests that the association may be due to chance, and the result is not statistically significant. Since the association is not statistically significant, we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for young age MI."

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings?

Answer: 
Analyzing the situation, the <fact1>72-year-old man</fact1> developed <fact2>reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL</fact2> three days after being hospitalized for <fact3>acute diverticulitis</fact3> and starting therapy with <fact10>intravenous ketoprofen</fact10>, <fact11>piperacillin</fact11>, and <fact12>tazobactam</fact12>. The <fact10>intravenous ketoprofen</fact10> is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which is known to cause renal impairment, especially in patients with pre-existing renal disease or those taking other nephrotoxic medications. Given the patient's history of <fact14>hypertension</fact14> and <fact16>type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact16>, he may have had underlying renal disease, making him more susceptible to NSAID-induced renal impairment. Additionally, the patient's <fact8>creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL</fact8> on admission was within normal limits, suggesting that the renal impairment developed during his hospital stay. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings is an <fact10>adverse drug reaction</fact10> to the NSAID. The answer is {B}."

E) History of preeclampsia in a sibling

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation with <fact3>nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain</fact3> at <fact2>30 weeks gestation</fact2>, along with laboratory findings indicating liver dysfunction (<fact21>ALT 101 U/L</fact21> and <fact22>AST 99 U/L</fact22>), and a history of a similar condition in a previous pregnancy that ended in <fact6>stillbirth at the 31st week</fact6>, the most likely diagnosis is acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP). AFLP is a rare but serious condition that typically occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy and is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

Among the provided options, the correct answer is {D} History in the previous pregnancy. This is because AFLP tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies, and the patient's history of a similar condition in her last pregnancy, which ended in stillbirth, is a significant risk factor for the current condition.

While nulliparity ({C}) is also a risk factor for AFLP, the patient's history of a previous pregnancy with similar complaints ({D}) is more directly relevant to her current condition. The patient's age ({A}), race ({B}), and the history of preeclampsia in a sibling ({E}) are not directly related to the risk of AFLP."

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation with <fact2>cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur</fact2> and her symptoms of <fact4>dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion</fact4> that have worsened during pregnancy, it is essential to evaluate the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy that could exacerbate her condition. Among the options provided, the increase in cardiac output (D) is a significant physiological change that occurs during pregnancy, starting from early gestation and peaking in the late second to early third trimester. This increase in cardiac output can put additional strain on the heart, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including <fact6>acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border</fact6>, suggest that her condition is being exacerbated by the increased demands on her heart. Therefore, the physiological pregnancy change causing the change in this patient's condition is an increase in cardiac output."

1002,"A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years.

Answer: 
Analyzing the patient's symptoms and test results, the <fact1>45-year-old man</fact1> has been experiencing <fact2>moderate-to-severe pelvic pain</fact2>, <fact3>irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria)</fact3>, and <fact4>occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation</fact4> for 2 years. These symptoms have not improved with antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, indicating that the cause is likely not a bacterial infection. The physical examination reveals a <fact6>mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules</fact6>, but no other abnormalities. The urine test results show <fact10>negative white cells and culture in the mid-stream urine</fact10>, but <fact11>positive white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion with a negative culture</fact11>. These findings are consistent with chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). This condition is characterized by chronic pain and inflammation in the pelvic region, often without evidence of bacterial infection. The patient's additional symptoms of <fact7>recurrent abdominal pain</fact7>, <fact8>periods of constipation and diarrhea</fact8>, and <fact9>fatigability</fact9> may be related to the CPPS or other underlying conditions, but the primary diagnosis is most likely chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

A urine pregnancy test is <fact21>negative</fact21>. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?

Answer: 

Analyzing the provided information, the <fact1>15-year-old girl</fact1> presents with <fact2>amenorrhea for the past 3 months</fact2>, which could be due to various factors. However, considering her <fact5>recent initiation of sexual intercourse</fact5>, a negative <fact21>urine pregnancy test</fact21> rules out pregnancy as the cause. Additionally, her <fact6>manic episode treated with risperidone</fact6> could potentially affect her menstrual cycle, but the hormone studies do not indicate a significant impact. Her <fact7>family history of PCOS</fact7> and <fact8>diabetes mellitus</fact8> is relevant, but the girl's <fact10>weight and BMI</fact10> are not indicative of obesity typically associated with PCOS. Furthermore, her <fact20>testosterone level</fact20> is within normal limits, which does not support a diagnosis of PCOS. 

Given the <fact3>irregular menstrual cycles</fact3> and <fact19>low progesterone level</fact19>, which is indicative of anovulation, the most likely cause of her symptoms is anovulation. This is further supported by the absence of any other significant abnormalities in the hormone studies or physical examination. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

239,"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?
A) Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.
B) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.
C) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.
D) The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.
E) The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.","Reformatted Question: 
A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of <fact1>incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</fact1> were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on <fact2>hospital discharges</fact2>, but also on <fact3>physician billing codes</fact3>. For study purposes, the researchers labeled <fact4>incident cases</fact4> at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while <fact5>prevalent cases</fact5> were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between <fact1>incidence and prevalence rates</fact1> during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?

Answer: C) The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.

Explanation: 
Considering the definitions used by the researchers, <fact4>incident cases</fact4> are identified at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis, while <fact5>prevalent cases</fact5> include all cases coded as having SLE at any time until death. When examining shorter time periods, the number of <fact4>incident cases</fact4> may not accurately reflect the total number of individuals with SLE, as some cases may have been diagnosed before the start of the time period or may not have been captured in the administrative data. However, the number of <fact5>prevalent cases</fact5> will still include all individuals diagnosed with SLE at any point, regardless of when they were diagnosed. This means that the prevalence of SLE during shorter time windows may be overestimated, as it includes cases that were diagnosed outside of the time period being examined."

43,"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy.

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of <fact2>sudden onset of blurry vision</fact2>, <fact9>fixed pupillary dilation</fact9>, and <fact10>difficulty depressing both eyes</fact10> suggests a neuromuscular junction disorder. The symptoms of <fact3>nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea</fact3> earlier in the day, along with the fact that his friend who ate similar foods at the picnic developed similar symptoms, point towards a foodborne illness. Among the foods listed in <fact4>, potato salad and deviled eggs are high-risk foods for botulism, a condition caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. The toxin acts by decreasing acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to the symptoms observed in this patient. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

Which of the following findings would most likely be found on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact2>progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion</fact2> along with laboratory findings of low <fact8>hemoglobin</fact8>, <fact9>hematocrit</fact9>, and <fact10>red cell count</fact10>, it is clear that he is suffering from anemia. The <fact11>low MCV</fact11> and <fact12>low MCH</fact12> indicate that the anemia is microcytic. Additionally, the <fact14>low reticulocyte count</fact14> suggests inadequate bone marrow response to the anemia. The <fact18>high TIBC</fact18> and <fact19>low transferrin saturation</fact19> are indicative of iron deficiency anemia. Given these findings, the bone marrow biopsy would most likely show a decrease in <fact20>hemosiderin stores</fact20>, which is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Answer: 
The <fact1>1-month-old girl</fact1> presents with <fact2>lethargy and irritation between meals</fact2>, which improves with frequent feedings. This pattern suggests an issue with energy metabolism. The <fact13>blood work showing normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin</fact13> indicates hemolysis. The <fact14>exclusion of sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies</fact14>, along with a <fact15>negative Coombs test</fact15> and <fact16>normal red blood cell osmotic fragility gap</fact16>, points towards an enzymatic deficiency affecting red blood cell metabolism. The <fact17>enzyme deficiency</fact17> in question is likely related to glycolysis, given the context of energy metabolism and hemolysis. Among the options, <fact18>2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)</fact18> is known to allosterically inhibit phosphoglycerate kinase, but it is not listed. However, another key regulator of glycolysis is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, which is not the correct answer in this case. Considering the allosteric regulation of glycolytic enzymes, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), but it is not the correct answer. However, the correct answer can be deduced by considering the enzyme that is likely deficient in this case. Given the clinical presentation and the fact that the patient's mother has a brother who requires <fact4>blood transfusions</fact4>, the enzyme deficiency is likely pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP, but the correct answer is not listed. However, another key inhibitor of pyruvate kinase is alanine, which is a key regulator of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the correct answer is {A} Alanine."

Considering the patient's symptoms of <fact3>lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days</fact3>, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes (<fact14>AST 4,702 U/L</fact14>, <fact15>ALT 3,551 U/L</fact15>), along with a recent travel history to <fact4>Sudan</fact4>, a region endemic for certain infectious diseases, it is essential to evaluate for possible infections. The patient's laboratory results show a significant elevation in liver enzymes, indicating liver damage. Given the acute presentation and travel history, viral hepatitis is a strong consideration. Among the options provided, choice E, Anti-HEV IgM, is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis of Hepatitis E, which is prevalent in regions like Sudan and can cause acute liver failure, especially in pregnant women. The patient's clinical presentation, including jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, along with the travel history, supports this diagnosis."
899,"A 38-year-old woman presents to the office for a routine examination. She has no complaints and offers very little information voluntarily. She answers each question with soft, short sentences and avoids eye contact. She appears timid, anxious and admits that this is one of the very few times she has left the house in the last several years. Medical history is significant for essential hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship. Today, her blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 95/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?
A) Body dysmorphic disorder
B) Schizoid personality disorder
C) Avoidant personality disorder
D) Antisocial personality disorder
E) Agoraphobia","Reformatted Question:

Considering the <fact1>68-year-old man's</fact1> symptoms, particularly the <fact3>cough for the last 4 months</fact3> and <fact15>chest radiograph revealing a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung</fact15>, it is likely that the mass is obstructing the superior vena cava (SVC), leading to superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS). A common clinical sign of SVCS is the distension of veins over the lower abdomen due to the increased venous pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."
213,"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?
A) Lack of a comparison group
B) No prevalence assessment
C) Low number of patients
D) Ascertainment bias
E) Lack of risk calculation","Reformatted Question:

Answer: 
The editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a <fact7>case series</fact7> instead of a <fact6>cohort study</fact6> because of the <fact1>lack of a comparison group</fact1> in the study. A cohort study typically involves comparing outcomes between two or more groups with different exposures or characteristics. In this case, the study only analyzed the outcomes of <fact1>14 patients</fact1> who underwent cerclage wiring without comparing them to a control group or a group with a different treatment approach.
