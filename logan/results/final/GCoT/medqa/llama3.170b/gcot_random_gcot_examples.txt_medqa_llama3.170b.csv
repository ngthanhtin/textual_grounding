A <fact1>48-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the physician because of a <fact2>4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising</fact2>. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of <fact3>thrombophlebitis</fact3>. Physical examination shows <fact4>multiple bruises on her limbs</fact4>. Laboratory studies show a <fact5>platelet count of 900,000/mm3</fact5> and elevated levels of <fact6>serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid</fact6>. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7>. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7>?

Answer: 
Analyzing the provided information, the patient's symptoms and lab results, including a <fact5>platelet count of 900,000/mm3</fact5> and elevated levels of <fact6>serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid</fact6>, are indicative of a myeloproliferative disorder, likely essential thrombocythemia. The medication used in treating this condition that is also used in the treatment of <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7> is likely hydroxyurea. The mechanism most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in <fact7>sickle cell disease</fact7> is the <fact8>increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin</fact8>. Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin production, which reduces the amount of sickle hemoglobin in red blood cells, thereby reducing the frequency of sickle cell crises. Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."

Answer: Based on the provided information, the <fact1>3-year-old refugee</fact1> presents with symptoms indicative of severe malnutrition, including <fact2>increasing pitting edema and abdominal swelling</fact2> over the past <fact3>2 months</fact3>, likely due to <fact5>frequently inadequate nutrition</fact5> resulting from <fact4>displacement and poor living conditions</fact4>. The presence of <fact8>pitting edema</fact8>, <fact9>ascites and hepatomegaly</fact9>, and <fact10>several missing teeth</fact10> are all characteristic of kwashiorkor, a form of malnutrition caused by a lack of sufficient protein intake. Additionally, the child's <fact6>irritability and drowsiness</fact6>, along with being <fact7>difficult to arouse</fact7>, may indicate a severe level of malnutrition. Therefore, the best explanation for these findings is kwashiorkor. The answer is {A}."

An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of <fact1>normal human cells</fact1> with an <fact2>elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase</fact2> is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells? 
A) α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase 
B) Pyruvate kinase 
C) Glutathione reductase 
D) Lactic acid dehydrogenase 
E) Carbonic anhydrase

Answer: 
Given that the <fact1>normal human cells</fact1> have an <fact2>elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase</fact2>, this suggests an adaptation to optimize oxygen delivery. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in the regulation of hemoglobin's oxygen-binding affinity by producing 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). Elevated levels of 2,3-BPG decrease hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, facilitating the release of oxygen to tissues. This adaptation is particularly relevant in conditions where oxygen delivery needs to be maximized, such as in high-altitude environments or in tissues with high oxygen demands. Considering the options provided, carbonic anhydrase (choice E) plays a crucial role in the transport of carbon dioxide in red blood cells and the regulation of blood pH, but it is not directly involved in the oxygen-binding affinity of hemoglobin or the metabolic pathway influenced by bisphosphoglycerate mutase. Therefore, carbonic anhydrase is the enzyme most likely to be absent or not directly affected in these cells with elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase activity."

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation, with symptoms of <fact2>shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria</fact2> that began <fact3>5 minutes after eating a peanut butter sandwich</fact3>, it is clear that the patient is experiencing anaphylaxis. The treatment for anaphylaxis typically involves the administration of epinephrine, a drug that has various effects on the body, including the cardiovascular system. In cardiac pacemaker cells, epinephrine increases the rate of depolarization by increasing the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) during phase 4 of the action potential, which is the resting phase. This increase in Ca2+ influx leads to an increase in the rate of firing of the pacemaker cells, resulting in an increase in heart rate. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

A <fact1>24-year-old man</fact1> is brought to the emergency department <fact2>15 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to the left chest just below the clavicle</fact2>. On arrival, he has <fact3>rapid, shallow breathing</fact3> and appears anxious. His <fact4>pulse is 135/min</fact4>, <fact5>respirations are 30/min and shallow</fact5>, and <fact6>palpable systolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg</fact6>. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

C) A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration
D) Herniation of the stomach into the chest
E) Paradoxical motion of part of the chest with breathing

Answer: C) A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration.

Explanation: The patient's presentation with <fact3>rapid, shallow breathing</fact3>, <fact4>high pulse rate</fact4>, and <fact6>low systolic blood pressure</fact6> suggests hypovolemic shock. The presence of <fact11>muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention</fact11> in the context of a <fact10>stab wound to the left chest</fact10> is highly suggestive of cardiac tamponade, a condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial space compressing the heart. A characteristic sign of cardiac tamponade is pulsus paradoxus, which is a drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation is a drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration, which is indicative of pulsus paradoxus."
542,"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?
A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
B) The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.
C) The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.
D) One can not comment, as the p-value is not given.

Answer: A) The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.

Explanation: The <fact6>chi-square test</fact6> was performed to test the significance of the relationship between <fact4>low educational status</fact4> and the risk of MI. However, the <fact8>confidence interval of 0.9–9.7</fact8> for the <fact7>odds ratio of 2.1</fact7> includes 1, which indicates that the association is not statistically significant. Although the odds ratio suggests a potential increased risk of MI with low education, the wide confidence interval and the inclusion of 1 within it imply that this association is not reliable. Therefore, based on this study, it cannot be concluded that low education is a statistically significant risk factor for MI at a young age."

Answer: 
Given that the patient has a <fact2>type 1 diabetes</fact2> and is experiencing a <fact3>upper respiratory infection</fact3> with symptoms such as <fact4>coughing and a runny nose</fact4>, it is essential to monitor his condition closely. The patient's <fact5>temperature is 37.8° C (100.2° F)</fact5>, which is slightly elevated, and <fact6>vital signs are within normal limits</fact6>, but it is crucial to be proactive in managing his diabetes during this illness. Since the physical examination is <fact7>unremarkable</fact7>, there is no indication of severe illness that would necessitate a significant change in his insulin regimen. However, illnesses like the common cold can cause fluctuations in blood glucose levels due to the body's stress response and potential changes in appetite or eating habits. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation would be to <fact8>increase the frequency of blood glucose checks</fact8> to closely monitor his glucose levels and adjust his insulin doses as needed based on the results. This approach allows for a more tailored management of his diabetes during the illness without making unnecessary changes to his regimen. The answer is {A}."

A) Activation of G protein-coupled receptors
B) Synthesis of glutamine
C) Accumulation of cAMP
D) Opening of ligand-gated ion channels
E) Influx of calcium

Answer: E) Influx of calcium

Explanation: 
The question asks about the event that occurs immediately prior to the <fact7>release of neurotransmitters</fact7> in the context of <fact1>glutamate release</fact1> from <fact2>presynaptic nerve terminals</fact2> in Alzheimer disease. Given that the concentration of <fact3>glutamate</fact3> is measured in the <fact4>CA1 region of the hippocampus</fact4> using <fact5>magnetic resonance spectroscopy</fact5> after <fact6>Schaffer collateral fibers</fact6> are electrically stimulated, the focus is on the neural mechanisms involved in neurotransmitter release. Among the options, the <fact8>influx of calcium</fact8> is the critical event that triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing an influx of calcium ions. This increase in intracellular calcium triggers the fusion of vesicles containing neurotransmitters with the presynaptic membrane, leading to the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft."

What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?

Answer: 
Analyzing the patient's symptoms, including a <fact2>6-month history of worsening fatigue and weight loss</fact2>, a recent episode of <fact3>blurring of his vision and headache</fact3>, and decreased memory (<fact4>“memory is not as good as it used to be”</fact4>), alongside laboratory findings of <fact6>anemia</fact6> and an <fact7>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</fact7>, points towards a hematological disorder. The presence of a <fact8>sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM</fact8> on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and a significantly elevated serum IgM concentration of <fact9>6.3 g/dL</fact9> are characteristic of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, a condition characterized by the proliferation of malignant lymphoplasmacytic cells that produce monoclonal IgM. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's symptoms, such as blurred vision and headaches, which can be attributed to the hyperviscosity syndrome associated with high levels of IgM. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a <fact5>3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop</fact5>. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of <fact6>> 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter</fact6>. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
<fact7>Leukocyte esterase  positive</fact7>
<fact8>WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF</fact8>
<fact9>Nitrites positive</fact9>
<fact10>RBCs 2 cell/HPF</fact10>
<fact11>Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF</fact11>
<fact12>Urine pH 5.7</fact12>
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact6>urine culture report showing growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter</fact6>, along with the urinalysis findings of <fact7>positive leukocyte esterase</fact7>, <fact8>50-100 WBCs/HPF</fact8>, and <fact9>positive nitrites</fact9>, it is clear that the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI). Given the patient's age and medical history, including <fact3>Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema</fact3>, it is essential to choose an antibiotic that is effective against Enterobacter and has a suitable safety profile for this patient. Nitrofurantoin is generally not effective against Enterobacter, and TMP-SMX may not be the best choice due to potential interactions with the patient's medications, such as <fact4>memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium</fact4>. Cephalexin is a suitable option for treating Enterobacter UTIs and is generally well-tolerated in elderly patients. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to prescribe {D} Cephalexin."

Which of the following cells in the patient's liver were most likely damaged first?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation with <fact3>painless rectal bleeding, dizziness, and lightheadedness</fact3> and the laboratory findings, particularly the significantly elevated liver enzymes <fact18>ALT of 2,674 U/L</fact18> and <fact19>AST of 2,254 U/L</fact19>, it is indicative of acute liver injury. The pattern of enzyme elevation, with ALT being higher than AST, points towards a hepatocellular injury pattern. In the context of hypovolemic shock due to <fact9>profuse diverticular bleeding</fact9>, the liver injury is likely due to ischemia. The liver cells most susceptible to ischemic injury are those located in the centrilobular region (zone III), which are farthest from the hepatic artery and portal vein and thus most prone to hypoxia. Therefore, the cells in the patient's liver that were most likely damaged first are the <fact20>centrilobular hepatocytes</fact20>. The answer is E."

A <fact6>metyrapone stimulation test</fact6> is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of <fact7>adrenal insufficiency</fact7>. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?

Answer: To answer this question, we need to understand the mechanism of the <fact6>metyrapone stimulation test</fact6> and its effects on the body's hormonal responses. Metyrapone is a medication that inhibits the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, which is crucial for the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol in the adrenal glands. When metyrapone is administered, it blocks this conversion, leading to an accumulation of 11-deoxycortisol and a decrease in cortisol production. As a result, the body responds by increasing the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland in an attempt to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol. Given this information, the most likely change in laboratory findings following the administration of metyrapone would be an <fact8>increase in serum ACTH</fact8> as the body tries to compensate for the blocked cortisol production. Therefore, the answer is {A}."

Urinalysis shows <fact13>proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells</fact13>. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation with <fact2>increased fatigue and back pain</fact2> along with laboratory findings such as <fact7>low hemoglobin</fact7>, <fact10>elevated urea nitrogen</fact10>, <fact11>high creatinine</fact11>, and <fact12>high calcium levels</fact12>, it suggests the presence of multiple myeloma, a plasma cell dyscrasia. The <fact13>proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells</fact13> can be attributed to the presence of Bence-Jones proteins in the urine, which is characteristic of multiple myeloma. This condition is associated with <fact5>pale skin and conjunctiva</fact5> due to anemia, <fact3>constant and non-radiating back pain</fact3> due to bone lesions, and <fact4>mild tenderness over the lumbar region</fact4> due to vertebral involvement. The presence of proteinuria in this context best fits the category of overflow proteinuria, which occurs when the glomeruli are overwhelmed by an excessive amount of proteins, such as Bence-Jones proteins, that are produced by the abnormal plasma cells. Therefore, the answer is {A}."

Answer: Considering the patient's presentation and the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is {E} Cardiac tamponade. This conclusion is based on several key points: 
1. The patient was an <fact3>unrestrained driver</fact3> in a motor vehicle collision, which increases the risk of thoracic trauma.
2. The patient had <fact8>multiple ecchymoses over the chest</fact8>, indicating chest trauma.
3. The patient's <fact11>jugaular venous pressure is increased</fact11>, which is a sign of increased intrathoracic pressure.
4. The <fact16>FAST is negative</fact16>, which makes abdominal bleeding less likely.
5. The patient's <fact18>pulse is 160/min</fact18> and <fact19>palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg</fact19> despite fluid resuscitation, indicating severe hypotension and tachycardia.
6. The patient's electrocardiogram shows <fact17>absent p-waves</fact17>, which can be seen in cardiac tamponade due to the compression of the heart.

While other options could also be considered based on the patient's presentation, the combination of these factors makes cardiac tamponade the most likely diagnosis."

<fact23>Sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa</fact23>. A <fact24>sweat test shows chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L (elevated)</fact24>. Which of the following is involved in the pathogenesis of this patient’s symptoms?

Answer: 
Considering the <fact1>4-month-old boy's</fact1> presentation with <fact2>fever, dyspnea, and cough</fact2> and the findings of a <fact23>sputum culture growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa</fact23> along with an <fact24>elevated chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L on a sweat test</fact24>, it is highly suggestive of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The pathogenesis of CF is primarily due to mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, which encodes for a chloride channel. This results in abnormal chloride transport across epithelial membranes, leading to thickened mucus secretions that are difficult to clear, making patients more susceptible to respiratory infections, including those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, the correct answer is {B} Abnormal CFTR protein."

Which of the following would have been most effective in preventing this patient's current symptoms?

Answer: Analyzing the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is evident that he is experiencing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication of cancer treatment, particularly with <fact3>acute myelogenous leukemia</fact3>. TLS is characterized by the release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream, leading to hyperkalemia (<fact14>Serum K+ 5.9 mEq/L</fact14>), hyperphosphatemia (<fact23>Serum phosphorus 8.9 mg/dL</fact23>), hyperuricemia (<fact18>Serum uric acid 11.2 mg/dL</fact18>), and hypocalcemia (<fact21>Serum Ca2+ 6.8 mg/dL</fact21>). The patient's symptoms of <fact2>nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps</fact2> are consistent with these electrolyte imbalances. To prevent TLS, it is essential to manage the risk factors, including the use of uric acid-lowering agents. Among the options provided, <fact24>Rasburicase</fact24> is a recombinant urate oxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin, thereby reducing uric acid levels and preventing TLS. Therefore, the most effective measure in preventing this patient's current symptoms would have been the administration of <fact24>Rasburicase</fact24>."

Answer: 
Considering the patient's diagnosis of <fact7>metastatic melanoma</fact7> and the initiation of chemotherapy with <fact8>aldesleukin</fact8>, it is essential to understand the mechanism of action of this drug. Aldesleukin, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2), is an immunotherapy agent that plays a crucial role in the immune system. The correct answer is {D} Activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells. This is because IL-2 stimulates the growth, proliferation, and survival of T cells, which are vital for the immune response against cancer cells. By activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, aldesleukin enhances the body's ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells, making it an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma."

He noticed it last month and felt that it has <fact3>increased slightly in size</fact3>. It is <fact4>tender to touch</fact4> but has no overlying skin changes. There is no breast discharge. The patient has <fact5>cryptorchidism as an infant</fact5> and underwent a successful <fact6>orchiopexy</fact6>. In addition, he was recently diagnosed with <fact7>ADHD</fact7> and is currently on <fact8>methylphenidate</fact8> with improvement in his symptoms. He has a family history of <fact9>type I diabetes in his father</fact9> and <fact10>breast fibroadenoma in his mother</fact10>. On exam, the patient is at the <fact11>82nd percentile for height</fact11>, <fact12>79th percentile for weight</fact12>, and <fact13>80th percentile for BMI</fact13>. He has <fact14>Tanner IV pubic hair</fact14>. Testicular volume is <fact15>7 mL on each side</fact15>, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. Breast exam shows a normal right breast and a <fact16>3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple</fact16>. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?

Answer: Considering the patient's age and physical examination findings, particularly the presence of a <fact16>3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple</fact16> and <fact14>Tanner IV pubic hair</fact14>, it is likely that the patient is experiencing a normal physiological change during puberty. The most common cause of a breast lump in a male during puberty is glandular tissue enlargement, also known as pubertal gynecomastia. This condition is usually self-limiting and resolves on its own within a few years. The patient's <fact11>height</fact11>, <fact12>weight</fact12>, and <fact13>BMI</fact13> percentiles are within a normal range, and there are no indications of hormonal imbalances or other underlying conditions that could cause gynecomastia. Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's condition is glandular tissue enlargement, also known as pubertal gynecomastia. The answer is {B}."

Physical examination shows <fact5>sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump</fact5>. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of the disease process in this patient?

A) Decreased release of acetylcholine
B) Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels
C) Destruction of Schwann cells
D) Decreased release of glycine
E) Destruction of anterior horn cells

Answer: The clinical presentation of the <fact1>5-day-old boy</fact1> with <fact2>poor feeding, irritability, and noisy breathing</fact2>, along with the physical findings of <fact5>sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump</fact5>, is highly suggestive of a severe infection. The absence of <fact3>prenatal care</fact3> and the specific physical examination findings point towards a diagnosis of neonatal tetanus. The pathogenesis of tetanus involves the toxin produced by Clostridium tetani, which is characterized by its ability to inhibit the release of glycine, a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of muscle tone. This inhibition leads to the characteristic muscle rigidity and spasms seen in tetanus infections. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."
136,"A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8.

Answer: 
The patient's presentation of <fact4>burning pain in her upper right back and chest</fact4> accompanied by a <fact11>long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions</fact11> is highly suggestive of herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles. This condition is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia after a primary chickenpox infection. The fact that the rash is localized to one side of the body and follows a dermatomal distribution further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease is viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia, which corresponds to option {A}."

Answer: The patient is a <fact1>47-year-old female</fact1> who recently experienced <fact2>nephrolithiasis</fact2> and was able to pass a <fact3>4-mm stone</fact3> composed of <fact4>calcium oxalate</fact4>. To prevent future renal calculi formation, it is essential to consider the composition of the stone and how different interventions might affect its formation. Decreasing <fact4>calcium</fact4> intake (option A) might seem like a viable option, but it could potentially lead to increased oxalate absorption in the gut, which could worsen the situation. Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds (option C) is not directly related to preventing <fact4>calcium oxalate</fact4> stones. Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy (option D) and urine acidification with cranberry juice (option E) are not typically recommended for preventing <fact4>calcium oxalate</fact4> stones. Decreasing sodium intake (option B) is the most appropriate choice, as high sodium intake can increase calcium excretion in the urine, which can contribute to the formation of <fact4>calcium oxalate</fact4> stones. Therefore, reducing sodium intake can help prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient."

What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?
A) Botulism
B) Duchenne muscular dystrophy
C) Hypothyroidism
D) Myasthenia gravis
E) Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>65-year-old woman</fact1> schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of <fact2>weight loss and weakness</fact2>. The <fact3>weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair</fact3>. The <fact4>weakness improves after brief exercise</fact4>. She also has <fact5>bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks</fact5> and was given an <fact6>anticholinesterase agent with no improvement</fact6>. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?

Answer: Evaluating the <fact1>65-year-old woman's</fact1> symptoms, the <fact2>weight loss and weakness</fact2> are significant. However, the pattern of <fact3>weakness being more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair</fact3> and <fact4>improving after brief exercise</fact4> is crucial in differentiating the cause. These characteristics are indicative of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction. The fact that she was given an <fact6>anticholinesterase agent with no improvement</fact6> might initially seem counterintuitive, but anticholinesterase agents are actually used to treat myasthenia gravis, and the lack of improvement could be due to various factors such as inadequate dosage or disease severity. However, the presence of <fact5>bladder incontinence</fact5> is not typically associated with myasthenia gravis, which primarily affects the muscles of the eyes, face, and extremities. Considering this discrepancy, another condition that could explain the symptoms, especially the bladder incontinence and the pattern of weakness, is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung, which can cause Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). LEMS is characterized by muscle weakness that improves with repeated use, and it can also involve autonomic dysfunction, such as bladder incontinence. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms, given the combination of improving weakness with exercise and the presence of bladder incontinence, is a paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung. The answer is {E}."

Answer: 
Considering the patient's symptoms, particularly the <fact3>4 points out of 10</fact3> pain rating, bilateral and ""band-like"" nature of the pain, and exacerbation by <fact5>coughing or laughing</fact5>, along with the absence of <fact4>nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia</fact4>, and no focal symptoms or meningeal symptoms on neurologic exam, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is tension-type headache. This type of headache is often described as a band or a squeezing sensation around the forehead, and can be exacerbated by stress, coughing, or laughing. The patient's recent history of a <fact10>runny nose with a temperature elevation</fact10> approximately 3 weeks ago may have triggered the onset of these headaches. The presence of <fact15>S2 accentuation</fact15> and the patient's history of <fact6>stage 1 arterial hypertension</fact6> and <fact7>stable angina pectoris</fact7> suggest possible cardiovascular involvement, but these findings do not directly correlate with the headache symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the provided options, but based on the given choices, the closest mechanism would be related to dilation of the intracerebral arterioles, which is not directly supported by the provided information.

A <fact1>63-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the physician because of a <fact2>6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion</fact2> in addition to a <fact3>1-month history of ankle swelling</fact3>. She has a <fact4>history of sleep apnea</fact4>. Examination of the lower extremities shows <fact5>bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema</fact5>. Cardiac examination shows a <fact6>widely split S2 that varies with respiration</fact6>. An ECG shows <fact7>right bundle branch block</fact7>. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?
A) Localized lymphatic obstruction
B) Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans
C) Thrombus formation in a deep vein
D) Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
E) Decreased plasma oncotic pressure

Answer: D) Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure

Explanation: The patient's presentation of <fact5>bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema</fact5> along with a <fact6>widely split S2 that varies with respiration</fact6> and a history of <fact2>fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion</fact2> is suggestive of heart failure or a condition leading to increased pressure in the heart. The presence of <fact7>right bundle branch block</fact7> on ECG further supports this, as it can be a sign of heart failure or pulmonary hypertension. Given these findings, the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema is <fact8>increased capillary hydrostatic pressure</fact8>, which occurs when there is increased pressure within the capillaries, causing fluid to leak into the interstitial space and resulting in edema."

Answer: 
Considering the patient's symptoms of <fact2>intermittent stabbing face pain</fact2> that is <fact4>bilateral, but rarely occurs on both sides simultaneously</fact4> and can be triggered by <fact5>touching her face or brushing her teeth</fact5>, along with the presence of <fact8>decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally</fact8>, this presentation is suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia.

Which of the following describes the <fact9>ejection fraction</fact9> in this patient?

Answer: To determine the ejection fraction, we need to understand that it is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume (EDV) that is ejected out of the left ventricle during systole. The formula for ejection fraction (EF) is EF = (EDV - ESV) / EDV. However, we are given the end-systolic volume (ESV) as 80 mL but not the end-diastolic volume (EDV). Nonetheless, we can infer the ejection fraction based on the provided information and typical values for a healthy heart. A normal ejection fraction is around 55-70%. Given the patient's symptoms of <fact4>breathlessness and fatigue</fact4> and the low <fact6>blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg</fact6>, indicating possible heart failure, an ejection fraction of 25% is a reasonable estimate for this scenario, as it suggests significant impairment of the heart's pumping ability. Therefore, the answer is {D}."

A <fact15>nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis</fact15>; <fact16>transillumination test is negative</fact16>. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact14>bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia</fact14> and the presence of a <fact15>nontender 1.5-cm mass in the left testis</fact15> with a <fact16>negative transillumination test</fact16>, which suggests a solid mass rather than a cyst, the most likely underlying cause is a <fact17>Leydig cell tumor</fact17>. Leydig cell tumors are known to produce estrogen, leading to gynecomastia in men. The patient's <fact5>accident and injured left testicle</fact5> <fact6>3 months ago</fact6> and <fact7>weight gain</fact7> may be contributing factors but are not the primary cause. The patient's <fact9>alcohol consumption</fact9> and <fact10>use of pantoprazole</fact10> are not directly related to the development of gynecomastia or testicular masses. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

D) <fact4>Fee-for-service</fact4> poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians
E) <fact5>Capitation</fact5> may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits

Answer: C and E. 

Explanation: 
- Option C is correct because <fact3>Fee-for-service</fact3> models can incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization, including tests and procedures, which may not always be necessary or of high quality. This is because physicians are paid for each service they provide, which can lead to overutilization.
- Option E is correct because <fact5>Capitation</fact5> involves paying physicians a fixed amount per patient, regardless of the services provided. This model can create perverse incentives for physicians to reduce healthcare utilization, including preventive medicine visits, in order to minimize costs and maximize profits."

Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?

Answer: Analyzing the patient's presentation and lab values, it's clear that she is experiencing a psychiatric episode, as evidenced by her <fact2>attack on her date</fact2> and responding to <fact3>internal stimuli</fact3>. Her past medical history of <fact4>depression and anxiety</fact4> and known history of <fact5>medication non-compliance</fact5> suggest that her underlying condition may be related to a psychiatric disorder. Additionally, her lab values show a low hemoglobin level (<fact24>10 g/dL</fact24>) and elevated creatinine level (<fact21>1.7 mg/dL</fact21>), which could be indicative of a systemic condition. However, given her psychiatric presentation, it's essential to rule out any underlying substance use or toxicity that could be contributing to her behavior. Therefore, the next best step in management would be to perform a <fact29>urine toxicology</fact29> screen to assess for any potential substance use. The answer is {D}."

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's history of <fact4>major depressive disorder</fact4> and current medication with <fact9>citalopram</fact9>, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) known to potentially cause sexual dysfunction, switching to a different antidepressant that may have fewer sexual side effects is a reasonable approach. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is less likely to cause sexual dysfunction compared to SSRIs like citalopram. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to {E} switch citalopram to bupropion."
846,"An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes. Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Transplant of which of the following tissues would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury?
A) Perichondrium
B) Proteoglycans
C) Chondronectin
D) Osteoblasts
E) Mature chondrocytes","Reformatted Question: An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes.

D) Osteoblasts
E) Mature chondrocytes

Answer: A) Perichondrium. 

The question states that the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing after <fact3>8 weeks</fact3>, and the investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of <fact4>progenitor cells for matrix regeneration</fact4>. Perichondrium is a tissue that contains progenitor cells capable of differentiating into chondrocytes, which are essential for cartilage regeneration. Therefore, transplanting perichondrium would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury."

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s <fact10>glucosuria</fact10>?

Answer: 
The patient's <fact10>glucosuria</fact10> is most likely due to the high blood glucose levels secondary to <fact4>type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact4>. The patient's <fact9>HbA1c is 9%</fact9>, indicating poor blood glucose control. Normally, the kidneys are able to reabsorb glucose from the filtrate back into the bloodstream through secondary active transport in the proximal renal tubules. However, when blood glucose levels exceed the reabsorptive capacity of the kidneys, glucose appears in the urine, resulting in <fact10>glucosuria</fact10>. The presence of <fact12>yeast</fact12> in the urinalysis is likely a secondary finding, as yeast can ferment glucose in the urine, but it is not the cause of the <fact10>glucosuria</fact10>. The correct answer is {C} There is a disruption of secondary active transport of glucose in the renal tubules."

Answer:

The patient's laboratory results show a serum sodium level of <fact9>148 mEq/L</fact9>, which is indicative of <fact18>hypernatremia</fact18>. To determine the cause of the hypernatremia, it is essential to consider the patient's overall clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The patient's <fact16>osmolality is 300 mOsmol/kg H2O</fact16>, and the <fact17>urine osmolality is 240 mOsm/kg H2O</fact17>, which suggests an inappropriately low urine osmolality in the context of hypernatremia. This pattern is most consistent with <fact19>central diabetes insipidus (DI)</fact19>, a condition characterized by <fact20>decreased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion</fact20>. Decreased ADH secretion leads to an inability to concentrate urine, resulting in hypernatremia due to free water loss.

The child’s <fact6>temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C)</fact6>, <fact7>blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg</fact7>, <fact8>pulse is 90/min</fact8>, and <fact9>respirations are 18/min</fact9>. Physical examination reveals a <fact10>listless child</fact10> with a <fact11>rotund abdomen</fact11> and <fact12>positive fluid wave</fact12>. Notable <fact13>lower extremity edema</fact13> is present. This patient's condition is most likely caused by a deficiency in which of the following?
A) Total caloric intake
B) Relative protein intake
C) Relative carbohydrate intake
D) Relative fat intake
E) Vitamin intake

Answer: B) Relative protein intake

Explanation: The child's presentation with <fact4>chronic tiredness and subdued behavior</fact4>, a <fact10>listless</fact10> appearance, <fact11>rotund abdomen</fact11>, <fact12>positive fluid wave</fact12>, and <fact13>lower extremity edema</fact13> is highly suggestive of kwashiorkor, a form of malnutrition characterized by a lack of sufficient protein intake despite potentially adequate caloric intake. This condition is often seen in individuals from regions with limited access to nutrient-rich foods, such as refugees from Somalia (<fact2>refugees from Somalia</fact2>) living in <fact3>temporary housing</fact3>, where access to nutritious food may be limited. The child's <fact5>birth at 38 weeks gestation</fact5> and the mother's report of symptoms preceding their arrival in the United States further support the likelihood of a long-standing nutritional deficiency, specifically a relative protein intake deficiency."

Which of the following is a feature of this patient's anemia?

Answer: 
The patient presents with <fact2>fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath</fact2> and laboratory findings show a <fact12>low hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL</fact12> and a <fact13>mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 fL</fact13>, indicating a microcytic anemia.

Instead, the elevated ferritin level, in combination with the patient's history of <fact4>rheumatoid arthritis</fact4>, suggests anemia of chronic disease. A key feature of anemia of chronic disease is the <fact18>upregulation of hepcidin</fact18>, a hormone that regulates iron metabolism and leads to decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."
209,"A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for HIV patients.

A) Prevents viral transcription
B) Inhibits viral assembly
C) Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell
D) Inhibits viral entry
E) Prevents T-cell binding","Reformatted Question: A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for <fact1>HIV patients</fact1>. <fact2>Darunavir</fact2> has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of <fact3>hyperglycemia</fact3>. A new drug called <fact4>DN501</fact4> is developed with the same mechanism of action as <fact2>darunavir</fact2> but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of <fact4>DN501</fact4>?

A) Prevents viral transcription
B) Inhibits viral assembly
C) Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell
D) Inhibits viral entry
E) Prevents T-cell binding

Answer: Considering that <fact4>DN501</fact4> has the same mechanism of action as <fact2>darunavir</fact2>, we should first identify the mechanism of action of darunavir. Darunavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV infection. Protease inhibitors work by binding to the protease active site in the virus, preventing the protease from cleaving the viral polyproteins into functional proteins necessary for viral replication. However, none of the options directly describe the action of a protease inhibitor. Among the options provided, the closest mechanism related to the action of a protease inhibitor would be inhibiting viral assembly, as protease inhibitors prevent the proper assembly of viral particles by blocking the processing of viral proteins. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

The patient has a <fact2>past medical history of asthma</fact2> which is controlled with albuterol. She is currently <fact3>sexually active</fact3> but states that she uses <fact4>birth control</fact4>. She has many friends and states that her mood is typically positive. The patient's <fact5>last pap smear was 1 year ago</fact5>. Her father died of <fact6>colon cancer</fact6> at the age of 68, and her mother was diagnosed with <fact7>breast cancer</fact7> at the age of 65. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), <fact8>blood pressure is 147/108 mmHg</fact8>, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's <fact9>BMI is 19 kg/m^2</fact9>. Physical exam demonstrates a normal S1 and S2, normal breath sounds, and an abdominal exam that is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact1>age</fact1> and <fact3>sexually active status</fact3>, along with her <fact5>last pap smear being 1 year ago</fact5>, it is essential to maintain regular cervical cancer screening. However, given her <fact8>high blood pressure</fact8>, it is crucial to address this issue promptly. Hypertension can lead to severe complications, and managing it takes precedence over other routine check-ups. Among the provided options, none directly address the patient's high blood pressure. However, considering the available choices, option B is the most relevant to her current situation, as it involves her <fact4>birth control</fact4> method, which could potentially be related to her hypertension. Therefore, the best answer is {B}."

A <fact1>3-year-old male</fact1> is brought in to his pediatrician by his mother because she is concerned that he is not growing appropriately. Physical examination is notable for <fact2>frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities</fact2>. His <fact3>axial skeleton appears normal</fact3>.

Genetic analysis reveals an <fact9>activating mutation in a growth factor receptor</fact9>. Which of the following physiologic processes is most likely disrupted in this patient’s condition?

Answer: 
Considering the <fact1>3-year-old male's</fact1> physical examination findings, including <fact2>frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities</fact2>, with a normal <fact3>axial skeleton</fact3>, suggests a condition affecting the appendicular skeleton. His growth percentile, at the <fact4>7th percentile for height</fact4> but <fact5>95th percentile for head circumference</fact5>, indicates a disproportionate growth pattern. Additionally, his developmental milestones, such as sitting up without support at <fact7>twelve months</fact7> and walking at <fact8>24 months</fact8>, are within normal limits, which suggests that his condition primarily affects bone growth rather than overall development or intelligence (<fact6>normal intelligence</fact6>). The presence of an <fact9>activating mutation in a growth factor receptor</fact9> points towards a disorder of bone growth regulation. Among the options provided, the process most likely disrupted is endochondral ossification, which is the process by which the appendicular skeleton grows in length. This process is regulated by various growth factors and is consistent with the patient's presentation of shortened limbs and normal axial skeleton. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

His symptoms improve significantly after the administration of <fact5>metoclopramide</fact5>. This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?

Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the <fact1>66-year-old man</fact1> with <fact2>small cell lung cancer</fact2> is experiencing <fact3>persistent nausea and vomiting</fact3> after starting chemotherapy with <fact4>etoposide</fact4>. The improvement of symptoms after the administration of <fact5>metoclopramide</fact5>, a dopamine antagonist with antiemetic properties, suggests that the chemotherapy affected a structure involved in nausea and vomiting that is responsive to dopamine antagonism. The area postrema is a part of the brain that is involved in the vomiting reflex and is sensitive to various chemicals, including those used in chemotherapy. This area is not protected by the blood-brain barrier, making it susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy agents like etoposide. Therefore, the structure most likely affected by chemotherapy in this case is the area postrema. The answer is {E}."

D) Incomplete abortion
E) Ectopic pregnancy","Reformatted Question: 
A <fact1>34-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past <fact2>2 months</fact2>, she has had increasing <fact3>breast tenderness</fact3>, <fact4>nausea</fact4>, <fact5>3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain</fact5>, and <fact6>urinary frequency</fact6>. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives <fact7>6 months ago</fact7>; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant. Her <fact8>temperature is 37.2°C (99°F)</fact8>, <fact9>pulse is 100/min</fact9>, and <fact10>blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg</fact10>. Physical examination shows <fact11>mild, nontender abdominal enlargement</fact11>. The <fact12>cervical os is closed</fact12>. <fact13>Urine β-hCG is negative</fact13>. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows <fact14>no abnormalities</fact14>. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A) Delusion of pregnancy
B) Pseudocyesis
C) Pregnancy
D) Incomplete abortion
E) Ectopic pregnancy

Answer: B) Pseudocyesis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of <fact3>breast tenderness</fact3>, <fact4>nausea</fact4>, <fact5>weight gain</fact5>, and <fact6>urinary frequency</fact6> for the past <fact2>2 months</fact2> could suggest pregnancy, but the <fact13>negative urine β-hCG</fact13> and <fact14>normal transvaginal ultrasonography</fact14> results contradict this. Additionally, the <fact11>mild, nontender abdominal enlargement</fact11> and <fact12>closed cervical os</fact12> do not support the diagnosis of pregnancy or any other obstetric condition. The patient's belief that she is pregnant despite the lack of objective evidence, as indicated by her informing her husband of the pregnancy, suggests a psychological component. Therefore, pseudocyesis, also known as false pregnancy or phantom pregnancy, is the most likely diagnosis."
