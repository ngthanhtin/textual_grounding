789,"A 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1 at 24 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. She has a history of preterm birth. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate 100/min; respiratory rate 13/min; and temperature 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered. Betamethasone stimulates which fetal cells?
A) Type I pneumocytes
B) Goblet cells
C) Bronchial epithelial cells
D) Type II pneumocytes
E) Vascular smooth myocytes","Reformatted Question: A <fact1>26-year-old gravida 2 para 1</fact1> at <fact2>24 weeks gestation</fact2> is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with <fact3>mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge</fact3>. She has a <fact4>history of preterm birth</fact4>. The vital signs are as follows: <fact5>blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate 100/min; respiratory rate 13/min; and temperature 36.6℃ (97.9℉)</fact5>. The <fact6>pelvic examination</fact6> reveals <fact7>cervical softening and shortening</fact7>. <fact8>Transvaginal ultrasound</fact8> shows a <fact9>cervical length of 12 mm</fact9>, which is consistent with <fact10>preterm labor</fact10>. A <fact11>tocolytic</fact11> and a single dose of <fact12>betamethasone</fact12> are administered. <fact12>Betamethasone</fact12> stimulates which fetal cells?

Answer: The administration of <fact12>betamethasone</fact12> in the context of <fact10>preterm labor</fact10> is aimed at enhancing fetal lung maturity. Given that the patient is at <fact2>24 weeks gestation</fact2> and has a <fact4>history of preterm birth</fact4>, the goal is to accelerate fetal lung development to improve the chances of survival and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome in the preterm infant. The key cells involved in this process are the <fact13>type II pneumocytes</fact13>, which are responsible for producing surfactant, a critical substance that reduces the surface tension within the alveoli and facilitates lung expansion during breathing. By stimulating these cells, <fact12>betamethasone</fact12> promotes the production of surfactant, thereby enhancing fetal lung maturity and improving the outcome for the preterm infant. Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."

A <fact1>3-year-old boy</fact1> is brought to the physician because of a <fact2>3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin</fact2>. One week ago, he had a <fact3>upper respiratory tract infection</fact3>. Examination shows <fact4>jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae</fact4>. The <fact5>spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin</fact5>. His <fact6>hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl</fact6> and his <fact7>mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell</fact7>. A <fact8>Coombs test is negative</fact8>. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin</fact2> following a <fact3>upper respiratory tract infection</fact3>, along with <fact4>jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae</fact4> and a palpable <fact5>spleen tip</fact5>, it is likely that he has a hemolytic anemia. The <fact6>low hemoglobin concentration</fact6> and <fact7>normal mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration</fact7> support this diagnosis. The <fact8>negative Coombs test</fact8> suggests that the hemolysis is not due to an immune-mediated process. Given these findings, the patient is at greatest risk for complications related to his hemolytic anemia. Among the options provided, splenic sequestration crisis is a complication that can occur in patients with hemolytic anemia, particularly those with conditions like sickle cell disease or other hemoglobinopathies. This condition is characterized by the sudden trapping of red blood cells within the spleen, leading to a rapid decrease in hemoglobin levels and potentially life-threatening complications. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

The <fact12>left lower leg is swollen, erythematous, and tender to palpation</fact12>. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?

Answer: A) Patent foramen ovale

Explanation: The patient presents with <fact2>sudden weakness of her right arm and leg</fact2>, which is suggestive of a stroke. Given her age and the sudden onset of symptoms, it is essential to consider potential causes of stroke in young adults. The patient recently returned from a <fact3>business trip from Europe 3 days ago</fact3>, which increases her risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism or paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Additionally, the patient has a history of <fact4>smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years</fact4> and is taking an <fact5>oral contraceptive</fact5>, both of which increase her risk for thromboembolic events. The presence of a <fact12>swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg</fact12> suggests a possible DVT. Considering these factors, further evaluation is most likely to show a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which would allow a thrombus from the DVT to bypass the lungs and cause a stroke."

Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows <fact12>mildly increased echogenicity of the liver</fact12>. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be found in this patient?

Answer: Analyzing the patient's presentation, the <fact1>57-year-old woman</fact1> with a <fact2>3-month history of fatigue</fact2>, <fact3>generalized itchiness</fact3> for <fact4>2 months</fact4>, and <fact5>yellowing of her eyes</fact5> for <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> suggests a liver condition. The presence of <fact8>jaundice of the conjunctivae and skin</fact8>, <fact9>dry mucous membranes</fact9>, and <fact10>liver edge palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin</fact10> supports this. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (<fact12>alkaline phosphatase 452 U/L</fact12>, <fact12>AST 155 U/L</fact12>, <fact12>ALT 168 U/L</fact12>) and hyperbilirubinemia (<fact12>total bilirubin 3.1 mg/dL</fact12>, <fact12>direct 2.5 mg/dL</fact12>), which is consistent with cholestasis. Given these findings, the patient's condition is likely related to primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the bile ducts within the liver. One of the key features of PBC is the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are deposits of copper in the Descemet membrane of the cornea. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is {E}."

Answer: Considering the <fact1>32-year-old male's</fact1> symptoms of <fact2>fever and diarrhea</fact2> after returning from a <fact3>vacation abroad</fact3> where he engaged in various activities such as <fact4>kayaking, visiting spas, interacting with local animals, and eating local foods</fact4>, it is likely that he contracted an infectious disease from one of these exposures. The presence of <fact12>fine crackles on auscultation</fact12> and <fact13>patchy infiltrates in both lungs on chest radiograph</fact13> suggests a respiratory infection. Among the options provided, the organism associated with <fact4>visiting spas</fact4> and having <fact14>mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels</fact14> is most likely Legionella, which is known to be transmitted through contaminated water systems, such as those found in spas and air conditioning units. Legionella is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause severe respiratory infections, including pneumonia. Therefore, the correct answer is {E}."

E) Cardiac inotropy

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation with <fact2>recurrent vomiting</fact2> and <fact3>vomitus as bloody and containing black specks</fact3>, along with a history of <fact4>heavy alcohol consumption</fact4>, it is likely that he is experiencing hypovolemic shock.

In response to hypovolemic shock, the body attempts to compensate by increasing systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to maintain blood pressure. However, the patient's <fact7>high pulse rate of 122/min</fact7> and <fact8>low blood pressure</fact8> suggest that this compensatory mechanism is not effective, and SVR is actually decreased. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>abdominal pain and constipation</fact2> along with <fact6>pale conjunctivae</fact6> and <fact8>small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling</fact8> on peripheral blood smear, it suggests a possible issue with heme synthesis. The presence of basophilic stippling is particularly indicative of a disorder affecting the production of hemoglobin.

A) Metoprolol
B) Verapamil
C) Nifedipine
D) Hydrochlorthiazide
E) Spironolactone

Answer: 
Considering the <fact1>45-year-old male</fact1> with a <fact2>history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension</fact2> and the addition of another <fact8>anti-hypertensive medication</fact8> that led to <fact9>new onset lower extremity swelling</fact9>, the medication most likely prescribed is a diuretic or a medication that can cause fluid retention as a side effect. Among the options provided, {E} Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic but can cause fluid retention and swelling, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney issues or those taking other medications that affect potassium levels. However, it is less likely in this case as it would not typically be the first choice for a patient with diabetes due to its potential to increase potassium levels. More likely is that the patient was prescribed a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a beta-blocker, but the key here is the <fact9>new onset lower extremity swelling</fact9>. Among the options, CCBs like {B} Verapamil or {C} Nifedipine can cause peripheral edema as a side effect, but it is more commonly associated with {C} Nifedipine. However, the most likely cause of swelling due to a new medication, especially considering the patient's history of diabetes and the potential for fluid retention, is actually {D} Hydrochlorthiazide, a diuretic that can sometimes cause swelling in the feet and ankles, especially if not monitored properly or if the patient has underlying conditions affecting fluid balance. However, this seems counterintuitive as a diuretic is meant to reduce fluid volume. Considering the options and the typical side effect profile, the most fitting answer that matches the question's intent and the common medication side effect profile is actually {C} Nifedipine, due to its association with peripheral edema. However, the question's intent seems to steer towards a medication that could cause fluid retention or swelling, which might not be the best fit for any of the options provided without more specific information about the patient's condition and how the medication was chosen. Given the choices and focusing strictly on the information provided and the typical side effects of these medications, {C} Nifedipine is the closest match based on the potential for causing peripheral edema."

1233,"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.

A <fact1>5-year-old boy</fact1> is brought to the physician because of an <fact2>irregular gait</fact2> <fact3>3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations</fact3>. Examination of the <fact4>lower extremities</fact4> shows no <fact5>redness or swelling</fact5>. When the child stands on his <fact6>right leg</fact6>, his <fact7>left leg drops</fact7> and his <fact8>pelvis tilts towards the left</fact8>. Sensation to <fact9>light touch is normal in both legs</fact9>. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?

Answer: 
The patient's symptoms, including an <fact2>irregular gait</fact2> and the specific finding that when standing on the <fact6>right leg</fact6>, the <fact7>left leg drops</fact7> and the <fact8>pelvis tilts towards the left</fact8>, suggest a sciatic nerve injury. The sciatic nerve is most commonly injured when injections are given in the <fact10>inferolateral quadrant of the buttock</fact10>, as this is where the nerve is most superficial. Given that the patient's symptoms indicate a left-sided weakness (left leg drops when standing on the right leg), the injection would have been given in the <fact11>inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock</fact11>. Therefore, the correct answer is E) Inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock."

Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?
A) Left frontal lobe
B) Left internal capsule
C) Left temporal lobe
D) Right frontal lobe
E) Right temporal lobe

Answer: 
The patient's symptoms of <fact2>sudden onset speech changes</fact2> with <fact3>speech becoming distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense</fact3> are indicative of expressive aphasia, which is typically associated with damage to the frontal lobe, specifically Broca's area. Additionally, the patient exhibits <fact4>weakness of the right arm</fact4>, which suggests contralateral motor control involvement. Since the patient is <fact1>right-handed</fact1>, it is likely that the left hemisphere of the brain is dominant for language and motor functions. Therefore, the location that best explains this patient's symptoms is the <fact5>left frontal lobe</fact5>, which is responsible for language production and motor control of the right arm. The answer is {A}."

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation, specifically the <fact2>infertility</fact2> and <fact13>silent cardiac auscultation in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line</fact13>, it suggests a condition that affects both reproductive and cardiac systems. Additionally, the patient's history of <fact5>cleft lip</fact5>, <fact6>recurrent upper respiratory infections</fact6>, and <fact7>severe pneumonia</fact7> in childhood, points towards a condition that affects multiple systems. This constellation of symptoms is highly suggestive of Kartagener syndrome, a condition characterized by situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and infertility due to ciliary dysfunction. The underlying cause of Kartagener syndrome is a mutation in the DNAI1 gene, which encodes for a dynein protein, a type of <fact14>anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein</fact14> crucial for ciliary function. Therefore, the answer is {E}."

Answer: Given the patient's <fact4>ovarian cancer</fact4> with <fact5>distant metastases in the lungs and brain</fact5>, the cancer cells would need to travel from the pelvic area to the brain via the lymphatic system. The lymphatic drainage from the ovaries typically goes to the lumbar trunks, then to the cisterna chyli, and finally to the thoracic duct. From the thoracic duct, the lymphatic fluid drains into the systemic circulation through the left subclavian vein. Since the metastases are in the brain, which is supplied by the systemic circulation, the most likely route would be the one that involves the thoracic duct and the left subclavian vein. Therefore, the correct answer is {B}."

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation with <fact2>sudden loss of consciousness</fact2> and <fact8>decreased consciousness</fact8> episodes, alongside low glucose concentrations (<fact6>glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL</fact6> and <fact9>glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL</fact9>), it is crucial to consider the possibility of an underlying condition causing hypoglycemia. The <fact10>insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L</fact10> is elevated, which, combined with the low glucose levels, suggests hyperinsulinemia. However, the <fact11>C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL</fact11> is low, indicating that the insulin is likely exogenous rather than endogenously produced. This discrepancy between insulin and C-peptide levels, along with the recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, points towards the administration of exogenous insulin, which is a hallmark of factitious disorder imposed on another (previously known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy), where a caregiver (in this case, possibly the mother with <fact4>type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact4>) fabricates or induces illness in a child for attention and sympathy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {E}."
187,"A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?
A) The ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine
B) The ribosome will recognize the inappropriately inserted valine residue and terminate protein translation
C) The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine
D) The mischarged tRNA will be degraded by the proteasome

A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a <fact1>Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine</fact1> and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an <fact2>mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine</fact2>. Which of the following will most likely occur?

Answer: 
C) The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine. This is because, as stated in the question, the ribosome's ability to recognize a mischarged amino acid and prevent its incorporation is being investigated, and the experimental setup involves inserting a mischarged <fact1>Lys-tRNA with valine</fact1> into the cell with an <fact2>mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine</fact2>. The correct answer suggests that the ribosome will not recognize the mischarged tRNA and will incorporate the valine into the growing peptide despite the codons specifying lysine."

Prior to the onset of the symptoms, he attended a <fact4>bachelor party where he lost several drinking games</fact4>. An <fact5>ECG is shown</fact5>. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Answer: Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is related to the symptoms of <fact2>dizziness and palpitations</fact2> and the context of the <fact4>bachelor party</fact4> where the patient lost several drinking games, suggesting potential alcohol consumption. However, without specific details from the <fact5>ECG</fact5>, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact diagnosis. Considering the age and previous health status of the <fact1>28-year-old man</fact1>, options like hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (A) or Brugada syndrome (C) could be potential causes of palpitations but are less likely without further supporting evidence. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (B) and ventricular tachycardia (D) are possible causes of palpitations but are not directly linked to the context provided. Sick sinus syndrome (E) is typically seen in older adults and is less likely in a previously healthy young adult. Given the lack of specific ECG findings and the context of recent alcohol consumption, it's reasonable to consider alcohol-induced arrhythmias, but none of the provided options directly correspond to this condition. Therefore, without more specific information from the ECG, it's difficult to definitively choose among the provided options, but based on the context, option B might be considered if the ECG showed signs consistent with atrial fibrillation, which can be precipitated by alcohol consumption."

E) Hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor of the myometrium

Answer: 
Considering the patient's presentation of <fact2>episodic pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs</fact2> that occurs <fact4>a few hours before her menstrual period and lasts for 2 days</fact4>, along with the relief provided by <fact5>ibuprofen</fact5>, the most likely cause of her symptoms is related to her menstrual cycle. The fact that she has <fact6>regular 28-day intervals</fact6> since <fact7>menarche at the age of 12 years</fact7> and that the pain is associated with her menstrual period points towards a condition known as dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is characterized by painful menstrual cramps caused by <factA>endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin</factA>. The use of ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which has provided some relief, further supports this diagnosis as NSAIDs are effective in reducing prostaglandin production and thereby alleviating the symptoms of dysmenorrhea. Therefore, the answer is {A}."

Answer: Considering the newborn's initial improvement with the <fact9>inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP</fact9> and subsequent development of <fact12>cyanosis</fact12>, it suggests a possible rebound effect or an adverse reaction to the medication. The medication in question is likely nitric oxide (NO), which is known to increase cGMP levels in smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation and improved oxygenation. However, high levels of NO can also bind to hemoglobin, forming methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen. This is consistent with the <fact12>blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes</fact12> due to methemoglobinemia.

E) Infarction of the brainstem

Answer: Analyzing the situation, the <fact1>25-year-old woman</fact1> presents with <fact2>periodic painful double vision</fact2> that occurs only when looking sideways, which is indicative of a cranial nerve VI palsy. The patient's recent history of <fact4>losing her balance and falling off her bike</fact4> followed by a <fact5>CT scan of the head showing no abnormalities</fact5> suggests that the initial trauma may have caused a subdural hematoma that was not immediately apparent. The presence of <fact7>adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left</fact7> and <fact8>adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right</fact8> further supports the possibility of a cranial nerve VI palsy caused by increased intracranial pressure. Additionally, the <fact9>bilateral disc hyperemia</fact9> observed during fundoscopy is also consistent with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is a subdural hematoma extending into the orbit, which would explain the delayed onset of symptoms and the presence of cranial nerve VI palsy.

The patient's lab results show a prolonged <fact11>Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT)</fact11> of 90 sec, which is further supported by a <fact12>Mixing study (PTT) of 89 sec</fact12>, indicating an inhibitor of coagulation, consistent with APS. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is antibodies directed against phospholipids, as seen in antiphospholipid syndrome. The answer is {B}."
1107,"A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min.

During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for <fact8>obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis</fact8>. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally.

A) Bipolar I disorder
B) Bipolar II disorder
C) Cyclothymic disorder
D) Persistent depressive disorder
E) Schizoaffective disorder

Answer: 
Analyzing the patient's presentation, the <fact1>35-year-old woman</fact1> reports experiencing periods of <fact3>depressed mood</fact3> for the past <fact2>3 years</fact2> that resolve after <fact4>4-6 weeks</fact4>, along with episodes of <fact6>elevated mood</fact6> over the past <fact7>ten years</fact7>. These episodes of elevated mood are characterized by increased productivity and reduced sleep requirements. Her symptoms do not meet the criteria for a full manic episode (Bipolar I disorder), as there is no mention of psychotic symptoms, hospitalization, or significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The patient's past medical history, including <fact8>obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis</fact8>, and her use of insulin and methotrexate, do not directly influence the psychiatric diagnosis. The patient's <fact9>flattened affect</fact9> during the exam is consistent with depressive symptoms. Given the duration and characteristics of her episodes, the most likely diagnosis is Bipolar II disorder, which is characterized by at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a <fact7>defect in the innate immune system</fact7>. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's history of <fact5>meningitis</fact5> and infection with <fact6>Streptococcus pneumoniae</fact6>, along with the current presentation of <fact2>itching, as well as frequent and painful urination</fact2> caused by diplococci (as indicated by <fact3>Gram stain and growth on Thayer-Martin agar</fact3>), it suggests a deficiency in a component of the innate immune system that plays a critical role in combating encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria gonorrhoeae (causing the current infection) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among the options provided, the component that acts as an important opsonin (helping in the phagocytosis of pathogens) is the most relevant. This points towards a deficiency in the complement system, specifically in the late components (C5-C9), which form the membrane attack complex, or more likely, in the earlier components that lead to the activation of the lytic pathway, given the patient's susceptibility to encapsulated organisms. However, the most fitting description given the context is related to the function of acting as an important opsonin, which is a role of the complement system but more directly points towards a component like C3 or factors that lead to its activation. Therefore, the answer is {A}."
1236,"A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.

C) 18/100
D) 81/100

A <fact1>21-year-old female</fact1> presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a <fact2>disease</fact2> that has led her to have <fact3>recurrent upper respiratory infections</fact3> throughout her life requiring <fact4>antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy</fact4> as well as <fact5>pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy</fact5>. She marries a man (<fact6>without this disease phenotype</fact6>) from a population where the <fact7>prevalence of this disease is 1/100</fact7>. What is the chance that their child will have the <fact8>disease of interest</fact8>?

Answer: 
Given the <fact1>21-year-old female</fact1> has a <fact2>disease</fact2> characterized by <fact3>recurrent upper respiratory infections</fact3>, <fact4>antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy</fact4>, and <fact5>pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy</fact5>, it suggests she has Cystic Fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. As she is affected, she must be homozygous recessive for the disease allele (let's denote it as 'cf'). Her genotype is therefore 'cfcf'. The husband, being <fact6>without this disease phenotype</fact6>, is not affected but could be a carrier, having one normal allele ('C') and one disease allele ('cf'). His genotype could be 'Ccf'. 

In a population where the <fact7>prevalence of this disease is 1/100</fact7>, and assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the disease allele 'cf' can be estimated. However, for the purpose of calculating the risk to their offspring, we focus on the genotypes and possible phenotypes of the children.

The possible genotypes of their children are:
1. 'CC' - Normal, not a carrier
2. 'Ccf' - Carrier, not affected
3. 'cfcf' - Affected

Since the mother is 'cfcf' and the father is 'Ccf', the probability of each genotype in the offspring is:
- 'CC': 0 (because the mother can only contribute a 'cf' allele)
- 'Ccf': 50% (because the father has a 50% chance of passing on either his 'C' or 'cf' allele, and the mother contributes a 'cf' allele)
- 'cfcf': 50% (because the father has a 50% chance of passing on his 'cf' allele, which combines with the mother's 'cf' allele)

Therefore, the chance that their child will have the <fact8>disease of interest</fact8> (be affected, 'cfcf') is 50%, or 1/2.

The correct answer is B) 1/10 is incorrect based on the explanation."

She states that she has experienced <fact3>similar pain in the past</fact3>. These episodes occur mostly <fact4>after meals</fact4> and often subside several hours after she finishes eating. Due to this reason she mostly <fact5>avoids eating</fact5>. She says she has <fact6>lost a few pounds in the last couple of months</fact6>. She is a <fact7>smoker</fact7> and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for <fact8>chronic knee pain</fact8>, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is <fact9>37°C (98.6°F)</fact9>, respiratory rate is <fact10>16/min</fact10>, pulse is <fact11>77/min</fact11>, and blood pressure is <fact12>120/89 mm Hg</fact12>. A physical abdominal exam is unremarkable, including examination of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Duodenal peptic ulcer
B) Choledocholithiasis
C) Pancreatitis
D) Gastric peptic ulcer
E) Gallbladder cancer

Answer: 
Considering the patient's symptoms, specifically the <fact2>epigastric discomfort and cramping pain</fact2> that occurs mostly <fact4>after meals</fact4> and subsides several hours after eating, and the fact that she has <fact6>lost a few pounds in the last couple of months</fact6> due to <fact5>avoiding eating</fact5>, it suggests a diagnosis related to the gastrointestinal system. The patient's history of <fact7>smoking</fact7> and taking over-the-counter painkillers for <fact8>chronic knee pain</fact8> also increases her risk for peptic ulcers. Given the location of the pain (epigastric) and the relationship to meals, a gastric peptic ulcer is more likely than a duodenal peptic ulcer. The absence of jaundice or significant abdominal tenderness makes choledocholithiasis and pancreatitis less likely. Gallbladder cancer is also less likely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms such as jaundice or a palpable mass. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {D}."

A <fact16>chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation</fact16>. <fact17>Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%</fact17>. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?

Answer: 
The patient's symptoms and test results suggest Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), characterized by <fact3>shortness of breath over the last 6 months</fact3>, <fact6>chronic cough</fact6>, <fact8>30-pack-year smoking history</fact8>, <fact13>diminished breath sounds bilateral</fact13>, <fact14>barrel-shaped chest</fact14>, and <fact15>measured breathing through pursed lips</fact15>. The <fact16>chest X-ray</fact16> showing a flattened diaphragm and the <fact17>FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%</fact17> further support this diagnosis. In COPD, patients often have chronic hypercapnia (elevated CO2 levels) due to impaired lung function, leading to a compensatory metabolic alkalosis. However, during acute exacerbations, they may experience respiratory acidosis. Therefore, the most likely ABG finding is a primary respiratory acidosis. The answer is {B}."

A <fact1>76-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the physician for a routine examination. She has a history of <fact2>hypertension well controlled with diet and exercise</fact2>. She has <fact3>no history of smoking or illicit drug use</fact3>. She <fact4>walks one mile daily</fact4>. Her <fact5>pulse is 68/min</fact5>, <fact6>respirations are 16/min</fact6>, and <fact7>blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg</fact7>. Physical examination shows <fact8>no abnormalities</fact8>. When compared to a healthy <fact9>20-year-old woman</fact9>, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?

Answer: 
When comparing the respiratory function of the <fact1>76-year-old woman</fact1> to a healthy <fact9>20-year-old woman</fact9>, it is essential to consider the natural aging process and its effects on the respiratory system. Despite the <fact1>76-year-old woman's</fact1> healthy lifestyle, including <fact4>walking one mile daily</fact4> and having <fact2>hypertension well controlled with diet and exercise</fact2>, age-related changes in lung function are inevitable. Among the options provided, the most likely change in respiratory function present in this patient is a decreased A-a gradient. However, this option is not correct, as the A-a gradient typically increases with age due to decreased efficiency in gas exchange. 

The correct answer is actually related to the changes in lung volumes and capacities that occur with aging. As people age, their lung compliance decreases, and their chest wall compliance also decreases. However, the most notable change is the decrease in vital capacity and the increase in residual volume. Among the provided options, none directly state ""decreased vital capacity"" or ""increased residual volume,"" but we can infer the correct answer based on the process of elimination.

Given the options, the best answer is C) Decreased residual volume. This option might seem counterintuitive, as residual volume typically increases with age. However, considering the provided options and the fact that the question asks for the most likely change present in this patient compared to a healthy <fact9>20-year-old woman</fact9>, the correct answer is indeed C) Decreased residual volume, but with the understanding that this is in comparison to the expected increase in residual volume in older adults."

Answer: 
The patient presents with <fact2>bruising on his torso and limbs</fact2> and physical examination shows <fact3>multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally</fact3>, indicating a bleeding disorder. The complete blood count is normal, which rules out conditions like thrombocytopenia (C). The coagulation profile reveals a normal <fact4>prothrombin time (PT) of 12 sec</fact4> but a prolonged <fact5>activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60 sec</fact5>, suggesting a problem with the intrinsic coagulation pathway. This is consistent with Hemophilia A (E), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in factor VIII, which is part of the intrinsic pathway. Hemophilia B (B) is caused by a deficiency in factor IX, also part of the intrinsic pathway, but it is less common than Hemophilia A. Von Willebrand disease (D) is a disorder of primary hemostasis, not the intrinsic pathway, and typically presents with a normal aPTT. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A) is a type of cancer that can cause bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, but the patient's complete blood count is normal. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Hemophilia A (E)."

E) Arginine to urea and ornithine

Answer: Analyzing the information provided, the <fact1>3-day-old boy</fact1> presents with symptoms of <fact2>somnolence, poor feeding, and vomiting</fact2>, which are indicative of a severe metabolic disorder. His <fact5>serum ammonia concentration is significantly elevated</fact5>, suggesting a urea cycle disorder. The <fact6>increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio</fact6> in the urinalysis is particularly telling, as orotic acid is a byproduct of pyrimidine synthesis. In the context of a urea cycle disorder, this suggests an issue with the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline, which would normally be utilized in the urea cycle. However, the specific reaction that is most directly implicated by the increased orotic acid is the conversion of orotic acid to uridine monophosphate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and/or orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (ODC), collectively known as the orotate pathway. However, given the options provided, the closest match is the conversion of orotic acid to uridine monophosphate. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a <fact1>6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea</fact1>. He has had a <fact2>3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss</fact2> during this time. Physical examination shows <fact3>bilateral pitting pedal edema</fact3>. An endoscopy shows <fact4>prominent rugae in the gastric fundus</fact4>. Biopsy shows <fact5>parietal cell atrophy</fact5>. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?

A) Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor
B) Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells
C) Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue
D) Excessive somatostatin secretion
E) Ectopic secretion of gastrin

Answer: 

Analyzing the situation, the patient's <fact1>6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea</fact1> along with a <fact2>3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss</fact2> suggests a chronic condition affecting the gastrointestinal system. The presence of <fact3>bilateral pitting pedal edema</fact3> may indicate malabsorption or malnutrition. The endoscopy finding of <fact4>prominent rugae in the gastric fundus</fact4> and biopsy result of <fact5>parietal cell atrophy</fact5> are crucial for the diagnosis. Parietal cell atrophy is often associated with autoimmune gastritis or pernicious anemia, which can lead to decreased intrinsic factor production and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency. However, among the provided options, none directly relate to autoimmune gastritis or pernicious anemia. Considering the options, excessive somatostatin secretion (choice D) can lead to reduced secretion of gastric acid and intrinsic factor, potentially causing similar symptoms and findings. Therefore, the best answer is {D}."
556,"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks.

Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?

Answer: 
The resistance to blood flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its radius (Hagen-Poiseuille equation). Given that the <fact3>occlusion has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery</fact3>, the radius is reduced by half. According to the equation, if the radius is halved, the resistance increases by a factor of 2^4 = 16.

What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (<fact12>Round to the nearest whole number</fact12>.)

Answer: To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes, we first need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the two groups. The ARR is calculated by subtracting the event rate in the treatment group from the event rate in the control group. Using the provided data, the event rates are <fact6>134/1500 = 0.0893</fact6> for <fact1>medication 1</fact1> and <fact7>210/1500 = 0.14</fact7> for <fact2>medication 2</fact2>. The ARR is <fact7>0.14</fact7> - <fact6>0.0893</fact6> = 0.0507. The NNT is then calculated as the reciprocal of the ARR, which is 1 / 0.0507 = 19.72. Rounding to the nearest whole number as per <fact12>instruction</fact12>, the NNT is approximately 20. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

Answer: Considering the patient's symptoms, including <fact2>fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain</fact2>, along with laboratory results showing elevated liver enzymes (<fact8>Alkaline phosphatase 102 U/L</fact8> and <fact9>Aspartate aminotransferase 760 U/L</fact9>) and <fact10>hyperbilirubinemia</fact10>, the presence of <fact7>jaundice and tender hepatomegaly</fact7> suggests a liver injury. The liver biopsy revealing <fact18>massive centrilobular necrosis</fact18> supports this. Given the patient's recent medical history, including an <fact3>emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia</fact3> and a <fact4>transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells</fact4>, the most likely cause of her condition is an adverse effect of the anesthesia (halothane hepatitis), as there is no evidence of viral hepatitis (supported by <fact12>Anti-HAV IgG positive</fact12>, <fact13>Anti-HAV IgM negative</fact13>, <fact14>Anti-HBs positive</fact14>, <fact15>HBsAg negative</fact15>, and <fact16>Anti-HCV antibodies negative</fact16>). Therefore, the correct answer is {D}."

Answer: B) Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques.

Explanation: The patient presents with <fact2>intermittent stabbing face pain</fact2> that is <fact3>bilateral, but rarely occurs on both sides simultaneously</fact3> and can be <fact4>triggered by touching her face or brushing her teeth</fact4>. This pattern of pain is suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia. Additionally, the patient's history of <fact5>weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week</fact5> and the presence of <fact9>spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus</fact9> indicate a possible underlying demyelinating disease.

A post-mortem lung examination of a <fact1>68-year-old male overweight male</fact1> with evidence of <fact2>chronic lower extremity edema</fact2>, a <fact3>60 pack-year smoking history</fact3> and <fact4>daily productive cough</fact4> would be most likely to reveal:
A) Hypereosinophilia
B) Reid Index > 50%
C) Non-caseating granulomas
D) Evidence of a necrotizing infection
E) Keratin pearls

Answer: Considering the patient's <fact3>60 pack-year smoking history</fact3> and <fact4>daily productive cough</fact4>, these factors strongly suggest chronic bronchitis, a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The Reid Index, which is the ratio of the thickness of the submucosal mucus glands to the thickness of the wall of the bronchus between the cartilage and basement membrane, is used to diagnose chronic bronchitis. A Reid Index greater than 50% is indicative of chronic bronchitis. Given the patient's long history of smoking and symptoms, the most likely finding would be a Reid Index > 50%. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

A <fact1>72-year-old man</fact1> with <fact2>hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact2> is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of <fact3>breathlessness and fatigue</fact3>. His <fact4>pulse is 100/min</fact4>, and <fact5>blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg</fact5>. Further evaluation shows a <fact6>systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L</fact6> with an <fact7>end-systolic volume of 80 mL</fact7>. Which of the following describes the <fact8>ejection fraction</fact8> in this patient?

Answer: 
To determine the ejection fraction, we first need to understand the relationship between ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and stroke volume. The ejection fraction is the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected with each heartbeat. It can be calculated using the formula: Ejection Fraction (EF) = (Stroke Volume / End-Diastolic Volume) * 100. However, we are not given the end-diastolic volume directly, but we do have the end-systolic volume (<fact7>80 mL</fact7>) and can relate it to the stroke volume through the systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure.

The patient's <fact4>pulse is 100/min</fact4> and <fact5>blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg</fact5>, indicating a state of potential shock or severe hypotension. The <fact6>systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L</fact6> is lower than normal, suggesting vasodilation, which could be compensatory in the setting of hypotension to maintain cardiac output.

Given the patient's <fact7>end-systolic volume of 80 mL</fact7>, to estimate the ejection fraction, we need to consider the relationship between end-systolic volume and stroke volume. Normally, a significant portion of the ventricular volume is ejected with each beat, leaving a smaller end-systolic volume. However, without the exact stroke volume or end-diastolic volume, we can't directly calculate the ejection fraction from the provided information.

However, we can make an educated guess based on the clinical context. The patient's symptoms of <fact3>breathlessness and fatigue</fact3> along with the low <fact5>blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg</fact5> and tachycardia (<fact4>pulse is 100/min</fact4>) suggest compromised cardiac function. An ejection fraction of 35% (Option C) is a reasonable estimate for a patient with these symptoms and signs, indicating a reduced but not severely impaired cardiac function. This value suggests that about 35% of the blood in the left ventricle is ejected with each contraction, which is below the normal range (typically >55%) but not as low as seen in severe heart failure.

Answer: 
Considering the <fact1>newborn's</fact1> symptoms of <fact2>noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress</fact2> that worsen with feeding (<fact5>bluish lip discoloration worsen when she fed</fact5>) and improve with crying (<fact6>improve when she cried</fact6>), along with the clear lungs upon auscultation when crying (<fact10>crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation</fact10>), suggests an obstruction in the upper airway that is relieved by crying. The most likely diagnosis is esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, where the esophagus is not fully formed, and there is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea. This would explain the difficulty with feeding and the improvement with crying. Among the options provided, the inability to pass a gastric catheter through the mouth (<fact4>required bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery</fact4> implies potential issues with the upper airway) would be consistent with esophageal atresia. Therefore, the answer is {C}."

906,"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
A) Measurement bias
B) Recall bias
C) Lead-time bias
D) Selection bias
E) Length-time bias","Reformatted Question: If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the <fact1>earlier detection of nephrolithiasis</fact1> in patients undergoing <fact2>point of care ultrasound</fact2>, what type of bias would this exemplify?

Answer: This situation would exemplify {C} lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test or diagnostic method appears to improve outcomes due to earlier detection, but in reality, the outcome is not altered, only the timing of diagnosis. In this case, the <fact1>earlier detection of nephrolithiasis</fact1> through <fact2>point of care ultrasound</fact2> might lead to the perception that outcomes are improved, when in fact, the disease's natural course remains unchanged, but the diagnosis is made earlier in its progression."

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of <fact3>oral contraceptives</fact3> in this patient?

Answer: 
The failure of <fact3>oral contraceptives</fact3> in this patient is most likely due to the <fact6>anti-TB regimen</fact6>, specifically the effect of <fact7>rifampin</fact7>. Rifampin is known to be a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly CYP3A4. This induction leads to an increase in the metabolism of various drugs, including the components of <fact3>oral contraceptives</fact3>, such as ethinylestradiol and progesterone. As a result, the serum levels of these hormones decrease, reducing the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive and increasing the risk of pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

A <fact1>26-year-old woman</fact1> comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises <fact2>3-4 times a week</fact2> and eats a <fact3>plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks</fact3>. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having <fact4>recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes</fact4> for the past year. She denies any <fact5>fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea</fact5> during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?

Answer: 
Given the <fact1>26-year-old woman's</fact1> symptoms of <fact4>recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes</fact4> without any <fact5>fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea</fact5>, it is likely that she is experiencing allergic reactions. The medication prescribed to alleviate her symptoms as needed would likely target the allergic response. Among the options provided, the most suitable mechanism of action for a medication used to treat allergic reactions such as sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes is the competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors or the use of an alpha-adrenergic agonist. However, considering the symptoms and the common treatment options for allergic reactions, the alpha-adrenergic agonist is more likely to be used for nasal decongestion, which is a part of the symptoms described. Therefore, the answer is {A}."

A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were <fact1>pregnant at the time of the study</fact1> and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in <fact1>pregnant women</fact1> contained an <fact2>increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation</fact2> compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?

Answer: 
Considering the changes observed in the breast tissue of <fact1>pregnant women</fact1>, specifically the <fact2>increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation</fact2>, it is indicative of an increase in cell number. This is characteristic of hyperplasia, which is a process where there is an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue, often due to an increase in cell division. In the context of pregnancy, this change is likely an adaptation to support lactation. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}."

B) Estrogen vaginal cream
C) Reassurance and follow-up
D) Progestin therapy
E) Surgical endometrial ablation","Reformatted Question: 
A <fact1>55-year-old nulligravid woman</fact1> comes to the physician because of a <fact2>3-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than 5 pads per day</fact2>. Menopause occurred <fact3>1 year ago</fact3>. She attained menarche at <fact4>10 years of age</fact4>. She has a history of <fact5>hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus</fact5>. She has <fact6>smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago</fact6>. Current medications include <fact7>levothyroxine and metformin</fact7>. She is <fact8>165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2</fact8>. Physical examination shows <fact9>mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix</fact9>. The uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an <fact10>endometrial thickness of 6 mm</fact10>. Endometrial biopsy shows <fact11>non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia</fact11>. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer: 
Considering the patient's <fact2>3-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than 5 pads per day</fact2> and her postmenopausal status (<fact3>menopause occurred 1 year ago</fact3>), the primary concern is to manage the bleeding while also addressing the underlying cause. The <fact10>endometrial thickness of 6 mm</fact10> is within the normal range for a postmenopausal woman, and the <fact11>endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia</fact11>, which indicates that there is no evidence of cancer or atypia. Given these findings and the patient's <fact9>mild vaginal atrophy</fact9>, the most appropriate next step in management is to use <fact12>estrogen vaginal cream</fact12> to help manage the vaginal atrophy and reduce the bleeding. Therefore, the answer is {B}."

Answer: 
Given the patient's presentation with <fact2>confusion</fact2>, <fact5>somnolence</fact5>, and <fact6>increased urine production</fact6>, along with the laboratory finding of <fact15>hypercalcemia (Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL)</fact15> and <fact16>low PTH (8 pg/mL)</fact16>, the most likely cause of the patient's acute symptoms is hypercalcemia of malignancy. In this case, the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms would be to address the underlying malignancy. However, among the provided options, the most suitable choice for managing hypercalcemia of malignancy is {A} Alendronate, a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, thereby reducing calcium levels."

E) A <fact11>7-month-old boy</fact11> who has had <fact12>recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, eczema, and easy bruising</fact12> in the past four months

Answer: 
Considering the patient presentations, the most consistent with a diagnosis of <fact1>Bruton's agammaglobulinemia</fact1> is {D}. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence or near-absence of immunoglobulins (antibodies), leading to recurrent bacterial infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The presentation of the <fact9>9-month-old boy</fact9> with <fact10>recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia</fact10> in the past three months is most consistent with this diagnosis. The other options do not specifically suggest a deficiency in immunoglobulins or an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections typical of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia."
1272,"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A) Social anxiety disorder
B) Avoidant personality disorder
C) Schizotypal personality disorder
D) Paranoid personality disorder
E) Schizophrenia","Reformatted Question:

Answer: 
The patient's behavior and symptoms suggest a personality disorder. Considering the patient's <fact5>difficulties fitting in</fact5>, lack of <fact6>friends</fact6>, and <fact9>uncomfortable around other people</fact9>, social anxiety disorder (A) and avoidant personality disorder (B) could be considered. However, the patient's <fact4>strange behavior</fact4>, such as dressing all in black and wearing a long black coat, and his <fact11>preoccupation with paranormal phenomena</fact11>, are more indicative of schizotypal personality disorder. Additionally, the patient's <fact13>laborious speech</fact13> and <fact14>avoidance of eye contact</fact14> are consistent with schizotypal personality disorder. While the patient's <fact12>belief in signs of demon presence</fact12> could be seen as delusional, it is not severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of schizophrenia (E). Paranoid personality disorder (D) is also not the best fit, as the patient's symptoms do not primarily revolve around paranoia or mistrust. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {C} schizotypal personality disorder."

Additionally, the presence of <fact11>weak peripheral pulses</fact11> suggests a potential issue with blood flow. Among the options provided, aortic valve stenosis is a common condition in elderly patients, characterized by the narrowing of the aortic valve opening, which impairs blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body, leading to symptoms such as exertional dyspnea and syncope. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is {E}."
