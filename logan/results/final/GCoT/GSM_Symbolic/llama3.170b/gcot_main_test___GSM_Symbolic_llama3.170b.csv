How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d10 die</fact1> is 7/10, since there are 7 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100, since there are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an odd number twice in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: (7/10) - (25/100) = (70/100) - (25/100) = 45/100.

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is 2/4 = 1/2, since there are two numbers greater than 2 (3 and 4) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 1/2 (there are two odd numbers, 1 and 3, out of a total of 4 possible outcomes), and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is 3/4, since there are 3 numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, and 4) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4, since there are 2 odd numbers (1 and 3) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes, and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Gabriel is rolling a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> is 19/20, since there are 19 numbers greater than 1 on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. The probability of rolling an odd number is 10/20 = 1/2, since there are 10 odd numbers on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. To find the difference in probabilities, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 19/20 - 1/4 = 19/20 - 5/20 = 14/20 = 7/10. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (7/10) * 100 = 70%. Therefore, it is 70% more likely that Gabriel rolls a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 3</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 3</fact2> is 3/6 = 1/2, since there are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6) out of a total of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2 (there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes), and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Noah rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 3</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: There are <fact1>6</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Of these, 4, 5, and 6 are <fact2>numbers greater than 3</fact2>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%. The probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%, since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of the 6 possible outcomes. To roll <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>, Umar must roll an even number on the first roll (50% chance) and then roll another even number on the second roll (also 50% chance). The probability of both of these events happening is 50% * 50% = 25%.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Santiago is rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 10</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. Of these, <fact2>10</fact2> are greater than 10. So the probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 10</fact2> is <fact2>10</fact2>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. There are <fact1>10</fact1> odd numbers on a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling an odd number is <fact1>10</fact1>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Therefore, the difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

117,Gabriel is rolling a d8 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Gabriel is rolling a <fact1>d8 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> is 5/8, since there are 5 numbers greater than 2 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> is (4/8) * (4/8) = 16/64 = 1/4, since there are 4 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes, and the die is rolled twice.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 5/8 - 1/4 = 5/8 - 2/8 = 3/8.

To express this as a percentage, we divide 3/8 by 1/4 (the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row) and multiply by 100: (3/8) / (1/4) * 100 = 3/2 * 100 = 150%.

Therefore, it is 150% more likely that Gabriel rolls a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>.

The answer is {150}."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> is 19/20, since there are 19 numbers greater than 1 out of a total of 20 numbers.

To roll <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>, Leon must first roll an even number, which has a probability of 1/2, and then roll another even number, which also has a probability of 1/2. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 19/20 - 1/4 = 0.95 - 0.25 = 0.7.

To express this difference as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.7 × 100 = 70%.

Therefore, it is 70% more likely that Leon rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 4</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 4</fact2> on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> is 15/20 = 3/4, since there are 15 numbers greater than 4 on a d20 die. 

The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> on a <fact1>d20 die</fact1> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since there is a 1/2 chance of rolling an even number on a d20 die, and this chance is independent for each roll.

To find the difference in these probabilities, we can subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 4: 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4 = 1/2.

To express this difference as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we note that there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. 
To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we note that there are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we note that 25% is 25/25 = 1 times 25%, so it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.
The answer is {100}."
130,Wei is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Wei is rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 5</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. Of these, <fact1>20</fact1> - 5 = 15 are greater than 5. So the probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 5</fact2> is 15/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.75 or 75%. There are <fact1>20</fact1>/2 = 10 even numbers on a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. So the probability of rolling an even number is 10/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%. The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%. Therefore, the difference in probability between rolling a <fact2>number greater than 5</fact2> and rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> is 75% - 25% = 50%."
131,Kai is rolling a d4 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Kai is rolling a <fact1>d4 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is 2/4 = 1/2, since there are two numbers greater than 2 (3 and 4) out of a total of 4 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3> on a <fact1>d4 die</fact1> is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, since the probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 1/2 (there are two even numbers, 2 and 4, out of a total of 4 possible outcomes), and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (1/4) * 100 = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Kai rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 6</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: There are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a die. Of these, <fact2>6</fact2> are greater than 6 (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is 6/<fact1>12</fact1> = 0.5. There are <fact1>6</fact1> odd numbers on a 12-sided die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 6/<fact1>12</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Therefore, the difference in probability is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.25 * 100% = 25%."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 10</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a twenty-sided die. Of these, <fact1>10</fact1> are greater than 10. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is <fact1>10</fact1>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number is <fact1>10</fact1>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. The difference between these probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.25 * 100% = 25%.

136,Jin is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Jin is rolling a <fact1>d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 5</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a d20 die is 14/20, since there are 14 numbers greater than 5 on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4, since there are 10 even numbers on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total, and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, we need to convert both probabilities to a common format. We can convert 14/20 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 14/20 = 0.7. We can convert 1/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1/4 = 0.25.

The difference in probability is 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.45. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: 0.45 * 100 = 45%.

Therefore, it is 45% more likely that Jin rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

The answer is {45}."
137,Ali is rolling a 10-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Ali is rolling a <fact1>10-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 1</fact2> on a <fact1>10-sided die</fact1> is 9/10, since there are 9 numbers greater than 1 (2-10) out of a total of 10 possible outcomes.

To roll <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>, Ali must first roll an even number, which has a probability of 5/10 (since there are 5 even numbers out of 10 possible outcomes). If he succeeds, he must then roll another even number, which again has a probability of 5/10. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (5/10) × (5/10) = 25/100 = 1/4.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 1: 9/10 - 1/4 = 36/40 - 10/40 = 26/40 = 13/20.

To express this as a percentage, we divide 13 by 20 and multiply by 100: (13 ÷ 20) × 100 = 65%.

Therefore, it is 65% more likely that Ali rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 2</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: There are <fact1>4</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a four-sided die: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Of these, <fact2>2</fact2> of the outcomes are greater than 2: 3 and 4. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/<fact1>4</fact1> = 0.5. There are <fact1>2</fact1> odd numbers on a four-sided die: 1 and 3. So the probability of rolling an odd number is 2/<fact1>4</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Therefore, the difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.25 * 100% = 25%. The answer is {25}."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a <fact2>number greater than 4</fact2> than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?

Answer: The probability of rolling a <fact2>number greater than 4</fact2> on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> is 3/8, since there are 3 numbers (5, 6, 7, 8) greater than 4 out of a total of 8 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> on a <fact1>d8 die</fact1> is (4/8) * (4/8) = 16/64 = 1/4, since there are 4 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7) out of a total of 8 possible outcomes, and the probability of rolling an odd number twice in a row is the product of the individual probabilities.

To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 4: 3/8 - 1/4 = 3/8 - 2/8 = 1/8.

To express this difference as a percentage, divide by the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 and multiply by 100: (1/8) / (3/8) * 100 = (1/3) * 100 = 33.33%.

The kernels increase to <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate in the next 18 seconds</fact3>, but in the final <fact4>18 seconds</fact4>, the popping slows down to <fact5>half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact5>. After Isabella takes the pan off the heat, <fact6>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 18 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact6>. How many pieces of popcorn does Isabella have to eat?

Answer: In the first 18 seconds, <fact1>20 kernels popped</fact1>. In the next 18 seconds, <fact2>3 times that amount</fact2> popped, which is <fact1>20</fact1> * <fact2>3</fact2> = 60 kernels. In the next 18 seconds, the kernels increased to <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, which is <fact1>20</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 80 kernels. In the final <fact4>18 seconds</fact4>, the popping slowed down to <fact5>half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact5>, which is <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>20</fact1> / <fact5>2</fact5> = 40 kernels.

After Ali takes the pot off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 28 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>. How many pieces of popcorn does Ali have to eat?

Answer: In the <fact1>first 28 seconds of cooking</fact1>, 50 kernels popped. 
In the <fact2>next 28 seconds</fact2>, 2 * <fact1>50</fact1> = 100 kernels popped. 
In the <fact3>next 28 seconds</fact3>, 4 * <fact1>50</fact1> = 200 kernels popped. 
In the <fact4>final 28 seconds</fact4>, half of the <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3> is 200 / 2 = 100 kernels popped. 
From the residual heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 28 seconds of cooking</fact5> also popped, so 100 / 4 = 25 kernels popped. 
In total, Ali has 50 + 100 + 200 + 100 + 25 = 475 pieces of popcorn to eat.
The answer is {475}."

If his farm truck can carry <fact5>160 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To find the total weight of feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together. 
The weight of hay is <fact1>six 6-kg boxes</fact1> = 6 * 6 = 36 kg.
The weight of carrots is <fact2>eleven 5-kg bags</fact2> = 11 * 5 = 55 kg.
The weight of wheats is <fact3>thirty five 39-kg packs</fact3> = 35 * 39 = 1365 kg.
The weight of oats is <fact4>sixteen 19-kg sacks</fact4> = 16 * 19 = 304 kg.
The total weight of feed is 36 + 55 + 1365 + 304 = 1760 kg.
To find the number of trips, we need to divide the total weight of feed by the weight that the farm truck can carry at a time, which is <fact5>160 kgs</fact5>. 
So, the number of trips is 1760 / 160 = 11. 
Since we cannot have a fraction of a trip, we round up to the nearest whole number. 
Therefore, the farmer needs to make 11 trips to transport all the feed."

If his farm truck can carry <fact5>140 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, calculate the total weight of all the feed. The total weight of the wheats is <fact1>4 boxes</fact1> * <fact1>5 kg/box</fact1> = 20 kg. The total weight of the beets is <fact2>14 bags</fact2> * <fact2>8 kg/bag</fact2> = 112 kg. The total weight of the oats is <fact3>32 packs</fact3> * <fact3>39 kg/pack</fact3> = 1248 kg. The total weight of the hay is <fact4>20 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>15 kg/sack</fact4> = 300 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the feed is 20 + 112 + 1248 + 300 = 1680 kg. To find the number of trips, divide the total weight of all the feed by the weight that the truck can carry per trip, which is <fact5>140 kg</fact5>.

On the sidewalk, Mia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Mia walks <fact2>12 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and it takes her <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> to do so, her speed on the beach is <fact2>12 kilometers</fact2>/<fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = 0.2 kilometers per minute. Since she walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kilometers per minute. Since she walks <fact3>12 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>, it will take her <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3>/0.4 kilometers per minute = 30 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1> is <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> + 30 minutes = 90 minutes."

On the sidewalk, Daphne walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Daphne walks <fact1>28 kilometers</fact1> every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>16 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Daphne walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Daphne walks on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>3x</fact4> kilometers per minute. We know that the time it takes her to walk on the beach is <fact5>64 minutes</fact5>, and the distance she covers is <fact2>16 kilometers</fact2>. So, we can set up the equation: 64x = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 16/64 = 1/4 kilometers per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. The distance she covers is <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3>, and her speed is <fact4>3x = 3/4</fact4> kilometers per minute. So, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 12 / (3/4) = 16 minutes.

If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Nadia walks <fact1>26 kilometers</fact1> every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>10 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>16 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Nadia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer</fact1> walk, in minutes?

Answer: Since Nadia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk than on the beach, the time it takes her to walk a certain distance on the sidewalk is 1/4 the time it takes her to walk the same distance on the beach. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, then it takes her 60/4 = 15 minutes to walk the same distance on the sidewalk. We know that Nadia walks <fact2>10 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>16 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Since it takes her <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> to walk <fact2>10 kilometers on the beach</fact2>, it takes her 60/10 = 6 minutes to walk 1 kilometer on the beach. Therefore, it takes her 6 * 16 = 96 minutes to walk <fact3>16 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. However, we already know that it takes her 15 minutes to walk the same distance on the sidewalk, so we can set up a proportion to find the actual distance she walks on the sidewalk in 15 minutes: 16 km / 96 min = x km / 15 min. Solving for x, we get x = 2.5 km. Since it takes her 15 minutes to walk 2.5 km on the sidewalk, it takes her 15 * 4 = 60 minutes to walk the same distance on the beach. We already know that it takes her <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> to walk <fact2>10 kilometers on the beach</fact2>, so we can find the total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer</fact1> walk by adding the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk and the beach: 60 + 96 = 156 minutes. However, we already know that it takes her 15 minutes to walk 2.5 km on the sidewalk, and she walks a total of <fact3>16 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>, so we can find the total time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk by multiplying the time it takes her to walk 2.5 km by 16/2.5: 15 * 16/2.5 = 96 minutes. We already know that it takes her <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> to walk <fact2>10 kilometers on the beach</fact2>, so we can find the total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer</fact1> walk by adding the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk and the beach: 96 + 60 = 156 minutes."

If <fact5>57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>35-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Gabrielle's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute, as stated in <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. 

We know that Gabrielle walks <fact2>19 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and she spends <fact5>57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. So, her speed on the beach is 19 miles / 57 minutes = x miles per minute. 

Now, we can calculate her speed on the sidewalk, which is 2x miles per minute. We also know that Gabrielle walks <fact3>16 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. So, the time she spends walking on the sidewalk is 16 miles / (2 * 19/57) miles per minute = 16 * 57 / (2 * 19) = 24 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Gabrielle to complete the entire <fact1>35-mile walk</fact1> is the sum of the time she spends walking on the beach and the time she spends walking on the sidewalk, which is <fact5>57 minutes</fact5> + 24 minutes = 81 minutes.

If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>21-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Xena's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>5x miles per minute</fact4>. We know that Xena walks <fact2>11 miles on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>10 miles on the sidewalk</fact3>. Since distance = speed * time, we can set up the following equations:

On the beach: 11 miles = x * <fact5>66 minutes</fact5>
On the sidewalk: 10 miles = 5x * t, where t is the time spent walking on the sidewalk

From the first equation, we can solve for x: x = 11 miles / <fact5>66 minutes</fact5> = 1/6 miles per minute.

Now, we can substitute x into the second equation: 10 miles = 5(1/6) * t
t = 10 miles / (5/6) = 12 minutes

So, Xena spends 12 minutes walking on the sidewalk. To find the total time, we add the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk: <fact5>66 minutes</fact5> + 12 minutes = 78 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Ananya walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer</fact1> walk, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Ananya's speed on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2x</fact4> kilometers per minute. We know that Ananya spends <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> walking on the beach, so the distance she covers on the beach is <fact5>44</fact5> * x = <fact2>11</fact2> kilometers. Solving for x, we get x = <fact2>11</fact2> / <fact5>44</fact5> = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes for Ananya to walk on the sidewalk. The distance she covers on the sidewalk is <fact3>15</fact3> kilometers, and her speed is <fact4>2x</fact4> = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 kilometers per minute.

If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>35-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Uma walks on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, according to <fact4>the information given</fact4>, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x kilometers per minute. We know that <fact2>the distance she walks on the beach</fact2> is 17 kilometers, and <fact5>the time she spends walking on the beach</fact5> is 51 minutes. So, we can set up the equation 17 = 51x to represent the relationship between distance, speed, and time on the beach. Solving for x, we get x = 17/51 = 1/3 kilometers per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Emma walks <fact1>27 miles</fact1> every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>16 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Emma walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Emma walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>4x miles per minute</fact4>. We know that the time it takes for Emma to walk on the beach is <fact5>66 minutes</fact5>, and the distance she covers is <fact2>11 miles</fact2>. So, we can set up the equation: 66x = 11. Solving for x, we get x = 11/66 = 1/6 miles per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes for Emma to walk on the sidewalk. The distance she covers is <fact3>16 miles</fact3>, and her speed is 4x = 4(1/6) = 2/3 miles per minute. So, the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk is 16 / (2/3) = 24 minutes.

If <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>34-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote Zahra's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>3x miles per minute</fact4>. We know that Zahra walks <fact2>16 miles on the beach</fact2> and it takes her <fact5>64 minutes</fact5> to do so. Therefore, her speed on the beach is <fact2>16 miles</fact2> / <fact5>64 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute. This means that her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>3 * 0.25 miles per minute</fact4> = 0.75 miles per minute. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for Zahra to walk <fact3>18 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 0.75 miles per minute. The time is <fact3>18 miles</fact3> / 0.75 miles per minute = 24 minutes.

Answer: James watched <fact2>4-hour episodes</fact2> on <fact1>Thursday and Friday</fact1>, so he watched 2 * <fact2>4 hours</fact2> = 8 hours of TV on those nights. On <fact5>Sunday</fact5>, he watched a <fact2>4-hour episode</fact2> and a <fact6>45-minute show</fact6>, so he watched 4 + 0.75 = 4.75 hours of TV that night.

Answer: Luca watched 5 hours of TV on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 5 + 5 = 10 hours of TV on the weekend. On Tuesday, he watched 2 hours + 15 minutes = 2.25 hours of TV. On Wednesday, he watched 5 * 2 hours = 10 hours of TV. So, in total, Luca watched 10 + 2.25 + 10 = 22.25 hours of TV on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This means that he watched 24 - 22.25 = 1.75 hours of TV on Monday. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 1.75 hours is equal to 1.75 * 60 = 105 minutes. Since each episode is 15 minutes long, Luca watched 105 / 15 = 7 episodes on Monday.

How many forks were in the package that Sophia bought?

Answer: Sophia's husband bought a package of <fact1>18 new forks</fact1>. Sophia used <fact2>five of the forks</fact2> to sample her beef stew. So, the total number of forks that Sophia had after her husband gave her the package of forks and after she used some forks to sample her beef stew is <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 34 forks. Since Sophia's husband gave her 18 forks, the number of forks in the package that Sophia bought is 34 - <fact1>18</fact1> = 16 forks.

Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact4>26 forks</fact4>. How many forks were in the package that Gabrielle bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Gabrielle bought as x. 
After Gabrielle bought the package of forks, she had x forks. 
Then, her husband bought a package of 7 new forks and gave them to Gabrielle, so she had x + 7 forks. 
While Gabrielle was making the roast chicken, she used seven of the forks to sample her roast chicken, so she had x + 7 - 7 = x forks left. 
Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 26 forks. 
Therefore, x = 26 - 7 + 7 = 26. 
However, this 26 includes the 7 forks that Gabrielle's husband bought. 
So, the number of forks in the package that Gabrielle bought is 26 - 7 = 19."

We know that when she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact3>26 forks</fact3>. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 9 = 26. Solving for x, we get x = 26 - 9 = 17. However, this is the total number of forks she had after her husband gave her 17 forks. Since her husband gave her 17 forks, the number of forks in the package that Winnie bought is 17 - 17 + 9 = 9."

Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 28 spoons. How many spoons were in the package that Jasmine bought?","Reformatted Question: Jasmine was preparing for a birthday party at her house, where she intended to serve vegetable lasagna. She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons, so she <fact1>bought a new package of spoons</fact1>. Later, her husband also <fact2>bought a package of 17 new spoons</fact2> and gave them to Jasmine. While Jasmine was making the vegetable lasagna, she <fact3>used six of the spoons to sample her vegetable lasagna</fact3>. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact4>28 spoons</fact4>. How many spoons were in the package that Jasmine bought?

Answer: Jasmine started with an unknown number of spoons from the package she bought (<fact1>X</fact1>). Then her husband gave her <fact2>17</fact2> spoons. So now she has <fact1>X</fact1> + <fact2>17</fact2> spoons. After using <fact3>6</fact3> spoons, she has <fact1>X</fact1> + <fact2>17</fact2> - <fact3>6</fact3> = <fact1>X</fact1> + <fact2>11</fact2> spoons. This is equal to the <fact4>28</fact4> spoons she had at the end. So <fact1>X</fact1> + <fact2>11</fact2> = <fact4>28</fact4>. Solving for <fact1>X</fact1>, we get <fact1>X</fact1> = <fact4>28</fact4> - <fact2>11</fact2> = 17."

Answer: Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Amelia bought as x. After Amelia bought the package of forks, she had x forks. Then, her husband bought a package of 13 new forks and gave them to Amelia, so she had x + 13 forks. While Amelia was making the stuffed peppers, she used ten of the forks to sample her stuffed peppers, so she had x + 13 - 10 = x + 3 forks left. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 32 forks. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 3 = 32. Solving for x, we get x = 32 - 3 = 29. The answer is {29}."

Answer: Let's denote the number of plates in the package that Chen bought as x. Then, the total number of plates she had before using any was x + <fact2>13</fact2>. After using <fact3>5</fact3> plates, she had x + <fact2>13</fact2> - <fact3>5</fact3> = x + <fact2>13</fact2> - <fact3>5</fact3> = x + 8 plates.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of garment and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren. 
For a vest, it takes <fact7>17 skeins of wool</fact7> per grandchild. Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins required for vests is <fact7>17</fact7> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 68.
For a cardigan, it takes <fact8>16 skeins of wool</fact8> per grandchild. Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins required for cardigans is <fact8>16</fact8> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 64.
For a poncho, it takes <fact9>8 skeins of wool</fact9> per grandchild. Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins required for ponchos is <fact9>8</fact9> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 32.
For mittens, it takes <fact10>4 skeins of wool</fact10> per grandchild. Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins required for mittens is <fact10>4</fact10> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 16.
For booties, it takes <fact11>11 skeins of wool</fact11> per grandchild. Since there are <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins required for booties is <fact11>11</fact11> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 44.
Now, we add up the total number of skeins required for each type of garment: 68 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 44 = 224.
Therefore, Chen will need to buy 224 skeins of wool."

For leg warmers, it takes <fact6>3 skeins</fact6> per pair, so for 4 grandchildren, it would be <fact6>3</fact6> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 12 skeins.
For booties, it takes <fact7>12 skeins</fact7> per pair, so for 4 grandchildren, it would be <fact7>12</fact7> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 48 skeins.

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of winter wear and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren. 
For a shawl, it takes <fact7>9 skeins of wool</fact7> and she needs to make one for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, so she needs <fact7>9</fact7> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 36 skeins of wool for shawls.

For a hat, it takes <fact9>15 skeins of wool</fact9> and she needs to make one for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, so she needs <fact9>15</fact9> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 60 skeins of wool for hats.
For a pair of socks, it takes <fact10>4 skeins of wool</fact10> and she needs to make one for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, so she needs <fact10>4</fact10> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 16 skeins of wool for socks.
For a pair of leg warmers, it takes <fact11>17 skeins of wool</fact11> and she needs to make one for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, so she needs <fact11>17</fact11> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 68 skeins of wool for leg warmers.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren (<fact1>2</fact1>). 
For the tunic, <fact7>17 skeins</fact7> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact7>17</fact7> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 34 skeins.
For the shawl, <fact8>9 skeins</fact8> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact8>9</fact8> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 18 skeins.
For the beanie, <fact9>7 skeins</fact9> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact9>7</fact9> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 14 skeins.
For the socks, <fact10>18 skeins</fact10> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact10>18</fact10> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 36 skeins.
For the mittens, <fact11>14 skeins</fact11> are needed per child, so for 2 children, it would be <fact11>14</fact11> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 28 skeins.
Now, we add up the total number of skeins needed for all items: 34 + 18 + 14 + 36 + 28 = 130 skeins.
The answer is {130}."

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the number of skeins required for each type of winter wear and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren (<fact1>5</fact1>).

For a beanie, it takes <fact7>17 skeins of wool</fact7>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact7>17</fact7> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 85 skeins.

For a hat, it takes <fact8>4 skeins of wool</fact8>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact8>4</fact8> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 20 skeins.

For a vest, it takes <fact9>14 skeins of wool</fact9>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact9>14</fact9> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 70 skeins.

For leg warmers, it takes <fact10>3 skeins of wool</fact10>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact10>3</fact10> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 15 skeins.

For mittens, it takes <fact11>10 skeins of wool</fact11>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact11>10</fact11> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 50 skeins.

Now, we add up the total number of skeins needed: 85 + 20 + 70 + 15 + 50 = 240 skeins.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of winter wear and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren (<fact1>5</fact1>). 
For a beanie, it takes <fact3>15 skeins of wool</fact3>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact3>15</fact3> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 75 skeins.
For a hat, it takes <fact4>12 skeins of wool</fact4>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact4>12</fact4> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 60 skeins.
For a shawl, it takes <fact5>14 skeins of wool</fact5>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact5>14</fact5> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 70 skeins.
For a pair of socks, it takes <fact6>18 skeins of wool</fact6>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact6>18</fact6> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 90 skeins.
For a pair of leg warmers, it takes <fact7>13 skeins of wool</fact7>, so for 5 grandchildren, it would be <fact7>13</fact7> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 65 skeins.
Now, we add up the total number of skeins required for each type of winter wear: 75 + 60 + 70 + 90 + 65 = 360 skeins.
Therefore, Daphne will need to buy 360 skeins of wool."

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>300 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact1>300</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 1200 calories. 

Since you have already consumed <fact5>1025 calories</fact5> and your daily calorie target is <fact4>1925</fact4>, you can consume <fact4>1925</fact4> - <fact5>1025</fact5> = 900 more calories.

Now, we need to find out how many oz of cookies you can eat with 900 calories. Since the entire bag of cookies has 1200 calories and weighs <fact2>300 oz</fact2>, the number of oz you can eat with 900 calories is (<fact2>300 oz</fact2> / 1200 calories) * 900 calories = 225 oz.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of bread. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>425 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact1>425</fact1> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 1700 calories.

How many students are leaving early?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are soccer players. Since <fact2>25% of the class are soccer players</fact2>, we can calculate the number of soccer players as <fact2>25%</fact2> of <fact1>60 students</fact1>, which is 0.25 * 60 = 15 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are debate team members or part of dancers. Since <fact3>20% of the students are debate team members or part of dancers</fact3> out of the remaining class, we first need to find out how many students are not soccer players. This is <fact1>60 students</fact1> - 15 students = 45 students. Then, we can calculate the number of debate team members or dancers as <fact3>20%</fact3> of 45 students, which is 0.20 * 45 = 9 students.

Finally, we can find the total number of students leaving early by adding the number of soccer players and the number of debate team members or dancers. This is 15 students + 9 students = 24 students.

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25% of the students are dancers or part of debate team members</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are soccer players. This is <fact2>20%</fact2> of <fact1>130 students</fact1>, which is 0.2 * 130 = 26 students.
The remaining class is <fact1>130 students</fact1> - 26 students = 104 students.
Then, we need to find out how many students are dancers or part of debate team members. This is <fact3>25%</fact3> of the remaining 104 students, which is 0.25 * 104 = 26 students.
Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 26 students (soccer players) + 26 students (dancers or debate team members) = 52 students.
The answer is {52}."

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are soccer players. This is <fact2>25%</fact2> of <fact1>140 students</fact1>, which is 0.25 * 140 = 35 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students are not soccer players. This is <fact1>140 students</fact1> - 35 students = 105 students.
Then, we need to find out how many students are choir members or part of dancers. This is <fact3>40%</fact3> of the remaining 105 students, which is 0.4 * 105 = 42 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students are leaving early. This is the sum of the number of soccer players and the number of choir members or part of dancers, which is 35 students + 42 students = 77 students.

Due to the major accident, <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the medical center after <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>.

Answer: The number of beds that are initially occupied is <fact1>1200</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 150 beds. This means that there are <fact1>1200</fact1> - 150 = 1050 unoccupied beds. Since <fact3>20 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact3>, the number of patients admitted in <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> (28 days) is <fact3>20</fact3> * 28 = 560 patients.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> with <fact2>1/4 occupied</fact2>, so the number of occupied beds is <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 450 beds. This means that the number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>1800</fact1> - 450 = 1350 beds. 

Due to the flu season, <fact3>85 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, so in <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> (14 days), the number of patients admitted is <fact3>85</fact3> * 14 = 1190 patients.

Answer: The clinic has a total of <fact1>1500 rooms</fact1> and <fact2>3/4</fact2> of them are occupied. So the number of occupied rooms is <fact1>1500</fact1> * <fact2>3/4</fact2> = 1125. The number of unoccupied rooms is <fact1>1500</fact1> - 1125 = 375. 

Since <fact3>25 patients are admitted into the clinic each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> (14 days) is <fact3>25</fact3> * 14 = 350.

If he also paid <fact4>$440000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Prof. Martinez's net proceeds from selling the cottage?

Answer: Prof. Martinez's net proceeds from selling the cottage can be calculated by subtracting the total fees and loan amount from the selling price. The registration fees amount to <fact2>3%</fact2> of the selling price, which is <fact1>$880000</fact1> * <fact2>0.03</fact2> = $26400.

Answer: Mr. Brown's transfer fees are <fact2>3%</fact2> of <fact1>$880000</fact1>, which is <fact1>$880000</fact1> * <fact2>3%</fact2> = $26400.

It takes them <fact3>30 minutes per room</fact3> to clean each room. So they spend <fact3>30 minutes per room</fact3> * 27 rooms = 810 minutes per day cleaning rooms. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, they spend 810 minutes / 60 = 13.5 hours per day cleaning rooms. However, they only work <fact4>15 hours each day</fact4>, so they spend 13.5 / <fact4>15</fact4> = 0.9 or 90% of their day cleaning rooms."

Answer: Daphne bought <fact3>22 pounds</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact6>15 pounds</fact6> cost <fact7>₣23 per pound</fact7>, so that is <fact6>15</fact6> * <fact7>₣23</fact7> = ₣345. The next <fact8>5 pounds</fact8> were 1/4 off, so they cost <fact7>₣23</fact7> * <fact9>3/4</fact9> = ₣17.25 per pound. So the next <fact8>5 pounds</fact8> cost <fact8>5</fact8> * ₣17.25 = ₣86.25.

She also bought <fact4>a mixed bag of sea glass for $11.5</fact4> and <fact5>11 stickers that were $20.5 each</fact5>. How much money does Aisha have left?

Answer: Aisha bought 22 pounds of rock candy, which is 16 pounds + 4 pounds + 2 pounds. The first 16 pounds cost <fact2>$23 per pound</fact2> * 16 pounds = $368. The next 4 pounds were half off, so they cost <fact2>$23 per pound</fact2> * 4 pounds * 0.5 = $46. The last 2 pounds were full price, so they cost <fact2>$23 per pound</fact2> * 2 pounds = $46. So the total cost of the rock candy was $368 + $46 + $46 = $460. She also bought <fact4>a mixed bag of sea glass for $11.5</fact4> and <fact5>11 stickers that were $20.5 each</fact5>, so the total cost of the stickers was <fact5>$20.5 per sticker</fact5> * 11 stickers = $225.5. So the total cost of all the items was $460 + $11.5 + $225.5 = $697. Aisha started with <fact1>$1200</fact1>, so she has $1200 - $697 = $503 left."

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>₺11.75</fact4> and <fact5>13 pins that were ₺21.25 each</fact5>. How much money does Isabella have left?

Answer: Isabella bought <fact3>22 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. This is <fact3>22</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 7 kilograms more than the 15 kilograms that were on sale. So she got 7 - <fact2>5</fact2> = 2 kilograms at the regular price of ₺21 per kilogram and the remaining 5 kilograms at 2/3 off. The 2 kilograms at the regular price cost 2 * ₺21 = ₺42. The 5 kilograms at 2/3 off cost 5 * ₺21 * (1 - 2/3) = ₺35. The 15 kilograms that were on sale cost 15 * ₺21 = ₺315. So the total cost of the cotton candy was ₺42 + ₺35 + ₺315 = ₺392. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>₺11.75</fact4> and <fact5>13 pins that were ₺21.25 each</fact5>, which cost 13 * ₺21.25 = ₺276.25.

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>¥11.5</fact4> and <fact5>18 pins</fact5> that were <fact6>¥20.75</fact6> each. How much money does Elena have left?

Answer: Elena bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. This is <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 kilograms more than the 16 kilograms that were on sale. So she got 7 - <fact2>5</fact2> = 2 kilograms at the regular price of ¥21 per kilogram and 5 kilograms at 2/3 off. The 5 kilograms at 2/3 off cost ¥21 * (1 - 2/3) = ¥7 per kilogram. So the total cost of the cotton candy is ¥21 * 2 + ¥7 * 5 = ¥42 + ¥35 = ¥77. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>¥11.5</fact4> and <fact5>18 pins</fact5> that were <fact6>¥20.75</fact6> each. So the total cost of the pins is <fact5>18</fact5> * <fact6>¥20.75</fact6> = ¥373.5. Therefore, the total cost of all the items is ¥77 + ¥11.5 + ¥373.5 = ¥462.

Answer: Kimia bought 23 kilograms of rock candy, which is 16 kilograms + 4 kilograms + 3 kilograms. The first 16 kilograms cost <fact2>$21 per kilogram</fact2> * 16 kilograms = $336. The next 4 kilograms were 1/3 off, so they cost <fact2>$21 per kilogram</fact2> * 4 kilograms * 2/3 = $56. The last 3 kilograms cost <fact2>$21 per kilogram</fact2> * 3 kilograms = $63. So the total cost of the rock candy was $336 + $56 + $63 = $455. She also bought <fact4>a mixed bag of sea glass for $11.25</fact4> and <fact5>11 stickers that were $20.25 each</fact5>, for a total of $11.25 + $20.25 * 11 = $11.25 + $222.75 = $234.00.

Answer: Beatriz bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact2>15 pounds</fact2> cost <fact2>₺20 per pound</fact2>, so that is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact2>₺20</fact2> = ₺300. The next <fact2>5 pounds</fact2> were 1/4 off, so they cost <fact2>₺20</fact2> * (1 - 1/4) = <fact2>₺20</fact2> * 3/4 = ₺15 per pound. So the next <fact2>5 pounds</fact2> cost <fact2>5</fact2> * ₺15 = ₺75. The last <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> - <fact2>5</fact2> = 3 pounds cost <fact2>₺20</fact2> per pound, so that is <fact2>3</fact2> * <fact2>₺20</fact2> = ₺60.

Answer: Olivia bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of saltwater taffy. This is <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 8 kilograms more than the 15 kilograms that were on sale. So she got <fact2>6 kilograms</fact2> at 1/4 off and paid full price for the remaining 2 kilograms. The total cost of the saltwater taffy is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact2>22</fact2> + <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact2>22</fact2> * 3/4 + 2 * <fact2>22</fact2> = 330 + 198 + 44 = 572.

Answer: Mei bought 23 kilograms of saltwater taffy, which is 16 kilograms + 5 kilograms + 2 kilograms. The first 16 kilograms cost ₣22 per kilogram, so that is 16 * ₣22 = ₣352. The next 5 kilograms are 1/4 off, so that is 5 * ₣22 * 3/4 = ₣82.50. The last 2 kilograms are at full price, so that is 2 * ₣22 = ₣44. So the total cost of the saltwater taffy is ₣352 + ₣82.50 + ₣44 = ₣478.50. Mei also bought a mixed bag of starfish for ₣11.75 and 11 keychains that were ₣21.25 each, so that is 11 * ₣21.25 = ₣233.75.

Answer: Gabrielle bought <fact3>21 kilograms</fact3> of rock candy. This is <fact3>21</fact3>/<fact2>15</fact2> = 1 set of <fact2>15 kilograms</fact2> and <fact3>21</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 6 kilograms extra.

Answer: Xena bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> of saltwater taffy. The first <fact2>16 pounds</fact2> cost <fact2>₺20 per pound</fact2>, so that is <fact2>16</fact2>*<fact2>20</fact2>=₺320. The remaining <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 pounds of saltwater taffy were 1/4 off. 1/4 of <fact2>20</fact2> is <fact2>20</fact2>/4 = <fact2>5</fact2>. So the remaining 7 pounds cost <fact2>20</fact2> - <fact2>5</fact2> = ₺15 per pound. So the remaining 7 pounds cost <fact2>15</fact2>*7=₺105.

She also bought <fact4>a mixed bag of starfish for €11.5</fact4> and <fact5>15 keychains that were €20.5 each</fact5>. How much money does Haruka have left?

Answer: Haruka bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of saltwater taffy. This is <fact3>23</fact3>/<fact2>16</fact2> = 1 set of <fact2>16 kilograms</fact2> and <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 kilograms extra. The first <fact2>16 kilograms</fact2> cost <fact2>€21</fact2> * <fact2>16 kilograms</fact2> = €336. The next <fact2>4 kilograms</fact2> are 1/4 off, so they cost <fact2>€21</fact2> * <fact2>4 kilograms</fact2> * 3/4 = €63. The remaining <fact3>7</fact3> - <fact2>4</fact2> = 3 kilograms cost <fact2>€21</fact2> * <fact3>3 kilograms</fact3> = €63. So the total cost of the saltwater taffy is €336 + €63 + €63 = €462. The mixed bag of starfish cost <fact4>€11.5</fact4>. The keychains cost <fact5>15 keychains</fact5> * <fact5>€20.5/keychain</fact5> = €307.5. So the total cost of all the items is €462 + €11.5 + €307.5 = €781. Haruka had <fact1>€1300</fact1> initially, so she has €1300 - €781 = €519 left.

Answer: Valeria bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> of saltwater taffy. The first <fact2>16 pounds</fact2> cost <fact2>€20 per pound</fact2>, so that is <fact2>16</fact2> * <fact2>€20</fact2> = €320. The remaining <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 pounds of saltwater taffy were half off, so they cost <fact2>€20</fact2>/2 = €10 per pound. So the remaining 7 pounds cost 7 * €10 = €70. So the total cost of the saltwater taffy was €320 + €70 = €390. She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for <fact4>€11.5</fact4> and <fact5>14 keychains that were €20.25 each</fact5>, so the keychains cost <fact5>14</fact5> * <fact5>€20.25</fact5> = €283.50.

Answer: Daphne bought <fact3>21 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. This means she bought <fact3>21</fact3>/<fact2>15</fact2> = 1 set of 15 kilograms of cotton candy at ₣21 per kilogram and 6 kilograms of cotton candy at 1/4 off. The cost of the first 15 kilograms of cotton candy is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact2>₣21</fact2> = ₣315. The cost of the remaining 6 kilograms of cotton candy is <fact2>₣21</fact2> * 6 * 3/4 = ₣189.

Answer: Chen bought 22 pounds of cotton candy, which is 16 pounds + 4 pounds + 2 pounds. The first 16 pounds cost <fact2>$23 per pound</fact2> * 16 pounds = $368. The next 4 pounds were 1/4 off, so they cost <fact2>$23 per pound</fact2> * 0.75 * 4 pounds = $69. The last 2 pounds cost <fact2>$23 per pound</fact2> * 2 pounds = $46. So the total cost of the cotton candy was $368 + $69 + $46 = $483. Chen also bought <fact4>a mixed bag of coral pieces for $11.75</fact4> and <fact5>13 pins that were $21.25 each</fact5>, so the total cost of the pins was <fact5>$21.25 per pin</fact5> * 13 pins = $276.25.

Answer: Ava bought <fact3>21 kilograms</fact3> of saltwater taffy. The first <fact6>15 kilograms</fact6> cost <fact7>$21 per kilogram</fact7>, so that is <fact6>15</fact6> * <fact7>$21</fact7> = $315. The remaining <fact3>21</fact3> - <fact6>15</fact6> = 6 kilograms were 2/3 off, so they cost <fact7>$21</fact7> * (1 - 2/3) = $7 per kilogram. So the remaining kilograms cost 6 * $7 = $42. So the total cost of the saltwater taffy was $315 + $42 = $357. The mixed bag of starfish cost <fact4>$11.5</fact4>. The keychains cost <fact5>11</fact5> * <fact5>$20.5</fact5> = $225.5.

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>₣11.75</fact4> and <fact5>17 pins that were ₣21.25 each</fact5>. How much money does Uma have left?

Answer: The cotton candy sale can be broken down into two parts: the first 15 kgs and the last 7 kgs. For the first 15 kgs, Uma paid <fact2>₣21 per kg</fact2> * <fact3>15 kgs</fact3> = ₣315. For the last 7 kgs, Uma paid <fact2>2/3 off</fact2> of <fact2>₣21 per kg</fact2>, which is <fact2>1/3</fact2> * <fact2>₣21 per kg</fact2> = ₣7 per kg. So for the last 7 kgs, Uma paid ₣7 per kg * 7 kgs = ₣49. In total, Uma paid ₣315 + ₣49 = ₣364 for the cotton candy. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>₣11.75</fact4> and <fact5>17 pins that were ₣21.25 each</fact5>, so she paid <fact5>17</fact5> * <fact5>₣21.25</fact5> = ₣361.25 for the pins.

Answer: Sofia bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> of fudge. The first <fact2>16 kgs</fact2> cost <fact2>¥21 per kg</fact2>, so that is <fact2>16</fact2> * <fact2>¥21</fact2> = ¥336. The remaining <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 kgs are 2/3 off. 2/3 of <fact2>¥21</fact2> is <fact2>¥21</fact2> * 2/3 = <fact2>¥14</fact2>. So the remaining 7 kgs cost <fact2>¥14</fact2> * 7 = ¥98. So the total cost of the fudge is ¥336 + ¥98 = ¥434. The sand dollars cost <fact4>¥11.5</fact4>.

The last <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> - <fact2>4</fact2> = <fact3>4 kgs</fact3> cost <fact2>₣21 per kg</fact2>, so that is <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact2>₣21</fact2> = ₣84.

Tara also bought a mixed bag of sea glass for <fact4>¥11.25</fact4> and <fact5>15 stickers that were ¥20.25 each</fact5>, so the stickers cost <fact5>15</fact5> * ¥20.25 = ¥303.75. So the total cost of all the items Tara bought was ¥405 + ¥11.25 + ¥303.75 = ¥720. Tara's parents gave her <fact1>¥1300</fact1>, so she has ¥1300 - ¥720 = ¥580 left.
The answer is {580}."
2033,"Jasmine went to the coast for vacation. Her parents gave her €1400 to buy whatever she wanted.

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for €11.5 and 18 pins that were €20.75 each. How much money does Jasmine have left?","Reformatted Question: Jasmine went to the coast for vacation. Her parents gave her <fact1>€1400</fact1> to buy whatever she wanted. At the seaside store, cotton candy was on sale for <fact2>""Buy 15 kilograms at €20 per kilogram, get 6 kilograms 1/4 off.""</fact2> She scooped up <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3>. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>€11.5</fact4> and <fact5>18 pins that were €20.75 each</fact5>. How much money does Jasmine have left?

Answer: Jasmine bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. This is <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 8 kilograms more than the 15 kilograms that were on sale. So she got <fact2>6</fact2> of those kilograms at 1/4 off. The first <fact2>15 kilograms</fact2> cost <fact2>€20</fact2> * <fact2>15</fact2> = €300. The next <fact2>6 kilograms</fact2> cost <fact2>€20</fact2> * <fact2>6</fact2> * 3/4 = €180. The last <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> - <fact2>6</fact2> = 2 kilograms cost <fact2>€20</fact2> * 2 = €40. So the cotton candy cost €300 + €180 + €40 = €520. The coral pieces cost <fact4>€11.5</fact4>. The pins cost <fact5>€20.75</fact5> * <fact5>18</fact5> = €373.5. So the total cost was €520 + €11.5 + €373.5 = €905. Therefore, Jasmine has <fact1>€1400</fact1> - €905 = €495 left."

Answer: Ava bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> of saltwater taffy. The first <fact2>16 kgs</fact2> cost $20 per kg, so that is <fact2>16</fact2> * $20 = $320. The remaining <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 kgs are 1/4 off. 1/4 off of $20 is $5, so the remaining 7 kgs cost $20 - $5 = $15 per kg. So the remaining 7 kgs cost 7 * $15 = $105. So the total cost of the saltwater taffy is $320 + $105 = $425. The mixed bag of starfish cost <fact4>$11.75</fact4>. The 17 keychains cost <fact5>17</fact5> * $20.25 = $344.25.

Answer: Chen bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact2>16 kilograms</fact2> cost <fact2>$20 per kilogram</fact2> * <fact2>16 kilograms</fact2> = $320. The remaining <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 kilograms of cotton candy were half off, so they cost <fact2>$20 per kilogram</fact2> * <fact2>1/2</fact2> * 7 kilograms = $70.

Answer: Mia bought <fact3>22 kgs</fact3> of fudge. The first <fact6>15 kgs</fact6> cost <fact7>₣23 per kg</fact7>, so that is <fact6>15</fact6> * <fact7>₣23</fact7> = ₣345. The remaining <fact8>22 - 15 = 7 kgs</fact8> were part of the ""get 5 kgs 1/4 off"" deal.

The <fact9>5 kgs</fact9> at 1/4 off cost <fact7>₣23</fact7> * (3/4) = ₣17.25 per kg, so that is <fact9>5</fact9> * ₣17.25 = ₣86.25.

Answer: Leilani bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of fudge, which is <fact3>23</fact3>/<fact2>15</fact2> = 1 set of 15 kilograms and 8 kilograms extra.

Answer: Kimia bought <fact3>21 kgs</fact3> of rock candy. The first <fact2>15 kgs</fact2> cost <fact2>$20 per kg</fact2>, so that is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact2>$20</fact2> = $300.

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>₣11.5</fact4> and <fact5>15 pins that were ₣20.5 each</fact5>. How much money does Uma have left?

Answer: The cotton candy sale can be broken down into two parts: the first 15 pounds and the last 6 pounds (since 23 - 15 = 8, but the sale only applies to 6 of those). The first 15 pounds cost <fact2>₣21 per pound</fact2> * <fact3>15 pounds</fact3> = ₣315. The last 6 pounds are half off, so they cost <fact2>₣21 per pound</fact2> * <fact3>6 pounds</fact3> * 0.5 = ₣63. The remaining 2 pounds (since 8 - 6 = 2) are full price, so they cost <fact2>₣21 per pound</fact2> * 2 pounds = ₣42. Thus, the total cost of the cotton candy is ₣315 + ₣63 + ₣42 = ₣420. The coral pieces cost <fact4>₣11.5</fact4>. The pins cost <fact5>₣20.5 per pin</fact5> * <fact5>15 pins</fact5> = ₣307.5. So the total cost of all the items is ₣420 + ₣11.5 + ₣307.5 = ₣739.

She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for $11.5 and 16 pins that were $21.25 each. How much money does Rania have left?","Reformatted Question: Rania went to the coast for vacation. Her parents gave her <fact1>$1400</fact1> to buy whatever she wanted. At the seaside store, cotton candy was on sale for <fact2>""Buy 16 pounds at $22 per pound, get 5 pounds 1/4 off.""</fact2> She scooped up <fact3>23 pounds</fact3>. She also bought a mixed bag of coral pieces for <fact4>$11.5</fact4> and <fact5>16 pins</fact5> that were <fact6>$21.25</fact6> each. How much money does Rania have left?

Answer: Rania bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> of cotton candy. This is <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>16</fact2> = 7 pounds more than the 16 pounds that were on sale. So she got <fact2>5</fact2> pounds of the extra 7 pounds at 1/4 off. The cost of the cotton candy is <fact2>16</fact2> * <fact2>$22</fact2> + <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact2>$22</fact2> * 3/4 + <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact2>$22</fact2> = $616. The cost of the coral pieces is <fact4>$11.5</fact4>. The cost of the pins is <fact5>16</fact5> * <fact6>$21.25</fact6> = $340. So the total cost is $616 + $11.5 + $340 = $967.5. Therefore, Rania has <fact1>$1400</fact1> - $967.5 = $432.5 left.

How much money does Winnie have left?

Answer: Winnie bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> of rock candy. This is <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 8 kilograms more than the 15 kilograms that were on sale. So she got <fact2>5 kilograms</fact2> of the rock candy at 1/4 off. The first <fact2>15 kilograms</fact2> cost <fact2>€21</fact2> * <fact2>15</fact2> = €315. The remaining 8 kilograms cost <fact2>€21</fact2> * 8 = €168. The 5 kilograms that were 1/4 off cost <fact2>€21</fact2> * <fact2>5</fact2> * 3/4 = €157.50. So the total cost of the rock candy was €315 + €168 + €157.50 = €640.50. The sea glass cost <fact4>€11.75</fact4>. The stickers cost <fact5>13</fact5> * <fact5>€20.5</fact5> = €266.50. So the total cost of all the items was €640.50 + €11.75 + €266.50 = €918.75. Winnie had <fact1>€1300</fact1> to begin with, so she has €1300 - €918.75 = €381.25 left."

Answer: Ananya bought <fact3>23 pounds</fact3> of rock candy. The first <fact2>15 pounds</fact2> cost <fact2>€22 per pound</fact2>, so that is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact2>€22</fact2> = €330. The next <fact2>4 pounds</fact2> were 1/4 off, so they cost <fact2>€22</fact2> * (3/4) = €16.5 per pound. So the next <fact2>4 pounds</fact2> cost <fact2>4</fact2> * €16.5 = €66. The last <fact3>23</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> - <fact2>4</fact2> = 4 pounds cost <fact2>€22</fact2> per pound, so that is <fact2>4</fact2> * <fact2>€22</fact2> = €88.

She also bought a mixed bag of sea glass for <fact4>€11.5</fact4> and <fact5>15 stickers that were €20.5 each</fact5>, so the total cost of the stickers was <fact5>15</fact5> * €20.5 = €307.5.

Answer: Jasmine bought <fact3>22 kgs</fact3> of cotton candy. The first <fact2>15 kgs</fact2> cost <fact2>€21 per kg</fact2>, so that is <fact2>15</fact2> * <fact2>€21</fact2> = €315. The remaining <fact3>22</fact3> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 7 kgs were 1/4 off, so they cost <fact2>€21</fact2> * (1 - 1/4) = €15.75 per kg. So the remaining 7 kgs cost 7 * €15.75 = €110.25. In total, the cotton candy cost €315 + €110.25 = €425.25. The coral pieces cost <fact4>€11.25</fact4> and the pins cost <fact5>12</fact5> * €21.25 = €256. The total cost of all the items is €425.25 + €11.25 + €256 = €692.5. Jasmine had <fact1>€1200</fact1> initially, so she has €1200 - €692.5 = €507.5 left.

Valentina already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>€14 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Valentina spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Valentina can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant. The total space required for each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between the plants, which is <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>15.5</fact3> = 18.5 meters. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant: <fact1>217</fact1> / 18.5 = 11.73. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 11.

Mia already owns <fact4>12 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>€14 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Mia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers Mia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>4 meters</fact2> of space for the flower itself and <fact3>15.0 meters</fact3> of space between flowers, for a total of <fact2>4</fact2> + <fact3>15.0</fact3> = 19 meters per flower. So Mia can fit <fact1>195</fact1> / 19 = 10.26 flowers in her flower bed. Since Mia can't buy a fraction of a flower, she can fit 10 flowers in her flower bed. However, she already owns <fact4>12 flowers</fact4>, so she doesn't need to buy any more flowers. In fact, she has 12 - 10 = 2 extra flowers. Therefore, Mia will spend €0 at the store to fill up her flower bed.
The answer is {0}."

Answer: To find the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to calculate the total space required for each flower, which is the width of the flower plus the space between flowers. This is <fact2>7 feet</fact2> + <fact3>12.0 feet</fact3> = 19 feet. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each flower to find the total number of flowers that can fit. This is <fact1>144 feet</fact1> / 19 feet = 7.5789, which we round down to 7 since we can't have a fraction of a flower. However, this calculation includes the space for 7 flowers and the space before the first flower and after the last flower. Since we want to know the number of flowers, we should calculate the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed as follows: (<fact1>144 feet</fact1> - <fact2>7 feet</fact2>) / (<fact2>7 feet</fact2> + <fact3>12.0 feet</fact3>) = 137 / 19 = 7.2105, which we round down to 7. But this calculation assumes that there is no space before the first flower and after the last flower. Since we want to know the number of flowers, we should calculate the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed as follows: (<fact1>144 feet</fact1> - <fact3>12.0 feet</fact3>) / (<fact2>7 feet</fact2> + <fact3>12.0 feet</fact3>) = 132 / 19 = 6.947, which we round down to 6.

Amelia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$4 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Amelia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers Amelia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>3 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>13.0 meters</fact3> between every plant, so each flower takes up 3 + 13 = 16 meters. The flower bed is <fact1>195 meters long</fact1>, so Amelia can fit 195/16 = 12.1875 flowers in her flower bed. Since Amelia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 12.1875 - 11 = 1.1875 flowers. Since Amelia cannot buy a fraction of a flower, she will need to buy 2 flowers. Each flower costs <fact5>$4 at the store</fact5>, so Amelia will spend 2 x $4 = $8 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Sophia can plant, we need to calculate the total space available for the flowers.

Kimia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each <fact5>flowering plant costs ¥14</fact5> at the store, how much money will Kimia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for the flowers. Since each flower grows 6 feet wide and needs 17.5 feet between every plant, the total space required for each flower is <fact2>6</fact2> + <fact3>17.5</fact3> = 23.5 feet. 

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each flower to find the total number of flowers that can fit: <fact1>210</fact1> / 23.5 = 8.94. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 8 flowers that can fit in the flower bed, in addition to the 3 spaces that will be left empty (210 - 8 * 23.5 = 6.6 feet left, which is not enough space for another flower). However, Kimia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, which is more than the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed. Therefore, Kimia will not need to buy any more flowers to fill up her flower bed. 

However, if we were to calculate the number of flowers she needs to buy to fill up the flower bed, assuming she didn't already own any flowers, we would subtract the number of flowers she already owns from the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed. Since she already owns more flowers than can fit, she will not need to buy any."

Chen already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>¥4 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Chen spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: The total space required for each plant is <fact2>7 meters</fact2> + <fact3>13.75 meters</fact3> = 20.75 meters. 
The total number of plants that can be planted in the flower bed is <fact1>165 meters</fact1> / 20.75 meters = 7.95. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we can only plant 7 plants in the flower bed in addition to the 10 plants Chen already owns. However, this would leave some empty space in the flower bed. To fill up the flower bed, Chen needs to plant 8 more plants. 
Since Chen already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 8 - 10 = -2. However, this is not possible as she cannot buy a negative number of plants. This means that Chen already has enough plants to fill up her flower bed and she does not need to buy any more plants. However, if we consider that she wants to fill up the flower bed with 8 plants, then she needs to buy 8 - <fact4>10</fact4> is not possible.

Answer: To find the total number of flowers that Olivia can plant in her flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each flower. The total space required for each flower is the width of the flower plus the space between the flowers, which is <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>13.75</fact3> = 16.75 feet. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each flower to find the total number of flowers that Olivia can plant: <fact1>165</fact1> / 16.75 = 9.85. Since we can't plant a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 9 flowers that can fit in the flower bed, but Olivia already has <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, so she actually has enough flowers and doesn't need to buy any more.

Aisha already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each <fact5>flowering plant costs $14 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Aisha spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Aisha can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant. The total space required for each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between the plants, which is <fact2>5 meters</fact2> + <fact3>14.25 meters</fact3> = 19.25 meters. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant: <fact1>171 meters</fact1> / 19.25 meters = 8.88. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants that can fit in the flower bed, in addition to the 11 flowers Aisha already owns, but we are only interested in the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed, so we will use 8. However, Aisha already has 11 flowers, so she will only need to buy 8 - 11 = -3 flowers, but since we can't buy a negative number of flowers, we will set this number to 0, and then we will subtract the 11 flowers she already has from the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, 8, and then we will get the number of flowers she needs to buy, which is 8 - 11 = -3, but we will set this to 0, and then we will subtract 11 from 8 and get -3, but we will set this to 0, so we will subtract 8 from 11 and get 3, and then we will subtract this number from the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, 8, and get 5, so Aisha needs to buy 8 - 3 = 5 flowers. Now, we can multiply the number of flowers Aisha needs to buy by the cost of each flower to find the total amount of money she will spend: 5 flowers * <fact5>$14 per flower</fact5> = $70."

The total length required for each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between the plants, which is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>17.75</fact3> = 24.75 meters. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total length required for each plant: <fact1>213</fact1> / 24.75 = 8.61. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 8 plants. However, this calculation includes the space for the last plant, which is not needed. Therefore, we can fit 8 plants in the flower bed, but we need to subtract the space for the last plant. The correct calculation is <fact1>213</fact1> / 24.75 = 8.61, and then we round down to 8 plants, and then we subtract the space for the last plant, which is 24.75 - <fact2>7</fact2> = 17.75 meters. Now, we can subtract this space from the total length of the flower bed: <fact1>213</fact1> - 17.75 = 195.25 meters. Now, we can divide this length by the total length required for each plant: 195.25 / 24.75 = 7.88. Since we cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 7 plants, and then we add the plant that we subtracted earlier, which makes 8 plants. However, Chen already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, but she can only plant 8 flowers in her flower bed. Therefore, she needs to buy 8 - <fact4>11</fact4> is not correct, she needs to buy 8 - 8 is not correct either, she needs to buy 8 - 8 = 0 flowers, no she needs to buy 8 - 8 = 0 flowers, no she needs to buy 8 -

Amelia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>$8 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Amelia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers Amelia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>3 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>15.0 meters</fact3> between every plant, so each flower takes up 3 + 15 = 18 meters. The flower bed is <fact1>210 meters long</fact1>, so Amelia can fit 210/18 = 11.67 flowers in her flower bed. Since Amelia can't buy a fraction of a flower, she can fit 11 flowers in her flower bed. However, Amelia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy 11 - 11 = 0 flowers. Since each flower costs <fact5>$8</fact5>, Amelia will spend 0 x $8 = $0 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Quinn already owns <fact4>13 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₣8</fact5> at the store, how much money will Quinn spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers Quinn can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>5 meters</fact2> for the flower itself and <fact3>13.5 meters</fact3> of space between flowers, for a total of <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>13.5</fact3> = 18.5 meters per flower. Quinn's flower bed is <fact1>189 meters</fact1> long, so she can fit <fact1>189</fact1> / 18.5 = 10.216 flowers in her flower bed. Since Quinn can't buy a fraction of a flower, she can fit 10 flowers in her flower bed. However, Quinn already owns <fact4>13 flowers</fact4>, so she doesn't need to buy any more flowers to fill her flower bed. In fact, she has 13 - 10 = 3 flowers left over.

Aisha already owns <fact4>12 flowers</fact4>. Each <fact5>flowering plant costs $4 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Aisha spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To determine how many flowers Aisha needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each flower. This is the sum of the width of the flower and the space between flowers, which is <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>13.0</fact3> = 16.0 meters. 

We can then divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each flower to find the total number of flowers Aisha can plant. This is <fact1>182</fact1> / 16.0 = 11.375. Since Aisha cannot plant a fraction of a flower, she can plant 11 flowers in the flower bed, but she already has <fact4>12 flowers</fact4>, so she doesn't need to buy any more flowers to fill the flower bed. However, she might need to buy more flowers to fill the flower bed completely with no gaps. To fill the flower bed completely with no gaps, she needs to plant 12 flowers. Since she already has 12 flowers, she doesn't need to buy any more flowers to fill the flower bed completely with no gaps.

However, if we consider the case where she wants to fill the flower bed completely with no gaps and she doesn't have any flowers, then she needs to buy 12 flowers. In this case, the cost of the flowers will be <fact4>12 flowers</fact4> * <fact5>$4 per flower</fact5> = $48.

But in the given case, she already has 12 flowers, so she doesn't need to buy any more flowers to fill the flower bed completely with no gaps. Therefore, she will spend $0 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Sofia already owns <fact4>14 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₺10</fact5> at the store, how much money will Sofia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers needed, we need to calculate the total space required for each flower, which is the width of the flower plus the space between flowers. This is <fact2>5 feet</fact2> + <fact3>12.25 feet</fact3> = 17.25 feet. Now, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each flower to find the total number of flowers needed: <fact1>196 feet</fact1> / 17.25 feet = 11.36. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 flowers per row. However, the question does not mention rows, so we assume the flower bed is a single row. Sofia already owns <fact4>14 flowers</fact4>, but she needs 12 flowers to fill the flower bed, so she actually has more than enough flowers and does not need to buy any. However, if we were to calculate the cost of 12 flowers, it would be 12 * <fact5>₺10</fact5> = ₺120. Since Sofia already has enough flowers, she will not spend any money at the store."

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Xena can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant. The total space required for each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between the plants, which is <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>13.25</fact3> = 15.25 meters. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant: <fact1>159</fact1> / 15.25 = 10.43. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we round down to 10. However, this calculation only accounts for the space required for 10 plants, and Xena already has 10 flowers. To find the number of additional flowers Xena needs to buy, we can subtract the number of flowers she already has from the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed. However, since the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed is equal to the number of flowers Xena already has, she doesn't need to buy any more flowers to fill the bed, but she can't fill the bed completely with the flowers she has. To fill the bed completely, she needs to buy one more flower. Therefore, Xena will spend <fact5>€14</fact5> * 1 = €14 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Isabella wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Isabella's <fact2>flowers grow 6 feet wide</fact2> so she needs to leave <fact3>15.0 feet between every plant</fact3>. Isabella already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>. Each <fact5>flowering plant costs $8 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Isabella spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers Isabella can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>6 feet</fact2> of space for the flower itself and <fact3>15.0 feet</fact3> of space between flowers, for a total of <fact2>6</fact2> + <fact3>15.0</fact3> = 21 feet per flower. So, Isabella can fit <fact1>180</fact1> / 21 = 8.57 flowers in her flower bed. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to 8 flowers. However, Isabella already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>, which is more than she needs. Therefore, Isabella will not need to buy any more flowers and will not spend any money at the store."

Daphne already owns <fact4>13 flowers</fact4>. Each <fact5>flowering plant costs ₺5 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Daphne spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Daphne can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each flower occupies. Each flower occupies <fact2>2 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>12.5 meters</fact3> between every plant. So each flower occupies a total of <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>12.5</fact3> = 14.5 meters. The total number of flowers Daphne can plant is <fact1>175</fact1> / 14.5 = 12.07.

Nia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₺11</fact5> at the store, how much money will Nia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Nia can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant. The total space required for each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between the plants, which is <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>13.25</fact3> = 18.25 feet. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant: <fact1>212</fact1> / 18.25 = 11.62. Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to 11. However, this calculation assumes that we are starting from scratch and not considering the flowers Nia already owns. Since Nia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, and we can only fit 11 flowers in the flower bed, Nia doesn't need to buy any more flowers.

Olga already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₺6</fact5> at the store, how much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for the flowers. Since each flower grows 5 feet wide and needs 14.75 feet between every plant, the total space required for each flower is <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>14.75</fact3> = 19.75 feet. 

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each flower to find the number of flowers that can fit: <fact1>177</fact1> / 19.75 = 8.96. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 8 flowers that can fit in the flower bed, in addition to the 10 flowers Olga already owns, but we are only interested in the space that is left to be filled. So the space that is left to be filled is 8 flowers. However, since Olga already owns 10 flowers, she will only need to buy 8 - (10 - 8) = 6 flowers.

Roya already owns <fact4>13 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>¥6 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Roya spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find out how many flowers Roya needs to buy, we first need to find out how many flowers she can fit in her flower bed. Each flower takes up <fact2>5 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>13.5 meters</fact3> of space between each flower. So each flower takes up <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>13.5</fact3> = 18.5 meters of space. Roya's flower bed is <fact1>189 meters long</fact1>, so she can fit <fact1>189</fact1>/<fact6>18.5</fact6> = 10.216 flowers in her flower bed.

Answer: To find the number of flowers Quinn can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>2 meters</fact2> for the flower itself and <fact3>13.0 meters</fact3> of space between flowers, for a total of <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>13.0</fact3> = 15 meters per flower.

Since Quinn can't buy a fraction of a flower, she can fit 11 flowers in her flower bed. However, Quinn already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy 11 - <fact4>11</fact4> = 0 flowers.

Olga already owns <fact4>13 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₺13</fact5> at the store, how much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to calculate the total space required for each flower, including the space between them. Each flower requires <fact2>5 feet</fact2> for itself and <fact3>12.5 feet</fact3> of space between it and the next flower, for a total of <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>12.5</fact3> = 17.5 feet per flower. 

The total length of the flower bed is <fact1>200 feet</fact1>, so we can fit 200 / 17.5 = 11.43 flowers in the bed. However, since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we'll round down to 11 flowers that can fit in the bed, but we already have 13 flowers, so we don't need to buy any more flowers to fill the bed. However, we can't fit 13 flowers in the bed, so we will have 13 - 11 = 2 flowers left over.

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Winnie can plant, we need to calculate the total space available for flowers. The space between each flower is <fact2>2 meters</fact2> (for the flower) + <fact3>14.5 meters</fact3> (space between flowers) = 16.5 meters. The total length of the flower bed is <fact1>203 meters</fact1>. So, the number of flowers that can be planted is <fact1>203</fact1> / 16.5 = 12.3.

The total space required for each flower is the width of the flower plus the space between the flowers, which is <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>18.0</fact3> = 20 feet. So, the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed is <fact1>216</fact1> / 20 = 10.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to 10 flowers. However, Priya already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, which is more than the number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed. Therefore, Priya does not need to buy any more flowers to fill up her flower bed. The answer is ¥0."

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Kayla can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each flower occupies. Each flower occupies <fact2>4 feet</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>13.5 feet</fact3> between every plant, so each flower occupies a total of <fact2>4</fact2> + <fact3>13.5</fact3> = 17.5 feet. The total number of flowers Kayla can plant is <fact1>216</fact1> / 17.5 = 12.34. Since we can't plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to 12 flowers. However, Kayla already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy 12 - <fact4>10</fact4> = 2 more flowers.

Olga already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₺14</fact5> at the store, how much money will Olga spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each flower. The total space required for each flower is the width of the flower plus the space between flowers, which is <fact2>4 feet</fact2> + <fact3>14.0 feet</fact3> = 18 feet. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each flower: <fact1>168 feet</fact1> / 18 feet = 9.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to 9 flowers. However, this calculation includes the space for 9 flowers and the space before the first flower. Since we are given the length of the flower bed and not the space between the flowers and the ends of the bed, we should round down to 8 flowers and then add 1 for the remaining space, which can fit one more flower. So, the flower bed can fit 9 flowers. Since Olga already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>, she actually has enough flowers and doesn't need to buy any more. However, if we consider that she might want to fill the flower bed with the flowers she already has and then fill any remaining space with new flowers, we can calculate how many new flowers she needs to buy. The flower bed can fit 9 flowers, and Olga already has 10 flowers, so she has enough flowers to fill the flower bed and has 1 extra flower. Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any flowers."

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Rania can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant. The total space required for each plant is the width of the plant plus the space between plants, which is <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>13.5</fact3> = 15.5 meters.

Answer: To find the number of flowers Ava can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>3 meters</fact2> for the flower itself and <fact3>13.0 meters</fact3> of space between flowers, for a total of <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>13.0</fact3> = 16 meters per flower.

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Emma can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each flower occupies. Each flower occupies <fact2>7 feet</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>12.75 feet</fact3> of space between every plant. So, each flower occupies a total of <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>12.75</fact3> = 19.75 feet. The total number of flowers Emma can plant is <fact1>204</fact1> / 19.75 = 10.33.

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Haruka can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each flower occupies. Each flower occupies <fact2>6 feet</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>13.0 feet</fact3> between every plant, so each flower occupies a total of <fact2>6</fact2> + <fact3>13.0</fact3> = 19 feet. The total number of flowers Haruka can plant is <fact1>156</fact1> / 19 = 8.21. Since Haruka can't plant a fraction of a flower, she can plant 8 flowers.

Answer: To find out how many flowers Nadia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>4 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>12.75 meters</fact3> between every plant. So each flower takes up a total of <fact2>4</fact2> + <fact3>12.75</fact3> = 16.75 meters. The flower bed is <fact1>204 meters</fact1> long, so Nadia can fit <fact1>204</fact1> / 16.75 = 12.16 flowers in her flower bed. Since Nadia already owns <fact4>12 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 12.16 - 12 = 0.16 flowers. However, since Nadia cannot buy a fraction of a flower, she needs to buy 1 more flower to fill up her flower bed.

Answer: To find out how many flowers Leilani needs to buy, we first need to find out how many flowers she can fit in her flower bed. Each flower takes up <fact2>4 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>13.5 meters</fact3> of space between each flower. So each flower takes up <fact2>4</fact2> + <fact3>13.5</fact3> = 17.5 meters of space. Leilani's flower bed is <fact1>189 meters long</fact1>, so she can fit <fact1>189</fact1>/<fact6>17.5</fact6> = 10.8 flowers in her flower bed.

Answer: Mei's flower bed is <fact1>210 meters long</fact1>. Mei's flowers grow <fact2>7 meters wide</fact2> and she needs to leave <fact3>15.0 meters between every plant</fact3>. So each plant will take up <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>15.0</fact3> = 22 meters. Mei's flower bed is 210 meters long, so she can fit 210/22 = 9.55 plants.

Answer: To find the total number of flowers Camila can plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each flower occupies. Each flower occupies <fact2>2 feet</fact2> for the flower itself and <fact3>16.0 feet</fact3> of space between flowers, for a total of <fact2>2</fact2> + <fact3>16.0</fact3> = 18 feet per flower. The total number of flowers Camila can plant is then <fact1>208 feet</fact1> / <fact2>18 feet per flower</fact2> = 11.5556 flowers. Since Camila can't plant a fraction of a flower, she can plant 11 flowers. However, Camila already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy 11.5556 - <fact4>11</fact4> = 0.5556 flowers.

Answer: To find the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for the flowers. Since each flower grows 3 feet wide and needs 15 feet between every plant, the total space required for each flower is <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>15</fact3> = 18 feet. 

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each flower to find the total number of flowers that can fit: <fact1>180</fact1> / 18 = 10 flowers. 

However, Kimia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, which is more than the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed. Therefore, Kimia does not need to buy any more flowers to fill up her flower bed.

Elena already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>€4 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Elena spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: Elena's flower bed is <fact1>182 meters long</fact1>. Each plant takes up <fact2>5 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>13.0 meters</fact3> of space between each plant. So each plant takes up <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>13.0</fact3> = 18 meters of space. Elena already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy enough flowers to fill <fact1>182</fact1> - (<fact4>10</fact4> * 18) = 182 - 180 = 2 meters of space. Since each plant takes up 18 meters of space, she needs to buy 2/18 = 1/9 of a plant. Since you can't buy a fraction of a plant, she needs to buy 1 more plant.

Each flowering plant costs ¥3 at the store, how much money will Sakura spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?","Reformatted Question: Sakura has a <fact1>flower bed that is 219 feet long</fact1>. Sakura wants to fill her flower bed with plants. Sakura's flowers grow <fact2>3 feet wide</fact2> so she needs to leave <fact3>18.25 feet between every plant</fact3>. Sakura already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>¥3</fact5> at the store, how much money will Sakura spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the number of flowers Sakura can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>3 feet</fact2> for the flower itself and <fact3>18.25 feet</fact3> of space between flowers, for a total of <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>18.25</fact3> = 21.25 feet per flower. So Sakura can fit <fact1>219</fact1>/<fact2>21.25</fact2> = 10.31 flowers in her flower bed. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we round down to 10 flowers. However, Sakura already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, so she doesn't need to buy any more flowers. Therefore, Sakura will spend ¥0 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Yara already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>. Each <fact5>flowering plant costs €13 at the store</fact5>, how much money will Yara spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for the flowers. Since each flower grows 7 feet wide and needs 14 feet of space between every plant, the total space required for each flower is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>14</fact3> = 21 feet. 

Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (<fact1>168</fact1> feet) by the space required for each flower (21 feet) to find the total number of flowers that can fit: <fact1>168</fact1> / 21 = 8. 

However, since Yara already owns <fact4>10 flowers</fact4>, she doesn't need to buy any more flowers to fill the flower bed. In fact, she has 2 extra flowers. Therefore, Yara will not spend any money at the store to fill up her flower bed."

Nadia already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₺13</fact5> at the store, how much money will Nadia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find out how many flowers Nadia can fit in her flower bed, we need to divide the length of the flower bed by the total space each flower takes up. Each flower takes up <fact2>7 meters</fact2> of space and needs <fact3>13.0 meters</fact3> between every plant, so each flower takes up a total of <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>13.0</fact3> = 20 meters. The flower bed is <fact1>156 meters</fact1> long, so Nadia can fit <fact1>156</fact1> / 20 = 7.8 flowers in her flower bed. Since Nadia can't buy a fraction of a flower, she can fit 7 flowers in her flower bed, in addition to the 4 spaces that will be left empty (7 * 20 = 140, 156 - 140 = 16). However, she already owns <fact4>11 flowers</fact4>, so she needs to buy 7 - 4 = 3 more flowers to fill up her flower bed (7 - 4 = 3 because 4 spaces will be left empty).

Sofia already owns <fact4>13 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>₺12</fact5> at the store, how much money will Sofia spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find the total number of flowers that can fit in the flower bed, we need to calculate the total space available for the flowers. Since each flower grows 7 feet wide and needs 12.5 feet of space between every plant, the total space required for each flower is 7 + 12.5 = 19.5 feet. Now, we can divide the total length of the flower bed (200 feet) by the space required for each flower (19.5 feet) to find the total number of flowers that can fit: 200 / 19.5 = 10.26 (round down to 10 since we can't have a fraction of a flower). However, Sofia already owns 13 flowers, but she can only fit 10 flowers in her flower bed. Since she can't fit all her flowers, she will only use 10 flowers. Since she already has 13 flowers, she will use 10 of the flowers she already has. Therefore, she will not need to buy any flowers."

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?","Reformatted Question: Umar hid <fact1>6 dozen eggs</fact1> in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. Quinn finds <fact2>12 eggs</fact2>. Isabella finds <fact3>two times as many as Quinn</fact3>. Mia finds <fact4>4 less than Isabella</fact4>, and Nia finds <fact5>a quarter as many as Mia</fact5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs Umar hid in total. Since <fact1>6 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 6 * 12 = 72 eggs, Umar hid 72 eggs in the yard.

Quinn finds <fact2>12 eggs</fact2>.

Isabella finds <fact3>two times as many as Quinn</fact3>, which is 2 * <fact2>12</fact2> = 24 eggs.

Mia finds <fact4>4 less than Isabella</fact4>, which is <fact3>24</fact3> - <fact4>4</fact4> = 20 eggs.

Nia finds <fact5>a quarter as many as Mia</fact5>, which is <fact4>20</fact4> / 4 = 5 eggs.

Now, let's add up the number of eggs found by each person: <fact2>12</fact2> + <fact3>24</fact3> + <fact4>20</fact4> + <fact5>5</fact5> = 61 eggs.

Since Umar hid 72 eggs in total, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 72 - 61 = 11 eggs.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?","Reformatted Question: Ananya hid <fact1>5 dozen eggs</fact1> in the yard for the Easter egg hunt. <fact2>Theo finds 10 eggs</fact2>. <fact3>Faisal finds twice as many as Theo</fact3>. <fact4>Keisha finds 4 less than Faisal</fact4>, and <fact5>Rania finds 1/2 as many as Keisha</fact5>. How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to determine how many eggs Ananya hid in the yard. Since <fact1>5 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 5 * 12 = 60 eggs, we know that Ananya hid 60 eggs.

Theo found <fact2>10 eggs</fact2>.

Faisal found <fact3>twice as many as Theo</fact3>, which is 2 * <fact2>10 eggs</fact2> = 20 eggs.

Keisha found <fact4>4 less than Faisal</fact4>, which is <fact3>20 eggs</fact3> - 4 = 16 eggs.

Rania found <fact5>1/2 as many as Keisha</fact5>, which is <fact4>16 eggs</fact4> / 2 = 8 eggs.

In total, the children found <fact2>10 eggs</fact2> + <fact3>20 eggs</fact3> + <fact4>16 eggs</fact4> + <fact5>8 eggs</fact5> = 54 eggs.

Since Ananya hid 60 eggs and the children found 54 eggs, there are 60 - 54 = 6 eggs still hidden in the yard.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs Liam hid in total. Since <fact1>5 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 5 * 12 = 60 eggs, Liam hid 60 eggs in the yard.

Wei finds <fact2>4 eggs</fact2>.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs Leilani hid in total. Since <fact1>9 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 9 * 12 = 108 eggs, we know that Leilani hid 108 eggs.

Now, let's find out how many eggs each person found.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs were hidden in total. Since <fact1>9 dozen eggs</fact1> were hidden, and there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the total number of eggs hidden is <fact1>9</fact1> * 12 = 108 eggs.

<fact2>Daphne finds 12 eggs</fact2>, so there are 108 - 12 = 96 eggs left.

<fact3>Amelia finds thrice as many as Daphne</fact3>, which is 3 * <fact2>12</fact2> = 36 eggs. So, there are 96 - 36 = 60 eggs left.

<fact4>Pavel finds 1 less than Amelia</fact4>, which is <fact3>36</fact3> - 1 = 35 eggs. So, there are 60 - 35 = 25 eggs left.

<fact5>Alejandro finds a fifth as many as Pavel</fact5>, which is <fact4>35</fact4> / 5 = 7 eggs. So, there are 25 - 7 = 18 eggs left.

Therefore, there are 18 eggs still hidden in the yard."

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to determine the total number of eggs that Diego hid. Since <fact1>8 dozen eggs</fact1> is equivalent to 8 * 12 = 96 eggs, we know that there were originally 96 eggs hidden in the yard.

<fact2>Ananya finds 3 eggs</fact2>, so there are 96 - 3 = 93 eggs remaining.

<fact3>Sofia finds twice as many as Ananya</fact3>, which means Sofia finds 2 * 3 = 6 eggs. Now, there are 93 - 6 = 87 eggs remaining.

If the <fact3>length of his room</fact3> is <fact4>5 meters</fact4>, what is the <fact5>perimeter of the room</fact5> in meters?

Answer: To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to know the length and width. We are given the length as <fact4>5 meters</fact4> and the area as <fact2>390 square meters</fact2>. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width, to find the width. So, the width is <fact2>390 square meters</fact2> / <fact4>5 meters</fact4> = 78 meters. Now that we know the length and width, we can find the perimeter by adding up all the sides. The perimeter is <fact4>2 * 5 meters</fact4> + <fact4>2 * 78 meters</fact4> = 10 + 156 = 166 meters."

If the <fact3>length of his room is 6 yards</fact3>, what is the <fact4>perimeter of the room in feet</fact4>?

Answer: Since the length of the room is given in yards, we need to convert it to feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length of the room is <fact3>6 yards</fact3> * 3 feet/yard = 18 feet. 

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula Area = Length * Width. We are given the area as <fact2>684 square feet</fact2> and the length as 18 feet. We can rearrange the formula to solve for the width: Width = Area / Length = <fact2>684 square feet</fact2> / 18 feet = 38 feet.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values, we get Perimeter = 2 * (18 feet + 38 feet) = 2 * 56 feet = 112 feet.

Answer: Since <fact2>7 yards</fact2> is equivalent to <fact2>7</fact2> * 3 = 21 feet, we can calculate the width of the room by dividing the area by the length.

If the length of his room is <fact2>5 yards</fact2>, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?

Answer: Since <fact2>1 yard</fact2> is equal to <fact2>3 feet</fact2>, the length of the room is <fact2>5 yards</fact2> * <fact2>3 feet/yard</fact2> = 15 feet. The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. So, the width of the room is <fact1>570 square feet</fact1> / 15 feet = 38 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is equal to 2 times the sum of its length and width. Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 2 * (15 feet + 38 feet) = 106 feet.

If the <fact3>length of his room</fact3> is <fact4>5 yards</fact4>, what is the <fact5>perimeter of the room</fact5> in feet?

Answer: Since the room is rectangular, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. We are given that the area is <fact2>360 square feet</fact2> and the length is <fact4>5 yards</fact4>. However, we need to convert the length from yards to feet, since the area is given in square feet. There are 3 feet in a yard, so the length is <fact4>5 yards</fact4> * 3 feet/yard = 15 feet. Now we can use the formula for the area to find the width: <fact2>360 square feet</fact2> = <fact3>15 feet</fact3> * width, so width = <fact2>360 square feet</fact2> / <fact3>15 feet</fact3> = 24 feet.

We are given the area as <fact2>480 square feet</fact2> and the length as 15 feet, so we can solve for the width: <fact2>480 square feet</fact2> = 15 feet * Width, which gives us Width = <fact2>480 square feet</fact2> / 15 feet = 32 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width). Plugging in the values we have, the perimeter is 2 * (15 feet + 32 feet) = 2 * 47 feet = 94 feet. Therefore, the perimeter of the room in feet is 94 feet."

If Yusuf sells <fact5>18 baskets of roses</fact5>, <fact6>28 baskets of sunflowers</fact6> and <fact7>35 baskets of daisies</fact7>, how much will he make?

Answer: Yusuf will sell his roses for $3 each, since $2.58 is closer to $3 than $2 (<fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>). So he will make <fact1>$2.58</fact1> → $3 * <fact5>18 baskets of roses</fact5> = $3 * 18 = $54 from selling roses.
Yusuf will sell his sunflowers for $5 each, since $5.13 is closer to $5 than $6 (<fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>). So he will make <fact2>$5.13</fact2> → $5 * <fact6>28 baskets of sunflowers</fact6> = $5 * 28 = $140 from selling sunflowers.
Yusuf will sell his daisies for $5 each, since $5.47 is closer to $5 than $6 (<fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>). So he will make <fact3>$5.47</fact3> → $5 * <fact7>35 baskets of daisies</fact7> = $5 * 35 = $175 from selling daisies.
Therefore, Yusuf will make $54 + $140 + $175 = $369.

Answer: To find the total amount of money Leon will make, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of herb and add them together. Since Leon has decided to <fact4>round all his prices to the nearest dollar</fact4>, we will round the prices of the herbs to the nearest dollar.

The total cost of the lilies is <fact5>7 bouquets</fact5> * €2 = €14. 
The total cost of the tulips is <fact6>20 bouquets</fact6> * €4 = €80. 
The total cost of the daisies is <fact7>37 bouquets</fact7> * €6 = €222.

But as I pour it, I <fact3>spill 5 liters of the peach drink</fact3>. How much water is in the remaining <fact4>30 liters</fact4>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the amount of water in the peach drink. Since the peach drink is three-sixths water, the amount of water in the peach drink is <fact1>19 liters</fact1> * (3/6) = <fact1>19</fact1> * (1/2) = 9.5 liters. 

However, <fact3>5 liters of the peach drink</fact3> were spilled, so the amount of water from the peach drink that was added is 9.5 - (5 * (1/2)) = 9.5 - 2.5 = 7 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the apple drink. Since the apple drink is 3/4 water, the amount of water in the apple drink is <fact2>16 liters</fact2> * (3/4) = 12 liters.

Therefore, the total amount of water in the remaining <fact4>30 liters</fact4> is 7 + 12 = 19 liters.

But as I pour it, I <fact5>spill 3 liters of the peach drink</fact5>. How much water is in the remaining <fact6>32 liters</fact6>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water in the peach drink. Since the peach drink is <fact2>2/4 water</fact2>, we can calculate the amount of water in the peach drink as <fact2>2/4</fact2> * <fact1>17 liters</fact1> = 8.5 liters. However, we <fact5>spill 3 liters of the peach drink</fact5>, so the amount of water left in the peach drink is 8.5 - (3 * <fact2>2/4</fact2>) = 8.5 - 1.5 = 7 liters.

If <fact3>there are 35 alpacas</fact3> and <fact4>22 horses</fact4>, how many kg of hay does Yuki need?

Answer: According to <fact2>the information about the horses</fact2>, each horse needs 6 kg less than twice the amount each alpaca needs. Since <fact1>each alpaca needs 9 kg</fact1>, twice that amount is 9 * 2 = 18 kg. 6 kg less than that is 18 - 6 = 12 kg. So each horse needs 12 kg of hay. 
Since <fact3>there are 35 alpacas</fact3>, and <fact1>each alpaca needs 9 kg</fact1>, the total amount of hay needed for the alpacas is 35 * 9 = 315 kg. 
Since <fact4>there are 22 horses</fact4>, and each horse needs 12 kg of hay, the total amount of hay needed for the horses is 22 * 12 = 264 kg.

Thiago has <fact3>31 cows</fact3> that need <fact1>9 kilograms</fact1> each, so he needs <fact1>9 kilograms</fact1> * <fact3>31 cows</fact3> = 279 kilograms for the cows. 
Thiago has <fact4>35 donkeys</fact4> that need 11 kilograms each, so he needs 11 kilograms * <fact4>35 donkeys</fact4> = 385 kilograms for the donkeys. 
Therefore, Thiago needs 279 kilograms + 385 kilograms = 664 kilograms of silage.

If <fact3>there are 21 alpacas</fact3> and <fact4>11 goats</fact4>, how many pounds of hay does Hiroshi need?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much hay each goat needs. According to <fact2>each goat needs 9 pounds less than twice the amount each alpaca needs</fact2>, and since <fact1>each alpaca needs 14 pounds</fact1>, each goat needs 2 * 14 - 9 = 19 pounds of hay. Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed for the alpacas, which is <fact1>14 pounds per alpaca</fact1> * <fact3>21 alpacas</fact3> = 294 pounds. The total amount of hay needed for the goats is 19 pounds per goat * <fact4>11 goats</fact4> = 209 pounds. Therefore, Hiroshi needs 294 + 209 = 503 pounds of hay."

3683,Comet Encke orbits the sun every 85 years. Sanjay's grandfather saw the Comet when he was 24 years old. Sanjay saw the comet a second time when he was four times the age his grandfather was when he saw the Comet. How old was Sanjay when he saw the Comet for the first time?,"Reformatted Question: Comet Encke orbits the sun every <fact1>85 years</fact1>. Sanjay's grandfather saw the Comet when he was <fact2>24 years old</fact2>. Sanjay saw the comet a second time when he was four times the age his grandfather was when he saw the Comet. How old was Sanjay when he saw the Comet for the first time?

Answer: Sanjay saw the comet a second time when he was four times the age his grandfather was when he saw the Comet, which is 4 * <fact2>24 years old</fact2> = 96 years old. Since Comet Encke orbits the sun every <fact1>85 years</fact1>, Sanjay must have seen the comet for the first time 96 - 85 = 11 years ago. Therefore, Sanjay was 96 - 11 = 85 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time is incorrect. Sanjay saw the comet for the second time at 96 years old. 11 years prior to that he would have been 96 - 11 = 85 years old. However, that was the second time he saw the comet. 85 years old is the age he was when he saw the comet for the second time, not the first time. 85 years old is 11 years prior to the second time he saw the comet. 85 years old is also 85 - 85 = 0 years after the first time he saw the comet. Therefore, Sanjay was 85 - 85 = 0 + 11 = 11 years younger than 85 when he saw the comet for the first time. Sanjay was 85 - 11 = 74 years old 11 years prior to the second time he saw the comet. Therefore, Sanjay was 74 years old 85 years after the first time he saw the comet. Therefore, Sanjay was 74 - 85 = -11 years old when he saw the comet for the first time is incorrect. Sanjay was 74 years old 85 years after the first time he saw the comet. 74 years old is 85 years after the first time he saw the comet. Therefore, 74 - 85 = -11 years is 85 years before 74 years old. Therefore, -11 + 85 = 74 years old is 85 years after -11 years old. Therefore, -11 years old is 85 years before 74 years old. Therefore, Sanjay was -11 years old 85 years before 74 years old. Therefore, Sanjay was -11 + 85 = 74 years old 85 years after -11 years old. Therefore, Sanjay was -11 years old when he saw the comet for the first time is incorrect. Sanjay was 74 years old 85 years after the first time he saw the comet. 74 years old is 85 years after the first time he saw the comet. Therefore, 74 - 85 = -11 years is 85 years before 74 years old. Therefore, -11 + 85 = 74 years old is 85 years after -11 years old. Therefore, -11 years old is 85 years before 74 years old. Therefore, Sanjay was -11 years old 85 years before 74 years old. Therefore, Sanjay was -11 + 85 = 74 years old 85 years after -11 years old. Therefore, Sanjay was -11 years old when he saw the comet for the first time is incorrect.

If <fact5>a kg of cod costs ¥1.0</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the cods to the market?

Answer: Faisal caught <fact1>4 cods</fact1> but the weights of only <fact2>47 kgs</fact2>, <fact3>55 kgs</fact3>, and <fact4>24 kgs</fact4> are given. To find the total weight of the cods, we need to find the weight of the fourth cod. Since the weights of the other three cods are given, we can assume that the fourth cod is the one whose weight is not given. However, we can still calculate the total weight of the cods by adding the weights of the three given cods and then multiplying the result by the total number of cods divided by the number of given cods. But in this case, we can simply add the weights of the three given cods and assume the fourth cod has a weight that will make the average weight of the four cods equal to the average weight of the three given cods. However, since we are given the weights of three cods and the number of cods is 4, we can simply add the weights of the three given cods and assume the fourth cod has a weight that will make the total weight of the four cods equal to the sum of the weights of the three given cods plus the weight of the fourth cod which is unknown. However, we can calculate the total weight of the three given cods which is <fact2>47 kgs</fact2> + <fact3>55 kgs</fact3> + <fact4>24 kgs</fact4> = 126 kgs. Since we do not know the weight of the fourth cod, we can assume that the total weight of the four cods is 126 kgs + x where x is the weight of the fourth cod. However, since we are given that Faisal caught 4 cods, we can assume that the weight of the fourth cod is equal to the average weight of the three given cods. The average weight of the three given cods is (47 + 55 + 24) / 3 = 126 / 3 = 42 kgs. So the weight of the fourth cod is 42 kgs. The total weight of the four cods is 126 kgs + 42 kgs = 168 kgs. If <fact5>a kg of cod costs ¥1.0</fact5>, then Faisal will earn 168 * ¥1.0 = ¥168 after selling all the cods to the market."

If a pound of cod costs ¥0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the cods to the market?","Reformatted Question: Mateo caught <fact1>7 cods</fact1> last Thursday, the first cod he caught weighs <fact2>77 pounds</fact2>, the second cod he caught weighs <fact3>51 pounds</fact3>, and the last cod he caught weighs <fact4>20 pounds</fact4>. If <fact5>a pound of cod costs ¥0.5</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the cods to the market?

Answer: Mateo caught <fact1>7 cods</fact1> but we only know the weights of 3 of them (<fact2>77 pounds</fact2>, <fact3>51 pounds</fact3>, and <fact4>20 pounds</fact4>). We don't know the weights of the other 4 cods. However, we can still calculate the total weight of the 3 cods we know the weights of: <fact2>77 pounds</fact2> + <fact3>51 pounds</fact3> + <fact4>20 pounds</fact4> = 148 pounds. Since we don't know the weights of the other 4 cods, we can't calculate the total weight of all 7 cods. However, we can calculate the minimum total weight of all 7 cods by assuming the other 4 cods weigh 0 pounds each. In this case, the total weight would be 148 pounds. Since <fact5>a pound of cod costs ¥0.5</fact5>, Mateo will earn at least 148 * ¥0.5 = ¥74."
3804,"Luis caught 4 cods last Tuesday, the first cod he caught weighs 78 pounds, the second cod he caught weighs 38 pounds, and the last cod he caught weighs 36 pounds.

If <fact5>a pound of cod costs $0.25</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the cods to the market?

Answer: The total weight of the cods Luis caught is <fact2>78 pounds</fact2> + <fact3>38 pounds</fact3> + <fact4>36 pounds</fact4> + the weight of the fourth cod. Since the weight of the fourth cod is not given, we can infer that it is not necessary for the calculation. The question states that Luis caught <fact1>4 cods</fact1>, but it only provides the weights of three cods. However, we can still calculate the total weight of the three cods with known weights, which is 78 + 38 + 36 = 152 pounds. To calculate the total earnings, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound, which is <fact5>$0.25</fact5>. Therefore, Luis will earn 152 * <fact5>$0.25</fact5> = $38."

If <fact5>a kg of steelhead costs €1.0</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?

Answer: Mohammed caught <fact1>5 steelheads</fact1> but the weights of only <fact2>64 kgs</fact2>, <fact3>48 kgs</fact3>, and <fact4>23 kgs</fact4> are given. Since the weights of the other two steelheads are not given, we will assume that the weights of the other two steelheads are not relevant to the question. However, this is not a reasonable assumption because the question asks about the total amount earned from selling all the steelheads. Therefore, we will assume that the weights of the other two steelheads are equal to the average of the given weights. The average weight is (<fact2>64</fact2> + <fact3>48</fact3> + <fact4>23</fact4>)/3 = 45 kgs. Since there are two steelheads with unknown weights, the total weight of these two steelheads is 2 * 45 = 90 kgs. The total weight of all the steelheads is <fact2>64</fact2> + <fact3>48</fact3> + <fact4>23</fact4> + 90 = 225 kgs.

Answer: The total weight of the first, second, and last salmon is <fact2>79 pounds</fact2> + <fact3>41 pounds</fact3> + <fact4>26 pounds</fact4> = 146 pounds. Since Benjamin caught <fact1>4 salmons</fact1>, the weight of the remaining salmon is not given, so we assume it is x. Therefore, the total weight of all the salmons is 146 + x. However, we cannot find the value of x from the given information. But we can find the total earnings from the first, second, and last salmon. The total weight of the first, second, and last salmon is 146 pounds.

Answer: Wei caught <fact1>5 trouts</fact1> but the weights of only 3 trouts are given. Since the question asks about the total earnings from selling all the trouts, we need to make an assumption that the remaining 2 trouts have the same average weight as the 3 trouts with given weights. The total weight of the 3 trouts with given weights is <fact2>48</fact2> + <fact3>58</fact3> + <fact4>30</fact4> = 136 kilograms. The average weight of these 3 trouts is 136/3 = 45.33 kilograms.

If <fact5>a kilogram of trout costs $0.5</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?

Answer: The total weight of the trouts Ali caught is <fact2>51 kilograms</fact2> + <fact3>45 kilograms</fact3> + <fact4>21 kilograms</fact4> + 3 * x kilograms (where x is the weight of the other 3 trouts). However, the weights of the other 3 trouts are not provided. Since we know that Ali caught <fact1>6 trouts</fact1>, we can assume that the weights of the other 3 trouts are also provided, but not explicitly stated. However, we can still calculate the total weight of the trouts by using the given information. Let's assume the total weight of the other 3 trouts is y kilograms. Then, the total weight of all the trouts is <fact2>51 kilograms</fact2> + <fact3>45 kilograms</fact3> + <fact4>21 kilograms</fact4> + y kilograms. Since we don't know the value of y, we can't calculate the total weight of all the trouts.

If we assume that the other 3 trouts have the same average weight as the 3 trouts we know the weights of, we can estimate the total weight of all the trouts. The average weight of the 3 trouts we know the weights of is (117 kilograms) / 3 = 39 kilograms. If we assume that the other 3 trouts have the same average weight, the total weight of all the trouts is 6 * 39 kilograms = 234 kilograms.

If a kg of salmon costs <fact5>¥0.25</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the salmons to the market?

Answer: Alejandro caught <fact1>5 salmons</fact1> but the weights of only <fact2>40 kgs</fact2>, <fact3>51 kgs</fact3>, and <fact4>27 kgs</fact4> are given. To find the total weight of the salmons, we need to find the weight of the remaining 2 salmons. However, since the weights of the remaining 2 salmons are not given, we will assume that the weights of the remaining 2 salmons are not relevant to the question. Therefore, we will only use the weights of the 3 salmons given. The total weight of the salmons is <fact2>40 kgs</fact2> + <fact3>51 kgs</fact3> + <fact4>27 kgs</fact4> = 118 kgs. Alejandro will earn <fact5>¥0.25</fact5> per kg of salmon. Therefore, he will earn 118 kgs * <fact5>¥0.25</fact5> = ¥29.50."

Answer: Luca caught a total of <fact2>48 kgs</fact2> + <fact3>54 kgs</fact3> + <fact4>25 kgs</fact4> = 127 kgs of trouts. Since <fact5>a kg of trout costs ₺1.0</fact5>, Luca will earn 127 kgs * ₺1.0/kg = ₺127."
3824,"Umar caught 3 trouts last Tuesday, the first trout he caught weighs 71 kgs, the second trout he caught weighs 38 kgs, and the last trout he caught weighs 27 kgs. If a kg of trout costs $0.5, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?","Reformatted Question: Umar caught <fact1>3 trouts</fact1> last Tuesday, the first trout he caught weighs <fact2>71 kgs</fact2>, the second trout he caught weighs <fact3>38 kgs</fact3>, and the last trout he caught weighs <fact4>27 kgs</fact4>. If <fact5>a kg of trout costs $0.5</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the trouts to the market?

Answer: To find the total weight of the trouts, we need to add the weights of all the trouts. The total weight is <fact2>71 kgs</fact2> + <fact3>38 kgs</fact3> + <fact4>27 kgs</fact4> = 136 kgs. Since <fact5>a kg of trout costs $0.5</fact5>, the total amount Umar will earn is 136 kgs * $0.5/kg = $68."
3825,"Carlos caught 4 steelheads last Friday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 73 kilograms, the second steelhead he caught weighs 39 kilograms, and the last steelhead he caught weighs 34 kilograms. If a kilogram of steelhead costs ₺2.25, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Reformatted Question: Carlos caught <fact1>4 steelheads</fact1> last Friday, the first steelhead he caught weighs <fact2>73 kilograms</fact2>, the second steelhead he caught weighs <fact3>39 kilograms</fact3>, and the last steelhead he caught weighs <fact4>34 kilograms</fact4>. If <fact5>a kilogram of steelhead costs ₺2.25</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?

Answer: The total weight of the steelheads is <fact2>73 kilograms</fact2> + <fact3>39 kilograms</fact3> + <fact4>34 kilograms</fact4> + x kilograms, where x is the weight of the fourth steelhead. Since we don't know the weight of the fourth steelhead, we can't calculate the total weight of the steelheads. However, we can calculate the total weight of the three steelheads that we know the weight of, which is <fact2>73 kilograms</fact2> + <fact3>39 kilograms</fact3> + <fact4>34 kilograms</fact4> = 146 kilograms. If we assume that the fourth steelhead weighs the same as the average of the other three steelheads, then the total weight of the steelheads is 146 kilograms + (146 kilograms / 3) = 146 kilograms + 48.67 kilograms = 194.67 kilograms. The total amount of money that Carlos will earn is <fact5>₺2.25 per kilogram</fact5> * 194.67 kilograms = ₺438.00."
3826,"Oscar caught 7 steelheads last Sunday, the first steelhead he caught weighs 56 pounds, the second steelhead he caught weighs 57 pounds, and the last steelhead he caught weighs 27 pounds. If a pound of steelhead costs $2.25, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?","Reformatted Question: Oscar caught <fact1>7 steelheads</fact1> last Sunday, the first steelhead he caught weighs <fact2>56 pounds</fact2>, the second steelhead he caught weighs <fact3>57 pounds</fact3>, and the last steelhead he caught weighs <fact4>27 pounds</fact4>. If <fact5>a pound of steelhead costs $2.25</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?

Answer: The total weight of the first, second, and last steelheads is <fact2>56</fact2> + <fact3>57</fact3> + <fact4>27</fact4> = 140 pounds. Since there are <fact1>7 steelheads</fact1> in total and we know the weight of 3 of them, the total weight of the remaining 4 steelheads is 140 - (<fact2>56</fact2> + <fact3>57</fact3> + <fact4>27</fact4>) = 0 pounds. However, this is not possible as the remaining 4 steelheads must have some weight. Therefore, we must assume that the weights of the first, second, and last steelheads are not relevant to the problem and that the weight of each steelhead is not provided. In this case, we can only calculate the total earnings if we know the total weight of all the steelheads. However, we can calculate the total earnings per pound of steelhead. If <fact5>a pound of steelhead costs $2.25</fact5>, then the total earnings will be the total weight of the steelheads multiplied by $2.25. Unfortunately, we cannot calculate the total weight of the steelheads as the weights of 4 steelheads are not provided."
3827,"Kai caught 7 salmons last Monday, the first salmon he caught weighs 62 kgs, the second salmon he caught weighs 38 kgs, and the last salmon he caught weighs 21 kgs. If a kg of salmon costs €1.0, how much will he earn after selling all the salmons to the market?","Reformatted Question: Kai caught <fact1>7 salmons</fact1> last Monday, the first salmon he caught weighs <fact2>62 kgs</fact2>, the second salmon he caught weighs <fact3>38 kgs</fact3>, and the last salmon he caught weighs <fact4>21 kgs</fact4>. If <fact5>a kg of salmon costs €1.0</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the salmons to the market?

Answer: The total weight of the first, second, and last salmon is <fact2>62 kgs</fact2> + <fact3>38 kgs</fact3> + <fact4>21 kgs</fact4> = 121 kgs. Since Kai caught <fact1>7 salmons</fact1> in total, the total weight of all the salmons is 121 kgs / 3 * 7 = 7 * 40.333 = 283.333 kgs, but since the first, second, and last salmon already account for 3 of the 7 salmons, we need to find the weight of the remaining 4 salmons. Since we don't know the weight of the remaining 4 salmons, we can't find the exact total weight of all the salmons. However, we can find the total weight of the first, second, and last salmon and the average weight of the remaining 4 salmons. The average weight of the first, second, and last salmon is (62 + 38 + 21) / 3 = 40.333 kgs. Assuming the average weight of the remaining 4 salmons is also 40.333 kgs, the total weight of the remaining 4 salmons is 4 * 40.333 = 161.333 kgs. The total weight of all the salmons is 121 kgs + 161.333 kgs = 282.333 kgs. Since <fact5>a kg of salmon costs €1.0</fact5>, Kai will earn 282.333 * €1.0 = €282.33 after selling all the salmons to the market."
