0,Rania saw a 210-foot whale with 7 72-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"Reformatted Question: Rania saw a <fact1>210-foot whale</fact1> with <fact2>7</fact2> <fact3>72-inch remoras</fact3> attached to it. What percentage of the <fact1>whale's body length</fact1> is the combined length of the <fact3>remoras</fact3>?

Answer: First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the length of each remora is <fact3>72 inches</fact3> / 12 = 6 feet. There are <fact2>7</fact2> remoras, so their combined length is 6 feet * <fact2>7</fact2> = 42 feet. To find the percentage of the whale's body length that the remoras cover, we divide the combined length of the remoras (42 feet) by the length of the whale (<fact1>210 feet</fact1>) and multiply by 100. This gives us (42 / <fact1>210</fact1>) * 100 = 20%.

1,Olivia saw a 10-foot dolphin with 8 3-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"Reformatted Question: Olivia saw a <fact1>10-foot dolphin</fact1> with <fact2>8 3-inch remoras</fact2> attached to it. What percentage of the <fact3>dolphin's body length</fact3> is the combined length of the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to convert the length of the dolphin from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the dolphin is <fact1>10 feet</fact1> * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches long. The combined length of the remoras is <fact2>8 remoras</fact2> * 3 inches/remora = 24 inches. To find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that the remoras cover, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the dolphin and multiply by 100: (24 inches / 120 inches) * 100 = 20%. So, the combined length of the remoras is 20% of the <fact3>dolphin's body length</fact3>.

2,Jamal saw a 380-foot whale with 8 57-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"Reformatted Question: Jamal saw a <fact1>380-foot whale</fact1> with <fact2>8 57-inch remoras</fact2> attached to it. What percentage of the <fact3>whale's body length</fact3> is the combined length of the remoras?

Answer: First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the length of each remora is <fact2>57 inches</fact2> / 12 = 4.75 feet. There are <fact2>8 remoras</fact2>, so the combined length of the remoras is 8 * 4.75 = 38 feet. To find the percentage of the <fact3>whale's body length</fact3> that the remoras cover, we divide the combined length of the remoras (38 feet) by the length of the <fact1>whale (380 feet)</fact1> and multiply by 100. This gives us (38 / 380) * 100 = 10%.

6,Luis is rolling a 4-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Luis is rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we first need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>, which is 4. There are 2 numbers greater than 2 on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>, which are 3 and 4. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 0.5.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, we need to multiply the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are 2 odd numbers on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>, which are 1 and 3. So, the probability of rolling an odd number on each roll is 2/4 = 0.5. The probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

7,Carlos is rolling a twelve-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Carlos is rolling a <fact1>twelve-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are 9 numbers greater than 3 on a <fact1>twelve-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 9/12 = 0.75. 
To roll <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 6/12 = 0.5, and the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 6/12 = 0.5. So, the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. 
The difference in probabilities is 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5. 
Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.5 * 100% = 50%.

8,Hiroshi is rolling a d10 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Hiroshi is rolling a <fact1>d10 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are 10 possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>d10 die</fact1>, and 8 of them are greater than 2. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 8/10 = 0.8. 
To roll <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2>, the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 5/10 = 0.5, and the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 5/10 = 0.5. So the probability of rolling <fact2>two odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. 
The difference in probability is 0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55, which is equivalent to 55%.

How many like to paint if the number that like to bake is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing badminton</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students like to bake. Since the number that like to bake is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing badminton</fact4>, and <fact3>2 students like to play badminton</fact3>, then 2 * 2 = 4 students like to bake. Now we know that <fact2>35 students like to dance</fact2>, 4 like to bake, and <fact3>2 like to play badminton</fact3>. So the number of students that like to paint is <fact1>54 students</fact1> - 35 - 4 - 2 = 13.

If his farm truck can carry 180 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of apples, wheats, cucumbers and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys <fact1>five 3-kg boxes of them</fact1> for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact2>thirteen 6-kg bags</fact2>. Apples are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys <fact3>thirty one 42-kg packs</fact3>. Wheats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys <fact4>fifteen 15-kg sacks</fact4>. If his farm truck can <fact5>carry 180 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together. 
The weight of oats is <fact1>five 3-kg boxes</fact1> = 5 * 3 = 15 kg. 
The weight of cucumbers is <fact2>thirteen 6-kg bags</fact2> = 13 * 6 = 78 kg.

He buys a variety of wheats, hay, beets and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys <fact1>four 4-pound boxes of them</fact1> for the whole stable. He only wants enough beets to feed the pigs while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact2>twelve 8-pound bags</fact2>. Wheats are the main diet of his pigs, so he buys <fact3>thirty two 37-pound packs</fact3>. Hay are a staple to supplement the wheats, so he buys <fact4>nineteen 16-pound sacks</fact4>. If his farm truck can <fact5>carry 200 pounds at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: The farmer buys <fact1>four 4-pound boxes of oats</fact1>, which is 4 x 4 = 16 pounds of oats. He buys <fact2>twelve 8-pound bags of beets</fact2>, which is 12 x 8 = 96 pounds of beets. He buys <fact3>thirty two 37-pound packs of wheats</fact3>, which is 32 x 37 = 1184 pounds of wheats. He buys <fact4>nineteen 16-pound sacks of hay</fact4>, which is 19 x 16 = 304 pounds of hay. In total, the farmer buys 16 + 96 + 1184 + 304 = 1600 pounds of feed.

If his farm truck can carry 190 kgs at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of hay, corns, cucumbers and wheats. Since <fact1>wheats are a rare treat, he only buys four 6-kg boxes of them</fact1> for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so <fact2>he buys fifteen 8-kg bags</fact2>. <fact3>Hay are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty two 43-kg packs</fact3>. <fact4>Corns are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 19-kg sacks</fact4>. If <fact5>his farm truck can carry 190 kgs at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To find the total weight of the feed, we need to calculate the weight of each type of feed and add them together. 
The weight of the wheats is <fact1>4 boxes</fact1> * <fact1>6 kg/box</fact1> = 24 kg. 
The weight of the cucumbers is <fact2>15 bags</fact2> * <fact2>8 kg/bag</fact2> = 120 kg. 
The weight of the hay is <fact3>32 packs</fact3> * <fact3>43 kg/pack</fact3> = 1376 kg. 
The weight of the corns is <fact4>20 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>19 kg/sack</fact4> = 380 kg. 
The total weight of the feed is 24 kg + 120 kg + 1376 kg + 380 kg = 1900 kg. 
Since <fact5>the farm truck can carry 190 kg at a time</fact5>, the farmer will need to make 1900 kg / 190 kg = 10 trips to transport all the feed.

On the sidewalk, Mia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Mia walks <fact1>24 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>12 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Mia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Mia walks <fact2>12 kilometers on the beach</fact2> in <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>, her speed on the beach is <fact2>12 kilometers</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = 0.2 kilometers per minute. Since she walks <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.2 = 0.4 kilometers per minute. To walk <fact3>12 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>, it will take her <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> / 0.4 kilometers per minute = 30 minutes.

If <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: To find the time it takes for Daphne to complete the entire walk, we need to find the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk and add it to the time it takes for her to walk on the beach. We are given that <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. We can find the rate at which Daphne walks on the beach by dividing the distance she walks on the beach by the time it takes her to walk on the beach. This gives us a rate of <fact2>16 kilometers</fact2> / <fact5>64 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Since Daphne walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her rate on the sidewalk is 3 x 0.25 = 0.75 kilometers per minute. We can now find the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk by dividing the distance she walks on the sidewalk by her rate on the sidewalk. This gives us <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> / 0.75 kilometers per minute = 16 minutes.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: To find the time it takes for Nadia to complete the entire walk, we need to find the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk and add it to the time it takes for her to walk on the beach. We are given that <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. We know that the distance walked on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2>, so the rate of speed on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = 1/6 kilometers per minute. Since Nadia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4> on the sidewalk, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. The distance walked on the sidewalk is <fact3>16 kilometers</fact3>, so the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk is <fact3>16 kilometers</fact3> / (2/3 kilometers per minute) = 24 minutes.

Since <fact5>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact5>, the hours watched on Thursday is 23 - 22.25 = 0.75 hours. Since <fact2>each episode on Thursday is 45 minutes</fact2>, which is 0.75 hours, the number of episodes watched on Thursday is 0.75 / 0.75 = 1 episode.

64,"Luca watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Sunday and Monday, he watched a 4-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Tuesday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show. On Wednesday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show. On Thursday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 3-hour episodes. If he watched 19 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Tuesday?","Reformatted Question: Luca watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On <fact1>Sunday and Monday, he watched a 4-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact1>. On <fact2>Tuesday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Wednesday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Thursday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 3-hour episodes</fact4>. If <fact5>he watched 19 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Tuesday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours Luca watched on Sunday and Monday. Since <fact1>he watched 4 hours each night</fact1>, that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours. On Wednesday, <fact3>he watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show</fact3>, which is 4 + 0.75 = 4.75 hours. On Thursday, <fact4>he watched two 3-hour episodes</fact4>, which is 3 * 2 = 6 hours. Now, let's add up the hours we know: 8 + 4.75 + 6 = 18.75 hours. Since <fact5>he watched 19 hours of TV in all</fact5>, that means he watched 19 - 18.75 = 0.25 hours on Tuesday. Since <fact2>each episode on Tuesday was 15 minutes</fact2>, we need to convert 0.25 hours to minutes: 0.25 * 60 = 15 minutes. Since 15 minutes is equal to one 15-minute episode, Luca watched 15/15 = 1 episode on Tuesday.

On Friday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes. If he watched 23 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","Reformatted Question: Hiroshi watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On <fact1>Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 6-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact1>. On <fact2>Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 30-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Friday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes</fact4>. If <fact5>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Answer: On <fact1>Monday and Tuesday</fact1>, Hiroshi watched 2 * 6 = 12 hours of TV. On <fact3>Thursday</fact3>, he watched 3 hours + 0.5 hours = 3.5 hours of TV. On <fact4>Friday</fact4>, he watched 2 * 2 = 4 hours of TV. So, the total hours of TV watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday is 12 + 3.5 + 4 = 19.5 hours. Since <fact5>he watched 23 hours of TV in all</fact5>, he must have watched 23 - 19.5 = 3.5 hours of TV on <fact2>Wednesday</fact2>. Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes or 0.5 hours, the number of episodes watched on Wednesday is 3.5 / 0.5 = 7 episodes.

How many spoons were in the package that Emma bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Emma bought as x. Emma's husband bought <fact2>a package of 18 new spoons</fact2> and gave them to Emma. Emma then <fact3>used ten of the spoons to sample her stuffed peppers</fact3>. So the total number of spoons Emma had after using 10 spoons is x + <fact2>18</fact2> - <fact3>10</fact3>. We know that <fact4>she had a total of 30 spoons</fact4> when she went to set the table. Therefore, x + <fact2>18</fact2> - <fact3>10</fact3> = <fact4>30</fact4>.

How many plates were in the package that Quinn bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of plates in the package that Quinn bought as x. We know that Quinn's husband bought <fact2>19 new plates</fact2> and Quinn used <fact3>7 plates</fact3> to sample her beef stew. So, the total number of plates that Quinn had initially (x) plus the number of plates her husband bought (<fact2>19</fact2>), minus the number of plates she used (<fact3>7</fact3>), should equal the total number of plates she had when she set the table (<fact4>30</fact4>).

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories you can still consume for the day. This is <fact3>2395</fact3> - <fact4>1350</fact4> = 1045 calories. Since each serving has <fact1>475 calories</fact1>, you can eat 1045 / <fact1>475</fact1> = 2.2 servings. Since a <fact2>275 ounces bag has 5 servings</fact2>, each serving is <fact2>275</fact2> / 5 = 55 ounces. Therefore, you can eat 2.2 * 55 = 121 ounces.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume for the day. This is <fact3>1905</fact3> - <fact4>1725</fact4> = 180 calories. Since each serving has <fact1>450 calories</fact1>, you can only eat 180 / <fact1>450</fact1> = 0.4 servings.
