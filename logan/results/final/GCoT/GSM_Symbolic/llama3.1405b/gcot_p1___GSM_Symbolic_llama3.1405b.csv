0,Sanjay saw a 60-foot dolphin with 16 12-inch remoras attached to it. But a quarter of the remoras go away. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras?,"Reformatted Question: Sanjay saw a <fact1>60-foot dolphin</fact1> with <fact2>16 12-inch remoras</fact2> attached to it. But <fact3>a quarter of the remoras go away</fact3>. What percentage of the <fact1>dolphin's body length</fact1> is the combined length of the remaining remoras?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many remoras are left after a quarter of them go away. Since <fact3>a quarter of the remoras go away</fact3>, that means 1/4 * <fact2>16 remoras</fact2> = 4 remoras leave. So, there are <fact2>16 remoras</fact2> - 4 remoras = 12 remoras left.

Next, we need to find the combined length of the remaining remoras. Since each remora is <fact2>12 inches</fact2> long, the combined length of the remaining remoras is 12 remoras * <fact2>12 inches</fact2> = 144 inches.

Now, we need to convert the combined length of the remaining remoras from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the combined length of the remaining remoras is 144 inches / 12 = 12 feet.

Finally, we need to find the percentage of the <fact1>dolphin's body length</fact1> that is the combined length of the remaining remoras. Since the <fact1>dolphin is 60 feet long</fact1>, the percentage is (12 feet / <fact1>60 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 20%.

The answer is {20}."
1,Tara saw a 70-foot dolphin with 14 12-inch remoras attached to it. But half of the remoras go away. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras?,"Reformatted Question: Tara saw a <fact1>70-foot dolphin</fact1> with <fact2>14 12-inch remoras</fact2> attached to it. But <fact3>half of the remoras go away</fact3>. What percentage of the <fact1>dolphin's body length</fact1> is the combined length of the remaining remoras?

Answer: First, we need to find the total length of the remaining remoras. Since <fact3>half of the remoras go away</fact3>, the number of remaining remoras is <fact2>14</fact2> / 2 = 7. The length of each remora is <fact2>12 inches</fact2>, so the total length of the remaining remoras is 7 * <fact2>12 inches</fact2> = 84 inches. We need to convert this to feet to match the units of the <fact1>dolphin's body length</fact1>. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 84 inches is equal to 84 / 12 = 7 feet. Now, we can find the percentage of the <fact1>dolphin's body length</fact1> that the combined length of the remaining remoras is. The percentage is (7 feet / <fact1>70 feet</fact1>) * 100% = 10%.

The answer is {10}."
2,Liam saw a 50-foot shark with 12 15-inch remoras attached to it. But 1/3 of the remoras go away. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remaining remoras?,"Reformatted Question: Liam saw a <fact1>50-foot shark</fact1> with <fact2>12 15-inch remoras</fact2> attached to it. But <fact3>1/3 of the remoras go away</fact3>. What percentage of the <fact1>shark's body length</fact1> is the combined length of the remaining remoras?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many remoras are left after 1/3 of them go away. Since there were originally <fact2>12 remoras</fact2>, 1/3 of them would be <fact2>12</fact2> * <fact3>1/3</fact3> = 4 remoras. So, there are <fact2>12</fact2> - 4 = 8 remoras left.

Next, we need to find the combined length of the remaining remoras. Since each remora is <fact2>15 inches</fact2> long, the combined length would be 8 * <fact2>15 inches</fact2> = 120 inches.

Now, we need to convert the combined length of the remoras from inches to feet, since the shark's body length is given in feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 120 inches would be 120 / 12 = 10 feet.

Finally, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remaining remoras represents. Since the shark is <fact1>50 feet</fact1> long, the percentage would be (10 / <fact1>50</fact1>) * 100 = 20%.

3,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 64 minutes to cover every 2 miles of the city. If the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover a tenth of the city?","Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. <fact1>It takes 64 minutes to cover every 2 miles of the city</fact1>. If <fact2>the city is 80 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact3>a tenth of the city</fact3>?

Answer: To find the time it takes to cover a tenth of the city, we first need to find the distance that is a tenth of the city. Since <fact2>the city is 80 miles across</fact2>, a tenth of the city is 80 / 10 = 8 miles. 

Since <fact1>it takes 64 minutes to cover every 2 miles of the city</fact1>, we can find the time it takes to cover 8 miles by setting up a proportion. If 2 miles takes 64 minutes, then 8 miles will take x minutes, where x is the time we are trying to find. 

Setting up the proportion, we have 2 miles / 64 minutes = 8 miles / x minutes. 

Cross-multiplying, we get 2x = 64 * 8. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 64 * 4 = 256 minutes.

The answer is {256}."
4,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 107 minutes to cover every 6 miles of the city. If the city is 60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/5 of the city?","Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>107 minutes to cover every 6 miles of the city</fact1>. If the city is <fact2>60 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact3>1/5 of the city</fact3>?

Answer: To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover <fact3>1/5 of the city</fact3>, we first need to find out how many miles <fact3>1/5 of the city</fact3> is. Since the city is <fact2>60 miles across</fact2>, <fact3>1/5 of the city</fact3> is 60 / 5 = 12 miles. 

Since it takes <fact1>107 minutes to cover every 6 miles of the city</fact1>, we can find out how many minutes it takes to cover 1 mile by dividing 107 by 6. This gives us 107 / 6 = 17.83 minutes per mile. 

Now, we can multiply the number of minutes it takes to cover 1 mile by the number of miles in <fact3>1/5 of the city</fact3> to find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover <fact3>1/5 of the city</fact3>. This gives us 17.83 * 12 = 214 minutes.

The answer is {214}."
5,"A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 113 minutes to cover every 2 miles of the city. If the city is 16 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/2 of the city?","Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>113 minutes to cover every 2 miles of the city</fact1>. If the city is <fact2>16 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover <fact3>1/2 of the city</fact3>?

Answer: To find the time it takes to cover <fact3>1/2 of the city</fact3>, we need to find out how many miles that is. Since the city is <fact2>16 miles across</fact2>, half of that would be <fact2>16</fact2>/2 = 8 miles. Now we know that it takes <fact1>113 minutes to cover every 2 miles</fact1>, so to cover 8 miles, it would take (<fact1>113</fact1>/2)*8 = 452 minutes, or (<fact1>113</fact1> * 8)/2 = 452 minutes, but more simply (<fact1>113</fact1> * 4) = 452 minutes.

6,Jamal is rolling a d12 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 6 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Jamal is rolling a <fact1>d12 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 6 than that he rolls <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 6 on a <fact1>d12 die</fact1>, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 6) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. There are 6 numbers greater than 6 on a <fact1>d12 die</fact1> (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), so the probability is 6/12 = 1/2.

To calculate the probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>, we need to calculate the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll and then raise it to the power of 4, since the rolls are independent. There are 6 odd numbers on a <fact1>d12 die</fact1> (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11), so the probability of rolling an odd number is 6/12 = 1/2. The probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2> is therefore (1/2)^4 = 1/16.

Now, we can calculate the difference in probabilities and express it as a percentage. The probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is 1/2, and the probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2> is 1/16. The difference is 1/2 - 1/16 = 7/16. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: (7/16) * 100 = 43.75%.

The answer is {43.75}."
7,Viktor is rolling a 4-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Viktor is rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are <fact1>4 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Three of these outcomes are greater than 1, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 3/4 or 0.75. 

To roll <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2>, Viktor must roll either 1 or 3 four times in a row. The probability of rolling an odd number on a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1> is 2/4 or 0.5, so the probability of rolling <fact2>four odd numbers in a row</fact2> is (0.5)^4 = 0.0625.

The difference between these two probabilities is 0.75 - 0.0625 = 0.6875. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.6875 * 100% = 68.75%.

The answer is {68.75}."
8,Wei is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls four even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Wei is rolling a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls <fact2>four even numbers in a row</fact2>?

Answer: There are 10 numbers greater than 10 on a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number is 10/20 = 0.5, so the probability of rolling <fact2>four even numbers in a row</fact2> is 0.5^4 = 0.0625. The difference in probabilities is 0.5 - 0.0625 = 0.4375. Expressed as a percentage, this is 0.4375 * 100% = 43.75%.

9,"A group of 190 students has various hobbies. 38 like to read, 22 like to play tennis, and the rest like to either hike or paint. How many like to hike if the number that like to paint is 5 less than two times the number that prefer playing tennis?","Reformatted Question: A group of <fact1>190 students</fact1> has various hobbies. <fact2>38 like to read</fact2>, <fact3>22 like to play tennis</fact3>, and the rest like to either hike or paint. How many like to hike if the number that like to paint is <fact4>5 less than two times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students who like to paint. We know that the number of students who like to paint is <fact4>5 less than two times the number that prefer playing tennis</fact4>. Since <fact3>22 students like to play tennis</fact3>, two times this number is 2 x <fact3>22</fact3> = 44. Therefore, the number of students who like to paint is 44 - 5 = 39.

Now, we can find the total number of students who like to read, play tennis, or paint. We know that <fact2>38 students like to read</fact2> and <fact3>22 students like to play tennis</fact3>. Adding these numbers to the number of students who like to paint (39), we get <fact2>38</fact2> + <fact3>22</fact3> + 39 = 99.

Since there are <fact1>190 students</fact1> in total, the number of students who like to hike is <fact1>190</fact1> - 99 = 91.

10,"A class of 280 students has various hobbies. 18 like to dance, 13 like to play hurling, and the rest like to either read or bake. How many like to read if the number that like to bake is 4 less than eight times the number that prefer playing hurling?","Reformatted Question: A class of <fact1>280 students</fact1> has various hobbies. <fact2>18 like to dance</fact2>, <fact3>13 like to play hurling</fact3>, and the rest like to either read or bake. How many like to read if the number that like to bake is <fact4>4 less than eight times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students who like to bake. Since the number that like to bake is <fact4>4 less than eight times the number that prefer playing hurling</fact4>, we can calculate this as 8 * <fact3>13</fact3> - 4 = 100 students who like to bake. Now, we can find the total number of students who like to dance, play hurling, or bake: <fact2>18</fact2> + <fact3>13</fact3> + 100 = 131 students. Since there are <fact1>280 students</fact1> in total, the number of students who like to read is <fact1>280</fact1> - 131 = 149 students.
The answer is {149}."
11,"A group of 260 students has various hobbies. 35 like to play video games, 17 like to play football, and the rest like to either paint or dance. How many like to paint if the number that like to dance is 7 less than twice the number that prefer playing football?","Reformatted Question: A group of <fact1>260 students</fact1> has various hobbies. <fact2>35 like to play video games</fact2>, <fact3>17 like to play football</fact3>, and the rest like to either paint or dance. How many like to paint if the number that like to dance is <fact4>7 less than twice the number that prefer playing football</fact4>?

Answer: First, let's find the number of students who like to dance. We know that the number of students who like to dance is <fact4>7 less than twice the number that prefer playing football</fact4>. Since <fact3>17 students like to play football</fact3>, twice that number is 2 x <fact3>17</fact3> = 34. Then, 7 less than that is 34 - 7 = 27. So, 27 students like to dance.

Now, let's find the total number of students who like to play video games or football. We know that <fact2>35 students like to play video games</fact2> and <fact3>17 students like to play football</fact3>. So, the total number of students who like to play video games or football is <fact2>35</fact2> + <fact3>17</fact3> = 52.

Since there are <fact1>260 students</fact1> in total, and 52 students like to play video games or football, and 27 students like to dance, the number of students who like to paint is <fact1>260</fact1> - 52 - 27 = 181.

15,"Kimia makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:21. She also uses 7 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water. If she used a total of 630 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.","Reformatted Question: Kimia makes tea using <fact1>teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 63:21</fact1>. She also uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 7 cups of water</fact2>. If she used a total of <fact3>630 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk</fact3>, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

Answer: Since the ratio of <fact1>sugar to water is 63:21</fact1>, and the ratio of <fact2>milk to water is 7:7</fact2> = 1:1, the overall ratio of sugar to water to milk is 63:21:21. Let's add these numbers up to get the total ratio: 63 + 21 + 21 = 105. Now we can divide the <fact3>total amount of ingredients (630)</fact3> by the total ratio (105) to get the multiplier: 630 / 105 = 6. Multiply this by the amount of sugar in the ratio (63) to get the total amount of sugar: 6 * 63 = 378.

16,"Ananya makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 66:48. She also uses 8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water. If she used a total of 810 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.","Reformatted Question: Ananya makes tea using <fact1>teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 66:48</fact1>. She also uses <fact2>8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water</fact2>. If she used a total of <fact3>810 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk</fact3>, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.

Answer: Let's start by analyzing the given ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 66:48</fact1>. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. This gives us a simplified ratio of 11:8.

We are also given that Ananya uses <fact2>8 tablespoons of milk for every 8 cups of water</fact2>. This means that the ratio of cups of water to tablespoons of milk is 8:8, or 1:1.

Let's say Ananya uses x cups of water. Then, she uses 11x/8 teaspoons of sugar (from the simplified ratio) and x tablespoons of milk.

We know that the total number of <fact3>teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk</fact3> is 810. We can set up an equation based on this:

11x/8 + x + x = 810

Combine like terms:

11x/8 + 2x = 810

Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fraction:

11x + 16x = 6480

Combine like terms:

27x = 6480

Divide both sides by 27:

x = 240

Now that we know x, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Ananya used:

11x/8 = 11(240)/8 = 330

The answer is {330}."

Answer: Let's start by using the information that Olga uses <fact2>7 tablespoons of milk for every 6 cups of water</fact2>. We can write this as a ratio of 7:6. Since the ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 66:36</fact1>, we can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 6, which gives us 11:6. Now we have the ratios of sugar to water and milk to water. We can write these ratios as 11x:6x and 7x:6x, where x is a multiplier. Since the total number of <fact3>teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, and tablespoons of milk is 720</fact3>, we can set up the equation 11x + 6x + 7x = 720. Combining like terms, we get 24x = 720. Dividing both sides by 24, we get x = 30. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Olga used by multiplying 11x by the value of x. This gives us 11 * 30 = 330. Therefore, Olga used 330 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

The answer is {330}."
18,Sanjay has 80 square yards of pineapple field. There are 6 pineapples per 3/5 a square yard. Sanjay can harvest his pineapples every 12 months. How many pineapples can Sanjay harvest in 2 years?,"Reformatted Question: Sanjay has <fact1>80 square yards of pineapple field</fact1>. There are <fact2>6 pineapples per 3/5 a square yard</fact2>. Sanjay can harvest his pineapples every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. How many pineapples can Sanjay harvest in <fact4>2 years</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pineapples Sanjay can harvest in one year. Since there are <fact2>6 pineapples per 3/5 a square yard</fact2>, we need to find out how many sets of 3/5 square yards are there in <fact1>80 square yards</fact1>. To do this, we can divide <fact1>80 square yards</fact1> by 3/5 square yards. 

80 / (3/5) = 80 * (5/3) = 133.33 sets of 3/5 square yards.

Since there are <fact2>6 pineapples per 3/5 a square yard</fact2>, Sanjay can harvest 133.33 * <fact2>6</fact2> = 800 pineapples every <fact3>12 months</fact3> or 1 year.

To find out how many pineapples Sanjay can harvest in <fact4>2 years</fact4>, we can multiply the number of pineapples he can harvest in one year by 2.

800 * 2 = 1600 pineapples.

The answer is {1600}."
19,Yusuf has 60 square yards of banana field. There are 24 bananas per four-sixths a square yard. Yusuf can harvest his bananas every 12 months. How many bananas can Yusuf harvest in 2 years?,"Reformatted Question: Yusuf has <fact1>60 square yards of banana field</fact1>. There are <fact2>24 bananas per four-sixths a square yard</fact2>. Yusuf can harvest his bananas every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. How many bananas can Yusuf harvest in <fact4>2 years</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many bananas Yusuf can harvest per square yard. Since there are <fact2>24 bananas per four-sixths a square yard</fact2>, we need to find out how many bananas are there per square yard. Four-sixths is equal to 2/3. So, there are <fact2>24 bananas</fact2> per 2/3 square yard. To find out how many bananas are there per square yard, we can multiply 24 by 3/2. 24 * 3/2 is 36. Therefore, there are 36 bananas per square yard. Since Yusuf has <fact1>60 square yards of banana field</fact1>, he can harvest 36 * <fact1>60</fact1> = 2160 bananas every time he harvests. Yusuf can harvest his bananas every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, and there are 12 months in a year. So, Yusuf can harvest his bananas once a year. Since we want to know how many bananas he can harvest in <fact4>2 years</fact4>, we can multiply the number of bananas he can harvest per year by 2. Therefore, Yusuf can harvest 2160 * 2 = 4320 bananas in <fact4>2 years</fact4>.

The answer is {4320}."
20,Ali has 5 hectares of pineapple field. There are 92 pineapples per 4/5 a hectare. Ali can harvest his pineapples every 6 months. How many pineapples can Ali harvest in 2 years?,"Reformatted Question: Ali has <fact1>5 hectares of pineapple field</fact1>. There are <fact2>92 pineapples per 4/5 a hectare</fact2>. Ali can harvest his pineapples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>. How many pineapples can Ali harvest in <fact4>2 years</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pineapples Ali can harvest per hectare. Since there are <fact2>92 pineapples per 4/5 a hectare</fact2>, we can find out how many pineapples per hectare by dividing 92 by 4/5. To do this, we multiply 92 by 5/4, which gives us 92 * 5/4 = 115 pineapples per hectare. 

Now, we can find out how many pineapples Ali can harvest in total by multiplying the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares he has. This gives us 115 * <fact1>5 hectares</fact1> = 575 pineapples.

However, this is the number of pineapples Ali can harvest at one time. Since Ali can harvest his pineapples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, and there are 12 months in a year, he can harvest twice a year. 

To find out how many pineapples Ali can harvest in <fact4>2 years</fact4>, we multiply the number of pineapples he can harvest at one time by the number of times he can harvest in 2 years. This gives us 575 * 2 * 2 = 2300 pineapples.

The answer is {2300}."
21,"A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, corns, cucumbers and wheat. Since wheat are a rare treat, he only buys six 4-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 5-pound bags. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys thirty two 43-pound packs. Corns are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys eighteen 15-pound sacks. Finally, he buys 43 pounds of grocery, and 27 pounds of tools. A farm truck can carry 120 pounds at a time. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has three trucks?","Reformatted Question: A farmer is buying feed for his cows. He buys a variety of apples, corns, cucumbers and wheat. Since wheat are a rare treat, he only buys <fact1>six 4-pound boxes of them</fact1> for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the cows while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact2>twelve 5-pound bags</fact2>. Apples are the main diet of his cows, so he buys <fact3>thirty two 43-pound packs</fact3>. Corns are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys <fact4>eighteen 15-pound sacks</fact4>. Finally, he buys <fact5>43 pounds of grocery</fact5>, and <fact6>27 pounds of tools</fact6>. A <fact7>farm truck can carry 120 pounds at a time</fact7>. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has <fact8>three trucks</fact8>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items. The weight of wheat is <fact1>6</fact1> * 4 = 24 pounds. The weight of cucumbers is <fact2>12</fact2> * 5 = 60 pounds. The weight of apples is <fact3>32</fact3> * 43 = 1376 pounds. The weight of corns is <fact4>18</fact4> * 15 = 270 pounds. The weight of grocery is <fact5>43</fact5> pounds and the weight of tools is <fact6>27</fact6> pounds. So, the total weight is 24 + 60 + 1376 + 270 + 43 + 27 = 1800 pounds.

Since the <fact7>farm truck can carry 120 pounds at a time</fact7>, we need to divide the total weight by 120 to find out how many trips are needed. 1800 / 120 = 15 trips.

Since the farmer has <fact8>three trucks</fact8>, we need to divide the total number of trips by 3 to find out how many trips the farmer needs. 15 / 3 = 5 trips.

The answer is {5}."

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if <fact8>he has three trucks</fact8>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items. The weight of corns is <fact1>8 boxes</fact1> * <fact1>4 kg/box</fact1> = 32 kg. The weight of cucumbers is <fact2>14 bags</fact2> * <fact2>7 kg/bag</fact2> = 98 kg. The weight of apples is <fact3>35 packs</fact3> * <fact3>36 kg/pack</fact3> = 1260 kg. The weight of oats is <fact4>20 sacks</fact4> * <fact4>17 kg/sack</fact4> = 340 kg. The weight of grocery is <fact5>43 kg</fact5> and the weight of tools is <fact6>27 kg</fact6>. So, the total weight is 32 + 98 + 1260 + 340 + 43 + 27 = 1800 kg.

Since <fact7>each truck can carry 150 kg at a time</fact7>, we need to divide the total weight by 150 to find out how many trips are needed. 1800 / 150 = 12 trips. Since <fact8>the farmer has three trucks</fact8>, we can divide the total number of trips by 3 to find out how many trips the farmer needs. 12 / 3 = 4 trips.

How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the items, if he has <fact8>three trucks</fact8>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the items. The weight of hay is <fact1>6</fact1> * 5 = 30 pounds. The weight of beets is <fact2>15</fact2> * 5 = 75 pounds. The weight of oats is <fact3>35</fact3> * 39 = 1365 pounds. The weight of corns is <fact4>20</fact4> * 19 = 380 pounds. The weight of grocery is <fact5>43 pounds</fact5> and the weight of tools is <fact6>27 pounds</fact6>. So, the total weight is 30 + 75 + 1365 + 380 + 43 + 27 = 1920 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate how many trips are needed to transport all the items. Since each truck can carry <fact7>160 pounds at a time</fact7>, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck: 1920 / 160 = 12. Since the farmer has <fact8>three trucks</fact8>, we divide the total number of trips by 3: 12 / 3 = 4.

He can make giant cubes that use <fact2>12 grams per cube</fact2>, medium cubes that use <fact3>11 grams</fact3>, small cubes that use <fact4>2/4 of gram</fact4>, and tiny cubes that are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>. If he makes <fact6>8 giant cubes</fact6>, <fact7>24 small cubes</fact7>, <fact8>12 medium cubes</fact8>, and <fact9>eight tiny cubes</fact9>, how many grams of water does he have left?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of water used for each type of cube. For giant cubes, <fact6>8 cubes</fact6> * <fact2>12 grams per cube</fact2> = 96 grams. For medium cubes, <fact8>12 cubes</fact8> * <fact3>11 grams per cube</fact3> = 132 grams. For small cubes, we need to convert <fact4>2/4 of gram</fact4> to a decimal, which is 0.5 grams. Then, <fact7>24 cubes</fact7> * 0.5 grams per cube = 12 grams. For tiny cubes, since they are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, they use 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 grams per cube. So, <fact9>8 tiny cubes</fact9> * 0.25 grams per cube = 2 grams. Now, let's add up the total amount of water used: 96 + 132 + 12 + 2 = 242 grams. Finally, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water: <fact1>306 grams</fact1> - 242 grams = 64 grams.

If he makes <fact6>8 giant cubes</fact6>, <fact7>14 small cubes</fact7>, <fact8>13 medium cubes</fact8>, and <fact9>eight tiny cubes</fact9>, how many grams of water does he have left?

Answer: To find out how many grams of water Oliver has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the ice cubes. 
The giant cubes use <fact2>13 grams per cube</fact2> and Oliver makes <fact6>8 giant cubes</fact6>, so the total amount of water used for giant cubes is <fact2>13</fact2> * <fact6>8</fact6> = 104 grams.
The medium cubes use <fact3>11 grams</fact3> and Oliver makes <fact8>13 medium cubes</fact8>, so the total amount of water used for medium cubes is <fact3>11</fact3> * <fact8>13</fact8> = 143 grams.
The small cubes use <fact4>1/2 of gram</fact4> and Oliver makes <fact7>14 small cubes</fact7>, so the total amount of water used for small cubes is <fact4>0.5</fact4> * <fact7>14</fact7> = 7 grams.
The tiny cubes are <fact5>half the size of small cubes</fact5>, so they use <fact4>0.5</fact4>/2 = 0.25 grams per cube. Oliver makes <fact9>eight tiny cubes</fact9>, so the total amount of water used for tiny cubes is 0.25 * <fact9>8</fact9> = 2 grams.
The total amount of water used to make all the ice cubes is 104 + 143 + 7 + 2 = 256 grams.
Oliver started with <fact1>318 grams of water</fact1>, so he has <fact1>318</fact1> - 256 = 62 grams of water left.

Theo then eats a third of the almonds. How many almonds won't he be able to place on the tables or bowls?","Reformatted Question: Theo places almonds on the <fact1>table and bowl</fact1>. Each <fact2>table can hold 24 almonds</fact2> while each <fact3>bowl can hold two times that</fact3>. Theo has <fact4>621 almonds</fact4>, <fact5>11 tables</fact5> and <fact6>3 bowls</fact6>. Theo then eats <fact7>a third of the almonds</fact7>. How many almonds won't he be able to place on the tables or bowls?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many almonds Theo has left after eating <fact7>a third of the almonds</fact7>. He had <fact4>621 almonds</fact4> and ate 621 / 3 = 207 almonds. So, he has 621 - 207 = 414 almonds left.

Each <fact2>table can hold 24 almonds</fact2> and there are <fact5>11 tables</fact5>, so the tables can hold 24 * 11 = 264 almonds.

Each <fact3>bowl can hold two times</fact3> what a table can hold, so each bowl can hold 24 * 2 = 48 almonds. There are <fact6>3 bowls</fact6>, so the bowls can hold 48 * 3 = 144 almonds.

In total, the tables and bowls can hold 264 + 144 = 408 almonds.

Theo has 414 almonds left, but the tables and bowls can only hold 408 almonds. Therefore, he won't be able to place 414 - 408 = 6 almonds on the tables or bowls.

Wei then eats <fact7>a third of the cookies</fact7>. How many cookies won't he be able to place on the tables or plates?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many cookies Wei eats. Wei has <fact4>711 cookies</fact4> and eats <fact7>a third of the cookies</fact7>, so he eats <fact4>711</fact4> / 3 = 237 cookies. Now, he has <fact4>711</fact4> - 237 = 474 cookies left.

Each <fact2>table can hold 20 cookies</fact2> and there are <fact5>9 tables</fact5>, so the tables can hold <fact2>20</fact2> * <fact5>9</fact5> = 180 cookies.

Each <fact3>plate can hold two times</fact3> that of a table, so each plate can hold <fact2>20</fact2> * 2 = 40 cookies. There are <fact6>5 plates</fact6>, so the plates can hold 40 * <fact6>5</fact6> = 200 cookies.

In total, the tables and plates can hold 180 + 200 = 380 cookies.

Wei has 474 cookies left, but the tables and plates can only hold 380 cookies. Therefore, Wei won't be able to place 474 - 380 = 94 cookies on the tables or plates.

Yuki then eats <fact7>a third of the olives</fact7>. How many olives won't he be able to place on the <fact1>plates or bowls</fact1>?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many olives Yuki eats. Yuki eats <fact7>a third of the olives</fact7>, which is <fact4>654</fact4> / 3 = 218 olives. So, he has <fact4>654</fact4> - 218 = 436 olives left.

Now, let's calculate the total capacity of the plates and bowls. Each <fact2>plate can hold 20 olives</fact2>, so <fact5>7 plates</fact5> can hold 20 * 7 = 140 olives. Each <fact3>bowl can hold two times that</fact3> of a plate, which is 20 * 2 = 40 olives. So, <fact6>5 bowls</fact6> can hold 40 * 5 = 200 olives. The total capacity of the plates and bowls is 140 + 200 = 340 olives.

Since Yuki has 436 olives left and the total capacity of the plates and bowls is 340 olives, he won't be able to place 436 - 340 = 96 olives on the plates or bowls.

Answer: Gabrielle started with <fact2>11 potted plants on each of the 67 window ledges</fact2>, which is a total of <fact2>11</fact2> * 67 = 737 plants. She received <fact1>38 new potted plants</fact1> last week, so she had 737 + <fact1>38</fact1> = 775 plants. She purchased <fact3>150 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount</fact3>, which means she got 150 * 0.5 = 75 plants at the discounted price, but the discount is irrelevant to the number of plants she has, so she actually got <fact3>150</fact3> plants. So now she has 775 + <fact3>150</fact3> = 925 plants. She will give away <fact4>6 potted plants from each ledge</fact4>, and there are 67 ledges, so she will give away <fact4>6</fact4> * 67 = 402 plants.

How much longer do they have to get to gym without being late, if they have already <fact5>wasted 35 minutes to get a coffee before their walk</fact5>?

Answer: Oscar and Luca have already spent <fact2>26 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>27 minutes</fact3> = 53 minutes walking to the cinema. 
The time it takes them to get to the park is <fact4>double the combined amount they have spent so far</fact4>, which is 2 * 53 minutes = 106 minutes. 
So, the total time they have spent so far, including walking to the park, is 53 minutes + 106 minutes = 159 minutes. 
They also <fact5>wasted 35 minutes to get a coffee before their walk</fact5>, so the total time they have spent is 159 minutes + 35 minutes = 194 minutes.

How much longer do they have to get to gym without being late, if they have already wasted <fact5>48 minutes</fact5> to get a coffee before their walk?

Answer: First, let's calculate the time Olga and Yuki spent walking to the bank. They spent <fact2>11 minutes</fact2> to get to the grocery store and <fact3>13 minutes</fact3> to get to the bank, for a total of <fact2>11</fact2> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 24 minutes. 

Then, it took them <fact4>triple the combined amount they have spent so far</fact4> to reach the park, which is 3 * 24 = 72 minutes.

So far, they have spent 24 + 72 = 96 minutes walking. However, they also wasted <fact5>48 minutes</fact5> getting a coffee, so the total time they've spent is 96 + <fact5>48</fact5> = 144 minutes.

How much longer do they have to get to grocery store without being late, if they have already wasted <fact5>42 minutes</fact5> to get a coffee before their walk?

Answer: First, let's calculate the time Yara and Carlos have spent walking so far. They spent <fact2>13 minutes</fact2> getting to the corner where the mall is and <fact3>16 minutes</fact3> getting to the library. So, the combined amount of time they have spent so far is <fact2>13</fact2> + <fact3>16</fact3> = 29 minutes. 

Then, it will take them <fact4>quadruple the combined amount they have spent so far</fact4> to reach the cinema, which is 4 * 29 = 116 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the time they have spent or will spend, which is 29 minutes (getting to the library) + 116 minutes (getting to the cinema) = 145 minutes.

However, they also wasted <fact5>42 minutes</fact5> getting a coffee before their walk. So, the total time they have spent or will spend is 145 minutes + <fact5>42 minutes</fact5> = 187 minutes.

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Umar's dog has <fact1>113 puppies</fact1> and Xena's dog has <fact3>47 puppies</fact3>. Sophia has <fact5>64 dogs</fact5>, each having <fact6>10 puppies</fact6>, so she has a total of <fact5>64</fact5> * <fact6>10</fact6> = 640 puppies. Therefore, the total number of puppies is <fact1>113</fact1> + <fact3>47</fact3> + 640 = 800.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies with spots. Umar's dog has <fact2>17 puppies with spots</fact2> and Xena's dog has <fact4>15 puppies with spots</fact4>.

If the <fact6>cookie cost ¥12</fact6> and the <fact7>orange pie cost ¥21</fact7>, how much was Liam's average daily earning?

Answer: On Friday, Liam sold <fact1>25 boxes of cookies</fact1> and <fact4>22</fact4> - <fact2>13</fact2> = 9 boxes of orange pie. 
On Saturday, he sold <fact1>25</fact1> + <fact3>11</fact3> = 36 boxes of cookies and <fact4>22 boxes of orange pie</fact4>. 
On Sunday, he sold <fact5>as much as he did in the past two days combined</fact5>, so he sold (25 + 36) boxes of cookies and (9 + 22) boxes of orange pie. 
This means he sold 25 + 36 + (25 + 36) = 122 boxes of cookies and 9 + 22 + (9 + 22) = 62 boxes of orange pie. 
His total earnings are (<fact6>¥12</fact6> * 122) + (<fact7>¥21</fact7> * 62) = ¥1464 + ¥1302 = ¥2766.

51,"Amelia walks 34 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 18 kilometers of walking on the beach and 16 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Amelia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Amelia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 34-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Amelia walks <fact1>34 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>18 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>16 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Amelia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. However, due to a recent injury, Amelia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>34-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Amelia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>18 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and it takes her <fact6>54 minutes</fact6> to do so. However, this is after her injury, so we need to find her original speed. Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, we can set up the equation: 18 km / x = 54 minutes, where x is her speed after the injury. Solving for x, we get x = 18 km / 54 min = 1/3 km/min. Since her speed has decreased by half, her original speed on the beach was 2 * (1/3) = 2/3 km/min.

Now, we know that Amelia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach</fact4>, so her original speed on the sidewalk was 2 * (2/3) = 4/3 km/min. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk decreased by half, so it is now 1/2 * (4/3) = 2/3 km/min.

We can now find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. She walks <fact3>16 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk at a speed of 2/3 km/min, so it takes her 16 km / (2/3 km/min) = 24 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire <fact1>34-kilometer walk</fact1>. 54 minutes (on the beach) + 24 minutes (on the sidewalk) = 78 minutes.

52,"Roya walks 24 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 12 miles of walking on the beach and 12 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Roya walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Roya's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Roya walks <fact1>24 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>12 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Roya walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Roya's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Roya's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>12 miles</fact2> on the beach and that it now takes her <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> to do so after her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>. So, if her speed has decreased by half, then it would have taken her <fact6>60</fact6>/2 = 30 minutes to walk <fact2>12 miles</fact2> on the beach at her original speed. Thus, her original speed on the beach is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / 30 minutes = 0.4 miles per minute. 

Since her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>three times her speed on the beach</fact4>, her original speed on the sidewalk is 3 * 0.4 = 1.2 miles per minute. 

After her injury, her speed on the beach is 0.4 / 2 = 0.2 miles per minute, and her speed on the sidewalk is 1.2 / 2 = 0.6 miles per minute.

So, it will take her <fact2>12 miles</fact2> / 0.2 miles per minute = <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> to walk on the beach and <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / 0.6 miles per minute = 20 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

Thus, it will take her <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 20 minutes = 80 minutes to complete the entire <fact1>24-mile walk</fact1>.

If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 20-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Isabella walks <fact1>20 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>10 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>10 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Isabella walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Isabella's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Isabella's original speed on the beach. We know that she walks <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> originally before the injury, but her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, so she would walk <fact2>10 miles</fact2> in 2 * <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 120 minutes originally. Thus, her original speed on the beach is <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / 120 minutes = 1/12 miles per minute. 

Her original speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach, so it is 3 * 1/12 miles per minute = 1/4 miles per minute.

However, her speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>, so her current speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/12 miles per minute = 1/24 miles per minute, and her current speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 1/4 miles per minute = 1/8 miles per minute.

The time it takes for her to walk <fact2>10 miles</fact2> on the beach is <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / (1/24 miles per minute) = 240 minutes, but we already know that it takes her <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> to walk on the beach.

The time it takes for her to walk <fact3>10 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk is <fact3>10 miles</fact3> / (1/8 miles per minute) = 80 minutes.

Thus, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>20-mile walk</fact1> is <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 80 minutes = 140 minutes.

On Monday, he picks half the amount of what he picked in the <fact4>past 3 days combined</fact4>. How many pears does Gabriel have?

Answer: Gabriel picked <fact1>173 pears</fact1> on Friday and <fact2>317 pears</fact2> on Saturday. On Sunday, he picked double the number of pears he did on <fact3>Friday</fact3>, which is 2 * <fact1>173</fact1> = 346 pears. So, in the <fact4>past 3 days combined</fact4>, he picked <fact1>173</fact1> + <fact2>317</fact2> + 346 = 836 pears. On Monday, he picked half of that amount, which is 836 / 2 = 418 pears. Therefore, Gabriel has a total of 836 + 418 = 1254 pears.

On Sunday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Monday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Tuesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 2-hour episodes. On Wednesday, he watched three episodes, each 30 minutes. If he watched 22 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Sunday?","Reformatted Question: Tariq watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On <fact1>Friday and Saturday, he watched 3-hour episodes of his favorite show each night</fact1>. On <fact2>Sunday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show</fact2>. On <fact3>Monday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Tuesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 2-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Wednesday, he watched three episodes, each 30 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 22 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Sunday?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total time Tariq spent watching TV on the days other than Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV (<fact1>3 hours each night</fact1>). On Monday, he watched 4 hours + 15 minutes = 4.25 hours of TV (<fact3>4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>). On Tuesday, he watched 4 * 2 = 8 hours of TV (<fact4>four 2-hour episodes</fact4>). On Wednesday, he watched 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 hours of TV (<fact5>three episodes, each 30 minutes</fact5>). So, the total time spent watching TV on days other than Sunday is 6 + 4.25 + 8 + 1.5 = 19.75 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 22 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 22 - 19.75 = 2.25 hours of TV on Sunday. Since each episode on Sunday is 45 minutes long (<fact2>45-minute show</fact2>), we can convert 2.25 hours to minutes: 2.25 * 60 = 135 minutes. Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 135 / 45 = 3. Therefore, Tariq watched 3 episodes of the 45-minute show on Sunday.

On Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 3-hour episodes. On Monday, he watched two episodes, each 45 minutes. If he watched 32 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Friday?","Reformatted Question: Arash watches TV after he finishes his homework every night.

On <fact3>Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show</fact3>. On <fact4>Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 3-hour episodes</fact4>. On <fact5>Monday, he watched two episodes, each 45 minutes</fact5>. If <fact6>he watched 32 hours of TV in all</fact6>, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Friday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV Arash watched on the days other than Friday. On Wednesday and Thursday, he watched <fact1>6 hours * 2 nights = 12 hours</fact1>. On Saturday, he watched <fact3>4 hours + 45 minutes = 4.75 hours</fact3>. On Sunday, he watched <fact4>4 * 3 hours = 12 hours</fact4>. On Monday, he watched <fact5>2 * 45 minutes = 1.5 hours</fact5>. So, the total hours of TV Arash watched on the days other than Friday is 12 + 4.75 + 12 + 1.5 = 30.25 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 32 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 32 - 30.25 = 1.75 hours of TV on Friday. Since each episode on Friday is 15 minutes, we can convert 1.75 hours to minutes: 1.75 * 60 = 105 minutes. Now, we can divide the total minutes by the length of each episode: 105 / 15 = 7 episodes. Therefore, Arash watched 7 episodes of the 15-minute show on Friday.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Saturday and Sunday. Since <fact1>he watched 4-hour episodes each night</fact1>, he watched a total of 4 + 4 = 8 hours. On Tuesday, he watched a total of 4 hours + 0.5 hours = 4.5 hours. On Wednesday, he watched a total of 4 * 3 = 12 hours. On Thursday, he watched a total of 2 * 0.5 = 1 hour. So, the total hours watched on these days is 8 + 4.5 + 12 + 1 = 25.5 hours. Since <fact6>he watched 26 hours of TV in all</fact6>, he must have watched 26 - 25.5 = 0.5 hours on Monday. Since each episode is 15 minutes or 0.25 hours, he must have watched 0.5 / 0.25 = 2 episodes on Monday.

How many forks were in the package that Zahra bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of forks in the package that Zahra bought as x. 
From <fact2>a package of 9 new forks</fact2> bought by Zahra's husband and <fact4>2 packs of forks, each having 14 inside them</fact4> brought by the guests, Zahra got 9 + 2*14 = 37 forks. 
She also used <fact3>eleven of the forks to sample her grilled salmon</fact3>, so the total number of forks she had at the end is x + 37 - 11 = x + 26. 
Since we know that <fact5>she had a total of 55 forks</fact5> at the end, we can set up the equation x + 26 = 55 and solve for x. 
x = 55 - 26 = 29.

How many forks were in the package that Tara bought?

Answer: Let's denote the number of forks in the package Tara bought as x. 
Tara started with x forks. 
Her husband gave her <fact2>8 forks</fact2>, so she had x + 8 forks. 
After using <fact3>19 forks</fact3> to sample the stuffed peppers, she had x + 8 - 19 forks. 
The guests brought <fact4>3 packs of forks, each having 6 inside them</fact4>, which is 3 * 6 = 18 forks. 
So, the total number of forks Tara had was x + 8 - 19 + 18 = x + 7.

Jasmine wants to make <fact8>three warm jackets for herself</fact8>, each needing <fact9>9 skeins of wool</fact9>. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool Jasmine needs to buy, we need to calculate the total amount needed for her grandchildren and for herself. 

For each grandchild, the total number of skeins needed is <fact3>14 skeins for a hat</fact3> + <fact4>11 skeins for a sweater</fact4> + <fact5>3 skeins for a shawl</fact5> + <fact6>10 skeins for a pair of booties</fact6> + <fact7>5 skeins for a pair of mittens</fact7> = 43 skeins. 

Since Jasmine has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, the total number of skeins needed for them is 43 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 172 skeins.

For herself, Jasmine needs <fact9>9 skeins of wool</fact9> for each of the <fact8>three warm jackets</fact8>, so the total number of skeins needed for herself is <fact9>9</fact9> * <fact8>3</fact8> = 27 skeins.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories you can still consume for the day. You have already <fact4>consumed 1500 calories</fact4> and <fact5>exercised for 100 calories</fact5>, so you have burned a total of <fact4>1500</fact4> - <fact5>100</fact5> = 1400 calories. Since <fact3>your daily calorie target is 1950</fact3>, you can still consume 1950 - 1400 = 550 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of breads has 275 calories per serving</fact1>, you can eat 550 / 275 = 2 servings.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories you can still consume for the day. You have already <fact4>consumed 1600 calories</fact4> and <fact5>exercised for 50 calories</fact5>, so you have burned a total of 1600 - 50 = 1550 calories. Since <fact3>your daily calorie target is 2000</fact3>, you can still consume 2000 - 1550 = 450 calories.

Since <fact1>a bag of cookies has 450 calories per serving</fact1>, you can eat 1 serving of cookies. We know that <fact2>a 300 oz bag has 6 servings</fact2>, so 1 serving is equal to 300/6 = 50 oz.

Answer: First, we need to calculate how many calories you can still consume for the day. This is <fact3>2150</fact3> - <fact4>1450</fact4> + <fact5>100</fact5> = 800 calories. Since <fact1>each serving has 400 calories</fact1>, you can eat 800 / <fact1>400</fact1> = 2 servings. Since <fact2>a 250-gram bag has 5 servings</fact2>, each serving is <fact2>250</fact2> / <fact2>5</fact2> = 50 grams. Therefore, you can eat 2 * 50 = 100 grams.

Out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>17% of the students are choir members or part of dancers</fact4>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. <fact5>Half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>. Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the competition?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many soccer players there are. Since <fact2>40% of the class are soccer players</fact2>, we can calculate the number of soccer players as <fact1>125 students</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2> = 50 students. However, <fact5>half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so only 50 / 2 = 25 soccer players will be leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are 50 soccer players, the remaining class has <fact1>125 students</fact1> - 50 students = 75 students. Then, we can calculate the number of choir members or dancers as <fact3>75 students</fact3> * <fact4>0.17</fact4> = 12.75 students. We will round this down to 12 students since we can't have a fraction of a student.

Now, we have 25 soccer players and 12 choir members or dancers. We also need to add the <fact6>3 cheerleaders for each of these groups</fact6>, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 more students.

In total, 25 soccer players + 12 choir members or dancers + 9 cheerleaders = 46 students will be leaving early to the competition.

However, <fact5>half of the basketball players are absent for being sick</fact5>, so only 50 / 2 = 25 basketball players will be leaving early.

Next, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>125 students in the class</fact1> and 50 of them are basketball players, the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> has <fact1>125</fact1> - 50 = 75 students. Then, we can calculate the number of choir members and debate team members as 0.38 * 75 = 28.5, which we will round down to 28 since we can't have a fraction of a student.

Finally, we need to add the number of basketball players, choir members, debate team members, and cheerleaders to find the total number of students leaving early. We have 25 basketball players, 28 choir members and debate team members, and <fact6>3 cheerleaders for each of the 3 groups</fact6>, which is 3 * 3 = 9 cheerleaders. Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 25 + 28 + 9 = 62.

The answer is {62}."

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?","Reformatted Question: In <fact1>Mrs. Garcia's class of 100 students</fact1>, <fact2>40% of the class are swimmers</fact2>. Out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>20% of the students are debate team members or part of robotics club members</fact4>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. <fact5>Half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>. Also, <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6>. How many students are leaving early to the tournament?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are swimmers. Since <fact2>40% of the class are swimmers</fact2> and there are <fact1>100 students in the class</fact1>, the number of swimmers is <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>100</fact1> = 40 students. However, <fact5>half of the swimmers are absent for being sick</fact5>, so the number of swimmers leaving early is 40 / 2 = 20 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are debate team members or part of robotics club members. Since <fact4>20% of the students in the remaining class are debate team members or part of robotics club members</fact4>, we need to find out how many students are in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>. The number of students in the <fact3>remaining class</fact3> is <fact1>100</fact1> - 40 = 60 students. So, the number of debate team members or part of robotics club members is <fact4>20%</fact4> * 60 = 12 students.

Finally, we need to add the number of swimmers, debate team members, robotics club members, and cheerleaders to find the total number of students leaving early. Since <fact6>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact6> and there are 3 groups, the total number of cheerleaders is <fact6>3</fact6> * 3 = 9 students.

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is 20 (swimmers) + 12 (debate team members or robotics club members) + 9 (cheerleaders) = 41 students.

78,"A father eats 4 pizzas per day, his wife eats 6 pizzas per day, and their daughter eats one less than three-sixths of the number of pizzas they eat combined per day. How many pizzas does this family eat in one month?","Reformatted Question: A father eats <fact1>4 pizzas per day</fact1>, his wife eats <fact2>6 pizzas per day</fact2>, and their daughter eats <fact3>one less than three-sixths of the number of pizzas they eat combined per day</fact3>. How many pizzas does this family eat in <fact4>one month</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of pizzas the father and wife eat per day. The father eats <fact1>4 pizzas per day</fact1> and the wife eats <fact2>6 pizzas per day</fact2>, so together they eat <fact1>4</fact1> + <fact2>6</fact2> = 10 pizzas per day.

Next, we need to calculate the number of pizzas the daughter eats per day. The daughter eats <fact3>one less than three-sixths of the number of pizzas they eat combined per day</fact3>. Three-sixths of 10 is 10 * 3/6 = 5, and one less than that is 5 - 1 = 4 pizzas per day.

So, the total number of pizzas the family eats per day is 10 (father and wife) + 4 (daughter) = 14 pizzas per day.

Since there are approximately 30 days in <fact4>one month</fact4>, the total number of pizzas the family eats in one month is 14 pizzas per day * 30 days = 420 pizzas.

How many burritos does this family eat in <fact4>one month</fact4>?

Answer: The uncle and his spouse eat a combined total of <fact1>7</fact1> + <fact2>5</fact2> = 12 burritos per day. 
Five-sixths of this amount is (5/6) * 12 = 10 burritos per day. 
The grandchild eats <fact3>one less than this amount</fact3>, so the grandchild eats 10 - 1 = 9 burritos per day. 
The total number of burritos the family eats per day is 12 + 9 = 21 burritos per day.

How many sushi rolls does this family eat in <fact4>one month</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls the grandfather and his partner eat per day. The grandfather eats <fact1>5 sushi rolls per day</fact1> and his partner eats <fact2>7 sushi rolls per day</fact2>, so together they eat <fact1>5</fact1> + <fact2>7</fact2> = 12 sushi rolls per day.

Next, we need to calculate the number of sushi rolls their son eats per day. The son eats <fact3>one less than three-sixths of the number of sushi rolls they eat combined per day</fact3>. Three-sixths of 12 is (3/6) * 12 = 6, and one less than that is 6 - 1 = 5. So, the son eats 5 sushi rolls per day.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sushi rolls the family eats per day. The grandfather and his partner eat 12 sushi rolls per day, and the son eats 5 sushi rolls per day, so the total is 12 + 5 = 17 sushi rolls per day.

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in <fact4>one month</fact4>. There are approximately 30 days in a month, so the total number of sushi rolls the family eats in one month is 17 * 30 = 510.

From the rest, Hiroshi can only respond to <fact3>20 less than 1/3 of them</fact3>. How many emails does Hiroshi respond to in a <fact4>4-day work week</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails require a response. Since <fact2>25% of the emails don't require a response</fact2>, we can calculate the number of emails that require a response as follows: <fact1>180 emails</fact1> * (1 - <fact2>0.25</fact2>) = 135 emails.

Next, we need to find out how many emails Hiroshi can respond to in a day. He can respond to <fact3>20 less than 1/3 of the emails that require a response</fact3>. So, we can calculate the number of emails he can respond to as follows: (1/3) * 135 - <fact3>20</fact3> = 45 - 20 = 25 emails.

Finally, we need to find out how many emails Hiroshi responds to in a <fact4>4-day work week</fact4>. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to in a day by the number of days in the work week: 25 emails/day * <fact4>4 days</fact4> = 100 emails.

From the rest, Esteban can only respond to <fact3>5 less than a third of them</fact3>. How many emails does Esteban respond to in a <fact4>5-day work week</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails require a response. Since <fact2>22% of the emails don't require a response</fact2>, that means 100% - <fact2>22%</fact2> = 78% of the emails require a response. To find the number of emails that require a response, we multiply <fact1>100 emails</fact1> by 78%: <fact1>100</fact1> * 0.78 = 78 emails per day.

Next, we need to find out how many emails Esteban can respond to in a day. He can respond to <fact3>5 less than a third of the emails that require a response</fact3>. One third of 78 emails is 78 / 3 = 26 emails. <fact3>5 less than that</fact3> would be 26 - 5 = 21 emails per day.

Finally, we need to find out how many emails Esteban responds to in a <fact4>5-day work week</fact4>. We multiply the number of emails he responds to per day by <fact4>5 days</fact4>: 21 * <fact4>5</fact4> = 105 emails.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails require a response. Since <fact2>25% of the emails don't require a response</fact2>, that means 100% - <fact2>25%</fact2> = 75% of the emails require a response. So, the number of emails that require a response is <fact1>160</fact1> * 0.75 = 120 emails per day.

Now, we need to find out how many emails Chen can respond to in a day. Chen can respond to <fact3>7 less than 1/5 of the emails that require a response</fact3>. So, the number of emails Chen can respond to in a day is (1/5) * 120 - <fact3>7</fact3> = 24 - <fact3>7</fact3> = 17 emails per day.

Finally, we need to find out how many emails Chen can respond to in a <fact4>5-day work week</fact4>. Since Chen can respond to 17 emails per day, the total number of emails Chen can respond to in a <fact4>5-day work week</fact4> is 17 * <fact4>5</fact4> = 85 emails.

Due to the major accident, <fact4>40 patients are admitted into the medical center each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the medical center after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: The number of occupied beds is <fact1>1400</fact1> * <fact2>1/5</fact2> = 280 beds.
The number of beds out of service is <fact1>1400</fact1> * <fact3>1/5</fact3> = 280 beds.
So, the total number of unoccupied beds initially is <fact1>1400</fact1> - 280 - 280 = 840 beds.
Since <fact4>40 patients are admitted each day</fact4>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> is <fact4>40</fact4> * 14 = 560 patients.
Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> is 840 - 560 = 280 beds.

Due to the flu season, <fact4>35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: The hospital has <fact1>800 beds</fact1> with <fact2>1/8 occupied</fact2>, which is <fact1>800</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 100 beds occupied. Additionally, <fact3>one-fifth of all the beds are out of service</fact3>, which is <fact1>800</fact1> * <fact3>1/5</fact3> = 160 beds out of service. Initially, the total number of unoccupied beds is <fact1>800</fact1> - 100 - 160 = 540 beds. 

Since <fact4>35 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> is <fact4>35</fact4> * <fact5>14</fact5> = 490 patients. 

Assuming that the initially occupied beds are still occupied and the out-of-service beds are still out of service, the total number of unoccupied beds after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> is 540 - 490 = 50 beds.

Due to the flu season, <fact4>25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of beds that are out of service. Since <fact3>three-fifths of all the beds are out of service</fact3>, we can calculate this as <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> * (3/5) = 1080 beds out of service.

Next, we need to find the number of beds that are occupied. Since <fact2>1/6 of the beds are occupied</fact2>, we can calculate this as <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> * (1/6) = 300 beds occupied.

Now, we need to find the number of beds that are available. We can do this by subtracting the number of beds out of service and the number of beds occupied from the total capacity: <fact1>1800 beds</fact1> - 1080 beds out of service - 300 beds occupied = 420 beds available.

Since <fact4>25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact4>, we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is equal to 2 * 7 = 14 days. Therefore, the total number of patients admitted is <fact4>25 patients per day</fact4> * 14 days = 350 patients.

Finally, we can find the total number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total number of patients admitted from the number of beds available: 420 beds available - 350 patients = 70 beds.

In <fact2>6 years</fact2> his sister Aisha will be <fact3>3 times as old as Pavel is now</fact3>. What is the average of Pavel and Aisha in <fact4>5 years</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find Aisha's current age. Since in <fact2>6 years</fact2> Aisha will be <fact3>3 times as old as Pavel is now</fact3>, we can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let's denote Aisha's current age as x. Then, in <fact2>6 years</fact2>, Aisha's age will be x + <fact2>6</fact2>. We are given that this will be equal to <fact3>3 times Pavel's current age</fact3>, which is <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact1>16</fact1> = 48. So, we have the equation x + <fact2>6</fact2> = 48. Solving for x, we get x = 42.

Now that we know Aisha's current age, we can find their ages in <fact4>5 years</fact4>. Pavel's age in <fact4>5 years</fact4> will be <fact1>16</fact1> + <fact4>5</fact4> = 21, and Aisha's age in <fact4>5 years</fact4> will be 42 + <fact4>5</fact4> = 47.

If <fact3>Carlos, who is younger than Thiago but older than Oscar, is 43 years old</fact3>, what's the average of their ages?

Answer: Since <fact3>Carlos is 43 years old</fact3> and <fact1>he and Thiago are 25 years apart in age</fact1>, Thiago must be 43 + 25 = 68 years old.

96,"Mrs. Lee is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her $440000 budget. She saw a property that has a selling price of $600000. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Lee can get 20% discount on the selling price, how much more is the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget?","Reformatted Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her <fact1>$440000 budget</fact1>. She saw a property that has a <fact2>selling price of $600000</fact2>. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more is the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $600000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$600000</fact2> = $120000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$600000</fact2> - $120000 = $480000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 x $480000 = $14400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 x $480000 = $57600.

Now, we can calculate the total cost, which is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee: $480000 + $14400 + $57600 = $551400.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's <fact1>$440000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $551400 - <fact1>$440000</fact1> = $111400.

If Mrs. Lee can get 25% discount on the selling price, how much more is the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget?","Reformatted Question: Mrs. Lee is looking for a townhouse that will not go beyond her <fact1>$370000 budget</fact1>.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 7% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 14% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Lee can get a <fact5>25% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more is the total cost will be than Mrs. Lee's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>25%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $480000</fact2>, which is 0.25 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $120000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$480000</fact2> - $120000 = $360000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 7% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.07 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $33600. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 * <fact2>$480000</fact2> = $67200.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $360000 + $33600 + $67200 = $460800.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Lee's budget. The difference is $460800 - <fact1>$370000</fact1> = $90800.

If Dr. Patel can get a <fact5>25% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more is the total cost will be than Dr. Patel's budget?

Answer: First, let's calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>25%</fact5> of <fact2>$680000</fact2>, which is 0.25 x <fact2>$680000</fact2> = $170000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$680000</fact2> - $170000 = $510000.

Next, let's calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is <fact3>7%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.07 x $510000 = $35700. The transfer fee is <fact4>12%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is 0.12 x $510000 = $61200.

Now, let's calculate the total cost. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $510000 + $35700 + $61200 = $606900.

Finally, let's calculate how much more the total cost is than Dr. Patel's budget. The difference is $606900 - <fact1>$460000</fact1> = $146900.

111,A giant lasagna has 84 servings. Daphne can eat 4 servings a day while Quinn can eat two times as much and Kimia can eat two times as much as Quinn. How many days will the lasagna last?,"Reformatted Question: A giant lasagna has <fact1>84 servings</fact1>. <fact2>Daphne can eat 4 servings a day</fact2> while <fact3>Quinn can eat two times as much</fact3> and <fact4>Kimia can eat two times as much as Quinn</fact4>. How many days will the lasagna last?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many servings Quinn can eat per day. Since <fact3>Quinn can eat two times as much</fact3> as Daphne, and <fact2>Daphne can eat 4 servings a day</fact2>, Quinn can eat 2 * <fact2>4</fact2> = 8 servings per day.

Next, we need to find out how many servings Kimia can eat per day. Since <fact4>Kimia can eat two times as much as Quinn</fact4>, and Quinn can eat 8 servings per day, Kimia can eat 2 * 8 = 16 servings per day.

Now, we can calculate the total number of servings eaten per day by all three: <fact2>Daphne eats 4 servings</fact2>, Quinn eats 8 servings, and Kimia eats 16 servings, for a total of 4 + 8 + 16 = 28 servings per day.

112,A giant cake has 60 servings. Isabella can eat 2 servings a day while Quinn can eat thrice as much and Amelia can eat two times as much as Quinn. How many days will the cake last?,"Reformatted Question: A giant cake has <fact1>60 servings</fact1>. <fact2>Isabella can eat 2 servings a day</fact2> while <fact3>Quinn can eat thrice as much</fact3> and <fact4>Amelia can eat two times as much as Quinn</fact4>. How many days will the cake last?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many servings Quinn can eat per day. Since <fact3>Quinn can eat thrice as much</fact3> as Isabella, and <fact2>Isabella can eat 2 servings a day</fact2>, Quinn can eat 3 * 2 = 6 servings per day.

Next, we need to find out how many servings Amelia can eat per day. Since <fact4>Amelia can eat two times as much as Quinn</fact4>, and Quinn can eat 6 servings per day, Amelia can eat 2 * 6 = 12 servings per day.

Now, we can calculate the total number of servings eaten per day by all three: 2 (Isabella) + 6 (Quinn) + 12 (Amelia) = 20 servings per day.

Finally, we can divide the total number of servings in the cake (<fact1>60 servings</fact1>) by the number of servings eaten per day (20) to find out how many days the cake will last: 60 / 20 = 3 days.

How much money does Sakura have left?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the saltwater taffy. Since Sakura bought <fact3>23 kilograms</fact3> and the sale is ""<fact2>Buy 16 kilograms at ₺22 per kilogram, get 6 kilograms 1/2 off</fact2>"", we can calculate the cost as follows: 
16 kg * ₺22/kg = ₺352 for the first 16 kg, and 
7 kg * ₺11/kg = ₺77 for the remaining 7 kg (since 6 kg is half off, and 1 kg is full price, but since we can't buy half a kilogram we'll assume the last kilogram is the half-off one and the other 6 kilograms were the ones that were on sale).
So the total cost of the saltwater taffy is ₺352 + ₺77 = ₺429.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the starfish and keychains. The starfish cost <fact4>₺11.0</fact4> and the keychains cost <fact5>18 * ₺20.0 = ₺360</fact5>. 
So the total cost of the starfish and keychains is ₺11 + ₺360 = ₺371.
Sakura also donated <fact6>₺5 at a charity stand along the way</fact6>. 
The total amount spent is ₺429 + ₺371 + ₺5 = ₺805.
Finally, let's subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Sakura had: <fact1>₺1300</fact1> - ₺805 = ₺495.

Answer: Chen started with <fact1>¥1400</fact1>. The saltwater taffy costs <fact2>¥23 per pound</fact2> for the first 16 pounds, which is <fact2>¥23</fact2> * 16 = ¥368. The next 5 pounds (since <fact3>21 pounds</fact3> - 16 pounds = 5 pounds) are half off, so they cost (<fact2>¥23</fact2> / 2) * 5 = ¥57.50. The total cost of the saltwater taffy is ¥368 + ¥57.50 = ¥425.50. The starfish cost <fact4>¥11.0</fact4> and the keychains cost <fact5>14</fact5> * <fact6>¥20.5</fact6> = ¥287.

If there are 30 bricks in the building in total, what percentage of bricks are orange?","Reformatted Question: A building is made out of <fact1>3 green bricks</fact1>, <fact2>six times as many purple bricks</fact2>, and an unknown number of orange bricks. If there are <fact3>30 bricks in the building in total</fact3>, what percentage of bricks are orange?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many purple bricks there are. Since there are <fact2>six times as many purple bricks</fact2> as green bricks, and there are <fact1>3 green bricks</fact1>, there are 6 * <fact1>3</fact1> = 18 purple bricks. Now we know that there are <fact1>3 green bricks</fact1> and 18 purple bricks, so the number of orange bricks is <fact3>30 bricks in total</fact3> - 18 - <fact1>3</fact1> = 9. To find the percentage of orange bricks, we divide the number of orange bricks by the total number of bricks and multiply by 100.

If there are <fact4>24 tiles in the stack in total</fact4>, what percentage of tiles are pink?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of black tiles. Since there are <fact2>two times as many black tiles</fact2> as white tiles, and there are <fact1>4 white tiles</fact1>, there must be 2 * <fact1>4</fact1> = 8 black tiles.

Next, we can find the total number of non-pink tiles by adding the number of white tiles and black tiles: <fact1>4 white tiles</fact1> + 8 black tiles = 12 non-pink tiles.

Since there are <fact4>24 tiles in the stack in total</fact4>, and 12 of them are not pink, the number of pink tiles is <fact4>24</fact4> - 12 = 12.

Finally, we can find the percentage of tiles that are pink by dividing the number of pink tiles by the total number of tiles and multiplying by 100: (12 / <fact4>24</fact4>) * 100 = 50%.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of green cubes. Since there are <fact2>two times as many green cubes</fact2> as pink cubes, and there are <fact1>7 pink cubes</fact1>, there are 2 * <fact1>7</fact1> = 14 green cubes. Now, we know that there are <fact1>7 pink cubes</fact1> and 14 green cubes, so the total number of cubes that are not purple is <fact1>7</fact1> + 14 = 21 cubes. Since there are <fact3>42 cubes in the pyramid in total</fact3>, the number of purple cubes is <fact3>42</fact3> - 21 = 21 cubes. To find the percentage of cubes that are purple, we divide the number of purple cubes by the total number of cubes and multiply by 100: (21 / <fact3>42</fact3>) * 100 = 50%.

Since he shopped more than <fact6>₣50</fact6>, he received a <fact7>₣15 discount</fact7>. How much does Ali have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of rice. Since it costs <fact2>40% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣5</fact1> + (<fact1>₣5</fact1> * <fact2>0.4</fact2>) = ₣7 per kg.

Since he shopped more than <fact5>₣50</fact5>, he received a <fact6>₣22 discount</fact6>. How much does Arash have to pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of sugar. Since it costs <fact2>20% more</fact2> than the normal brand, the cost is <fact1>₣10</fact1> + (<fact1>₣10</fact1> * <fact2>0.20</fact2>) = ₣12 per kg.

Arash uses <fact3>3 kgs of sugar per day</fact3> and he buys a week's worth of sugar, so he buys 3 kgs/day * 7 days = 21 kgs of sugar.

The total cost of the sugar is 21 kgs * ₣12/kg = ₣252.

He also buys a cookie for <fact4>₣3</fact4>, so the total cost before the discount is ₣252 + ₣3 = ₣255.

What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?","Reformatted Question: Aisha went to their allotment to pick some raspberries and found <fact1>four times as many caterpillars as ants</fact1> in the patch. Aisha then found <fact2>36 rabbits</fact2>, <fact3>33 bees</fact3>, and <fact4>15 ants</fact4>. What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of caterpillars. Since there are <fact1>four times as many caterpillars as ants</fact1> and <fact4>15 ants</fact4>, there are <fact1>four times</fact1> * <fact4>15 ants</fact4> = 60 caterpillars. Now, we can find the total number of animals in the patch by adding the number of caterpillars, ants, rabbits, and bees. Total animals = 60 caterpillars + <fact4>15 ants</fact4> + <fact2>36 rabbits</fact2> + <fact3>33 bees</fact3> = 144 animals. To find the percentage of animals that are rabbits, we divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100. Percentage of rabbits = (<fact2>36 rabbits</fact2> / 144 animals) * 100 = 25%.

Gabrielle then found <fact2>13 rabbits</fact2>, <fact3>16 bees</fact3>, and <fact4>24 grasshoppers</fact4>. What percentage of animals in the field were rabbits?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of ladybugs. Since there are <fact1>one-half as many ladybugs as grasshoppers</fact1> and <fact4>24 grasshoppers</fact4>, there must be <fact4>24</fact4> / 2 = 12 ladybugs. Now, we can find the total number of animals in the field by adding the number of rabbits, bees, grasshoppers, and ladybugs: <fact2>13 rabbits</fact2> + <fact3>16 bees</fact3> + <fact4>24 grasshoppers</fact4> + 12 ladybugs = 65 animals. To find the percentage of animals that are rabbits, we divide the number of rabbits by the total number of animals and multiply by 100: (<fact2>13 rabbits</fact2> / 65 animals) * 100 = 20%.

If there are <fact2>1/3 the number of boys</fact2> in the park, what percentage of the kids in the park are girls?

Answer: To find the percentage of girls in the park, we first need to find the total number of kids in the park. We know that there are <fact1>39 girls</fact1> and the number of boys is <fact2>1/3 the number of boys</fact2> as the number of girls. So, the number of boys is <fact1>39</fact1> / 3 = 13. The total number of kids in the park is <fact1>39 girls</fact1> + 13 boys = 52 kids. Now, we can find the percentage of girls by dividing the number of girls by the total number of kids and multiplying by 100.

If there are <fact2>two-sixths the number of boys</fact2> in the park, what percentage of the kids in the park are girls?

Answer: To find the percentage of girls in the park, we first need to find the total number of kids in the park. We are given that there are <fact1>6 girls</fact1> and that the number of boys is <fact2>two-sixths the number of boys</fact2> as the number of girls. Since two-sixths is equal to 2/6 or 1/3, the number of boys is 1/3 * <fact1>6 girls</fact1> = 2 boys. The total number of kids in the park is <fact1>6 girls</fact1> + 2 boys = 8 kids. The percentage of girls in the park is then (<fact1>6 girls</fact1> / 8 kids) * 100% = 75%.

If there are <fact2>1/4 the number of boys</fact2> in the playground, what percentage of the kids in the playground are girls?

Answer: To find the percentage of girls, we first need to find the total number of kids in the playground. We know that there are <fact1>28 girls</fact1> and the number of boys is <fact2>1/4 the number of boys</fact2> as the girls. Since the number of boys is 1/4 of the girls, we can calculate the number of boys as <fact1>28</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 7 boys. The total number of kids is <fact1>28 girls</fact1> + 7 boys = 35 kids. Now, we can find the percentage of girls by dividing the number of girls by the total number of kids and multiplying by 100: (<fact1>28</fact1> / 35) * 100 = 80%. Therefore, 80% of the kids in the playground are girls.

However, if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she'll receive a <fact7>$10 discount on the entire purchase</fact7>. How much money will Aisha spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To determine how many plants Aisha needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of plants that can fit in her flower bed. Since each plant is <fact2>5 meters wide</fact2> and there needs to be <fact3>13 meters between every plant (including the plants width)</fact3>, the total space required for each plant is <fact3>13</fact3> meters. 

The total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is <fact1>117</fact1> / <fact3>13</fact3> = 9 plants. 

Since Aisha already owns <fact4>5 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 9 - <fact4>5</fact4> = 4 plants. 

The total cost of the plants without discount would be 4 * <fact5>$10</fact5> = $40. 

However, since Aisha is buying more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she is eligible for a <fact7>$10 discount on the entire purchase</fact7>. 

So, the final amount Aisha will spend at the store is $40 - <fact7>$10</fact7> = $30.

However, if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she'll receive a <fact7>$6 discount on the entire purchase</fact7>. How much money will Camila spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To find out how many plants Camila needs to buy, we first need to find out how many plants she needs in total. Since each plant is <fact2>2 meters wide</fact2> and there needs to be <fact3>13 meters between every plant (including the plants width)</fact3>, each plant takes up 13 meters of space. So the number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is <fact1>143 meters</fact1> / 13 meters per plant = 11 plants. Since Camila already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 11 - 6 = 5 plants. Since she is buying more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she will receive a <fact7>$6 discount on the entire purchase</fact7>.

However, if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she'll receive a <fact7>¥9 discount on the entire purchase</fact7>. How much money will Priya spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?

Answer: To determine how many plants Priya needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of plants that can fit in her flower bed. Since each plant is <fact2>5 feet wide</fact2> and there needs to be <fact3>15 feet between every plant (including the plants width)</fact3>, the total space required for each plant is <fact3>15</fact3> feet. 

The total number of plants that can fit in the flower bed is <fact1>150</fact1> / <fact3>15</fact3> = 10 plants. 

Since Priya already owns <fact4>5 flowers</fact4>, she needs to buy 10 - <fact4>5</fact4> = 5 more plants. 

The total cost of the plants without discount would be <fact5>¥14</fact5> * 5 = ¥70. 

However, since Priya is buying more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she is eligible for a <fact7>¥9 discount on the entire purchase</fact7>. 

So, the final amount Priya will spend at the store is ¥70 - <fact7>¥9</fact7> = ¥61.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many seats are available for the graduates' friends and family. We can do this by subtracting the number of seats reserved for the graduates, faculty, and staff from the total number of seats available. So, <fact1>3000 people</fact1> - <fact2>850 seats for the graduates</fact2> - <fact3>350 seats for the faculty attending</fact3> - <fact4>100 seats for the event's staff</fact4> = 1700 seats available for friends and family. Since there are <fact2>850 graduates</fact2>, we can divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive. 1700 / <fact2>850 graduates</fact2> = 2 tickets per graduate.

Answer: 
First, we need to find out how many seats are available for the graduates' friends and family. We can do this by subtracting the number of seats reserved for the graduates, faculty, and staff from the total number of seats available in the Sports Arena. 
So, the available seats for friends and family are <fact1>3500 people</fact1> - <fact2>750 seats for the graduates</fact2> - <fact3>400 seats for the faculty attending</fact3> - <fact4>100 seats for the event's staff</fact4> = 3500 - 750 - 400 - 100 = 2250 seats.
Now, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive. Since there are <fact2>750 seats for the graduates</fact2>, we can assume that there are 750 graduates. 
So, each graduate will receive 2250 / 750 = 3 tickets.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many seats are available for the friends and family of the graduates. We can do this by subtracting the number of seats reserved for the graduates, faculty, and staff from the total number of seats available in the gymnasium. So, the number of seats available for friends and family is <fact1>5700</fact1> - <fact2>1050</fact2> - <fact3>400</fact3> - <fact4>50</fact4> = 4200 seats.

Since there are <fact2>1050 graduates</fact2>, and we want to split the tickets equally among them, we can divide the total number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates. Therefore, each graduate will receive 4200 / <fact2>1050</fact2> = 4 tickets.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many eggs each person found. Ava found <fact2>3 eggs</fact2>. Quinn found <fact3>six times as many as Ava</fact3>, so Quinn found 6 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 18 eggs. Sophia found <fact4>3 less than Quinn</fact4>, so Sophia found 18 - 3 = 15 eggs. Esteban found <fact5>1/5 as many as Sophia</fact5>, so Esteban found 15 / 5 = 3 eggs. To find out how many eggs Fatima found, we need to know how many eggs Quinn and Ava found combined. Quinn and Ava found 18 + <fact2>3</fact2> = 21 eggs combined. Fatima found <fact6>three dozen eggs more than Quinn and Ava combined</fact6>, so Fatima found 21 + 3 * 12 = 21 + 36 = 57 eggs. Now we need to find out how many eggs were hidden in total. Zahra hid <fact1>10 dozen eggs</fact1>, so Zahra hid 10 * 12 = 120 eggs. Now we can find out how many eggs are still hidden by subtracting the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden. The total number of eggs found is 3 + 18 + 15 + 3 + 57 = 96 eggs. So, the number of eggs still hidden is 120 - 96 = 24 eggs.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to convert <fact1>9 dozen eggs</fact1> into a total number of eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, <fact1>9 dozen eggs</fact1> equals 9 x 12 = 108 eggs.

Next, let's calculate how many eggs each person found:
- <fact2>Zahra finds 5 eggs</fact2>.
- <fact3>Roya finds two times as many as Zahra</fact3>, so Roya finds 2 x <fact2>5 eggs</fact2> = 10 eggs.
- <fact4>Sanjay finds 4 less than Roya</fact4>, so Sanjay finds 10 - 4 = 6 eggs.
- <fact5>Ava finds a third as many as Sanjay</fact5>, so Ava finds 6 / 3 = 2 eggs.
- To find out how many eggs <fact6>Noah finds four dozen eggs more than Roya and Zahra combined</fact6>, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs found by Roya and Zahra. Roya found 10 eggs and Zahra found <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>, so together they found 10 + <fact2>5 eggs</fact2> = 15 eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, 4 dozen equals 4 x 12 = 48. Therefore, Noah finds 15 + 48 = 63 eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found by everyone: 5 (Zahra) + 10 (Roya) + 6 (Sanjay) + 2 (Ava) + 63 (Noah) = 86 eggs.

Finally, to find out how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we subtract the total number of eggs found (86) from the initial number of eggs hidden (108). 108 - 86 = 22 eggs.

How many eggs are still hidden in the yard?

Answer: First, we need to convert <fact1>11 dozen eggs</fact1> into a total number of eggs. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, <fact1>11 dozen eggs</fact1> is equal to 11 * 12 = 132 eggs.

Next, we can calculate how many eggs each person found:
- <fact2>Elena found 3 eggs</fact2>.
- <fact3>Mateo found thrice as many as Elena</fact3>, so Mateo found 3 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 9 eggs.
- <fact4>Tara found 1 less than Mateo</fact4>, so Tara found <fact3>9</fact3> - 1 = 8 eggs.
- <fact5>Gabriel found 1/8 as many as Tara</fact5>, so Gabriel found <fact4>8</fact4> / 8 = 1 egg.
- To find out how many eggs <fact6>Liam found</fact6>, we first need to calculate how many eggs Mateo and Elena found combined: <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>9</fact3> = 12 eggs. Since <fact6>Liam found three dozen eggs more than Mateo and Elena combined</fact6>, Liam found 12 + (3 * 12) = 12 + 36 = 48 eggs.

Now, we can add up all the eggs that were found: <fact2>3</fact2> + <fact3>9</fact3> + <fact4>8</fact4> + <fact5>1</fact5> + <fact6>48</fact6> = 69 eggs.

How long will it take her to peel and saute <fact3>80 carrots</fact3> if it takes <fact4>21 minutes to wash all the carrots</fact4>? Note that Tara can't work in parallel.

Answer: First, Tara needs to wash the carrots, which takes <fact4>21 minutes</fact4>. Then, she needs to peel <fact3>80 carrots</fact3>. Since she can <fact1>peel 4 carrots a minute</fact1>, it will take her <fact3>80 carrots</fact3> / <fact1>4 carrots per minute</fact1> = 20 minutes to peel all the carrots. After peeling, she needs to saute the carrots. Since she can <fact2>saute 40 carrots in 11 minutes</fact2>, it will take her <fact3>80 carrots</fact3> / <fact2>40 carrots per 11 minutes</fact2> * 11 minutes = 22 minutes to saute all the carrots.

How long will it take her to peel and saute <fact3>140 clams</fact3> if it takes <fact4>22 minutes to wash all the clams</fact4>? Note that Daphne can't work in parallel.

Answer: First, let's calculate how long it takes Daphne to peel <fact3>140 clams</fact3>. Since she can <fact1>peel 4 clams a minute</fact1>, it will take her <fact3>140</fact3> / <fact1>4</fact1> = 35 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, let's calculate how long it takes Daphne to saute <fact3>140 clams</fact3>. Since she can <fact2>saute 20 clams in 15 minutes</fact2>, it will take her <fact3>140</fact3> / <fact2>20</fact2> * <fact2>15</fact2> = 105 minutes to saute all the clams.

Additionally, it takes <fact4>22 minutes to wash all the clams</fact4>. Since Daphne can't work in parallel, we need to add up the time it takes to wash, peel, and saute the clams. Therefore, the total time it will take Daphne to peel and saute <fact3>140 clams</fact3> is 22 + 35 + 105 = 162 minutes.

If the length of his room is 19 feet longer that its width, what is the perimeter of the room in feet?","Reformatted Question: The <fact1>area of Yuki's rectangular office is 92 square feet</fact1>. If the <fact2>length of his room is 19 feet longer than its width</fact2>, what is the <fact3>perimeter of the room in feet</fact3>?

Answer: Let's denote the width of the room as w. Then, according to <fact2>the length of his room is 19 feet longer than its width</fact2>, the length of the room is w + 19. The area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width. So, we can write the equation: w(w + 19) = <fact1>92</fact1>. This equation can be rewritten as w^2 + 19w - <fact1>92</fact1> = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that w = 4. The length is then w + 19 = 23. The <fact3>perimeter of the room</fact3> is the sum of all sides, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Therefore, the perimeter is 2(23) + 2(4) = 54.

If the <fact2>length of his room is 16 meters longer than its width</fact2>, what is the <fact3>perimeter of the room in meters</fact3>?

Answer: Let's denote the width of the room as w. Then, according to <fact2>the length of his room is 16 meters longer than its width</fact2>, the length of the room is w + 16. The area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width. So, we can write the equation: w(w + 16) = <fact1>80</fact1>. This equation can be rewritten as w^2 + 16w - <fact1>80</fact1> = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get w = 4. Now we can find the length: w + 16 = 4 + 16 = 20. The <fact3>perimeter of the room</fact3> is the sum of all sides, which is 2 times (length + width). So, the perimeter is 2(20 + 4) = 48 meters.

If the <fact2>length of his room is 2 meters longer than its width</fact2>, what is the <fact3>perimeter of the room in meters</fact3>?

Answer: Let's denote the width of the room as w. Then, according to <fact2>the length of his room is 2 meters longer than its width</fact2>, the length of the room is w + 2. The area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width. So, we can write the equation: w(w + 2) = <fact1>224</fact1>. Expanding the equation, we get w^2 + 2w - <fact1>224</fact1> = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (w + 16)(w - 14) = 0. This gives us two possible values for w: w = -16 (which is not possible since width cannot be negative) and w = 14. So, the width of the room is 14 meters. The length of the room is w + 2 = 14 + 2 = 16 meters. The <fact3>perimeter of the room</fact3> is calculated as 2 times the sum of the length and width. Therefore, the <fact3>perimeter of the room</fact3> is 2(14 + 16) = 60 meters.

How much will Leilani make, after receiving a <fact8>25% tip on every purchase</fact8>?

Answer: First, we need to round the prices of the herbs to the nearest dollar. The price of sunflowers will be rounded to $2, since <fact1>$1.59</fact1> is closer to $2 than $1. The price of lilies will be rounded to $5, since <fact2>$4.87</fact2> is closer to $5 than $4. The price of daisies will be rounded to $5, since <fact3>$5.16</fact3> is closer to $5 than $6.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Leilani will make from selling the herbs. Leilani sells <fact5>11 bundles of sunflowers</fact5> for $2 each, so the total amount of money from sunflowers is 11 x $2 = $22. Leilani sells <fact6>23 bundles of lilies</fact6> for $5 each, so the total amount of money from lilies is 23 x $5 = $115. Leilani sells <fact7>39 bundles of daisies</fact7> for $5 each, so the total amount of money from daisies is 39 x $5 = $195.

The total amount of money Leilani will make is $22 + $115 + $195 = $332. Since Leilani receives a <fact8>25% tip on every purchase</fact8>, the total amount of money Leilani will make is $332 + ($332 x 0.25) = $415.

How much will Luca make, after receiving a <fact8>25% tip on every purchase</fact8>?

Answer: First, we need to round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar. The price of roses will be rounded to ₣2, since <fact1>₣1.59</fact1> is closer to ₣2 than ₣1. The price of sunflowers will be rounded to ₣5, since <fact2>₣5.39</fact2> is closer to ₣5 than ₣6. The price of daisies will be rounded to ₣5, since <fact3>₣5.16</fact3> is closer to ₣5 than ₣6.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Luca will make from selling the flowers. Luca sells <fact5>6 bundles of roses</fact5> for ₣2 each, so the total amount of money from roses is 6 x ₣2 = ₣12. Luca sells <fact6>24 bundles of sunflowers</fact6> for ₣5 each, so the total amount of money from sunflowers is 24 x ₣5 = ₣120. Luca sells <fact7>40 bundles of daisies</fact7> for ₣5 each, so the total amount of money from daisies is 40 x ₣5 = ₣200.

The total amount of money Luca will make is ₣12 + ₣120 + ₣200 = ₣332. Since Luca receives a <fact8>25% tip on every purchase</fact8>, the total amount of money Luca will make is ₣332 + (25% of ₣332) = ₣332 + ₣83 = ₣415.

How much money does he have left, if he receives a <fact4>20% discount on the action figure</fact4> and a <fact5>25% on the candy bar</fact5>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Santiago has. Since he has <fact1>5 €20 bills</fact1>, he has a total of 5 x 20 = €100.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the action figures. He buys <fact2>8 action figures for €5 each</fact2>, so the total cost would be 8 x 5 = €40. However, he receives a <fact4>20% discount on the action figure</fact4>, so the actual cost would be 40 - (40 x 0.20) = €32.

Then, we need to calculate the total cost of the candy bars. He buys <fact3>3 packs of candy bars for €4 each</fact3>, so the total cost would be 3 x 4 = €12. However, he receives a <fact5>25% discount on the candy bar</fact5>, so the actual cost would be 12 - (12 x 0.25) = €9.

174,"One miner can mine 5 pounds of ore per day with wooden pickaxe. He can mine thrice as much with one silver pickaxe and 60% more with a mithril pickaxe than with one silver pickaxe. How many pounds of ore can 8 miners mine in a month with 28 days if they all use silver pickaxe in the first half, and then switch to mithril pickaxes in the second half of the month?","Reformatted Question: One miner can mine <fact1>5 pounds of ore per day with wooden pickaxe</fact1>. He can mine <fact2>thrice as much with one silver pickaxe</fact2> and <fact3>60% more with a mithril pickaxe than with one silver pickaxe</fact3>. How many pounds of ore can <fact4>8 miners</fact4> mine in a <fact5>month with 28 days</fact5> if they all use silver pickaxe in the <fact6>first half</fact6>, and then switch to mithril pickaxes in the <fact7>second half of the month</fact7>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much ore a miner can mine with a silver pickaxe. Since a miner can mine <fact2>thrice as much with one silver pickaxe</fact2> as with a wooden pickaxe, and a miner can mine <fact1>5 pounds of ore per day with wooden pickaxe</fact1>, a miner can mine 3 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 15 pounds of ore per day with a silver pickaxe.

Next, we need to find out how much ore a miner can mine with a mithril pickaxe. Since a miner can mine <fact3>60% more with a mithril pickaxe than with one silver pickaxe</fact3>, and a miner can mine 15 pounds of ore per day with a silver pickaxe, a miner can mine 15 + (15 * 0.6) = 15 + 9 = 24 pounds of ore per day with a mithril pickaxe.

Now, we need to calculate the total amount of ore mined by <fact4>8 miners</fact4> in the <fact5>month with 28 days</fact5>. In the <fact6>first half</fact6> of the month, which is 14 days, <fact4>8 miners</fact4> using silver pickaxes can mine 8 * 15 * 14 = 1680 pounds of ore.

In the <fact7>second half of the month</fact7>, which is also 14 days, <fact4>8 miners</fact4> using mithril pickaxes can mine 8 * 24 * 14 = 2688 pounds of ore.

Therefore, the total amount of ore mined by <fact4>8 miners</fact4> in the <fact5>month with 28 days</fact5> is 1680 + 2688 = 4368 pounds.

Answer: With an iron pickaxe, a troll can mine <fact2>two times as much</fact2> as he can with his bare hands. Since <fact1>he can mine 7 kgs of ore per day with bare hands</fact1>, with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 7 * 2 = 14 kgs of ore per day. 
With a steel pickaxe, a troll can mine <fact3>50% more</fact3> than he can with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine 14 kgs of ore per day with an iron pickaxe, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 14 + 0.5 * 14 = 21 kgs of ore per day.
In the <fact6>first half</fact6> of the month, there are 32 / 2 = 16 days. In this period, <fact4>8 trolls</fact4> using iron pickaxes can mine 8 * 14 * 16 = 1792 kgs of ore.
In the <fact7>second half of the month</fact7>, there are also 16 days. In this period, <fact4>8 trolls</fact4> using steel pickaxes can mine 8 * 21 * 16 = 2688 kgs of ore.

Answer: First, we need to find out how much ore a gnome can mine with a silver pickaxe. Since a gnome can mine <fact2>twice as much with one silver pickaxe</fact2> as with a wooden pickaxe, and he can mine <fact1>5 pounds of ore per day with wooden pickaxe</fact1>, then with a silver pickaxe, he can mine 2 * <fact1>5</fact1> = 10 pounds of ore per day.

Next, we need to find out how much ore a gnome can mine with a mithril pickaxe. Since a gnome can mine <fact3>60% more with a mithril pickaxe than with one silver pickaxe</fact3>, and he can mine 10 pounds of ore per day with a silver pickaxe, then with a mithril pickaxe, he can mine 10 + 0.6 * 10 = 16 pounds of ore per day.

Now, we need to calculate how much ore <fact4>8 gnomes</fact4> can mine in the <fact6>first half</fact6> of the month with silver pickaxes. The first half of the month is <fact5>32</fact5> / 2 = 16 days. So, in the first half of the month, 8 gnomes can mine 8 * 10 * 16 = 1280 pounds of ore.

Next, we need to calculate how much ore <fact4>8 gnomes</fact4> can mine in the <fact7>second half of the month</fact7> with mithril pickaxes. The second half of the month is also 16 days. So, in the second half of the month, 8 gnomes can mine 8 * 16 * 16 = 2048 pounds of ore.

Finally, we add the amount of ore mined in the first half and the second half to get the total amount of ore mined in the month. The total amount of ore mined is 1280 + 2048 = 3328 pounds.

But as I pour it, I spill <fact5>4 liters of the lemon drink</fact5>. To make up for that, I add <fact6>4 liters of water</fact6> to the mix. What percentage of the final mix is water?

Answer: First, let's calculate the amount of water in the lemon drink. Since the lemon drink is <fact2>4/5 water</fact2>, the amount of water in the lemon drink is <fact1>9 liters</fact1> * <fact2>4/5</fact2> = 7.2 liters. However, <fact5>4 liters of the lemon drink</fact5> are spilled, so the amount of water from the lemon drink that is added to the mix is 7.2 - <fact5>4</fact5> * <fact2>4/5</fact2> = 7.2 - 3.2 = 4 liters.

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the mango drink. Since the mango drink is <fact4>1/8 water</fact4>, the amount of water in the mango drink is <fact3>16 liters</fact3> * <fact4>1/8</fact4> = 2 liters.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the mix. We have 4 liters of water from the lemon drink, 2 liters of water from the mango drink, and <fact6>4 liters of water</fact6> that are added to the mix. So, the total amount of water in the mix is 4 + 2 + <fact6>4</fact6> = 10 liters.

Finally, let's calculate the total volume of the mix. We have <fact1>9 liters</fact1> - <fact5>4 liters</fact5> = 5 liters of lemon drink, <fact3>16 liters</fact3> of mango drink, and <fact6>4 liters of water</fact6> that are added to the mix. So, the total volume of the mix is 5 + <fact3>16</fact3> + <fact6>4</fact6> = 25 liters.

The percentage of water in the final mix is the total amount of water divided by the total volume of the mix, multiplied by 100. So, the percentage of water in the final mix is (10 / 25) * 100 = 40%.

Answer: Yusuf works <fact1>10 hours a day</fact1> for <fact2>4 days a week</fact2>, so he works a total of <fact1>10 hours/day</fact1> * <fact2>4 days/week</fact2> = 40 hours/week. 
He earns <fact3>€24 per hour</fact3>, so his weekly earnings are 40 hours/week * <fact3>€24/hour</fact3> = €960/week. 
He also gets a <fact4>€265 bonus each week</fact4>, so his total weekly earnings are €960/week + <fact4>€265/week</fact4> = €1225/week. 
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, his monthly earnings are €1225/week * 4 weeks/month = €4900/month.

How much money did DeShawn make after tax in February if the company performed very well for the whole month?

Answer: Since Deshawn works <fact1>9 hours a day</fact1> and <fact2>4 days a week</fact2>, he works a total of <fact1>9 hours/day</fact1> * <fact2>4 days/week</fact2> = 36 hours/week. In a month with 4 weeks, he works a total of 36 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 144 hours/month. His monthly income from hours worked is <fact3>₺11/hour</fact3> * 144 hours/month = ₺1584. He also gets a weekly bonus of <fact4>₺485</fact4>, so his monthly bonus is <fact4>₺485/week</fact4> * 4 weeks/month = ₺1940. His total monthly income before tax is ₺1584 + ₺1940 = ₺3524. He pays <fact5>25% income tax</fact5>, so his monthly income after tax is ₺3524 * (1 - <fact5>0.25</fact5>) = ₺3524 * 0.75 = ₺2643.

Answer: Luis started with <fact1>54 beads</fact1>. He dropped <fact2>two-fourths of them</fact2>, which is 2/4 * <fact1>54</fact1> = 27 beads. He was left with <fact1>54</fact1> - 27 = 27 beads. He then picked up <fact3>13</fact3> more beads, but <fact4>3 of them were coins</fact4>, so he actually picked up <fact3>13</fact3> - <fact4>3</fact4> = 10 beads. Now he has 27 + 10 = 37 beads.

Seeing how upset Kai was, his father gave him a pouch of beads with <fact5>6 beads inside</fact5>. How many beads did Kai end up with?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many beads Kai dropped. Since he dropped <fact2>two-fourths of them</fact2>, we need to calculate two-fourths of <fact1>84</fact1>. Two-fourths is the same as one-half, so we can calculate this as <fact1>84</fact1>/2 = 42 beads dropped. 

Kai was left with <fact1>84</fact1> - 42 = 42 beads. Then, he found <fact3>10</fact3> more, but <fact4>5 of them were buttons</fact4>, so he only found <fact3>10</fact3> - <fact4>5</fact4> = 5 beads.

On average, how many cards per color are there?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of blue cards. Since there are <fact2>40% more blue cards</fact2> than green cards, we can calculate the number of blue cards as <fact1>115 green cards</fact1> * 1.4 = 161 blue cards.

Next, we can find the number of pink cards, which is the sum of green and blue cards. So, the number of pink cards is <fact1>115 green cards</fact1> + 161 blue cards = 276 pink cards.

Now, we have the total number of cards for each color: 115 green, 161 blue, and 276 pink. To find the average number of cards per color, we can add these numbers together and divide by 3.

The total number of cards is <fact1>115 green cards</fact1> + 161 blue cards + 276 pink cards = 552 cards.

Finally, we can calculate the average number of cards per color as 552 cards / 3 colors = 184 cards per color.

On average, how many cards per color are there?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of green cards. Since there are <fact2>25% more green cards</fact2> than purple cards, we can calculate the number of green cards as <fact1>36 purple cards</fact1> * 1.25 = 45 green cards.

Next, we need to find the number of black cards. According to the problem, <fact3>black cards are as many as the sum of purple and green cards</fact3>, so the number of black cards is <fact1>36 purple cards</fact1> + 45 green cards = 81 black cards.

Now, we can find the total number of cards: <fact1>36 purple cards</fact1> + 45 green cards + 81 black cards = 162 cards.

Finally, we can calculate the average number of cards per color by dividing the total number of cards by 3 (the number of colors): 162 cards / 3 = 54 cards per color.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of blue cards. Since there are <fact2>25% more blue cards</fact2> than orange cards, we can calculate the number of blue cards as <fact1>60 orange cards</fact1> * 1.25 = 75 blue cards.

Next, we need to find the number of green cards. According to the problem, <fact3>green cards are as many as the sum of orange and blue cards</fact3>, so the number of green cards is <fact1>60 orange cards</fact1> + 75 blue cards = 135 green cards.

Now, we can calculate the average number of cards per color by adding the number of cards of each color and dividing by 3 (the number of colors). The total number of cards is <fact1>60 orange cards</fact1> + 75 blue cards + 135 green cards = 270 cards.

Finally, we can calculate the average number of cards per color as 270 cards / 3 colors = 90 cards per color.

The total weight is <fact1>1300 kilograms</fact1> + <fact2>375 kilograms</fact2> + <fact3>3</fact3> * <fact3>55 kilograms</fact3> + <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact4>80 kilograms</fact4> = 1300 + 375 + 165 + 160 = 2000 kilograms. Since <fact5>the force needed to move the SUV is 3% of the total weight</fact5>, we can calculate the force needed by multiplying the total weight by 0.03. The force needed is 2000 * 0.03 = 60 kilograms.

He also has his <fact3>2 young friends who weigh 70 kilograms each</fact3> in it. In addition, the van comes with <fact4>two spare tires, each weighing 70 kilograms</fact4>. If <fact5>the force need to move the van is 5% of the total weight</fact5>, how much force does Andre need to push the van?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of the van. The van itself weighs <fact1>2300 kilograms</fact1>. The groceries weigh <fact2>400 kilograms</fact2>. The two young friends weigh <fact3>2</fact3> x <fact3>70 kilograms</fact3> = 140 kilograms. The two spare tires weigh <fact4>2</fact4> x <fact4>70 kilograms</fact4> = 140 kilograms. So, the total weight is <fact1>2300</fact1> + <fact2>400</fact2> + 140 + 140 = 2980 kilograms. Since <fact5>the force needed to move the van is 5% of the total weight</fact5>, we can calculate the force needed by multiplying the total weight by 0.05. Therefore, the force needed is 2980 x 0.05 = 149 kilograms.

On Thursday he exercised for <fact2>33 minutes</fact2>. On Friday he exercised for <fact3>45 minutes</fact3>. How many hours does he have to exercise on Saturday to reach his goal?

Answer: First, we need to find the total amount of time Mohammed exercised on Thursday and Friday. He exercised for <fact2>33 minutes</fact2> on Thursday and <fact3>45 minutes</fact3> on Friday, so the total time is <fact2>33</fact2> + <fact3>45</fact3> = 78 minutes.

He gets paid <fact3>₣25 every day</fact3>. How much does he earn in a year after paying <fact4>20% in taxes</fact4>?

Answer: The carpenter works for <fact1>2 weeks every month</fact1> and there are 12 months in a year, so he works for <fact1>2 weeks/month</fact1> * 12 months/year = 24 weeks/year. Since he works <fact2>4 days every week</fact2>, he works a total of 24 weeks/year * <fact2>4 days/week</fact2> = 96 days/year. He earns <fact3>₣25 every day</fact3>, so his total earnings per year are 96 days/year * <fact3>₣25/day</fact3> = ₣2400/year.

He gets paid <fact3>€20 every day</fact3>. How much does he earn in a year after paying <fact4>20% in taxes</fact4>?

Answer: The carpenter works for <fact1>2 weeks every month</fact1>, which is equivalent to 2 * 4 = 8 weeks in a 4-week month. However, since the month is not exactly 4 weeks, we will calculate the total number of days worked per year. There are 52 weeks in a year, and the carpenter works <fact2>2 days every week</fact2>, so he works 52 * 2 = 104 days per year from the weekly schedule. Additionally, he works <fact1>2 weeks every month</fact1>, which is equivalent to 2 * 12 = 24 weeks per year from the monthly schedule. Since there are 7 days in a week, he works 24 * 7 = 168 days per year from the monthly schedule. However, this includes some days that are already counted in the weekly schedule. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the overlap. Since the carpenter works <fact2>2 days every week</fact2> and there are 24 weeks from the monthly schedule, the overlap is 24 * 2 = 48 days. Therefore, the total number of days worked per year is 168 + 104 - 48 = 224 days. The carpenter earns <fact3>€20 every day</fact3>, so his total annual income is 224 * 20 = €4480. After paying <fact4>20% in taxes</fact4>, his take-home income is 4480 * (1 - 0.20) = €3584.

He gets paid <fact3>$30 every day</fact3>. How much does he earn in a year after paying <fact4>15% in taxes</fact4>?

Answer: The plumber works for <fact1>2 weeks every month</fact1> and there are 12 months in a year, so he works for <fact1>2 weeks/month</fact1> * 12 months/year = 24 weeks/year. Since he works <fact2>3 days every week</fact2>, he works a total of 24 weeks/year * <fact2>3 days/week</fact2> = 72 days/year. He earns <fact3>$30 every day</fact3>, so his total annual income is 72 days/year * <fact3>$30/day</fact3> = $2160. After paying <fact4>15% in taxes</fact4>, his take-home pay is $2160 - ( <fact4>15%</fact4> * $2160 ) = $2160 - $324 = $1836.

If there are <fact4>17 cows</fact4>, <fact5>8 horses</fact5>, and <fact6>20 alpacas</fact6>, how many pounds of silage does Sanjay need?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each horse needs. Since <fact2>each horse needs 6 pounds less than twice the amount each cow needs</fact2> and <fact1>each cow needs 7 pounds</fact1>, each horse needs 2 * <fact1>7</fact1> - 6 = 8 pounds. Next, we calculate how much each alpaca needs. Since <fact3>each alpaca eats as much as a cow and horse eat combined</fact3>, each alpaca needs <fact1>7</fact1> + 8 = 15 pounds. Now, we can calculate the total amount of silage needed. <fact4>17 cows</fact4> need <fact1>7</fact1> * <fact4>17</fact4> = 119 pounds. <fact5>8 horses</fact5> need 8 * <fact5>8</fact5> = 64 pounds. <fact6>20 alpacas</fact6> need 15 * <fact6>20</fact6> = 300 pounds.

If there are <fact4>22 horses</fact4>, <fact5>9 goats</fact5>, and <fact6>18 cows</fact6>, how many kg of hay does Esteban need?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each goat needs. Since <fact2>each goat needs 5 kg less than twice the amount each horse needs</fact2> and <fact1>each horse needs 9 kg</fact1>, each goat needs 2 * <fact1>9</fact1> - 5 = 13 kg. 

Next, we need to calculate how much each cow needs. Since <fact3>each cow eats as much as a horse and goat eat combined</fact3>, each cow needs <fact1>9</fact1> + 13 = 22 kg.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of hay needed. The <fact4>22 horses</fact4> need <fact4>22</fact4> * <fact1>9</fact1> = 198 kg. The <fact5>9 goats</fact5> need <fact5>9</fact5> * 13 = 117 kg. The <fact6>18 cows</fact6> need <fact6>18</fact6> * 22 = 396 kg.

If there are <fact4>6 llamas</fact4>, <fact5>23 goats</fact5>, and <fact6>23 alpacas</fact6>, how many kilograms of grain does Liam need?

Answer: First, we need to calculate how much each goat needs. Since <fact2>each goat needs 4 kilograms less than twice the amount each llama needs</fact2> and <fact1>each llama needs 6 kilograms</fact1>, each goat needs 2 * <fact1>6</fact1> - 4 = 8 kilograms. Next, we calculate how much each alpaca needs. Since <fact3>each alpaca eats as much as a llama and goat eat combined</fact3>, each alpaca needs <fact1>6</fact1> + 8 = 14 kilograms. Now, we can calculate the total amount of grain needed. The <fact4>6 llamas</fact4> need <fact4>6</fact4> * <fact1>6</fact1> = 36 kilograms. The <fact5>23 goats</fact5> need <fact5>23</fact5> * 8 = 184 kilograms. The <fact6>23 alpacas</fact6> need <fact6>23</fact6> * 14 = 322 kilograms.

Answer: Since <fact1>Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the Sun every 58 years</fact1>, Andre's father saw the comet 58 years ago. At that time, <fact2>Andre's father was 34 years old</fact2>. Now, Andre's father is 34 + 58 = 92 years old. Since <fact3>Andre saw the comet for the second time when he was two times the age his father was when he first saw the comet</fact3>, Andre is 2 * 34 = 68 years old. Therefore, Andre's father is 92 - 68 = 24 years older than Andre.

222,"There are 81 second-graders at Oak Ridge School. 36 of them are girls. On Tuesday, 8 second-grade girls and 3 second-grade boys were absent. On Tuesday, what percentage of the present second grade students were boys?","Reformatted Question: There are <fact1>81 second-graders at Oak Ridge School</fact1>. <fact2>36 of them are girls</fact2>. On Tuesday, <fact3>8 second-grade girls</fact3> and <fact4>3 second-grade boys</fact4> were absent. On Tuesday, what percentage of the present second grade students were boys?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of boys in the second grade. Since <fact1>there are 81 second-graders</fact1> and <fact2>36 of them are girls</fact2>, the number of boys is <fact1>81</fact1> - <fact2>36</fact2> = 45. 

On Tuesday, <fact3>8 girls</fact3> and <fact4>3 boys</fact4> were absent, so the number of present boys is 45 - <fact4>3</fact4> = 42, and the number of present girls is <fact2>36</fact2> - <fact3>8</fact3> = 28.

The total number of present students is 42 + 28 = 70.

On Monday, <fact3>6 first-grade girls</fact3> and <fact4>1 first-grade boy</fact4> were absent. On Monday, what percentage of the present first grade students were boys?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of boys in the class. Since <fact2>28 of the students are girls</fact2>, the number of boys is <fact1>95</fact1> - <fact2>28</fact2> = 67. On Monday, <fact3>6 girls</fact3> and <fact4>1 boy</fact4> were absent, so the number of boys present is 67 - <fact4>1</fact4> = 66, and the number of girls present is <fact2>28</fact2> - <fact3>6</fact3> = 22. The total number of students present is 66 + 22 = 88. To find the percentage of boys, we divide the number of boys present (66) by the total number of students present (88) and multiply by 100: (66 / 88) * 100 = 75%.

On Monday, <fact3>1 first-grade girl</fact3> and <fact4>3 first-grade boys</fact4> were absent. On Monday, what percentage of the present first grade students were boys?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of boys in the class. Since <fact1>there are 144 first-graders</fact1> and <fact2>22 of them are girls</fact2>, the number of boys is <fact1>144</fact1> - <fact2>22</fact2> = 122. 

On Monday, <fact3>1 girl</fact3> and <fact4>3 boys</fact4> were absent, so the number of boys present is 122 - <fact4>3</fact4> = 119. 

The total number of students present on Monday is <fact1>144</fact1> - <fact3>1</fact3> - <fact4>3</fact4> = 140.

If a <fact5>kg of steelhead costs $1.75</fact5>, how much will he earn after selling all the steelheads to the market?

Answer: The total weight of the steelheads caught by Ali can be calculated as follows: 
The first steelhead weighs <fact2>57 kgs</fact2>. 
The second steelhead weighs <fact3>47 kgs</fact3>. 
The rest of the steelheads, which are <fact1>5</fact1> - 2 = 3, weigh <fact3>47 kgs</fact3> + <fact4>21 kgs</fact4> = 68 kgs each. 
So, the total weight of the steelheads is <fact2>57 kgs</fact2> + <fact3>47 kgs</fact3> + 3 * 68 kgs = 57 + 47 + 204 = 308 kgs. 
Since a <fact5>kg of steelhead costs $1.75</fact5>, Ali will earn 308 * <fact5>$1.75</fact5> = $539.

Answer: To find out how many pages Zahra has left to write, we need to calculate the number of pages she has already written. Since she has finished writing <fact2>3/5 of the essay</fact2>, and the total number of pages is <fact1>310</fact1>, the number of pages she has written is <fact2>3/5</fact2> * <fact1>310</fact1> = 186 pages.

Answer: Liam has <fact1>5 periods</fact1> + <fact2>3 extra classes</fact2> = 8 classes per day. Each class is <fact3>35 minutes long</fact3> and he spends <fact4>5 minutes before each class</fact4>, so he spends 35 + 5 = 40 minutes per class. He spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes per day on classes.

Answer: First, we need to convert all the costs to the same unit, which is pounds. Since there are 100 cents in a pound, the cost of cookies is <fact1>50 cents</fact1> = £0.50 and the cost of popcorn packs is <fact2>100 cents</fact2> = £1. 

James spent <fact4>£60</fact4> and had <fact7>5% of his money left in change</fact7>, so he actually spent 95% of £60, which is £57. 

The cost of the cookies James bought is <fact5>2 bags</fact5> * £0.50 = £1. The cost of the crackers James bought is <fact6>3 packs</fact6> * <fact3>£13</fact3> = £39.

Now, let's subtract the amount spent on cookies and popcorn packs from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on pretzels. The amount spent on pretzels is €91 - €44 = €47. 

Since each pretzel costs <fact2>100 cents</fact2> = €1, the number of pretzels Yuki bought is €47 / €1 = 47.

The answer is {47}."
242,"The vending machine sells popcorn packs for 80 cents, cookies for 100 cents, and gum for ₤11. Kai spent ₤100 and got 5 bags of popcorn packs, 3 packs of gum, and had 9% of his money left in change. How many cookies did he buy?","Reformatted Question: The vending machine sells <fact1>popcorn packs for 80 cents</fact1>, <fact2>cookies for 100 cents</fact2>, and <fact3>gum for £11</fact3>. <fact4>Kai spent £100</fact4> and got <fact5>5 bags of popcorn packs</fact5>, <fact6>3 packs of gum</fact6>, and had <fact7>9% of his money left in change</fact7>. How many cookies did he buy?

Answer: First, we need to find out how much money Kai spent on popcorn packs and gum. Since <fact1>popcorn packs cost 80 cents</fact1>, and <fact5>Kai bought 5 bags of popcorn packs</fact5>, he spent <fact5>5</fact5> * <fact1>0.80</fact1> = £4 on popcorn packs. Since <fact3>gum costs £11</fact3>, and <fact6>Kai bought 3 packs of gum</fact6>, he spent <fact6>3</fact6> * <fact3>£11</fact3> = £33 on gum. 

The total amount of money Kai spent on popcorn packs and gum is £4 + £33 = £37. 

Since <fact4>Kai spent £100</fact4> and had <fact7>9% of his money left in change</fact7>, the amount of money he spent is £100 - (£100 * 0.09) = £100 - £9 = £91. 

So, the amount of money Kai spent on cookies is £91 - £37 = £54. 

Since <fact2>cookies cost 100 cents or £1</fact2>, the number of cookies Kai bought is £54 / £1 = 54.

How many engineers have stayed at the party, if 14 artists remained?","Reformatted Question: At the beginning of the party, there were <fact1>76 people</fact1>, of which <fact2>33 were artists</fact2>, and the rest were engineers. After half an hour, <fact3>two-fourths of the total number of people left</fact3>. How many engineers have stayed at the party, if <fact4>14 artists remained</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many engineers were at the party initially. We know that there were <fact1>76 people</fact1> in total and <fact2>33 were artists</fact2>. So, the number of engineers is <fact1>76</fact1> - <fact2>33</fact2> = 43.

Next, we need to find out how many people left the party. We know that <fact3>two-fourths of the total number of people left</fact3>, which is <fact1>76</fact1> * 2/4 = 38 people.

Now, we know that <fact4>14 artists remained</fact4> at the party. So, the number of artists who left is <fact2>33</fact2> - <fact4>14</fact4> = 19. This means that the number of engineers who left is 38 - 19 = 19.

After 45 minutes, <fact3>four-sixths of the total number of people left</fact3>. How many engineers have stayed at the gathering, if <fact4>12 teachers remained</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many engineers were at the gathering initially. We know that <fact1>there were 54 people</fact1> and <fact2>28 were teachers</fact2>, so the number of engineers is <fact1>54</fact1> - <fact2>28</fact2> = 26.
Next, we need to find out how many people left the gathering. We know that <fact3>four-sixths of the total number of people left</fact3>, so the number of people who left is <fact1>54</fact1> * <fact3>4/6</fact3> = 36.
Since <fact4>12 teachers remained</fact4>, the number of teachers who left is <fact2>28</fact2> - <fact4>12</fact4> = 16. This means that the number of engineers who left is 36 - 16 = 20.

After half an hour, <fact3>2/5 of the total number of people left</fact3>. How many teachers have stayed at the conference, if <fact4>19 doctors remained</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many teachers were at the conference initially. Since there were <fact1>40 people</fact1> in total and <fact2>30 were doctors</fact2>, the number of teachers is <fact1>40</fact1> - <fact2>30</fact2> = 10.

Next, we need to find out how many people left the conference. Since <fact3>2/5 of the total number of people left</fact3>, the number of people who left is <fact1>40</fact1> * <fact3>2/5</fact3> = 16.

Now, we know that <fact4>19 doctors remained</fact4>, so the number of doctors who left is <fact2>30</fact2> - <fact4>19</fact4> = 11. This means that the number of teachers who left is 16 - 11 = 5.

In the third year, the stock price <fact5>increases by 25%</fact5>. By the end of the third year, how much profit has Keisha made?

Answer: Keisha initially spent <fact1>8 shares</fact1> * <fact2>€44 per share</fact2> = €352 on the stock. 
In the first year, the stock price <fact3>increased by 75%</fact3>, so the new price per share was <fact2>€44</fact2> + (<fact2>€44</fact2> * <fact3>0.75</fact3>) = €44 + €33 = €77. 
The total value of the stock after the first year was <fact1>8 shares</fact1> * €77 per share = €616. 
In the second year, the stock price <fact4>decreased by 50%</fact4>, so the new price per share was €77 - (€77 * <fact4>0.5</fact4>) = €77 - €38.5 = €38.5. 
The total value of the stock after the second year was <fact1>8 shares</fact1> * €38.5 per share = €308. 
In the third year, the stock price <fact5>increased by 25%</fact5>, so the new price per share was €38.5 + (€38.5 * <fact5>0.25</fact5>) = €38.5 + €9.625 = €48.125. 
The total value of the stock after the third year was <fact1>8 shares</fact1> * €48.125 per share = €385.

In the third year, the stock price <fact4>increases by 25%</fact4>. By the end of the third year, how much profit has Sofia made?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total amount Sofia spent on the stock. Since she bought <fact1>6 shares for $35 each</fact1>, the total amount spent is <fact1>6</fact1> * <fact1>$35</fact1> = $210.

In the first year, the stock price <fact2>increases 50%</fact2>, so the new price per share is <fact1>$35</fact1> + (<fact1>$35</fact1> * <fact2>0.5</fact2>) = $52.50.

In the second year, the stock price <fact3>decreases 20%</fact3>, so the new price per share is $52.50 - ($52.50 * <fact3>0.2</fact3>) = $42.

In the third year, the stock price <fact4>increases by 25%</fact4>, so the new price per share is $42 + ($42 * <fact4>0.25</fact4>) = $52.50.

Now, let's calculate the total value of the stock after three years. Since Sofia owns <fact1>6 shares</fact1>, the total value is <fact1>6</fact1> * $52.50 = $315.

To find the profit, we subtract the initial amount spent from the final value: $315 - $210 = $105.

By the end of the third year, how much profit has Olga made?

Answer: Olga initially spent <fact1>16 shares</fact1> * <fact2>₺92 each</fact2> = ₺1472 on the stock. 
In the first year, the stock price <fact3>increased by 50%</fact3>, so the new price per share was <fact2>₺92</fact2> + (<fact2>₺92</fact2> * <fact3>0.5</fact3>) = ₺138. 
The total value of the stock after the first year was <fact1>16 shares</fact1> * ₺138 = ₺2208. 
In the second year, the stock price <fact4>decreased by 25%</fact4>, so the new price per share was ₺138 - (₺138 * <fact4>0.25</fact4>) = ₺103.5.

They agree to split it with <fact2>Camila getting 180 feet more than Santiago</fact2>, and <fact3>Ibrahim getting 120 feet more than Camila</fact3>. How much is left over for Santiago?

Answer: Let's denote the amount of fence Santiago gets as x. Since <fact2>Camila gets 180 feet more than Santiago</fact2>, Camila gets x + 180 feet. Since <fact3>Ibrahim gets 120 feet more than Camila</fact3>, Ibrahim gets (x + 180) + 120 = x + 300 feet. The total amount of fence is <fact1>780 feet</fact1>, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 180) + (x + 300) = 780. Combining like terms, we get 3x + 480 = 780.

They agree to split it with <fact2>Mia getting 150 feet more than Quinn</fact2>, and <fact3>Kayla getting 150 feet more than Mia</fact3>. How much is left over for Quinn?

Answer: Let's denote the amount of fence Quinn gets as Q. Since <fact2>Mia gets 150 feet more than Quinn</fact2>, Mia gets Q + 150 feet. Since <fact3>Kayla gets 150 feet more than Mia</fact3>, Kayla gets (Q + 150) + 150 = Q + 300 feet. The total amount of fence is <fact1>480 feet</fact1>, so Q + (Q + 150) + (Q + 300) = 480. This simplifies to 3Q + 450 = 480. Subtracting 450 from both sides gives 3Q = 30. Dividing both sides by 3 gives Q = 10. Therefore, Quinn gets 10 feet of fence.

Answer: Let's denote the amount of fence Sophia gets as x. Then, Beatriz gets x + <fact2>140 meters</fact2>, and Roya gets (x + <fact2>140 meters</fact2>) + <fact3>150 meters</fact3> = x + 290 meters. The total amount of fence is <fact1>820 meters</fact1>, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + <fact2>140 meters</fact2>) + (x + 290 meters) = <fact1>820 meters</fact1>. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 430 meters = <fact1>820 meters</fact1>. Subtracting 430 meters from both sides, we get 3x = 390 meters. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 130 meters.

The second biggest waterslide is 210 meters long, but steeper, so people slide down at 70 meters/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?","Reformatted Question: The biggest waterslide at Neptunes Kingdom is <fact1>250 meters long</fact1>, and people slide down at <fact2>50 meters/minute</fact2>. The second biggest waterslide is <fact3>210 meters long</fact3>, but steeper, so people slide down at <fact4>70 meters/minute</fact4>. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?

Answer: To find the time it takes to ride each slide, we need to divide the length of the slide by the speed. For the biggest slide, the time is <fact1>250 meters</fact1> / <fact2>50 meters/minute</fact2> = 5 minutes. For the second biggest slide, the time is <fact3>210 meters</fact3> / <fact4>70 meters/minute</fact4> = 3 minutes.

Answer: Since Nadia can skip at <fact3>4 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>2/5 as fast as running</fact2>, then Nadia can run at 4 / (2/5) = 4 * (5/2) = 10 miles per hour. 
Since Nadia can run <fact1>two times faster than she can walk</fact1>, then Nadia can walk at 10 / 2 = 5 miles per hour. 
In <fact4>10 hours</fact4>, Nadia will spend <fact5>1/10 of the time running</fact5>, which is 10 * (1/10) = 1 hour. She will spend <fact6>2/5 of the time skipping</fact6>, which is 10 * (2/5) = 4 hours. The remaining time will be spent walking, which is 10 - 1 - 4 = 5 hours.

Answer: Since Mei can skip at <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3> and skipping is <fact2>1/2 as fast as running</fact2>, Mei can run at 2 * 2 = 4 miles per hour. 
Since Mei can run <fact1>four times faster than she can walk</fact1>, Mei can walk at 4 / 4 = 1 mile per hour. 
Mei spends <fact5>2/5 of the time running</fact5>, which is 2/5 * <fact4>10 hours</fact4> = 4 hours. 
In 4 hours, Mei can run 4 * 4 = 16 miles. 
Mei spends <fact6>1/2 of the time skipping</fact6>, which is 1/2 * <fact4>10 hours</fact4> = 5 hours. 
In 5 hours, Mei can skip 5 * <fact3>2 miles per hour</fact3> = 10 miles.

Answer: Since Chen can skip at <fact2>2 miles per hour</fact2> and she can skip at a rate of speed that is <fact1>2/5 as fast as she can run</fact1>, she can run at 2 / (2/5) = 5 miles per hour. Since she can run two times faster than she can walk, she can walk at 5 / 2 = 2.5 miles per hour. She spends <fact4>2/5 of the time running</fact4>, which is (2/5) * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 4 hours. She also spends <fact5>2/5 of the time skipping</fact5>, which is (2/5) * <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 4 hours. The remaining time is <fact3>10 hours</fact3> - 4 hours - 4 hours = 2 hours, which she spends walking. So, she travels 5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 20 miles running, <fact2>2 miles per hour</fact2> * 4 hours = 8 miles skipping, and 2.5 miles per hour * 2 hours = 5 miles walking. In total, she travels 20 + 8 + 5 = 33 miles.

There is a fixed insurance cost of <fact3>₣20</fact3> as well. The <fact4>first paid hour is ₣21</fact4> and <fact5>each hour after that is thrice the cost</fact5>. How much did he pay?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of hours Noah hired the car. He hired it from <fact1>2 PM to 11 PM</fact1>, which is 9 hours. Since he gets <fact2>2 hours free</fact2>, he only needs to pay for 9 - 2 = 7 hours. The <fact4>first paid hour is ₣21</fact4>. For the remaining 6 hours, the cost is <fact5>thrice the cost</fact5> of the first paid hour, which is ₣21 * 3 = ₣63 per hour. So, the total cost for the remaining 6 hours is ₣63 * 6 = ₣378. Adding the cost of the first paid hour, the total cost is ₣378 + ₣21 = ₣399. Finally, we need to add the fixed insurance cost of <fact3>₣20</fact3>, making the total amount Noah paid ₣399 + ₣20 = ₣419.

But <fact4>Xavier, having forgot his hammer at home, slew one-tenth as many trolls as Alejandro using a feather</fact4>. How many trolls each person have slew on average?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many trolls each person slew. We know that <fact1>Arjun slew 200 trolls</fact1>. Since <fact2>Leon slew 1/5 as many trolls as Arjun</fact2>, Leon slew 200/<fact2>5</fact2> = 40 trolls. Since <fact3>Alejandro slew nine times as many trolls as Leon</fact3>, Alejandro slew 40 * <fact3>9</fact3> = 360 trolls. Since <fact4>Xavier slew one-tenth as many trolls as Alejandro</fact4>, Xavier slew 360/<fact4>10</fact4> = 36 trolls.

Now, we can find the average number of trolls each person slew. To do this, we add up the total number of trolls slew by each person and divide by the number of people. The total number of trolls slew is 200 + 40 + 360 + 36 = 636. There are 4 people. So, the average number of trolls each person slew is 636/4 = 159.

Answer: To find the average number of trolls each person slew, we need to find the total number of trolls they slew and divide it by the number of people. 
<fact1>Ravi slew 300 trolls</fact1>. 
<fact2>Theo slew two-thirds as many trolls as Ravi</fact2>, so Theo slew 2/3 * 300 = 200 trolls. 
<fact3>Oliver slew eight times as many trolls as Theo</fact3>, so Oliver slew 8 * 200 = 1600 trolls. 
<fact4>Faisal slew 3/4 as many trolls as Oliver</fact4>, so Faisal slew 3/4 * 1600 = 1200 trolls. 
The total number of trolls they slew is 300 + 200 + 1600 + 1200 = 3300. 
There are 4 people, so the average number of trolls each person slew is 3300 / 4 = 825.
The answer is {825}."
279,"When the water is cold, Sophia swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, Sophia swims a mile in 2 minutes more than two times as long. How much longer does Sophia take to swim 9 miles on a warm day than 7 miles on a cold day?","Reformatted Question: When the water is cold, <fact1>Sophia swims a mile in 16 minutes</fact1>. When the water is warm, <fact2>Sophia swims a mile in 2 minutes more than two times as long</fact2>. How much longer does Sophia take to swim <fact3>9 miles on a warm day</fact3> than <fact4>7 miles on a cold day</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how long it takes Sophia to swim a mile on a warm day. Two times as long as it takes her to swim a mile on a cold day is 2 * <fact1>16 minutes</fact1> = 32 minutes. Two minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes. So, it takes Sophia 34 minutes to swim a mile on a warm day. 

It takes Sophia <fact1>16 minutes</fact1> to swim a mile on a cold day, so it will take her <fact4>7 miles</fact4> * <fact1>16 minutes</fact1> = 112 minutes to swim <fact4>7 miles on a cold day</fact4>. 

It takes Sophia 34 minutes to swim a mile on a warm day, so it will take her <fact3>9 miles</fact3> * 34 minutes = 306 minutes to swim <fact3>9 miles on a warm day</fact3>. 

The difference between these two times is 306 minutes - 112 minutes = 194 minutes.

When the water is warm, <fact2>Luca swims a kilometer in 1 minutes more than four times as long</fact2>. How much longer does Luca take to swim <fact3>3 kilometers on a warm day</fact3> than <fact4>9 kilometers on a cold day</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how long it takes Luca to swim a kilometer on a warm day. Since it takes him <fact1>10 minutes</fact1> on a cold day, on a warm day it will take him <fact1>10</fact1> * 4 + 1 = 41 minutes to swim a kilometer. 

To swim <fact3>3 kilometers on a warm day</fact3>, it will take Luca 3 * 41 = 123 minutes. 

To swim <fact4>9 kilometers on a cold day</fact4>, it will take Luca <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact1>10</fact1> = 90 minutes. 

The difference between the two times is 123 - 90 = 33 minutes.

How much longer does Olivia take to swim <fact3>12 miles on a warm day</fact3> than <fact4>8 miles on a cold day</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to find out how long it takes Olivia to swim a mile on a warm day. Since it takes her <fact1>16 minutes</fact1> on a cold day, on a warm day it will take her 3 * <fact1>16 minutes</fact1> + <fact2>8 minutes</fact2> = 48 + 8 = 56 minutes to swim a mile. 

To find the time it takes her to swim <fact3>12 miles on a warm day</fact3>, we multiply the time it takes to swim one mile on a warm day by <fact3>12 miles</fact3>, which is 56 * <fact3>12</fact3> = 672 minutes.

To find the time it takes her to swim <fact4>8 miles on a cold day</fact4>, we multiply the time it takes to swim one mile on a cold day by <fact4>8 miles</fact4>, which is <fact1>16 minutes</fact1> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 128 minutes.

The difference between the two times is 672 - 128 = 544 minutes.

Of those who accept the position, <fact5>four-sixths of the people will relocate</fact5>. How many people relocate?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many people receive interviews. Since <fact2>50% of the applicants receive interviews</fact2>, we can calculate this as <fact1>320</fact1> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 160 people.

Next, we need to find out how many people receive a job offer. Since <fact3>30% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer</fact3>, we can calculate this as 160 * <fact3>0.3</fact3> = 48 people.

If each student only participates in one sport, how many students are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students playing football. Since there are <fact2>two times the number of students playing table tennis</fact2>, the number of students playing football is <fact1>8</fact1> * 2 = 16.
Next, we need to find the total number of students playing table tennis, football, and basketball. This is <fact1>8</fact1> + 16 + <fact3>20 + 24</fact3> = 68.
Now, we can find the number of students playing golf. Since the number of students playing golf is <fact4>nine times the combined number of students who play other sports</fact4>, the number of students playing golf is 68 * 9 = 612.

If each student only participates in one sport, how many students are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of students playing table tennis. Since there are <fact2>three times</fact2> as many students playing table tennis as badminton, and there are <fact1>9 students playing badminton</fact1>, there are <fact2>three times</fact2> * <fact1>9</fact1> = 27 students playing table tennis.

Next, we need to find the total number of students playing badminton, table tennis, and basketball. We already know that there are <fact1>9 students playing badminton</fact1> and 27 students playing table tennis. Additionally, there are <fact3>27 boys and 14 girls playing basketball</fact3>, for a total of <fact3>27</fact3> + <fact3>14</fact3> = 41 students playing basketball. So, the total number of students playing these three sports is <fact1>9</fact1> + 27 + <fact3>41</fact3> = 77.

If each student only participates in one sport, how many students are there in total?

Answer: There are <fact1>12 students playing basketball</fact1>. Since there are <fact2>twice that number playing volleyball</fact2>, there are 2 * <fact1>12</fact1> = 24 students playing volleyball. The total number of students playing badminton is <fact3>26 boys + 30 girls</fact3> = 56 students. The combined number of students playing basketball, volleyball, and badminton is <fact1>12</fact1> + 24 + <fact3>56</fact3> = 92 students.

She wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play one round of laser tag, have $6 in pinball tokens, and get to ride the roller coaster seven times. A round of laser tag is $3. The roller coaster costs $13 per ride. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Olga needs to rent a bus for the day, which costs $60. How many friends can she invite?","Reformatted Question: Olga's uncle said that she had <fact1>$260 budgeted for her birthday party</fact1>. She wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>$6 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster seven times</fact4>. <fact5>A round of laser tag is $3</fact5>. <fact6>The roller coaster costs $13 per ride</fact6>. For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Olga needs to <fact7>rent a bus for the day, which costs $60</fact7>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: Let's denote the number of friends Olga can invite as x. Since Olga also participates in the activities, the total number of people is x + 1. The total cost of laser tag is (x + 1) * <fact5>$3</fact5> = $3(x + 1). The total cost of pinball tokens is (x + 1) * <fact3>$6</fact3> = $6(x + 1). The total cost of the roller coaster is (x + 1) * <fact6>$13</fact6> * 7 = $91(x + 1). Adding the cost of the bus, <fact7>$60</fact7>, the total cost is $3(x + 1) + $6(x + 1) + $91(x + 1) + $60. This total cost should not exceed <fact1>$260</fact1>. Setting up the equation: $3(x + 1) + $6(x + 1) + $91(x + 1) + $60 = <fact1>$260</fact1>. Solving for x, we get $100(x + 1) + $60 = $260. $100(x + 1) = $200. x + 1 = 2. x = 1.

However, the problem states that Olga wants to make sure she and her friends each get to play <fact2>one round of laser tag</fact2>, have <fact3>$6 in pinball tokens</fact3>, and get to ride <fact4>the roller coaster seven times</fact4>. This means that the cost for Olga's activities is $3 + $6 + $91 = $100. The remaining budget for her friends is <fact1>$260</fact1> - $100 - <fact7>$60</fact7> = $100. The cost for each friend is $3 + $6 + $91 = $100. Therefore, Olga can invite 1 friend, but since the cost for the friend's activities equals the remaining budget, this would leave no money for anything else. In reality, Olga can invite 0 friends.

However, if we consider the fact that the question asks for the number of friends Olga can invite and the calculations provide the result of 1 friend but no money left, the final answer should be considered as 0 friends because you cannot invite a friend and not pay for their activities.

For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Amelia needs to <fact7>rent a bus for the day, which costs ₣70</fact7>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total cost per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> at <fact5>₣7</fact5>, receive <fact3>₣7 in arcade tokens</fact3>, and ride <fact4>the go-karts two times</fact4> at <fact6>₣13 per ride</fact6>, for a total of 2 x <fact6>₣13</fact6> = ₣26. The total cost per person is <fact5>₣7</fact5> + <fact3>₣7</fact3> + ₣26 = ₣40.

The total budget for the party is <fact1>₣270</fact1>, and <fact7>renting a bus for the day costs ₣70</fact7>, so the remaining budget for the guests is <fact1>₣270</fact1> - <fact7>₣70</fact7> = ₣200.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find the total number of people that can be invited, including Amelia. ₣200 / ₣40 = 5. Since Amelia is one of the guests, the number of friends she can invite is 5 - 1 = 4.

For the transportation of the birthday party guests, Tara needs to <fact7>rent a bus for the day, which costs ¥90</fact7>. How many friends can she invite?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost per person. Each person will play <fact2>one round of mini-golf</fact2> at <fact5>¥8</fact5> per round, ride <fact4>the go-karts four times</fact4> at <fact6>¥6</fact6> per ride, and receive <fact3>¥3 in arcade tokens</fact3>. The total cost per person is <fact5>¥8</fact5> + (<fact6>¥6</fact6> * 4) + <fact3>¥3</fact3> = ¥8 + ¥24 + ¥3 = ¥35.

The total budget for the party is <fact1>¥230</fact1>, but <fact7>¥90</fact7> is allocated for the bus rental, leaving ¥230 - ¥90 = ¥140 for the activities.

Now, we can divide the remaining budget by the cost per person to find out how many people can be invited, including Tara. ¥140 / ¥35 = 4.

However, this is the total number of people, including Tara. To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of people. 4 - 1 = 3.

So, the total number of infected people after the first day will be <fact1>24 people</fact1> + 96 people = 120 people.
On the second day, the number of newly infected people will be 120 people * <fact2>4 others</fact2> = 480 people.
Thus, the total number of infected people after <fact3>2 days</fact3> will be 120 people + 480 people = 600 people.
The answer is {600}."

297,"If Gabrielle eats 9 brownies a day for 20 days and then increases it to 12 brownies a day for the rest of the days, how many dozens of brownies will Gabrielle need for 12 weeks?","Reformatted Question: If <fact1>Gabrielle eats 9 brownies a day</fact1> for <fact2>20 days</fact2> and then increases it to <fact3>12 brownies a day</fact3> for the rest of the days, how many dozens of brownies will Gabrielle need for <fact4>12 weeks</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of days in <fact4>12 weeks</fact4>. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is <fact4>12 weeks</fact4> * 7 days/week = 84 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of brownies Gabrielle eats in the first <fact2>20 days</fact2>. This is <fact1>9 brownies/day</fact1> * <fact2>20 days</fact2> = 180 brownies.

Then, we calculate the total number of brownies Gabrielle eats in the remaining days. The number of remaining days is 84 days - <fact2>20 days</fact2> = 64 days. The total number of brownies eaten in these days is <fact3>12 brownies/day</fact3> * 64 days = 768 brownies.

The total number of brownies Gabrielle eats in <fact4>12 weeks</fact4> is 180 brownies + 768 brownies = 948 brownies.

To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 brownies in a dozen). So, 948 brownies / 12 = 79 dozens.

The answer is {79}."
298,"If Benjamin eats 2 waffles a day for 56 days and then increases it to 11 waffles a day for the rest of the days, how many dozens of waffles will Benjamin need for 12 weeks?","Reformatted Question: If <fact1>Benjamin eats 2 waffles a day for 56 days</fact1> and then increases it to <fact2>11 waffles a day for the rest of the days</fact2>, how many dozens of waffles will Benjamin need for <fact3>12 weeks</fact3>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of days in <fact3>12 weeks</fact3>. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is <fact3>12 weeks</fact3> * 7 days/week = 84 days.

Next, we calculate the total number of waffles Benjamin eats in the first <fact1>56 days</fact1>. This is <fact1>2 waffles/day * 56 days</fact1> = 112 waffles.

Then, we calculate the total number of waffles Benjamin eats in the remaining days. The number of remaining days is 84 days - <fact1>56 days</fact1> = 28 days. The total number of waffles eaten in these days is <fact2>11 waffles/day * 28 days</fact2> = 308 waffles.

The total number of waffles Benjamin needs is 112 waffles + 308 waffles = 420 waffles.

To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12: 420 waffles / 12 waffles/dozen = 35 dozen waffles.

The answer is {35}."
299,"If Luca eats 2 brownies a day for 26 days and then increases it to 7 brownies a day for the rest of the days, how many dozens of brownies will Luca need for 10 weeks?","Reformatted Question: If Luca eats <fact1>2 brownies a day</fact1> for <fact2>26 days</fact2> and then increases it to <fact3>7 brownies a day</fact3> for the rest of the days, how many dozens of brownies will Luca need for <fact4>10 weeks</fact4>?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of days in <fact4>10 weeks</fact4>. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is <fact4>10 weeks</fact4> * 7 days/week = 70 days.

Luca eats <fact1>2 brownies a day</fact1> for <fact2>26 days</fact2>, so the total number of brownies eaten during this period is <fact1>2 brownies a day</fact1> * <fact2>26 days</fact2> = 52 brownies.

For the remaining days, Luca eats <fact3>7 brownies a day</fact3>. The number of remaining days is 70 days - <fact2>26 days</fact2> = 44 days. So, the total number of brownies eaten during this period is <fact3>7 brownies a day</fact3> * 44 days = 308 brownies.

The total number of brownies Luca needs is 52 brownies + 308 brownies = 360 brownies. To convert this to dozens, we divide by 12: 360 brownies / 12 = 30 dozen brownies.

The answer is {30}."
