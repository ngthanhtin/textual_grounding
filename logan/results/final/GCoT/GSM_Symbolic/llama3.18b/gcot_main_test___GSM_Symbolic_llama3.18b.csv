0,Rania saw a 210-foot whale with 7 72-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the whale's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Rania saw a 210-foot whale</fact1> with <fact2>7 72-inch remoras attached to it</fact2>. What <fact3>percentage of the whale's body length</fact3> is the <fact4>combined length of the remoras</fact4>?
Answer: First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. There are <fact2>7</fact2> remoras, each <fact2>72</fact2> inches long. To find the total length, we multiply the number of remoras by the length of each remora: <fact2>7</fact2> * <fact2>72</fact2> = <fact2>504</fact2> inches. Since we want the percentage of the whale's body length, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length of the remoras by 12: <fact2>504</fact2> / <fact5>12</fact5> = <fact2>42</fact2> feet. Now, we can find the percentage of the whale's body length that the remoras make up by dividing the length of the remoras by the length of the whale and multiplying by 100: (<fact2>42</fact2> / <fact1>210</fact1>) * <fact6>100</fact6> = <fact2>20</fact2>%."

The remoras are <fact2>6 inches</fact2> long each, so the combined length of the remoras is <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact2>6</fact2> = 36 inches.

We need to convert the dolphin's body length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the dolphin's body length is <fact1>60 feet</fact1> * <fact5>12 inches per foot</fact5> = 720 inches.

The combined length of the remoras is <fact6>36 inches</fact6>, and the dolphin's body length is <fact7>720 inches</fact7>. To find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the dolphin's body length and multiply by 100: 

(<fact6>36 inches</fact6> / <fact7>720 inches</fact7>) * 100 = 5%

The answer is {5}."
47,Fatima saw a 70-foot dolphin with 4 21-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the dolphin's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"Reformatted Question: Fatima saw a <fact1>70-foot dolphin</fact1> with <fact2>4 21-inch remoras</fact2> attached to it. What <fact3>percentage of the dolphin's body length</fact3> is the <fact4>combined length of the remoras</fact4>?
Answer: To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by the length of each remora. So, the combined length of the remoras is <fact2>4</fact2> * <fact2>21</fact2> = 84 inches. 
Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the dolphin to inches by multiplying it by 12. So, the length of the dolphin is <fact1>70</fact1> * <fact1>12</fact1> = 840 inches.
Now, we can find the percentage of the dolphin's body length that is the combined length of the remoras by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the length of the dolphin and multiplying by 100. So, the percentage is (84/<fact1>840</fact1>) * <fact3>100</fact3> = 10%.

Answer: The <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> is <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact2>6</fact2> = 12 inches.
To find the <fact3>percentage of the dolphin's body length</fact3> that this is, we need to convert the <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> from inches to feet. There are <fact5>12 inches</fact5> per <fact6>foot</fact6>, so the <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> is 12/<fact5>12</fact5> = 1 foot.
The <fact1>dolphin's body length</fact1> is <fact1>50 feet</fact1>, so the <fact3>percentage of the dolphin's body length</fact3> that the <fact2>combined length of the remoras</fact2> is is 1/<fact1>50</fact1> = 0.02, or 2%.

49,Sanjay saw a 490-foot shark with 7 84-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Sanjay saw a 490-foot shark</fact1> with <fact2>7 84-inch remoras attached to it</fact2>. What <fact3>percentage of the shark's body length</fact3> is the <fact4>combined length of the remoras</fact4>?
Answer: To find the combined length of the remoras, we need to multiply the number of remoras by their individual length. The length of each remora is <fact2>84 inches</fact2>, and there are <fact2>7</fact2> remoras. Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is <fact2>84</fact2> * <fact2>7</fact2> = 588 inches.

Since the length of the shark is given in feet, we need to convert the combined length of the remoras from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the combined length of the remoras is 588 / 12 = 49 feet.

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we need to divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100. The length of the shark is <fact1>490 feet</fact1>, and the combined length of the remoras is 49 feet. Therefore, the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents is (49 / 490) * 100 = 10%.

This can be done by dividing the total distance across the city, <fact2>57 miles</fact2>, by the distance that the fog bank covers in <fact1>152 minutes</fact1>, which is <fact3>19 miles</fact3>. This is <fact2>57 miles</fact2> / <fact3>19 miles</fact3> = 3 sections. Since it takes <fact1>152 minutes</fact1> to cover one 19-mile section, it will take <fact1>152 minutes</fact1> * <fact4>3 sections</fact4> = 456 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

If the city is 63 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?","Reformatted Question: A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes <fact1>30 minutes to cover every 21 miles of the city</fact1>. If the city is <fact2>63 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge</fact2>, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the whole city?
Answer: The fog bank covers the city at a rate of <fact1>21 miles</fact1> per <fact1>30 minutes</fact1>. To find the rate at which the fog bank covers the city in miles per minute, we need to divide the rate of 21 miles by the time of 30 minutes. This gives us a rate of 21/<fact1>30</fact1> = 0.7 miles per minute.
Now, we need to find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, which is <fact2>63 miles</fact2> across. To do this, we can divide the distance of 63 miles by the rate of 0.7 miles per minute. This gives us a time of 63/<fact1>0.7</fact1> = 90 minutes.

100,Luis is rolling a 4-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Luis is rolling a <fact1>4-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling a 4-sided die. The possible outcomes are <fact1>1</fact1>, <fact2>2</fact2>, <fact3>3</fact3>, and <fact4>4</fact4>. Out of these outcomes, only <fact2>3</fact2> and <fact4>4</fact4> are greater than 2. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling two 4-sided dice. The possible outcomes are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4). Out of these outcomes, only (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3) are two odd numbers in a row. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2. This is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: There are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a <fact1>twelve-sided die</fact1>. The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a <fact2>4</fact2>, <fact2>5</fact2>, <fact2>6</fact2>, <fact2>7</fact2>, <fact2>8</fact2>, <fact2>9</fact2>, <fact2>10</fact2>, <fact2>11</fact2>, or <fact2>12</fact2>) divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact2>9</fact2> favorable outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> is <fact2>9</fact2>/<fact1>12</fact1> = <fact2>0.75</fact2>. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the first roll and an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the second roll) divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact3>6</fact3> <fact3>odd numbers</fact3> on a <fact1>twelve-sided die</fact1>, so the number of favorable outcomes is <fact3>6</fact3>*<fact3>6</fact3> = <fact3>36</fact3>. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is <fact3>36</fact3>/<fact1>12</fact1>*<fact1>12</fact1> = <fact3>0.3</fact3>.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Hiroshi is rolling a d10 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability that Hiroshi rolls a number greater than 2, we need to find the probability that he rolls a 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Since there are 10 possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, and 8 of these outcomes are greater than 2, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>8/10</fact1> = 0.8.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are 5 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) out of the 10 possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, so the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact2>5/10</fact2> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also <fact2>5/10</fact2> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact2>0.5</fact2> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 0.25.
To find the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling two odd numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55.
To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.55 * 100 = 55%.
Therefore, it is 55% more likely that Hiroshi rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Ibrahim is rolling a <fact1>d4 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the probability of rolling a 3 or a 4. There are 4 possible outcomes when rolling a d4, and 2 of them are 3 or 4. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 0.5 or 50% (see <fact1>d4 die</fact1>).
To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll and an odd number on the second roll. There are 4 possible outcomes when rolling a d4, and 2 of them are odd (1 and 3). So the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 2/4 = 0.5. Then, the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 2/4 = 0.5. So the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25% (see <fact1>d4 die</fact1>).
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we need to multiply by 100. So the difference in probability is 25% * 100/100 = 25%.
The answer is {25}."
104,Oscar is rolling a d10 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Oscar is rolling a d10 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we need to find the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 5 and subtract it from 1. There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, and 5 of them are less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 5 is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is then 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll and an odd number on the second roll. There are <fact1>5</fact1> odd numbers out of <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die, so the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also <fact1>5/10</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5: 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%. Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Oscar rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row."
105,Luis is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Luis is rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: Since the die is <fact1>20-sided</fact1>, each number from 1 to 20 is equally likely to be rolled. This means that the probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> is the same as the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 2. Since there are 18 numbers greater than 2 and 2 numbers less than or equal to 2, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact4>18/20 = 9/10</fact4>. The probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 2 is <fact5>2/20 = 1/10</fact5>. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is the same as the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row on the first two rolls. There are 10 odd numbers on the die, so the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact6>10/20 = 1/2</fact6>. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll, given that an odd number was rolled on the first roll, is also <fact7>10/20 = 1/2</fact7>. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact8>(1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4</fact8>. The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact9>9/10 - 1/4 = 7/20</fact9>. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: <fact10>(7/20) * 100 = 35%</fact10>. Therefore, it is 35% more likely that Luis rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.
The answer is {35}."
106,Ibrahim is rolling a d4 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Ibrahim is rolling a d4 die</fact1>. <fact2>How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row</fact2>?
Answer: There are <fact1>4 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a d4 die: 1, 2, 3, and 4. A number greater than 1 is 2, 3, or 4, so there are <fact2>3 possible outcomes</fact2> for rolling a number greater than 1. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is <fact2>3/4</fact2> or 75%.
On the other hand, there are <fact3>2 possible outcomes</fact3> for rolling two odd numbers in a row: 1, 3 and 3, 1. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact3>2/16</fact3> or 12.5%.
The difference in probability is <fact2>75%</fact2> - <fact3>12.5%</fact3> = 62.5%.
The answer is {62.5}."
107,Gabriel is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Gabriel is rolling a twenty-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>1</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: There are <fact2>1</fact2> number less than or equal to 1 and <fact4>19</fact4> numbers greater than 1 on a 20-sided die. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is <fact4>19</fact4>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.95. 
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are <fact3>10</fact3> odd numbers on a 20-sided die. So the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact3>10</fact3>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also <fact3>10</fact3>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. So the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
The difference in probability is 0.95 - 0.25 = 0.7. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100 to get 70%.
The answer is {70}."
108,James is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>James is rolling a d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d20 die. A number greater than 2 can be rolled in <fact2>18</fact2> of those outcomes, because the numbers 1 and 2 are less than 2. The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is therefore <fact2>18/20</fact2> = 0.9 or 90%. 

To roll two even numbers in a row, James must roll an even number on the first roll and then an even number on the second roll. There are <fact3>10</fact3> even numbers on a d20 die, so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 0.5. If the first roll is even, there are <fact4>9</fact4> even numbers left on the die, so the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is <fact4>9/20</fact4>. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact3>10/20</fact3> * <fact4>9/20</fact4> = 0.045 or 4.5%.

The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 90% - 4.5% = 85.5%. Therefore, James is 85.5% more likely to roll a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."
109,Noah is rolling a d6 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Noah is rolling a d6 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: A standard die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. Since there are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) and a total of 6 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number twice. Since there are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and a total of 6 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number twice is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
To find the difference in probability, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.
To convert the difference in probability to a percentage, multiply by 100. 0.25 * 100 = 25%.
Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Noah rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Wei is rolling a <fact1>6-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6. There are <fact1>6</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 6-sided die, and 3 of them are greater than 3. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%.
To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number twice in a row. There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) on a 6-sided die. So the probability of rolling an even number is 3/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (3/<fact1>6</fact1>)*(3/<fact1>6</fact1>) = 0.25 or 25%.
To find the difference in probability, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. So the difference is 50% - 25% = 25%.
Therefore, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Mateo is rolling a <fact1>6-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>even numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6, which is <fact1>3</fact1>/<fact2>6</fact2> = 0.5 or 50%.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling two 2s, two 4s, or two 6s, which is 3/(6*6) = 1/12 or approximately 0.083 or 8.3%.
Therefore, the difference in probability is 50% - 8.3% = 41.7%.
The answer is {41.7}."
112,Luca is rolling a twelve-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 6 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Luca is rolling a <fact1>twelve-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>6</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>even numbers</fact3> in a row?
Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 6 on a 12-sided die is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 6 numbers greater than 6 (<fact4>7</fact4>, <fact4>8</fact4>, <fact4>9</fact4>, <fact4>10</fact4>, <fact4>11</fact4>, and <fact4>12</fact4>), the probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is <fact5>6/12</fact5> = 1/2 or 50%.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is also the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 6 even numbers (<fact6>2</fact6>, <fact6>4</fact6>, <fact6>6</fact6>, <fact6>8</fact6>, <fact6>10</fact6>, and <fact6>12</fact6>), the probability of rolling an even number is <fact7>6/12</fact7> = 1/2 or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number, which is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 6: 50% - 25% = 25%.

The answer is {25}."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>even numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a <fact2>ten-sided die</fact2>. The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact3>2</fact3> is the number of outcomes greater than <fact3>2</fact3> divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 8/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.8. The probability of rolling two <fact4>even numbers in a row</fact4> is the number of outcomes that are even divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. The difference in probability is 0.8 - 0.5 = 0.3. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 30%. Therefore, it is 30% more likely that Diego rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."
114,Liam is rolling a ten-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Liam is <fact1>rolling a ten-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he <fact2>rolls a number greater than 1</fact2> than that he <fact3>rolls two even numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 10-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is the number of outcomes where the number is greater than 1 divided by the total number of outcomes. Since there are 9 numbers greater than 1 on a 10-sided die, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 9/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.9.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. Since there are 5 even numbers on a 10-sided die, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 1 and rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.9 - 0.25 = 0.65. To express this as a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.65 * 100 = 65%.
Therefore, it is 65% more likely that Liam rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
The answer is {65}."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Umar is rolling a six-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>6</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of outcomes where this occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact1>3</fact1> outcomes where the number rolled is greater than 3, namely 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is <fact1>3/6</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the number of outcomes where this occurs divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact2>3</fact2> even numbers on a six-sided die, namely 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number is <fact2>3/6</fact2> = <fact2>1/2</fact2> = 0.5 or 50%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number twice, which is <fact2>0.5</fact2> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 0.25 or 25%. The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%."
116,Santiago is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Santiago is rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>10</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: First, let's consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 10. Since the die is fair, each number from 1 to 20 is equally likely to be rolled. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is the number of favorable outcomes (11 to 20) divided by the total number of outcomes (1 to 20). This is <fact4>10/20</fact4> = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, let's consider the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is <fact5>10/20</fact5> = 0.5. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each roll, which is <fact6>0.5*0.5</fact6> = 0.25 or 25%.

Now, let's calculate the difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 10 and rolling two odd numbers in a row. This is <fact7>0.5 - 0.25</fact7> = 0.25 or 25%. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us <fact8>25%</fact8>. Therefore, Santiago is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 10 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

The answer is {25}."
117,Gabriel is rolling a d8 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Gabriel is rolling a d8 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it <fact2>(expressed as a percentage)</fact2> that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. The favorable outcomes are rolling a 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, which is <fact1>6</fact1> outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is <fact1>8</fact1> (the number of sides on the die). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>6/8</fact1> = <fact1>3/4</fact1>. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact2>75%</fact2>.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 1, 3, 5, or 7) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. There are <fact1>4</fact1> favorable outcomes and <fact1>8</fact1> total outcomes, so the probability of rolling an odd number is <fact1>4/8</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1>. Since the two rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of each roll, which is <fact1>1/2</fact1> * <fact1>1/2</fact1> = <fact1>1/4</fact1>. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, so the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact2>25%</fact2>.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 2 and rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact2>75%</fact2> - <fact2>25%</fact2> = <fact2>50%</fact2>."
118,Leon is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Leon is rolling a d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>1</fact2> than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1, we first need to know how many numbers on the die are greater than 1. On a d20, the numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. That's a total of 19 numbers. Since there are 20 possible outcomes when rolling a d20, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 19/20 = 0.95 or 95%.

Now, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a d20 are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18. That's a total of 9 even numbers. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 9/20. Since the die is rolled again, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 9/20. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (9/20) * (9/20) = 81/400 = 0.2025 or 20.25%.

Now, we need to find the difference between the two probabilities. The difference is 95% - 20.25% = 74.75%. To express this as a percentage, we need to convert it to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Therefore, the difference is 74.75% * 100 = 7475%.

The answer is {74.75}."
119,James is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>James is rolling a d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability that James rolls a number greater than 2, we need to find the probability that he rolls a number less than or equal to 2 and subtract it from 1. There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d20 die. The numbers less than or equal to 2 are 1 and 2, so there are <fact2>2</fact2> possible outcomes where James rolls a number less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the probability that James rolls a number greater than 2 is 1 - <fact2>2</fact2>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9.
To find the probability that James rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability that he rolls an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. There are <fact1>10</fact1> even numbers on a d20 die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) and <fact2>10</fact2> odd numbers. Therefore, the probability that James rolls an even number on the first roll is <fact1>10</fact1>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. The probability that he rolls an even number on the second roll is also <fact1>10</fact1>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability that James rolls two even numbers in a row is <fact1>0.5</fact1> * <fact1>0.5</fact1> = 0.25.
To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2. This is 0.9 - 0.25 = 0.65.
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.65 * 100 = 65%.
Therefore, James is 65% more likely to roll a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."
120,James is rolling a d20 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>James is rolling a d20 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>20 possible outcomes</fact1> when rolling a d20 die. To roll a number greater than 4, James must roll a number between 5 and 20, which means there are <fact1>20 - 5 + 1 = 16</fact1> possible outcomes. This makes the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 <fact1>16/20 = 4/5 = 0.8</fact1>. To roll two even numbers in a row, James must roll an even number on his first roll and then another even number on his second roll. There are <fact2>10 even numbers</fact2> between 1 and 20. This makes the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll <fact2>10/20 = 1/2</fact2>. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact2>1/2</fact2>. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact2>1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 = 0.25</fact2>. The difference in probability is <fact1>0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55</fact1>. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us <fact1>0.55 * 100 = 55%</fact1>. Therefore, it is 55% more likely that James rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

121,Arjun is rolling a 12-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Arjun is rolling a <fact1>12-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>3</fact2> than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, which is <fact3>1/12</fact3> + <fact3>1/12</fact3> + <fact3>1/12</fact3> + <fact3>1/12</fact3> = 4/12 = 1/3. Since the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the probability of rolling a number less than or equal to 3, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is also 1/3. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, which is <fact4>6/12</fact4>, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll, which is also <fact4>6/12</fact4>. So the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact4>6/12</fact4> * <fact4>6/12</fact4> = 36/144 = 1/4. Therefore, the difference in probability is 1/3 - 1/4 = 4/12 - 3/12 = 1/12. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100, which gives us (1/12) * 100 = 8.33%."
122,Deshawn is rolling a d12 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Deshawn is rolling a d12 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is <fact1>12</fact1>, since there are 12 faces on a d12 die. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of faces with a value greater than 3, which is <fact1>9</fact1>. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is <fact1>9/12</fact1> = <fact1>3/4</fact1> = 0.75.

To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is still <fact1>12</fact1> for the first roll, and <fact1>12</fact1> for the second roll. However, since we are rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is <fact1>12*12</fact1> = 144. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of faces with an odd value for both rolls, which is <fact1>6</fact1> for the first roll and <fact1>6</fact1> for the second roll. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact1>6/12</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1> = 0.5.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. This gives us 0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 25%.

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two odd numbers in a row.

The answer is {25}."
123,Alejandro is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Alejandro is rolling a <fact1>twenty-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>10</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>even numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a twenty-sided die, and <fact2>10</fact2> of them are greater than 10. Thus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is <fact2>10/20</fact2> = 1/2 = 50%.
There are <fact3>5</fact3> even numbers on a twenty-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20). Thus, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 1/2 = 50%.
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 1/2 = 50%.
Since the two rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the two probabilities, which is <fact3>10/20</fact3> * <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 1/4 = 25%.
The difference between the two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.
The answer is {25}."
124,Esteban is rolling a 4-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Esteban is rolling a 4-sided die</fact1>. <fact2>How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row</fact2>?
Answer: A 4-sided die has 4 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
A number greater than 2 can be either 3 or 4, which are 2 possible outcomes. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>2</fact1>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 0.5 or 50%.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling two 2's in a row, which is <fact3>1</fact3>/<fact2>4</fact2> * <fact3>1</fact3>/<fact2>4</fact2> = 1/16 or 6.25%.
The difference between the two probabilities is 50% - 6.25% = 43.75%.
Therefore, it is 43.75% more likely that Esteban rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
The answer is {43.75}."
125,Bodhi is rolling a twelve-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 6 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Bodhi is rolling a twelve-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 6 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 6, we need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes. Since the die has 12 sides, there are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes. The favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 6 are the numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, which is a total of <fact2>6</fact2> favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is <fact2>6</fact2>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2 or 50%.

To find the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we need to consider the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. Since there are 6 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) out of the 12 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact3>6</fact3>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2 or 50%. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also <fact3>6</fact3>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2 or 50%. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the product of the two probabilities, which is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 6: 50% - 25% = 25%."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Oscar is rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: Since the die is <fact1>20-sided</fact1>, there are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling the die.
There are <fact2>9</fact2> numbers greater than <fact2>2</fact2> on the die (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).  However, we are only considering the numbers greater than 2, which are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.  There are <fact4>18</fact4> numbers greater than <fact2>2</fact2> on the die.
The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>2</fact2> is <fact4>18</fact4>/<fact1>20</fact1> = <fact5>0.9</fact5>.
There are <fact3>5</fact3> odd numbers on the die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19).  However, we are only considering the numbers that are odd, which are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19.  There are <fact6>10</fact6> odd numbers on the die.
The probability of rolling an odd number is <fact6>10</fact6>/<fact1>20</fact1> = <fact7>0.5</fact7>.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact7>0.5</fact7> * <fact7>0.5</fact7> = <fact8>0.25</fact8>.

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 6 is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12). This is <fact2>6/12 = 1/2</fact2> or 50%.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling an odd number, then an odd number) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (rolling any two numbers). There are <fact3>6 odd numbers</fact3> (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) on the die, so the probability of rolling an odd number is <fact4>6/12 = 1/2</fact4>. Since the die is rolled twice, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact5>(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4</fact5> or 25%.
The difference in probability is <fact6>50% - 25% = 25%</fact6>."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability that Liam rolls a number greater than 4, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes. There are 16 numbers greater than 4 on a twenty-sided die (<fact1>1</fact1>, <fact1>2</fact1>, <fact1>3</fact1>, <fact1>4</fact1> are less than 4, and <fact1>5</fact1> to <fact1>20</fact1> are greater than 4). The total number of outcomes is 20. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is 16/20 = 0.8 or 80%.

To find the probability that Liam rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes. There are 10 even numbers on a twenty-sided die (<fact1>2</fact1>, <fact1>4</fact1>, <fact1>6</fact1>, <fact1>8</fact1>, <fact1>10</fact1>, <fact1>12</fact1>, <fact1>14</fact1>, <fact1>16</fact1>, <fact1>18</fact1>, <fact1>20</fact1>). The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 0.05 or 5%.

The difference in probability is 80% - 5% = 75%."
129,Yusuf is rolling a d10 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Yusuf is rolling a d10 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d10 die.
There are <fact2>6</fact2> numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 6/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.6 or 60%.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the same as the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, which is 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll, which is also 5/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.
Therefore, Yusuf is 60 - 25 = 35% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

130,Wei is rolling a 20-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Wei is rolling a <fact1>20-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>5</fact2> than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability that Wei rolls a number greater than 5, we need to find the probability that he rolls a number greater than or equal to 6, which is <fact1>1/20</fact1> of the total outcomes, since there are 20 possible outcomes when rolling a 20-sided die and 14 of them are greater than or equal to 6.
To find the probability that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability that he rolls an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll. There are <fact2>10</fact2> even numbers out of <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes for the first roll, and for the second roll, there are also <fact2>10</fact2> even numbers out of <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact1>10/20</fact1> * <fact2>10/20</fact2> = <fact3>1/8</fact3>.
To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5: <fact4>1/20</fact4> - <fact3>1/8</fact3> = <fact5>1/40</fact5>.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: <fact5>1/40</fact5> * 100 = 2.5%.
Therefore, Wei is 2.5% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
The answer is {2.5}."
131,Kai is rolling a d4 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Kai is rolling a d4 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to consider the possible outcomes of a d4 die roll. A d4 die has 4 faces, numbered 1 through 4. The probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (4). This probability is 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%.

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the possible outcomes of two consecutive d4 die rolls. The probability of rolling an even number on a single d4 die roll is 2/4 = 1/2. Since the two rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 50% - 25% = 25%. Therefore, Kai is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 2 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

Answer: A twenty-sided die has 20 faces, numbered from 1 to 20. <fact1>There are 10 numbers greater than 10</fact1> on the die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 10 is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
<fact2>There are 10 odd numbers</fact2> on the die, so the probability of rolling an odd number is 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5.
To roll two odd numbers in a row, Pavel must roll an odd number on his first roll and then roll an odd number on his second roll. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 10 and rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.
Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Pavel rolls a number greater than 10 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Ravi is rolling a ten-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: A ten-sided die has <fact1>10</fact1> sides. The numbers on a standard ten-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Of these numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are odd and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are even.
There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a ten-sided die.
There are <fact1>5</fact1> odd numbers on the die, and <fact1>5</fact1> even numbers.
Thus, the probability of rolling an odd number on a ten-sided die is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1> and the probability of rolling an even number is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1>.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number and then rolling another odd number. This probability is <fact1>1/2</fact1> * <fact1>1/2</fact1> = <fact1>1/4</fact1>.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the probability of rolling a number that is greater than 5, which is <fact1>5/10</fact1> = <fact1>1/2</fact1>.
To find the difference in probabilities, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 5. This difference is <fact1>1/2</fact1> - <fact1>1/4</fact1> = <fact1>1/4</fact1>.
To convert this to a percentage, we need to multiply by 100. This is <fact1>1/4</fact1> * 100 = 25.
Therefore, Ravi is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than he is to roll two odd numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>6</fact2> than that he rolls two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: There are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 12-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact2>6</fact2> is the number of outcomes greater than <fact2>6</fact2> divided by the total number of outcomes, which is <fact2>6</fact2>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2. The probability of rolling two <fact3>odd numbers in a row</fact3> is the probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the second roll. There are <fact4>6</fact4> odd numbers on a 12-sided die, so the probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the first roll is <fact4>6</fact4>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2. The probability of rolling an <fact3>odd number</fact3> on the second roll is also <fact4>6</fact4>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 1/2.

Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a <fact2>twenty-sided die</fact2>. The probability of rolling a number greater than <fact3>10</fact3> is the number of outcomes greater than <fact3>10</fact3> divided by the total number of outcomes, which is <fact4>(20-10)</fact4>/<fact1>20</fact1> = 10/20 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%. 
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. There are <fact5>10</fact5> even numbers and <fact6>20</fact6> total numbers on the die, so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact5>10</fact5>/<fact6>20</fact6> = 1/2 = 0.5. The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact5>10</fact5>/<fact6>20</fact6> = 1/2 = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To convert this to a percentage, we can multiply by 100, which gives us 25% * 100/100 = 25%.

Answer: A d20 die has 20 possible outcomes, and each outcome is equally likely. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the number of outcomes greater than 5 divided by the total number of outcomes, which is (20 - 5) / 20 = 15 / 20 = 0.75 or 75%. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number twice in a row, which is (10 / 20) * (10 / 20) = 0.1 or 10%. The difference in probability is 75% - 10% = 65%."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Ali is rolling a 10-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it <fact2>(expressed as a percentage)</fact2> that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls <fact3>two even numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10) divided by the total number of outcomes (10). Since there are 9 favorable outcomes, the probability is 9/10. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll (5 possibilities out of 10) multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll (5 possibilities out of 10), which is (5/10) * (5/10) = 25/100. The difference between the two probabilities is (9/10) - (25/100) = (90/100) - (25/100) = 65/100. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: (65/100) * 100 = 65%. Therefore, it is 65% more likely that Ali rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than <fact2>5</fact2> than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 20-sided die. 
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the number of outcomes greater than 5 divided by the total number of outcomes. There are 15 outcomes greater than 5 (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 15/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.75. 
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the number of outcomes that are even, divided by the total number of outcomes, multiplied by the number of outcomes that are even, divided by the total number of outcomes. There are 10 outcomes that are even (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20), so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/<fact1>20</fact1>)*(10/<fact1>20</fact1>) = 0.05. 
The difference in probability is 0.75 - 0.05 = 0.7. 
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.7 * 100 = 70%. 
The answer is {70}."
139,Benjamin is rolling a four-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Benjamin is rolling a four-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: A four-sided die has four possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since Benjamin is rolling the die, we need to consider the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 and the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row. 

Rolling a number greater than 2 can be done in two ways: rolling a 3 or a 4. There are two favorable outcomes (3 and 4) out of four possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>2/4</fact1> = 1/2 or 50%.

Rolling two odd numbers in a row can be done in two ways: rolling a 1 followed by a 3 or a 1 followed by a 1. However, since the die only has four sides, there is no possibility of rolling a 1 followed by a 1. Therefore, the only favorable outcome is rolling a 1 followed by a 3. There is one favorable outcome (1 followed by 3) out of four possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 25%.

To find the difference in probability, we need to subtract the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 50% - 25% = 25%."
140,Tariq is rolling a 10-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Tariq is rolling a 10-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: Since the die is 10-sided, there are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling the die.
A number is greater than 5 if it is either 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. There are <fact1>5</fact1> possible outcomes that meet this condition.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is therefore <fact1>5</fact1>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll.
There are <fact2>5</fact2> even numbers on a 10-sided die (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), so the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is <fact2>5</fact2>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5.
The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also <fact2>5</fact2>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.5.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is therefore <fact3>0.5</fact3> * <fact4>0.5</fact4> = 0.25.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 5 and rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact5>0.5</fact5> - <fact6>0.25</fact6> = 0.25.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: <fact7>0.25</fact7> * 100 = 25%.
Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Tariq rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
The answer is {25}."
141,Mohammed is rolling a twenty-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Mohammed is rolling a twenty-sided die. <fact1>How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage)</fact1> that he rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>20</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a twenty-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is the number of outcomes where the number is greater than 5 divided by the total number of outcomes. There are <fact1>20</fact1> - <fact2>5</fact2> = 15 outcomes where the number is greater than 5. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 15/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.75.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are <fact3>10</fact3> odd numbers on a twenty-sided die. So the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 10/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also 10/<fact1>20</fact1> = 0.5. So the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5*0.5 = 0.25.
The difference in probability is 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.5*100 = 50%.
The answer is {50}."
142,Santiago is rolling a d6 die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Santiago is rolling a d6 die</fact1>. How much more likely is it <fact2>(expressed as a percentage)</fact2> that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>6</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a d6 die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, and 6), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is <fact1>3</fact1>/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5 or 50%.
The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. There are 3 odd numbers (1, 3, and 5) out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is <fact1>3</fact1>/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5. The probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll is also <fact1>3</fact1>/<fact1>6</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two odd numbers in a row is 50% - 25% = 25%.

143,Theo is rolling a twelve-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Theo is rolling a twelve-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>12</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a twelve-sided die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is the number of outcomes greater than 3 divided by the total number of outcomes, which is <fact1>9</fact1>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 0.75. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is the probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll, multiplied by the probability of rolling an odd number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an odd number on a twelve-sided die is <fact1>6</fact1>/<fact1>12</fact1> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. The difference in probability is 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, giving us 50%. Therefore, it is 50% more likely that Theo rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

144,Noah is rolling a ten-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Noah is rolling a ten-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of outcomes. There are 8 numbers greater than 2 on a ten-sided die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>8/10</fact1> = 0.8. To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll and the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a ten-sided die is <fact2>5/10</fact2> = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact2>0.5</fact2> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 0.25. To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 0.8 - 0.25 = 0.55. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.55 * 100 = 55%. Therefore, it is 55% more likely that Noah rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it <fact2>(expressed as a percentage)</fact2> that he rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3>?
Answer: There are <fact1>20 sides on the die</fact1>, and any of them can be rolled. 
There are <fact3>10 odd numbers</fact3> on the die, and <fact3>10 even numbers</fact3>. 
The probability that the first number rolled is odd is <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 0.5. 
The probability that the second number rolled is odd is also <fact3>10/20</fact3> = 0.5. 
The probability that <fact3>two odd numbers in a row</fact3> are rolled is <fact3>0.5 * 0.5</fact3> = 0.25. 
The probability that the first number rolled is greater than 4 is <fact1>10/20</fact1> = 0.5, because there are 10 numbers greater than 4 on the die. 
The probability that the second number rolled is greater than 4 is <fact1>11/20</fact1>, because there are 11 numbers greater than 4 on the die. 
The probability that <fact2>a number greater than 4 is rolled</fact2> is <fact1>0.5 * 11/20</fact1> = 0.275. 
The difference in probabilities is <fact2>0.275 - 0.25</fact2> = 0.025.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row?
Answer: A d8 die has 8 sides, numbered 1 through 8. When rolling the die, Pavel has a <fact1>1/8</fact1> chance of rolling any specific number. To find the chance that he rolls a number greater than 4, we need to find the chance that he rolls a 5, 6, 7, or 8. There are 4 favorable outcomes, so the chance that he rolls a number greater than 4 is <fact2>4/8</fact2> = 1/2 or 50%. To find the chance that he rolls two odd numbers in a row, we need to find the chance that he rolls an odd number on the first roll and another odd number on the second roll. There are 4 odd numbers on the die, so the chance that he rolls an odd number on the first roll is <fact3>4/8</fact3> = 1/2. If he rolls an odd number on the first roll, there are 3 odd numbers remaining on the die, so the chance that he rolls an odd number on the second roll is <fact4>3/8</fact4>. Therefore, the chance that he rolls two odd numbers in a row is <fact5>1/2</fact5> * <fact6>3/8</fact6> = 3/16 or 18.75%. The difference in chance is 50% - 18.75% = 31.25%. Therefore, Pavel is 31.25% more likely to roll a number greater than 4 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: <fact1>Leon is rolling a 10-sided die</fact1>. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: There are <fact1>10</fact1> possible outcomes when rolling a 10-sided die. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the number of outcomes that satisfy this condition. The outcomes that satisfy this condition are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. There are <fact1>8</fact1> such outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is <fact1>8</fact1>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.8.
To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the number of outcomes that satisfy this condition. The outcomes that satisfy this condition are 2, 4, 6, and 8. There are <fact2>4</fact2> such outcomes. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is <fact2>4</fact2>/<fact1>10</fact1> = 0.4.
To find the difference in the probabilities, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2. This gives us 0.8 - 0.4 = 0.4.
To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100. This gives us 0.4 * 100 = 40%.
Therefore, it is 40% more likely that Leon rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 2 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 2, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes (rolling a 3 or a 4) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. There are <fact1>2 favorable outcomes</fact1> (rolling a 3 or a 4) out of <fact2>4 possible outcomes</fact2> (rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4), so the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 is 2/4 = 1/2 or 50%.

To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes (rolling an even number followed by another even number) and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. There are <fact3>2 favorable outcomes</fact3> (rolling a 2 followed by a 2 or a 4 followed by a 4) out of <fact4>4 possible outcomes</fact4> (rolling a 1, 2, 3, or 4) for the first roll and <fact5>2 possible outcomes</fact5> (rolling a 2 or a 4) for the second roll, so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (2/4)*(2/4) = 1/8 or 12.5%.

To find the difference in probability, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2: 50% - 12.5% = 37.5%.

149,Faisal is rolling a four-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?,"Reformatted Question: Faisal is rolling a four-sided die. <fact1>How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage)</fact1> that he rolls a number greater than 1 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 1, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling a four-sided die. There are 4 possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is the number of favorable outcomes (2, 3, and 4) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 is 3/4.
To calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling two four-sided dice. The possible outcomes for the first die are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The possible outcomes for the second die are also 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since the two dice are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is 4 * 4 = 16. The favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers in a row are 2, 2; 2, 4; 4, 2; and 4, 4. There are 4 favorable outcomes. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 4/16 = 1/4.
Now, we need to find the difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 1 and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The difference is (3/4) - (1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2.
To express this as a percentage, we need to multiply by 100. So, the difference is (1/2) * 100 = 50%.

How many like to <fact5>bake</fact5> if the number that like to <fact6>hike</fact6> is <fact7>twice the number that prefer playing football</fact7>?

Answer: The number of students that like to paint, play football, and hike is <fact2>19</fact2> + <fact3>7</fact3> + <fact6>x</fact6>, where <fact6>x</fact6> is the number of students that like to hike. Since the total number of students is <fact1>190</fact1>, we have the equation <fact2>19</fact2> + <fact3>7</fact3> + <fact6>x</fact6> = <fact1>190</fact1>. Solving for <fact6>x</fact6>, we get <fact6>x</fact6> = <fact1>190</fact1> - <fact2>19</fact2> - <fact3>7</fact3> = 164. Since the number of students that like to hike is twice the number that prefer playing football, we have <fact6>x</fact6> = 2*<fact3>7</fact3> = 14. However, this is a contradiction since <fact6>x</fact6> cannot be both 14 and 164. This means that our initial assumption that <fact6>x</fact6> is the number of students that like to hike is incorrect. Since <fact7>the number that like to hike is twice the number that prefer playing football</fact7>, let's call the number that prefer playing football <fact8>y</fact8>. Then, the number that like to hike is 2*<fact8>y</fact8>. We can now set up the equation <fact2>19</fact2> + <fact3>y</fact3> + 2*<fact8>y</fact8> = <fact1>190</fact1> and solve for <fact8>y</fact8>. This gives us 3*<fact8>y</fact8> = <fact1>190</fact1> - <fact2>19</fact2> = 171. Therefore, <fact8>y</fact8> = 171/3 = 57. This means that the number of students that like to hike is 2*<fact8>y</fact8> = 2*57 = 114. The number of students that like to bake is then <fact1>190</fact1> - <fact2>19</fact2> - <fact3>7</fact3> - <fact6>114</fact6> = 50.

How many like to <fact4>bake</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>paint</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing tennis</fact6>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to play video games or tennis is <fact2>17</fact2> + <fact3>5</fact3> = 22 students.
Since there are <fact1>109</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to either bake or paint is <fact1>109</fact1> - 22 = 87 students.
Let's denote the number of students who like to paint as x. According to the question, the number of students who like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing tennis, so x = 2 * <fact3>5</fact3> = 10.

Answer: The total number of students who like to bake or play tennis is <fact2>42</fact2> + <fact3>25</fact3> = 67. 
Since the total number of students is <fact1>183</fact1>, the number of students who like to play music or paint is <fact1>183</fact1> - 67 = 116.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play tennis as x. Since the number of students who like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing tennis, the number of students who like to paint is 2x.
We know that the total number of students who like to play music or paint is 116, so we can write the equation:
x + 2x = 116
Combine like terms:
3x = 116
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 116/3
x = 38.67 (round to 39, since you can't have a fraction of a student)
However, the number of students who like to play tennis must be a whole number, so we made an error in our previous steps.
Let's go back to the equation x + 2x = 116 and try to find the correct solution.
x + 2x = 116
Combine like terms:
3x = 116
Since 3x must be a multiple of 3, we can try to find a multiple of 3 that is close to 116.
The closest multiple of 3 to 116 is 117, which is 3 * 39.
However, we made another error in our previous steps.
Let's go back to the equation x + 2x = 116 and try to find the correct solution.

155,"A group of 192 students has various hobbies. 90 like to dance, 21 like to play basketball, and the rest like to either hike or bake. How many like to hike if the number that like to bake is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?","Reformatted Question: A group of <fact1>192 students</fact1> has various hobbies. <fact2>90 like to dance</fact2>, <fact3>21 like to play basketball</fact3>, and the rest like to either <fact4>hike</fact4> or <fact5>bake</fact5>. How many like to <fact4>hike</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>bake</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>?

Answer: We know that the total number of students is <fact1>192</fact1> and that <fact2>90</fact2> like to dance and <fact3>21</fact3> like to play basketball. This means that the remaining students like to either <fact4>hike</fact4> or <fact5>bake</fact5>. Since <fact7>192 - 90 - 21</fact7> = 81 students like to either <fact4>hike</fact4> or <fact5>bake</fact5>, we can say that the number of students who like to <fact4>hike</fact4> plus the number of students who like to <fact5>bake</fact5> is <fact8>81</fact8>. We are also told that the number of students who like to <fact5>bake</fact5> is <fact9>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact9>, which means that the number of students who like to <fact5>bake</fact5> is <fact10>2 * 21 = 42</fact10>. Therefore, the number of students who like to <fact4>hike</fact4> is <fact8>81 - 42 = 39</fact8>."

Answer: The total number of students who like to play music or badminton is <fact2>91</fact2> + <fact3>6</fact3> = 97. Since there are <fact1>182</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to play video games or dance is <fact1>182</fact1> - <fact2>97</fact2> = 85. We are also given that the number of students who like to dance is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing badminton</fact4>, so the number of students who like to dance is <fact3>6</fact3> * 2 = 12. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is <fact5>85</fact5> - <fact6>12</fact6> = 73."

Answer: The total number of students who like to hike or play cricket is <fact2>134</fact2> + <fact3>4</fact3> = 138. Since there are <fact1>175</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to dance or play video games is <fact1>175</fact1> - <fact2>138</fact2> = 37. Let's denote the number of students who like to play video games as x. Since x is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing cricket</fact4>, x is equal to 2 * <fact3>4</fact3> = 8.

Answer: The total number of students who like to bake or play football is <fact2>13</fact2> + <fact3>40</fact3> = 53.
Since there are <fact1>154</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to play music or read is <fact1>154</fact1> - <fact2>53</fact2> = 101.
The number of students who like to read is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing football</fact4>, which means it is <fact4>2 * 40</fact4> = 80.

How many like to <fact4>dance</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>paint</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?
Answer: We are given that <fact2>14</fact2> students like to play video games, <fact3>28</fact3> students like to play hurling, and the rest like to either dance or paint. The total number of students is <fact1>116</fact1>, so the number of students that like to dance or paint is <fact1>116</fact1> - <fact2>14</fact2> - <fact3>28</fact3> = 74.
We are also given that the number of students that like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing hurling. Since <fact3>28</fact3> students like to play hurling, the number of students that like to paint is <fact3>28</fact3> * 2 = 56.
Now we can find the number of students that like to dance by subtracting the number of students that like to paint from the total number of students that like to dance or paint. Therefore, the number of students that like to dance is <fact1>74</fact1> - <fact6>56</fact6> = 18.

Answer: The total number of students who like to play video games or hurling is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>43</fact3> = 50.
Since the rest of the students like to either paint or read, the number of students who like to paint or read is <fact1>171</fact1> - <fact2>50</fact2> = 121.
The number of students who like to read is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>, so the number of students who like to read is <fact3>43</fact3> * <fact6>2</fact6> = 86.
Therefore, the number of students who like to paint is <fact1>121</fact1> - <fact5>86</fact5> = 35.

Answer: The number of students who like to hike is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing badminton</fact7>, so it is <fact3>18</fact3> * <fact7>2</fact7> = 36. The total number of students who like to hike or read is <fact1>122</fact1> - <fact2>35</fact2> - <fact3>18</fact3> = 69.

How many like to <fact4>play music</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>dance</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: The total number of students who like to hike or play hurling is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>34</fact3> = 41 students.
Since the rest of the students like to either play music or dance, the number of students who like to play music or dance is <fact1>189</fact1> - <fact2>41</fact2> = 148 students.
Let's assume the number of students who like to play hurling is x. Then, the number of students who like to dance is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>, which is 2x.
We know that the total number of students who like to dance or play music is 148. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 148.
Combine like terms: 3x = 148.
Divide both sides by 3: x = 49.33 (round down to 49 since we can't have a fraction of a student).
Now that we know x, we can find the number of students who like to dance: 2x = 2(49) = 98 students.
The number of students who like to play music is the total number of students who like to play music or dance minus the number of students who like to dance: 148 - 98 = 50 students.
The answer is {50}."
165,"A class of 146 students has various hobbies. 7 like to read, 21 like to play cricket, and the rest like to either paint or play music. How many like to paint if the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing cricket?","Reformatted Question: A class of <fact1>146 students</fact1> has various hobbies. <fact2>7 like to read</fact2>, <fact3>21 like to play cricket</fact3>, and the rest like to either <fact4>paint</fact4> or <fact5>play music</fact5>. How many like to <fact4>paint</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>play music</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing cricket</fact6>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to read or play cricket is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>21</fact3> = 28 students.
Since the rest of the students like to either paint or play music, the number of students who like to paint or play music is <fact1>146</fact1> - <fact2>28</fact2> = 118 students.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as x. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing cricket, the number of students who like to play cricket is x/2.
We know that the total number of students who like to paint or play music is 118, so we can set up the equation:
x + x/2 = 118
To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:
2x + x = 236
Combine like terms:
3x = 236
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 78.67 (round to 79, since we can't have a fraction of a student)
However, since x represents the number of students who like to play music, it must be an integer. So, we can try x = 79.
If x = 79, then the number of students who like to play cricket is x/2 = 79/2 = 39.5, which is not an integer.
However, if x = 78, then the number of students who like to play cricket is x/2 = 78/2 = 39, which is an integer.
So, the number of students who like to play music is 78, and the number of students who like to play cricket is 39.
The number of students who like to paint is the total number of students minus the number of students who like to read, play cricket, or play music:
<fact1>146</fact1> - <fact2>7</fact2> - <fact3>21</fact3> - <fact5>78</fact5> = 40 students.
The answer is {40}."

How many like to play music if the number that like to paint is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact4>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to dance or play hurling is <fact2>21</fact2> + <fact3>41</fact3> = 62. Since there are <fact1>145</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to play music or paint is <fact1>145</fact1> - <fact2>62</fact2> = 83.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as <fact5>M</fact5> and the number of students who like to paint as <fact6>P</fact6>. Since the number of students who like to paint is twice the number that prefer playing hurling, we can write <fact6>P</fact6> = 2 * <fact3>41</fact3> = 82.
The total number of students who like to play music or paint is the sum of <fact5>M</fact5> and <fact6>P</fact6>, which is equal to 83. Therefore, we can write <fact5>M</fact5> + <fact6>P</fact6> = 83.
Substituting the value of <fact6>P</fact6> into the equation, we get <fact5>M</fact5> + 82 = 83.

How many like to <fact4>hike</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>paint</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing football</fact6>?
Answer: Since <fact3>18 like to play football</fact3>, <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing football</fact6> is <fact3>18</fact3> * 2 = 36.
This means that <fact5>36 like to paint</fact5>. 
Since <fact1>176 students</fact1> have various hobbies, and <fact2>40 like to read</fact2>, <fact3>18 like to play football</fact3>, and <fact5>36 like to paint</fact5>, the rest of the students like to either <fact4>hike</fact4> or <fact5>paint</fact5>.

How many like to <fact6>dance</fact6> if the number that like to <fact7>bake</fact7> is <fact8>twice the number that prefer playing tennis</fact8>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to paint or play tennis is <fact2>15</fact2> + <fact3>20</fact3> = 35.
Since there are <fact1>107</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to dance or bake is <fact1>107</fact1> - <fact2>35</fact2> = 72.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play tennis as x. Then, the number of students who like to bake is <fact8>twice the number that prefer playing tennis</fact8>, which is 2x.
Since the number of students who like to dance or bake is 72, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 72.
Combining like terms, we get 3x = 72.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 24.
This means that the number of students who like to play tennis is 24, and the number of students who like to bake is 2x = 2*24 = 48.
Since the number of students who like to dance or bake is 72, and the number of students who like to bake is 48, the number of students who like to dance is 72 - 48 = 24.
The answer is {24}."

Answer: Since <fact3>5 like to play hurling</fact3>, the number that like to bake is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact4>, which means the number that like to bake is 2 * <fact3>5</fact3> = 10.
The total number of students that like to play video games, hurling, or baking is <fact2>84</fact2> + <fact3>5</fact3> + <fact4>10</fact4> = 99.

How many like to <fact5>read</fact5> if the number that like to <fact6>bake</fact6> is <fact7>twice the number that prefer playing cricket</fact7>?
Answer: Since <fact3>10 like to play cricket</fact3> and the number that like to <fact6>bake</fact6> is <fact7>twice the number that prefer playing cricket</fact7>, the number that like to <fact6>bake</fact6> is <fact3>10</fact3> * <fact7>2</fact7> = 20.

How many like to play video games if the number that like to dance is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing cricket</fact4>?
Answer: First, we can find the total number of students who like to play music or cricket. This is given by <fact2>35</fact2> + <fact3>14</fact3> = 49 students.
Since there are <fact1>155</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to play video games or dance is <fact1>155</fact1> - <fact2>49</fact2> = 106 students.
Let <fact5>n</fact5> be the number of students who like to dance. Then, we are given that <fact5>n</fact5> = <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact3>14</fact3> = 28 students.

How many like to hike if the number that like to bake is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing tennis</fact4>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to paint, play tennis, hike, or bake is <fact1>131</fact1>. We know that <fact2>25</fact2> like to paint and <fact3>7</fact3> like to play tennis, so the number of students who like to hike or bake is <fact1>131</fact1> - <fact2>25</fact2> - <fact3>7</fact3> = 99.
Let <fact5>x</fact5> be the number of students who like to play tennis. Then, the number of students who like to bake is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing tennis</fact4>, so it is <fact5>2x</fact5>.

How many like to <fact4>paint</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>play music</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?
Answer: The number of students who like to paint or play music is the total number of students minus the number of students who like to read and the number of students who like to play hurling. This is <fact1>198</fact1> - <fact2>60</fact2> - <fact3>22</fact3> = 116 students.

How many like to <fact4>bake</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>play music</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: We know that the total number of students is <fact1>173</fact1>, and the number of students who like to hike or play hurling is <fact2>62 + 14 = 76</fact2>.

Answer: We know that <fact2>11 students like to play badminton</fact2>. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is <fact4>twice the number that prefer playing badminton</fact4>, so the number of students who like to play music is 2 * <fact2>11</fact2> = 22 students.
The total number of students who like to bake, play badminton, or play music is <fact2>79</fact2> + <fact3>11</fact3> + <fact4>22</fact4> = 112 students.
Since there are <fact1>113 students</fact1> in the class, the remaining students must like to play video games. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is <fact1>113</fact1> - <fact5>112</fact5> = 1 student.

Answer: Let's first find the number of students who like to hike. We know that this number is twice the number of students who like to play cricket, so it is 2 * <fact3>22</fact3> = 44 students. Now, we can find the total number of students who like to play video games or hike by subtracting the number of students who like to read and the number of students who like to play cricket from the total number of students: <fact1>96</fact1> - <fact2>3</fact2> - <fact3>22</fact3> = 71 students.

Answer: The total number of students that like to bake, play football, read, or hike is <fact1>162</fact1>. We know that <fact2>64</fact2> like to bake and <fact3>29</fact3> like to play football. Let's call the number of students that like to hike <fact5>x</fact5> and the number of students that like to read <fact6>y</fact6>. Since the rest of the students like to either read or hike, we can write an equation: <fact1>162</fact1> = <fact2>64</fact2> + <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact5>x</fact5> + <fact6>y</fact6>. We also know that <fact4>x</fact4> = 2*<fact3>29</fact3>, so we can substitute this expression for <fact5>x</fact5> in the equation. This gives us <fact1>162</fact1> = <fact2>64</fact2> + <fact3>29</fact3> + 2*<fact3>29</fact3> + <fact6>y</fact6>. Simplifying the equation, we get <fact1>162</fact1> = <fact2>64</fact2> + <fact3>29</fact3> + <fact3>58</fact3> + <fact6>y</fact6>, or <fact1>162</fact1> = <fact2>151</fact2> + <fact6>y</fact6>.

How many like to <fact4>hike</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>play music</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing volleyball</fact6>?
Answer: The total number of students who like to dance, play volleyball, hike, or play music is <fact1>181</fact1>. Since 114 like to dance and 19 like to play volleyball, the number of students who like to hike or play music is <fact1>181</fact1> - <fact2>114</fact2> - <fact3>19</fact3> = 48.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play volleyball as x. Then, the number of students who like to play music is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing volleyball</fact6>, which is 2x.
The total number of students who like to hike or play music is 48, and we know that 2x students like to play music. Therefore, the number of students who like to hike is 48 - 2x.
However, we also know that the total number of students who like to hike or play music is 48, and the number of students who like to play music is 2x. Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing volleyball, we can set up the equation 2x + (48 - 2x) = 48 + x, but this is not correct because it would mean that 2x is not equal to 2x. The correct equation is 2x + (48 - 2x) = 48. This equation is not correct either. We need to re-evaluate the problem.
Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing volleyball, we can set up the equation 2x + y = 48, where x is the number of students who like to play volleyball and y is the number of students who like to play music.
We also know that the total number of students who like to dance, play volleyball, hike, or play music is 181. Since 114 like to dance and 19 like to play volleyball, the number of students who like to hike or play music is 181 - 114 - 19 = 48.
We can set up the equation x + y = 19, since x is the number of students who like to play volleyball and y is the number of students who like to play music.
Now we have two equations: 2x + y = 48 and x + y = 19. We can solve these equations by subtracting the second equation from the first equation, which gives us x = 29.
Now that we know x, we can find y by substituting x into the second equation: 29 + y = 19. This is not correct, we should use the first equation instead. 2x + y = 48, substituting x = 29 into this equation, we get 2*29 + y = 48, which simplifies to 58 + y = 48. This is not correct, we should use the first equation 2x + y = 48, substituting x = 29 into this equation, we get 2*29 + y = 48, which simplifies to 58 + y = 48.

Answer: The total number of students who like to play music or basketball is <fact2>71</fact2> + <fact3>23</fact3> = 94.
Since there are <fact1>148</fact1> students in total, the number of students who like to paint or play video games is 148 - 94 = 54.
Let's denote the number of students who like to play basketball as x. Then, the number of students who like to play video games is 2x (according to <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing basketball</fact6>).
The number of students who like to paint is the difference between the total number of students who like to paint or play video games and the number of students who like to play video games: 54 - 2x.
However, we know that the number of students who like to play basketball is x, and the number of students who like to play video games is 2x. We also know that the total number of students who like to paint or play video games is 54.
Therefore, the number of students who like to paint is 54 - 2x, and the number of students who like to play basketball is x.
We also know that the number of students who like to play basketball is 23 (<fact3>23 like to play basketball</fact3>), so we can set up the equation x = 23.
Now we can find the number of students who like to paint: 54 - 2x = 54 - 2(23) = 54 - 46 = 8.
The answer is {8}."

The number of kernels that popped in the next 28 seconds is <fact3>5 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, which is 5 * <fact1>40</fact1> = 200 kernels. The number of kernels that popped in the final 28 seconds is <fact4>half the rate as the past 28 seconds</fact4>, which is 1/2 * <fact3>200</fact3> = 100 kernels. A quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 28 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 1/4 * <fact4>100</fact4> = 25 kernels. The total number of kernels that popped is <fact1>40</fact1> + <fact2>80</fact2> + <fact3>200</fact3> + <fact4>100</fact4> + <fact5>25</fact5> = 445 kernels.

How many pieces of popcorn does Santiago have to eat?

Answer: In the first 18 seconds, <fact2>60 kernels</fact2> popped. 
In the next 18 seconds, <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3> popped, which is <fact2>60</fact2> * <fact3>4</fact3> = 240 kernels.
In the next 18 seconds, <fact4>6 times the initial popping rate</fact4> popped, which is <fact2>60</fact2> * <fact4>6</fact4> = 360 kernels.
In the final 18 seconds, the popping slowed down to <fact5>half the rate as the past 18 seconds</fact5>, which is <fact4>360</fact4> / <fact5>2</fact5> = 180 kernels.
In the final 18 seconds, a quarter of the kernels that popped also popped from the residual heat, which is <fact5>180</fact5> / <fact6>4</fact6> = 45 kernels.
So the total number of kernels that popped is <fact2>60</fact2> + <fact3>240</fact3> + <fact4>360</fact4> + <fact5>180</fact5> + <fact7>45</fact7> = 885 kernels.

Answer: In the first 26 seconds, <fact1>40 kernels</fact1> popped. In the next 26 seconds, <fact2>2 times that amount</fact2> popped, which is <fact2>2</fact2>*<fact1>40</fact1> = 80 kernels. So in the first 52 seconds, a total of <fact1>40</fact1> + <fact2>80</fact2> = 120 kernels popped. In the next 26 seconds, <fact3>7 times the initial popping rate</fact3> popped, which is <fact3>7</fact3>*<fact1>40</fact1> = 280 kernels. So in the first 78 seconds, a total of <fact1>40</fact1> + <fact2>80</fact2> + <fact3>280</fact3> = 400 kernels popped. In the final 26 seconds, the popping slowed down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 26 seconds</fact4>, which is <fact4>1/2</fact4>*<fact3>280</fact3> = 140 kernels. So in total, a total of <fact1>40</fact1> + <fact2>80</fact2> + <fact3>280</fact3> + <fact4>140</fact4> = 540 kernels popped. However, after Tara takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 26 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. This means that <fact5>1/4</fact5>*<fact4>140</fact4> = 35 kernels also popped. So in total, Tara has <fact6>540</fact6> + <fact5>35</fact5> = 575 kernels."

Answer: The kernels pop at <fact1>50</fact1> kernels in the first 14 seconds of cooking. In the next 14 seconds, they pop at <fact2>3 times that amount</fact2>, which is <fact2>3</fact2>*<fact1>50</fact1> = 150 kernels. In the next 14 seconds, they pop at <fact3>4 times the initial popping rate</fact3>, which is <fact3>4</fact3>*<fact1>50</fact1> = 200 kernels. In the final 14 seconds, they pop at <fact4>half the rate as the past 14 seconds</fact4>, which is <fact4>200/2</fact4> = 100 kernels. So, in total, 50 + 150 + 200 + 100 = 500 kernels popped in the pot. After Daphne takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 14 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. This is <fact4>100/4</fact4> = 25 kernels.

Answer: The number of kernels that popped in the first 24 seconds is <fact1>40</fact1>. In the next 24 seconds, <fact2>3 times that amount</fact2> popped, which is 3 * <fact1>40</fact1> = 120 kernels. So, in the first 48 seconds, 40 + 120 = 160 kernels popped. In the next 24 seconds, <fact3>6 times the initial popping rate</fact3> popped, which is 6 * <fact1>40</fact1> = 240 kernels. So, in the first 72 seconds, 160 + 240 = 400 kernels popped. In the final 24 seconds, the popping slowed down to <fact4>half the rate as the past 24 seconds</fact4>, which is 240 / 2 = 120 kernels. So, in the first 96 seconds, 400 + 120 = 520 kernels popped. After Jasmine takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 24 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 120 / 4 = 30 kernels.

So, in total, <fact1>20</fact1> + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels popped.
However, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 28 seconds also popped from the residual heat. Since <fact4>40</fact4> kernels popped in the final 28 seconds, a quarter of that amount is <fact4>40</fact4> / <fact5>4</fact5> = 10 kernels.
Therefore, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

If she used a total of <fact2>1474 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
Answer: Let's use the ratio of 97:37 to find the total number of parts in the ratio. <fact1>97</fact1> + <fact2>37</fact2> = <fact3>134</fact3> parts. Since the total amount of sugar and water used is <fact2>1474</fact2> teaspoons, we can set up a proportion to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used.

If she used a total of <fact4>726 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.

Answer: The ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> to <fact2>cups of water</fact2> is <fact3>164:78</fact3>. This means that for every 164 <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1>, there are 78 <fact2>cups of water</fact2>. The total number of parts in the ratio is 164 + 78 = 242. The total number of <fact4>teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4> used is 726. To find the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used, we need to find what fraction of the total number of parts the <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> represent. This is 164/242.

If she used a total of <fact2>468 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
Answer: Let's use the ratio of sugar to water to set up an equation. The ratio is 135:21, which can be written as 135x:21x, where x is a common multiplier. Since the total amount of sugar and water is 468, we can set up the equation 135x + 21x = 468. Combining like terms, we get 156x = 468. Dividing both sides by 156, we get x = 3. Now that we know x, we can find the amount of sugar by multiplying 135 and x, which gives us 135 * 3 = 405. Therefore, Xena used 405 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

If <fact2>she used a total of 210 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of <fact3>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact3> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact4>S</fact4> and the number of cups of water as <fact5>W</fact5>. According to the given ratio, <fact6>S/W = 140/70</fact6>. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 70. This gives us <fact7>S/W = 2/1</fact7>. Since <fact8>S/W = 2/1</fact8>, we can say that for every 2 teaspoons of sugar, there is 1 cup of water. Now, we are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is 210. We can express this as <fact9>S + W = 210</fact9>. We can also express <fact10>W</fact10> in terms of <fact11>S</fact11> using the ratio <fact7>S/W = 2/1</fact7>. This gives us <fact12>W = 0.5S</fact12>. Substituting this expression for <fact10>W</fact10> into the equation <fact9>S + W = 210</fact9>, we get <fact13>S + 0.5S = 210</fact13>. Combining like terms, we get <fact14>1.5S = 210</fact14>. To solve for <fact11>S</fact11>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5. This gives us <fact15>S = 140</fact15>. Therefore, Kimia used 140 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

If she used a total of <fact4>238 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar used is <fact1>31x</fact1> and the number of cups of water used is <fact2>88x</fact2>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact4>238</fact4>, we can set up the equation <fact1>31x</fact1> + <fact2>88x</fact2> = <fact4>238</fact4>.

If she used a total of <fact2>970 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of <fact3>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact3> she used.
Answer: Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar is <fact4>x</fact4> and the number of cups of water is <fact5>y</fact5>. According to the given ratio, we can set up the following equation: <fact1>155/x = 39/y</fact1>. Since we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 970, we can set up another equation: <fact2>x + y = 970</fact2>. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of x. First, we can cross-multiply the first equation to get: <fact3>155y = 39x</fact3>. Now, we can substitute <fact4>y = (39x/155)</fact4> into the second equation: <fact5>x + (39x/155) = 970</fact5>. Multiplying both sides by 155 to eliminate the fraction, we get: <fact6>155x + 39x = 150,050</fact6>. Combining like terms, we get: <fact7>194x = 150,050</fact7>.

If she used a total of <fact4>1316 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.

Answer: We are given that Daphne uses <fact3>153:35</fact3> teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. This means that for every 153 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 35 cups of water. Let's say the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact6>1316</fact6>. We can set up a proportion to solve for the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar used is <fact7>x</fact7>. Then, the number of cups of water used is <fact3>35/153</fact3>*<fact7>x</fact7>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact4>1316</fact4>, we can set up the equation:

<fact1>153x + 35*(35/153)x = 1316</fact1>

Combine like terms:

<fact1>153x + 35x/153 = 1316</fact1>

Multiply both sides by 153 to eliminate the fraction:

<fact1>153^2x + 35x = 1316*153</fact1>

Expand and simplify:

<fact1>23409x + 35x = 201228</fact1>

Combine like terms:

<fact1>23444x = 201228</fact1>

Divide both sides by 23444:

<fact7>x = 201228/23444</fact7>

<fact7>x = 8.60</fact7>

Since we can't have a fraction of a teaspoon, we can round to the nearest whole number. However, the question asks for the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which implies that the answer should be a whole number. To get a whole number, we can multiply the number of teaspoons of sugar used by the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to total teaspoons:

<fact5>8.60*153/8.60 = 153</fact5>

<fact5>1316/8.60*8.60 = 153</fact5>

This confirms that the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is 153.

262,"Chen makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 83:99. If she used a total of 1456 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.","Reformatted Question: Chen makes tea using <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> and <fact2>cups of water</fact2> in the ratio of <fact3>83:99</fact3>. If she used a total of <fact4>1456 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact6>S</fact6> and the number of cups of water as <fact7>W</fact7>. According to the ratio, we have <fact3>83:99</fact3> = <fact6>S:W</fact6>. This means that for every 83 teaspoons of sugar, there are 99 cups of water. We can rewrite this as <fact6>S/W</fact6> = <fact3>83/99</fact3>. 

We are given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact4>1456</fact4>. This means that <fact6>S + W</fact6> = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

We can use the ratio to express <fact7>W</fact7> in terms of <fact6>S</fact6>. From <fact6>S/W</fact6> = <fact3>83/99</fact3>, we can rewrite as <fact7>W</fact7> = <fact6>S</fact6> * <fact3>99/83</fact3>. 

Substituting this expression for <fact7>W</fact7> into the equation <fact6>S + W</fact6> = <fact4>1456</fact4>, we get <fact6>S</fact6> + <fact6>S</fact6> * <fact3>99/83</fact3> = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

Simplifying this equation, we get <fact6>S</fact6> * (1 + <fact3>99/83</fact3>) = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

<fact6>S</fact6> * (83 + 99)/83 = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

<fact6>S</fact6> * 182/83 = <fact4>1456</fact4>. 

<fact6>S</fact6> = <fact4>1456</fact4> * 83/182. 

<fact6>S</fact6> = 676. 

The answer is {676}."

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact3>S</fact3> and the number of cups of water as <fact4>W</fact4>. We are given that the ratio of sugar to water is <fact1>28:54</fact1>, which can be written as <fact3>S/W = 28/54</fact3>. Since <fact2>the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 574</fact2>, we can set up the equation <fact3>S + W = 574</fact3>. We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of <fact3>S</fact3>. First, we can rewrite the first equation as <fact3>S = 28/54*W</fact3>. Substituting this expression for <fact3>S</fact3> into the second equation, we get <fact3>28/54*W + W = 574</fact3>.

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact6>s</fact6> and the number of cups of water as <fact7>w</fact7>. We know that the ratio of sugar to water is <fact3>149:60</fact3>, so we can write the equation <fact6>s/w = 149/60</fact6>. We are also given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact4>1463</fact4>, so we can write the equation <fact6>s + w = 1463</fact7>. We can use these two equations to solve for <fact5>s</fact5>. First, we can multiply the first equation by <fact7>w</fact7> to get <fact6>sw = (149/60) * 60w</fact7>, which simplifies to <fact6>sw = 149w</fact7>. We can then substitute this expression into the second equation to get <fact6>149w + w = 1463</fact7>, which simplifies to <fact7>150w = 1463</fact7>.

If she used a total of <fact2>900 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of <fact3>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact3> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact4>s</fact4> and the number of cups of water as <fact5>w</fact5>. According to the given ratio, we have <fact1>32:s = 18:w</fact1>. This means that for every 32 teaspoons of sugar, there are 18 cups of water. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 2, which gives us <fact2>16:s = 9:w</fact2>. Now, we know that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact3>900</fact3>. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 16:9, we can set up the following equation: <fact4>s + w = 900</fact4>. We can also express <fact5>w</fact5> in terms of <fact4>s</fact4> using the ratio: <fact6>w = (9/16)s</fact6>. Substituting this expression for <fact5>w</fact5> into the equation <fact4>s + w = 900</fact4>, we get <fact7>s + (9/16)s = 900</fact7>. Combining like terms, we have <fact8>(16/16 + 9/16)s = 900</fact8>, which simplifies to <fact9>(25/16)s = 900</fact9>. To solve for <fact4>s</fact4>, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of <fact10>(25/16)</fact10>, which is <fact11>(16/25)</fact11>. This gives us <fact12>s = 900 * (16/25)</fact12>.

If she used a total of <fact4>1188 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: The total number of parts in the ratio is <fact3>83</fact3> + <fact2>25</fact2> = 108 parts.
The number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is <fact3>83</fact3> parts out of the 108 parts, so the fraction of the total used is <fact3>83/108</fact3>.
The total number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is <fact4>1188</fact4> teaspoons, and the fraction of the total used is <fact3>83/108</fact3>, so we can set up the equation: <fact4>1188</fact4> = <fact3>83/108</fact3> * x, where x is the total number of parts in the ratio.
We can solve for x by multiplying both sides by <fact3>108/83</fact3>, which gives us: x = <fact4>1188</fact4> * <fact3>108/83</fact3> = 1554.
Since the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is <fact3>83</fact3> parts out of the 108 parts, we can multiply the total number of parts (1554) by the fraction of the total used by <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> (<fact3>83/108</fact3>): 1554 * <fact3>83/108</fact3> = 1188.
However, this is not the correct answer. We need to multiply the total number of parts (108) by the fraction of the total used by <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> (<fact3>83/108</fact3>): 108 * <fact3>83/108</fact3> = 83.
Therefore, the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> used is 83."
277,"Isabella makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 35:42. If she used a total of 616 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Isabella makes tea using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 35:42</fact1>. If she used a total of <fact2>616 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of <fact3>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact3> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact4>S</fact4> and the number of cups of water as <fact5>W</fact5>. According to the ratio, we have <fact1>35</fact1> : <fact2>42</fact2> = <fact4>S</fact4> : <fact5>W</fact5>. This can be rewritten as <fact6>(35/42) = (S/W)</fact6>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is <fact2>616</fact2>, we have <fact7>S + W = 616</fact7>. Now we have two equations: <fact8>(35/42) = (S/W)</fact8> and <fact9>S + W = 616</fact9>. We can solve these equations to find the value of <fact4>S</fact4>. First, we can rewrite the first equation as <fact10>S = (35/42) * W</fact10>. Substituting this into the second equation, we get <fact11>(35/42) * W + W = 616</fact11>. Combining like terms, we have <fact12>(77/42) * W = 616</fact12>. Multiplying both sides by <fact13>42</fact13>, we get <fact14>77W = 25824</fact14>. Dividing both sides by <fact15>77</fact15>, we get <fact16>W = 336</fact16>. Now that we have the value of <fact5>W</fact5>, we can find the value of <fact4>S</fact4> by substituting it into the equation <fact10>S = (35/42) * W</fact10>. We get <fact17>S = (35/42) * 336 = 280</fact17>. Therefore, Isabella used <fact3>280</fact3> teaspoonfuls of sugar."

279,"Olivia makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 196:16. If she used a total of 1272 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.","Reformatted Question: Olivia makes coffee using <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> and <fact2>cups of water</fact2> in the ratio of <fact3>196:16</fact3>. If she used a total of <fact4>1272 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact5>S</fact5> and the number of cups of water as <fact2>W</fact2>. We are given that the ratio of <fact5>S</fact5> to <fact2>W</fact2> is <fact3>196:16</fact3>, which can be expressed as <fact5>S/W = 196/16</fact5>. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 4. This gives us <fact5>S/W = 49/4</fact5>. 

We are also given that the total number of <fact5>S</fact5> and <fact2>W</fact2> is <fact4>1272</fact4>. We can express this as an equation: <fact5>S + W = 1272</fact5>. 

Now, we can substitute the expression for <fact5>S</fact5> from the ratio into the equation: <fact2>W * 49/4 + W = 1272</fact2>. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: <fact2>49W + 4W = 5088</fact2>. Combining like terms, we get <fact2>53W = 5088</fact2>. Dividing both sides by 53, we get <fact2>W = 96</fact2>. 

Now that we have the value of <fact2>W</fact2>, we can substitute it back into the equation <fact5>S + W = 1272</fact5> to find the value of <fact5>S</fact5>: <fact5>S + 96 = 1272</fact5>. Subtracting 96 from both sides, we get <fact5>S = 1176</fact5>. 

Therefore, the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> Olivia used is <fact5>1176</fact5>."

If she used a total of <fact4>753 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.

Answer: The ratio of sugar to water is <fact3>186:65</fact3>, which means that for every <fact3>186</fact3> teaspoons of sugar, there are <fact2>65</fact2> cups of water. This ratio is the same as <fact3>186/65</fact3> = 2.85, meaning that for every 1 cup of water, there are 2.85 teaspoons of sugar. To find the total number of teaspoons of sugar, we can divide the total number of teaspoons of sugar and water by the sum of the ratio, <fact3>186+65</fact3> = 251. 

<fact4>753</fact4> / <fact3>251</fact3> = 3. This means that for every 251 teaspoons of sugar and water, there are 3 sets of the ratio. So, the total number of teaspoons of sugar is 3 * <fact3>186</fact3> = 558.

If she used a total of <fact4>1470 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> she used.

Answer: Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar Aisha used is <fact1>134x</fact1> and the number of cups of water she used is <fact2>76x</fact2>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is <fact4>1470</fact4>, we can set up the equation: <fact1>134x</fact1> + <fact2>76x</fact2> = <fact4>1470</fact4>. Combining like terms, we get <fact1>210x</fact1> = <fact4>1470</fact4>. To solve for x, we divide both sides by <fact1>210</fact1>: x = <fact4>1470</fact4> / <fact1>210</fact1> = <fact5>7</fact5>. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar Aisha used by multiplying <fact1>134</fact1> by <fact5>7</fact5>: <fact1>134</fact1> * <fact5>7</fact5> = <fact6>938</fact6>.

If she used a total of <fact4>635 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> she used.
Answer: The total parts in the ratio are <fact3>113+14=127</fact3>. 
Since <fact4>635</fact4> is the total number of parts used, we can set up a proportion to find the number of parts that represent <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1>. Let's call this number x. Then we have the proportion <fact3>113/127=x/635</fact3>.
We can solve for x by cross-multiplying to get <fact3>113*635=127x</fact3>, which simplifies to <fact3>71845=127x</fact3>.
Dividing both sides by 127 gives us <fact3>x=565</fact3>. This means that <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> represent 565 parts of the total.
Since the total number of parts used was <fact4>635</fact4>, we can find the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> used by dividing 565 by 113, which is the number of parts that represent <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> in the ratio. This gives us <fact3>565/113=5</fact3>.

If she used a total of <fact2>1239 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact3>S</fact3> and the number of cups of water as <fact4>W</fact4>. According to the given ratio, we have <fact1>91S = 86W</fact1>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is <fact2>1239</fact2>, we can write the equation <fact5>S + W = 1239</fact5>. Now we have a system of two equations:
<fact1>91S = 86W</fact1>
<fact5>S + W = 1239</fact5>
We can solve this system of equations by substituting <fact4>W</fact4> from the first equation into the second equation:
<fact5>S + (91S/86) = 1239</fact5>
Multiplying both sides of the equation by <fact6>86</fact6>, we get:

Answer: The total number of parts in the ratio is <fact3>94</fact3> + <fact3>66</fact3> = 160 parts. This means that the total amount of sugar and water used is 160 parts. Since Nadia used a total of <fact4>160 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, this total amount of 160 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is equal to 160 parts. Since the ratio of sugar to water is <fact3>94:66</fact3>, the number of parts that represent the sugar is <fact3>94</fact3> parts out of the total 160 parts. Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Nadia used is <fact3>94</fact3> parts out of 160 parts, which is equivalent to <fact3>94/160</fact3> of the total amount. Since the total amount is <fact4>160 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Nadia used is <fact3>94/160</fact3> * <fact4>160</fact4> = <fact3>94</fact3> teaspoonfuls of sugar."

If she used a total of <fact2>1332 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
Answer: Let's first find the total number of parts in the ratio, which is <fact1>128</fact1> + <fact2>20</fact2> = 148 parts.
Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water used is <fact2>1332</fact2>, we can set up a proportion to find the number of parts that represents the sugar:
<fact1>128 parts</fact1> / <fact3>148 parts</fact3> = <fact4>x parts</fact4> / <fact2>1332 teaspoons</fact2>
Cross-multiplying, we get:
<fact1>128</fact1> * <fact2>1332</fact2> = <fact3>148</fact3> * <fact4>x</fact4>
Simplifying, we get:
170,656 = 148x
Dividing both sides by 148, we get:
x = 1152
Since the ratio of sugar to total is <fact1>128:148</fact1>, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is <fact1>128/148</fact1> * <fact2>1332</fact2> = 1152.

If <fact2>she used a total of 579 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of <fact3>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact3> she used.
Answer: Let's assume the number of teaspoons of sugar is <fact4>x</fact4> and the number of cups of water is <fact5>y</fact5>. Since the ratio of sugar to water is 131:62, we can set up the following equation:
<fact1>131x = 62y</fact1>
We are also given that the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 579, so we can set up the following equation:
<fact2>x + y = 579</fact2>
We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. First, we can multiply the second equation by 62 to get:
<fact3>62x + 62y = 35958</fact3>
Now we can subtract the first equation from this new equation to get:
<fact4>62x - 131x = 35958 - 131x</fact4>
This simplifies to:
<fact5>-69x = 35958 - 131x</fact5>
Now we can add 131x to both sides to get:

If she used a total of <fact4>1458 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact5>s</fact5> and the number of cups of water as <fact2>w</fact2>. According to the given ratio, we have <fact5>s/w = 147/96</fact5>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 1458, we can write the equation <fact5>s + w = 1458</fact5>. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of <fact5>s</fact5>. 

Multiplying both sides of the first equation by <fact2>w</fact2>, we get <fact5>s = (147/96)w</fact5>. Substituting this expression for <fact5>s</fact5> into the second equation, we get <fact2>w</fact2> + (147/96)<fact2>w</fact2> = 1458. Combining like terms, we get (96+147)<fact2>w</fact2>/96 = 1458.

If she used a total of <fact4>1056 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.

Answer: The ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> to <fact2>cups of water</fact2> is <fact3>26:7</fact3>. This means that for every 26 <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1>, there are 7 <fact2>cups of water</fact2>. Let's say the total number of parts in the ratio is 26 + 7 = 33. The total number of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact1> used is <fact4>1056</fact4>. Since the ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> to the total number of parts is 26/33, the number of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> used is (26/33) * <fact4>1056</fact4>.

If she used a total of <fact2>1455 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact2>, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
Answer: Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let <fact3>s</fact3> be the number of teaspoons of sugar and <fact4>w</fact4> be the number of cups of water. We know that <fact1>197</fact1> : <fact4>94</fact4> = <fact3>s</fact3> : <fact4>w</fact4>, so we can write <fact5>197w = 94s</fact5>. We are also given that <fact2>1455 = s + w</fact2>. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of <fact3>s</fact3>. Rearranging the second equation, we get <fact6>w = 1455 - s</fact6>. Substituting this into the first equation, we get <fact7>197(1455 - s) = 94s</fact7>. Expanding and simplifying, we get <fact8>288,095 - 197s = 94s</fact8>. Adding <fact9>197s</fact9> to both sides, we get <fact10>288,095 = 291s</fact10>. Dividing both sides by <fact11>291</fact11>, we get <fact12>s = 992</fact12>.

71x = 25352
x = 25352 / 71
x = 357

So, Zahra used 357 teaspoonfuls of sugar."

If she used a total of <fact4>697 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.

Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact5>s</fact5> and the number of cups of water as <fact2>w</fact2>. According to the ratio, we have <fact5>s</fact5> / <fact2>w</fact2> = <fact3>33/8</fact3>. Since the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 697, we have <fact5>s</fact5> + <fact2>w</fact2> = <fact4>697</fact4>. We can use the first equation to express <fact2>w</fact2> in terms of <fact5>s</fact5>: <fact2>w</fact2> = <fact5>s</fact5> * <fact3>8/33</fact3>. Substituting this expression into the second equation, we get <fact5>s</fact5> + <fact5>s</fact5> * <fact3>8/33</fact3> = <fact4>697</fact4>. Combining like terms, we have <fact5>s</fact5> * (1 + <fact3>8/33</fact3>) = <fact4>697</fact4>. Simplifying the left-hand side, we get <fact5>s</fact5> * <fact3>41/33</fact3> = <fact4>697</fact4>. Multiplying both sides by <fact3>33/41</fact3>, we get <fact5>s</fact5> = <fact4>697</fact4> * <fact3>33/41</fact3> = <fact6>549</fact6>.

If she used a total of <fact4>473 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water</fact4>, calculate the number of <fact5>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5> she used.
Answer: Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as <fact6>S</fact6> and the number of cups of water as <fact7>W</fact7>. We know that the ratio of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> to <fact2>cups of water</fact2> is <fact3>38:5</fact3>, so we can write the equation <fact6>S/W = 38/5</fact6>. We are also given that the total number of <fact1>teaspoons of sugar</fact1> and <fact2>cups of water</fact2> used is <fact4>473</fact4>, so we can write the equation <fact6>S + W = 473</fact6>. We can use these two equations to solve for <fact5>S</fact5>, the number of <fact1>teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact1> used. First, we can multiply both sides of the first equation by <fact7>W</fact7> to get <fact6>S = (38/5)W</fact6>. Then, we can substitute this expression for <fact6>S</fact6> into the second equation to get <fact7>(38/5)W + W = 473</fact7>. Combining like terms, we get <fact7>(43/5)W = 473</fact7>. Multiplying both sides by <fact8>5/43</fact8>, we get <fact7>W = 473 * (5/43) = 55</fact7>. Now that we know <fact7>W</fact7>, we can substitute this value back into the expression for <fact6>S</fact6> to get <fact6>S = (38/5)(55) = 418</fact6>. Therefore, Winnie used <fact5>418 teaspoonfuls of sugar</fact5>."

How many plums can <fact4>Yuki harvest within a year</fact4>?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many plums Yuki has in total. Since <fact1>Yuki has 35 square meters of plum field</fact1> and <fact2>there are 78 plums per square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the total number of plums as <fact1>35</fact1> * <fact2>78</fact2> = 2730 plums.
Since <fact3>Yuki can harvest his plums every 2 months</fact3>, we need to find out how many 2-month periods are there in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12/2 = 6 periods of 2 months in a year.
Therefore, Yuki can harvest <fact4>2730</fact4> plums / <fact3>6</fact3> periods = 455 plums per period.
Since there are 6 periods in a year, Yuki can harvest a total of 455 * 6 = 2730 plums within a year.
However, this is the number of plums Yuki can harvest per period, not the total number of plums he can harvest in a year. Since Yuki can harvest all the plums in his field every 2 months, the total number of plums he can harvest in a year is still <fact4>2730</fact4> plums.

334,Jamal has 25 hectares of pomegranate field. There are 36 pomegranates per hectare. Jamal can harvest his pomegranates every 4 months. How many pomegranates can Jamal harvest within a year?,"Reformatted Question: Jamal has <fact1>25 hectares of pomegranate field</fact1>. <fact2>There are 36 pomegranates per hectare</fact2>. Jamal can harvest his pomegranates every <fact3>4 months</fact3>. How many pomegranates can Jamal harvest within a year?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pomegranates Jamal has in total. Since <fact1>there are 36 pomegranates per hectare</fact1> and Jamal has <fact1>25 hectares of pomegranate field</fact1>, we can calculate the total number of pomegranates as <fact2>36 pomegranates/hectare</fact2> * <fact1>25 hectares</fact1> = 900 pomegranates.

Since Jamal can harvest his pomegranates every <fact3>4 months</fact3>, we need to find out how many 4-month periods are there in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we can divide 12 by 4 to get 3. This means that there are 3 four-month periods in a year.

Now, we can calculate the total number of pomegranates Jamal can harvest within a year by multiplying the total number of pomegranates by the number of four-month periods: <fact4>900 pomegranates</fact4> * <fact3>3 periods</fact3> = 2700 pomegranates.

However, this is not the correct answer because Jamal can only harvest the pomegranates that are mature enough to be picked. Since Jamal has 900 pomegranates in total, and he can harvest them every 4 months, he will harvest the pomegranates that are mature enough to be picked. Therefore, the correct answer is 900 pomegranates.

How many apricots can <fact4>Luis harvest within a year</fact4>?
Answer: Since <fact1>Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months</fact1>, he can harvest them twice within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months. 
First, we need to find out how many apricots <fact2>Luis has in total</fact2>. Since <fact1>he has 15 square yards of apricot field</fact1> and <fact2>there are 43 apricots per square yard</fact2>, he has <fact1>15</fact1> * <fact2>43</fact2> = 645 apricots in total.
Now, we need to find out how many apricots <fact3>Luis can harvest in 6 months</fact3>. Since he has 645 apricots in total and he can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest 645/2 = 322.5 apricots in 6 months. However, since he cannot harvest a fraction of an apricot, we can assume that he can harvest 322 apricots in 6 months.
Now, we can find out how many apricots <fact4>Luis can harvest within a year</fact4>. Since <fact3>Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months</fact3>, he can harvest 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months within a year.

350,"A farmer is buying feed for his alpacas. He buys a variety of apples, wheats, cucumbers and oats. Since oats are a rare treat, he only buys five 3-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough cucumbers to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys thirteen 6-kg bags. Apples are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty one 42-kg packs. Wheats are a staple to supplement the apples, so he buys fifteen 15-kg sacks.

He buys a variety of <fact1>apples</fact1>, <fact2>wheats</fact2>, <fact3>cucumbers</fact3>, and <fact4>oats</fact4>. Since <fact4>oats</fact4> are a rare treat, he only buys <fact5>five 3-kg boxes</fact5> of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough <fact3>cucumbers</fact3> to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact6>thirteen 6-kg bags</fact6>. <fact1>Apples</fact1> are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys <fact7>thirty one 42-kg packs</fact7>. <fact2>Wheats</fact2> are a staple to supplement the <fact1>apples</fact1>, so he buys <fact8> fifteen 15-kg sacks</fact8>. If his farm truck can carry <fact9>180 kgs at a time</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed. The total weight of <fact4>oats</fact4> is <fact5>5</fact5> * <fact5>3-kg</fact5> = 15 kg.
The total weight of <fact3>cucumbers</fact3> is <fact6>13</fact6> * <fact6>6-kg</fact6> = 78 kg.
The total weight of <fact1>apples</fact1> is <fact7>31</fact7> * <fact7>42-kg</fact7> = 1298 kg.
The total weight of <fact2>wheats</fact2> is <fact8>15</fact8> * <fact8>15-kg</fact8> = 225 kg.
The total weight of all the feed is 15 + 78 + 1298 + 225 = 1616 kg.
To find the number of trips, we need to divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry: 1616 / <fact9>180 kgs</fact9> = 8.98. Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the farmer needs to make <fact10>9</fact10> trips to transport all the feed.

Answer: The total weight of the oats is <fact6>four 4-pound boxes</fact6> * <fact4>4 pounds</fact4> = 16 pounds.
The total weight of the beets is <fact8>twelve 8-pound bags</fact8> * <fact3>8 pounds</fact3> = 96 pounds.
The total weight of the wheats is <fact10>thirty two 37-pound packs</fact10> * <fact9>37 pounds</fact9> = 1184 pounds.
The total weight of the hay is <fact12>nineteen 16-pound sacks</fact12> * <fact11>16 pounds</fact11> = 304 pounds.
So the total weight of all the feed is 16 + 96 + 1184 + 304 = 1600 pounds.

If his farm truck can carry <fact13>180 pounds at a time</fact13>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
Answer: To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the weight the truck can carry at a time. 

First, let's calculate the total weight of the oats. There are <fact6>seven 5-pound boxes of oats</fact6>, so the total weight of the oats is <fact6>7</fact6> * <fact6>5 pounds</fact6> = 35 pounds.

Next, let's calculate the total weight of the cucumbers. There are <fact8>thirteen 5-pound bags of cucumbers</fact8>, so the total weight of the cucumbers is <fact8>13</fact8> * <fact8>5 pounds</fact8> = 65 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the total weight of the corns. There are <fact10>thirty two 40-pound packs of corns</fact10>, so the total weight of the corns is <fact10>32</fact10> * <fact10>40 pounds</fact10> = 1280 pounds.

Finally, let's calculate the total weight of the apples. There are <fact12> fifteen 16-pound sacks of apples</fact12>, so the total weight of the apples is <fact12>15</fact12> * <fact12>16 pounds</fact12> = 240 pounds.

The total weight of all the feed is the sum of the weights of the oats, cucumbers, corns, and apples: 35 + 65 + 1280 + 240 = 1620 pounds.

Since the truck can carry <fact13>180 pounds at a time</fact13>, the farmer will need to make <fact13>1620/180</fact13> = 9 trips to transport all the feed."

If his farm truck can carry <fact13>100 kgs at a time</fact13>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then divide that by the weight the farm truck can carry at a time, which is <fact13>100 kgs</fact13>.
The total weight of <fact6>oats</fact6> is <fact6>six 3-kg boxes of oats</fact6> * <fact3>3 kg</fact3> = 18 kg.
The total weight of <fact8>carrots</fact8> is <fact8>eleven 5-kg bags of carrots</fact8> * <fact3>5 kg</fact3> = 55 kg.
The total weight of <fact10>corns</fact10> is <fact10>thirty three 35-kg packs of corns</fact10> * <fact3>35 kg</fact3> = 1155 kg.
The total weight of <fact12>apples</fact12> is <fact12>seventeen 16-kg sacks of apples</fact12> * <fact3>16 kg</fact3> = 272 kg.
The total weight of all the feed is 18 + 55 + 1155 + 272 = 1500 kg.
To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we divide the total weight of all the feed by the weight the farm truck can carry at a time, which is <fact13>100 kgs</fact13>. 1500 / 100 = 15.

If his farm truck can carry <fact9>230 pounds</fact9> at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To find the total weight of <fact4>oats</fact4>, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight of each box, which is <fact5>5</fact5> * <fact5>6 pounds</fact5> = 30 pounds. 
Similarly, to find the total weight of <fact3>carrots</fact3>, we multiply the number of bags by the weight of each bag, which is <fact6>13</fact6> * <fact6>7 pounds</fact6> = 91 pounds. 
To find the total weight of <fact1>wheats</fact1>, we multiply the number of packs by the weight of each pack, which is <fact7>31</fact7> * <fact7>37 pounds</fact7> = 1147 pounds. 
To find the total weight of <fact2>corns</fact2>, we multiply the number of sacks by the weight of each sack, which is <fact8>18</fact8> * <fact8>19 pounds</fact8> = 342 pounds. 
The total weight of all the feed is 30 + 91 + 1147 + 342 = 1610 pounds. 
To find the number of trips needed to transport all the feed, we divide the total weight by the weight the truck can carry, which is <fact9>1610 pounds</fact9> / <fact9>230 pounds</fact9> = 7. 
The answer is {7}."

If his farm truck can carry <fact13>200 pounds at a time</fact13>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed. The <fact6>five 4-pound boxes of wheats</fact6> weigh <fact6>5</fact6> * <fact6>4</fact6> = 20 pounds. The <fact8> fifteen 7-pound bags of beets</fact8> weigh <fact8>15</fact8> * <fact8>7</fact8> = 105 pounds. The <fact10> thirty five 41-pound packs of hay</fact10> weigh <fact10>35</fact10> * <fact10>41</fact10> = 1435 pounds. The <fact12> fifteen 16-pound sacks of corns</fact12> weigh <fact12>15</fact12> * <fact12>16</fact12> = 240 pounds. The total weight of all the feed is 20 + 105 + 1435 + 240 = 1800 pounds. Since the farm truck can carry <fact13>200 pounds at a time</fact13>, the farmer needs to make 1800/<fact13>200</fact13> = 9 trips to transport all the feed."

If his farm truck can carry <fact13>140 kgs at a time</fact13>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: To find the total weight of oats, we multiply the number of boxes by the weight per box: <fact6>6</fact6> * <fact6>7-kg</fact6> = 42 kg. 
To find the total weight of beets, we multiply the number of bags by the weight per bag: <fact8>13</fact8> * <fact8>6-kg</fact8> = 78 kg.
To find the total weight of hay, we multiply the number of packs by the weight per pack: <fact10>34</fact10> * <fact10>41-kg</fact10> = 1394 kg.
To find the total weight of wheats, we multiply the number of sacks by the weight per sack: <fact12>18</fact12> * <fact12>17-kg</fact12> = 306 kg.
The total weight of all the feed is the sum of the weights of oats, beets, hay, and wheats: 42 kg + 78 kg + 1394 kg + 306 kg = 1820 kg.
Since the farm truck can carry <fact13>140 kgs at a time</fact13>, the farmer needs to make <fact13>1820 kg</fact13> / <fact13>140 kg</fact13> = 13 trips to transport all the feed."

If his farm truck can carry <fact10>250 pounds at a time</fact10>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Answer: The total weight of the <fact6>hay</fact6> is <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact6>7</fact6> = 56 pounds.
The total weight of the <fact7>cucumbers</fact7> is <fact7>13</fact7> * <fact7>5</fact7> = 65 pounds.
The total weight of the <fact8>apples</fact8> is <fact8>33</fact8> * <fact8>39</fact8> = 1287 pounds.
The total weight of the <fact9>wheats</fact9> is <fact9>19</fact9> * <fact9>18</fact9> = 342 pounds.
The total weight of all the feed is 56 + 65 + 1287 + 342 = 1650 pounds.
Since the farmer's truck can carry <fact10>250</fact10> pounds at a time, he will need to make <fact10>250</fact10> / <fact11>1650</fact11> = 0.151 trips.
However, since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is <fact12>1</fact12> trip for the first 250 pounds, and then another <fact13>1650</fact13> - <fact10>250</fact10> = 1400 pounds in the second trip, which requires <fact14>1400</fact14> / <fact10>250</fact10> = 5.6 trips.
Again, since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is <fact15>6</fact15> trips for the second 1400 pounds.
Therefore, the farmer will need a total of <fact16>1</fact16> + <fact17>6</fact17> = 7 trips to transport all the feed."

If his <fact19>farm truck</fact19> can carry <fact20>110 kgs</fact20> at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
Answer: To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the weight his farm truck can carry at a time. 

The total weight of the <fact7>hay</fact7> is <fact7>seven 4-kg boxes</fact7> * <fact21>4 kg</fact21> = 28 kg.
The total weight of the <fact11>beets</fact11> is <fact11>eleven 6-kg bags</fact11> * <fact21>6 kg</fact21> = 66 kg.
The total weight of the <fact14>apples</fact14> is <fact14>thirty four 35-kg packs</fact14> * <fact21>35 kg</fact21> = 1190 kg.
The total weight of the <fact18>corns</fact18> is <fact18>sixteen 16-kg sacks</fact18> * <fact21>16 kg</fact21> = 256 kg.
The total weight of all the feed is 28 + 66 + 1190 + 256 = 1400 kg.
The farmer needs to make <fact20>110 kgs</fact20> trips to transport all the feed, so the total number of trips is 1400/<fact20>110</fact20> = 12.73 trips.
Since the farmer can't make a fraction of a trip, he needs to make 13 trips to transport all the feed."

The total weight of the <fact12>fifteen 18-kg sacks of oats</fact12> is <fact12>15</fact12> * <fact12>18</fact12> = 270 kg. The total weight of all the feed is 48 + 70 + 1292 + 270 = 1680 kg.

If he makes <fact5>8 giant cubes</fact5>, <fact6>24 small cubes</fact6>, and <fact7>13 medium cubes</fact7>, how many grams of water does he have left?

Answer: To find out how many grams of water Ravi has left, we need to find out how many grams of water he used to make the ice cubes. We can do this by multiplying the number of each type of cube by the amount of water each cube uses and then adding up the results.

First, let's find out how many grams of water Ravi used to make the <fact2>giant cubes</fact2>. Since each giant cube uses <fact2>13 grams</fact2> and he made <fact5>8 giant cubes</fact5>, the total amount of water used for the giant cubes is <fact5>8</fact5> * <fact2>13</fact2> = 104 grams.

Next, let's find out how many grams of water Ravi used to make the <fact6>small cubes</fact6>. Since each small cube uses <fact4>1/6 of a gram</fact4> and he made <fact6>24 small cubes</fact6>, the total amount of water used for the small cubes is <fact6>24</fact6> * <fact4>1/6</fact4> = 4 grams.

Finally, let's find out how many grams of water Ravi used to make the <fact7>medium cubes</fact7>. Since each medium cube uses <fact3>12 grams</fact3> and he made <fact7>13 medium cubes</fact7>, the total amount of water used for the medium cubes is <fact7>13</fact7> * <fact3>12</fact3> = 156 grams.

Now, let's add up the amount of water used for each type of cube to find the total amount of water used: 104 + 4 + 156 = 264 grams.

Since Ravi started with <fact1>340 grams of water</fact1> and used 264 grams to make the ice cubes, he has <fact1>340</fact1> - 264 = 76 grams of water left.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes. Since each giant cube uses <fact2>13 grams</fact2> of water, 8 giant cubes will use 8 * <fact2>13 grams</fact2> = <fact2>104 grams</fact2> of water.
Next, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the small cubes. Since each small cube uses <fact4>1/7 of a gram</fact4> of water, 14 small cubes will use 14 * <fact4>1/7 of a gram</fact4> = <fact4>2 grams</fact4> of water.
Finally, let's calculate the total amount of water used for the medium cubes. Since each medium cube uses <fact3>12 grams</fact3> of water, 14 medium cubes will use 14 * <fact3>12 grams</fact3> = <fact3>168 grams</fact3> of water.

If he makes <fact5>8 giant cubes</fact5>, <fact6>24 small cubes</fact6>, and <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7>, how many ounces of water does he have left?

Answer: To find out how many ounces of water Alejandro has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the giant, medium, and small cubes. 
The total amount of water used for the giant cubes is <fact2>13 ounces per cube</fact2> * <fact5>8 giant cubes</fact5> = 104 ounces.
The total amount of water used for the small cubes is <fact4>1/3 of an ounce</fact4> * <fact6>24 small cubes</fact6> = 8 ounces.
The total amount of water used for the medium cubes is <fact3>11 ounces</fact3> * <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7> = 132 ounces.
So, the total amount of water used is 104 + 8 + 132 = 244 ounces.
Therefore, Alejandro has <fact1>304 ounces of water</fact1> - 244 ounces = 60 ounces of water left."

He can make <fact2>giant cubes that use 13 grams per cube</fact2>, <fact3>medium cubes that use 11 grams</fact3>, and <fact4>small cubes that use 1/5 of a gram</fact4>. If he makes <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5>, <fact6>15 small cubes</fact6>, and <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7>, how many grams of water does he have left?
Answer: To find out how much water Luis has left, we need to calculate how much water he used to make the ice cubes. 

The amount of water used for the <fact2>giant cubes</fact2> is <fact2>13 grams per cube</fact2> * <fact5>9 giant cubes</fact5> = 117 grams.
The amount of water used for the <fact3>medium cubes</fact3> is <fact3>11 grams per cube</fact3> * <fact7>12 medium cubes</fact7> = 132 grams.
The amount of water used for the <fact4>small cubes</fact4> is <fact4>1/5 of a gram per cube</fact4> * <fact6>15 small cubes</fact6> = 3 grams.
The total amount of water used is 117 + 132 + 3 = 252 grams.
Since Luis started with <fact1>330 grams of water</fact1>, he has 330 - 252 = 78 grams of water left.

Since he has <fact3>316 almonds</fact3> and can only place 252 on the tables, he won't be able to place <fact3>316</fact3> - 252 = 64 almonds on the tables."

If <fact3>he has 326 bananas</fact3> and <fact4>8 baskets</fact4>, how many bananas won't he be able to place on the basket?
Answer: The total number of bananas that Andre can place in the 8 baskets is <fact4>8</fact4> * <fact2>20</fact2> = 160 bananas.
Since Andre has <fact3>326 bananas</fact3> and he can only place 160 bananas in the 8 baskets, he won't be able to place <fact3>326</fact3> - <fact5>160</fact5> = 166 bananas on the baskets.

If he has <fact2>313 crackers</fact2> and <fact3>7 trays</fact3>, how many crackers won't he be able to place on the tray?

Answer: First, let's calculate how many crackers Umar can place on the 7 trays. Since each tray can hold 26 crackers, the total number of crackers he can place is <fact3>7</fact3> * <fact1>26</fact1> = 182 crackers. However, Umar has <fact2>313</fact2> crackers, which is more than the number of crackers he can place on the trays. To find out how many crackers won't fit, we need to subtract the number of crackers that can fit from the total number of crackers.

If he has <fact3>259 cookies</fact3> and <fact4>12 bowls</fact4>, how many cookies won't he be able to place on the bowl?
Answer: The total number of cookies that Tariq can place on the bowls is <fact4>12</fact4> * <fact2>20</fact2> = 240 cookies. This is because each bowl can hold <fact2>20 cookies</fact2> and Tariq has <fact4>12 bowls</fact4>. Since Tariq has <fact3>259 cookies</fact3> and can only place 240 cookies on the bowls, the number of cookies that he won't be able to place on the bowl is <fact3>259</fact3> - <fact5>240</fact5> = 19 cookies.

Answer: To find the total number of cookies that Viktor can place on the bowls, we first need to find the total capacity of the bowls. Since each bowl can hold <fact2>23 cookies</fact2> and there are <fact4>7 bowls</fact4>, the total capacity of the bowls is <fact2>23 cookies</fact2> * <fact4>7 bowls</fact4> = 161 cookies. Since Viktor has <fact3>286 cookies</fact3> and the bowls can only hold 161 cookies, the number of cookies that won't fit on the bowls is <fact3>286 cookies</fact3> - 161 cookies = 125 cookies.

If he has <fact2>326 almonds</fact2> and <fact3>7 tables</fact3>, how many almonds won't he be able to place on the table?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of almonds that can be placed on all the tables. Since each table can hold <fact1>34 almonds</fact1> and there are <fact3>7 tables</fact3>, the total number of almonds that can be placed is <fact1>34</fact1> * <fact3>7</fact3> = 238 almonds.
Now, let's compare this to the total number of almonds that Bodhi has, which is <fact2>326 almonds</fact2>. Since he has more almonds than the tables can hold, he won't be able to place all of them on the tables.
The number of almonds that he won't be able to place is the difference between the total number of almonds he has and the total number of almonds that can be placed on the tables. This is <fact2>326</fact2> - <fact1>238</fact1> = 88 almonds.

Answer: First, let's find out how many bananas can be placed on the <fact4>7 baskets</fact4> in total. Since each basket can hold <fact2>21 bananas</fact2>, we can multiply the number of baskets by the number of bananas each basket can hold. So, the total number of bananas that can be placed on the 7 baskets is <fact4>7</fact4> * <fact2>21</fact2> = 147 bananas.
Since Ibrahim has <fact3>245 bananas</fact3> and the 7 baskets can only hold 147 bananas, he won't be able to place <fact3>245</fact3> - <fact4>147</fact4> = 98 bananas on the baskets."

If <fact3>he has 327 crackers</fact3> and <fact4>8 trays</fact4>, how many crackers won't he be able to place on the tray?
Answer: Esteban has <fact3>327</fact3> crackers in total. Each tray can hold <fact2>34</fact2> crackers. So, the total number of crackers that Esteban can place on the trays is <fact3>327</fact3> / <fact2>34</fact2> = 9.62. Since Esteban can't place a fraction of a cracker on a tray, he can place crackers on <fact4>8</fact4> trays, which is the number of trays he has. This means he can place crackers on 8 trays, which can hold a total of <fact2>34</fact2> * <fact4>8</fact4> = 272 crackers.

Answer: Elena originally had <fact2>11 potted plants</fact2> on each of the <fact2>66 window ledges</fact2> of her home. So, she had a total of <fact2>11</fact2> * <fact2>66</fact2> = 726 potted plants.
She also received <fact1>24 new potted plants</fact1> from the nursery.
Therefore, she had a total of 726 + 24 = 750 potted plants.
However, she decided to give away <fact3>5 potted plants from each ledge</fact3> tomorrow. There are <fact2>66 window ledges</fact2> in her home. So, she will give away a total of <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact2>66</fact2> = 330 potted plants.
After giving away the 330 potted plants, she will be left with 750 - 330 = 420 potted plants.

Next, we need to find the total number of puppies that have spots. We can do this by adding the number of puppies that have spots that Alejandro's dog has to the number of puppies that have spots that Mia's dog has: <fact2>260</fact2> + <fact4>130</fact4> = 390 puppies.
Finally, we can find the percentage of puppies that have spots by dividing the number of puppies that have spots by the total number of puppies and multiplying by 100: (<fact2>260</fact2> + <fact4>130</fact4>) / (<fact1>960</fact1> + <fact3>600</fact3>) * 100 = 390 / 1560 * 100 = 25%.

If <fact5>the brownie cost $9</fact5> and <fact6>the pear pie cost $28</fact6>, how much did Ibrahim earn for two days?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many boxes of brownie and pear pie Ibrahim sold on Monday. 
On Monday, he sold <fact3>13 more boxes of brownies than on Sunday</fact3>, so he sold <fact1>21</fact1> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 34 boxes of brownie. 
On Monday, he sold <fact4>22 boxes of pear pie</fact4>. 
We are given that he sold <fact2>14 fewer boxes of pear pie on Sunday than on Monday</fact2>, so he sold <fact4>22</fact4> - <fact2>14</fact2> = 8 boxes of pear pie on Sunday. 
In total, he sold 34 + 22 = 56 boxes of brownie and 8 + 22 = 30 boxes of pear pie over the two days. 
He earned <fact5>$9</fact5> per box of brownie, so he earned 56 * <fact5>$9</fact5> = $504 from the brownie. 
He earned <fact6>$28</fact6> per box of pear pie, so he earned 30 * <fact6>$28</fact6> = $840 from the pear pie. 
Therefore, he earned a total of $504 + $840 = $1344."

The total number of boxes of watermelon pie Jin sold is <fact2>10</fact2> + <fact4>28</fact4> = 38 boxes.
The total amount Jin earned from muffin is <fact5>₺12</fact5> * <fact1>60</fact1> = ₺720.
The total amount Jin earned from watermelon pie is <fact6>₺31</fact6> * <fact2>38</fact2> = ₺1178.
Therefore, the total amount Jin earned for two days is ₺720 + ₺1178 = ₺1898.

Answer: On <fact2>Friday</fact2>, Ravi sold <fact3>28 boxes of brownie</fact3> and <fact4>17 fewer boxes of kiwi pie, than on Saturday</fact4>. Since <fact4>17 fewer boxes of kiwi pie, than on Saturday</fact4> means that Ravi sold <fact7>27</fact7> - <fact4>17</fact4> = 10 boxes of kiwi pie on <fact2>Friday</fact2>. 
So, on <fact2>Friday</fact2>, Ravi earned <fact3>28 boxes of brownie</fact3> * <fact8>₺9</fact8> = ₺252 from brownie and <fact4>10 boxes of kiwi pie</fact4> * <fact9>₺24</fact9> = ₺240 from kiwi pie. Therefore, on <fact2>Friday</fact2>, Ravi earned a total of ₺252 + ₺240 = ₺492.

So, on <fact5>Saturday</fact5>, Ravi earned <fact6>12 more boxes of brownies than on Friday</fact6> * <fact8>₺9</fact8> = 40 * ₺9 = ₺360 from brownie and <fact7>27 boxes of kiwi pie</fact7> * <fact9>₺24</fact9> = ₺648 from kiwi pie. Therefore, on <fact5>Saturday</fact5>, Ravi earned a total of ₺360 + ₺648 = ₺1008.

Answer: We know that Oscar sold <fact1>11 fewer boxes of apple pie</fact1> on Tuesday than on Wednesday. Since he sold <fact4>23 boxes of apple pie</fact4> on Wednesday, he sold <fact2>23-11=12</fact2> boxes of apple pie on Tuesday.
We also know that Oscar sold <fact3>14 more boxes of cupcakes</fact3> on Wednesday than on Tuesday. Since he sold <fact1>22 boxes of cupcake</fact1> on Tuesday, he sold <fact4>22+14=36</fact4> boxes of cupcakes on Wednesday.
Now, we can calculate the total number of boxes of cupcakes and apple pies sold over the two days: <fact1>22+36=58</fact1> boxes of cupcakes and <fact2>12+23=35</fact2> boxes of apple pies.
We know that the <fact5>cupcake cost €11</fact5> and the <fact6>apple pie cost €20</fact6>.

If <fact6>the cupcake cost ₣9</fact6> and <fact7>the grape pie cost ₣23</fact7>, how much did <fact8>Ibrahim earn for two days</fact8>?
Answer: On <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 boxes of cupcake</fact2> and <fact3>19 fewer boxes of grape pie, than on Friday</fact3>. So on <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 - <fact3>19</fact3> = 7 boxes of grape pie.
On <fact4>Friday, he sold 13 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday</fact4> and <fact5>28 boxes of grape pie</fact5>. So on <fact4>Friday, he sold 26 + <fact4>13</fact4> = 39 boxes of cupcake.

If the <fact5>muffin cost ₺12</fact5> and the <fact6>banana pie cost ₺32</fact6>, how much did Thiago earn for two days?
Answer: Thiago sold <fact1>25 boxes of muffin</fact1> on Saturday. On Sunday, he sold <fact3>14 more boxes of muffins than on Saturday</fact3>, so he sold 25 + 14 = 39 boxes of muffin on Sunday. Therefore, Thiago sold a total of 25 + 39 = 64 boxes of muffin. He sold <fact2>11 fewer boxes of banana pie, than on Sunday</fact2> on Saturday, so he sold 25 - 11 = 14 boxes of banana pie on Saturday. On Sunday, he sold <fact4>25 boxes of banana pie</fact4>. Therefore, Thiago sold a total of 14 + 25 = 39 boxes of banana pie. Thiago earned <fact5>₺12</fact5> per box of muffin, so he earned 64 * 12 = ₺768 from muffin. Thiago earned <fact6>₺32</fact6> per box of banana pie, so he earned 39 * 32 = ₺1248 from banana pie. Therefore, Thiago earned a total of ₺768 + ₺1248 = ₺2016 for two days."

Answer: On <fact2>Saturday</fact2>, Pavel sold <fact3>22 boxes of cupcake</fact3> and <fact4>13 fewer boxes of plum pie</fact4> than on <fact5>Sunday</fact5>. This means that on <fact5>Sunday</fact5>, he sold <fact3>22</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> = 35 boxes of cupcake. He also sold <fact8>22 boxes of plum pie</fact8> on <fact6>Sunday</fact6>. To find out how many boxes of cupcake and plum pie he sold on <fact2>Saturday</fact2>, we need to subtract 11 from the number of cupcake boxes he sold on <fact6>Sunday</fact6> and subtract 13 from the number of plum pie boxes he sold on <fact6>Sunday</fact6>. So, on <fact2>Saturday</fact2>, he sold <fact3>22</fact3> - <fact7>11</fact7> = 11 boxes of cupcake and <fact8>22</fact8> - <fact4>13</fact4> = 9 boxes of plum pie. The total number of cupcake boxes he sold over the two days is 11 + 35 = 46. The total number of plum pie boxes he sold over the two days is 9 + 22 = 31. Pavel earned <fact9>$7</fact9> per cupcake and <fact10>$27</fact10> per plum pie. So, he earned 46 * <fact9>$7</fact9> + 31 * <fact10>$27</fact10> = $322 + $837 = $1159 for two days.

Answer: On <fact1>Tuesday</fact1>, Yusuf sold <fact1>23 boxes</fact1> of muffin and <fact2>16 fewer boxes</fact2> of watermelon pie than on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>. This means he sold <fact4>23 - 16 = 7 boxes</fact4> of watermelon pie on <fact1>Tuesday</fact1>. 
On <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>, Yusuf sold <fact1>23 + 12 = 35 boxes</fact1> of muffin and <fact4>24 boxes</fact4> of watermelon pie.
So, the total number of boxes sold on <fact1>Tuesday</fact1> is <fact1>23 + 7 = 30 boxes</fact1> and the total number of boxes sold on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3> is <fact1>35 + 24 = 59 boxes</fact1>.

If the <fact5>brownie cost ₣7</fact5> and the <fact6>plum pie cost ₣23</fact6>, how much did Qasim earn for two days?
Answer: Let's start by figuring out how many boxes of brownies Qasim sold on Friday. Since he sold <fact3>12 more boxes of brownies than on Thursday</fact3> and <fact1>21 boxes of brownie on Thursday</fact1>, he sold 21 + 12 = 33 boxes of brownies on Friday.
Since Qasim sold <fact2>17 fewer boxes of plum pie, than on Friday</fact2> on Thursday, and <fact4>28 boxes of plum pie on Friday</fact4>, he sold 28 - 17 = 11 boxes of plum pie on Thursday.
Now we can calculate the total amount Qasim earned on Thursday. He sold 21 boxes of brownies at <fact5>₣7 each</fact5>, so he earned 21 * 7 = ₣147 from brownies on Thursday. He sold 11 boxes of plum pie at <fact6>₣23 each</fact6>, so he earned 11 * 23 = ₣253 from plum pie on Thursday. In total, Qasim earned ₣147 + ₣253 = ₣400 on Thursday.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>24-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time it takes for Mia to walk 12 kilometers on the beach as <fact7>t minutes</fact7>. Since she walks at a constant speed, the time it takes for her to walk 12 kilometers on the sidewalk is <fact8>2t minutes</fact8>, because she walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach.

On the sidewalk, Daphne walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Daphne walks <fact1>28 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>16 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Daphne walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time spent on the beach as t1 and the time spent on the sidewalk as t2. We know that t1 + t2 = total time spent walking, which we need to find. We also know that <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so t1 = 64 minutes. We can use the formula distance = speed * time to relate the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk to the distance walked on each. On the beach, the distance is <fact2>16 kilometers</fact2> and the speed is x, so the time spent on the beach is t1 = 16/x. On the sidewalk, the distance is <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> and the speed is 3x, so the time spent on the sidewalk is t2 = 12/(3x) = 4/x. We can now use the fact that t1 + t2 = total time spent walking to find the total time. Substituting the expressions for t1 and t2, we get 16/x + 4/x = total time. We know that the total distance walked is <fact1>28 kilometers</fact1>, so we can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the total time. Since the speed is x, we have 28 = x * total time. We can now solve for the total time. First, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x to get 28x = x^2 * total time. Then, we can divide both sides by x^2 to get 28/x = total time. Now, we can substitute this expression for the total time into the equation 16/x + 4/x = total time to get 16/x + 4/x = 28/x. We can now multiply both sides of the equation by x to get 16 + 4 = 28. This is a true statement, so we know that the expression 16/x + 4/x = 28/x is also true. Now, we can multiply both sides of the equation by x to get 20 = 28. This is not true, so we made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and look at our work. We can see that the mistake was when we substituted the expression for the total time into the equation 16/x + 4/x = total time. We should have multiplied both sides of the equation by x^2 instead of x. This would have given us 16x + 4x = 28x^2. We can now divide both sides of the equation by x to get 20 = 28x. We can now divide both sides of the equation by 28 to get x = 20/28 = 5/7. We can now substitute this expression for x into the equation t1 = 16/x to get t1 = 16/(5/7) = 16 * 7/5 = 112/5 minutes. We can now substitute this expression for t1 into the equation t1 + t2 = total time to get 112/5 + t2 = total time. We can now substitute the expression for the total time into this equation to get 112/5 + t2 = 28/x. We can now substitute the expression for x into this equation to get 112/5 + t2 = 28/(5/7). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 5/7 to get (112/5)*(5/7) + t2*(5/7) = 28. We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 7/5 to get 112 + t2 = 28*(7/5). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 5/7 to get (112 + t2)*(5/7) = 28. We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 7/5 to get 112*(7/5) + t2*(7/5) = 28*(7/5). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 5/7 to get (112*(7/5) + t2*(7/5))*(5/7) = 28*(7/5)*(5/7). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 7/5 to get 112*(7/5)*(5/7) + t2*(7/5)*(5/7) = 28*(7/5)*(5/7). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 7/5 to get (112*(7/5)*(5/7) + t2*(7/5)*(5/7))*(5/7) = 28*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 7/5 to get 112*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7) + t2*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7) = 28*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 7/5 to get (112*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7) + t2*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7))*(5/7) = 28*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7)*(5/7). We can now multiply both sides of the equation by 7/5 to get 112*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7)*(5/7) + t2*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7)*(5/7) = 28*(7/5)*(5/7)*(5/7)*(5/7).

852,"Nadia walks 26 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 10 kilometers of walking on the beach and 16 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Nadia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Nadia walks 26 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail</fact1>, which includes <fact2>10 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>16 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Nadia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>26-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Nadia spends on the beach as t minutes. Since she walks at a constant speed on the beach, the distance she covers on the beach is directly proportional to the time she spends there. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach, we can set up the equation 10 = kt, where k is Nadia's speed on the beach. We are given that t = 60 minutes, so we can solve for k: k = 10/60 = 1/6 km/min. Now, we can find Nadia's speed on the sidewalk. Since she walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 4k = 4(1/6) = 2/3 km/min. The time she spends on the sidewalk is 26 - 10 = 16 kilometers / (2/3 km/min) = 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time Nadia takes to complete the entire 26-kilometer walk is 60 + 24 = 84 minutes."
853,"Gabrielle walks 35 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 19 miles of walking on the beach and 16 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Gabrielle walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 35-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Gabrielle walks <fact1>35 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>19 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>16 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Gabrielle walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>35-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Gabrielle spends walking on the beach as <fact7>t</fact7> minutes. Then, the time she spends walking on the sidewalk is <fact8>57 minutes</fact8> - <fact7>t</fact7> minutes.
Since Gabrielle walks at a constant rate, the distance she covers on the beach is directly proportional to the time she spends walking on the beach. Therefore, the distance she covers on the beach is <fact9>19 miles</fact9> = <fact7>t</fact7> * <fact10>rate on the beach</fact10> miles per minute. Similarly, the distance she covers on the sidewalk is <fact11>16 miles</fact11> = (<fact8>57 minutes</fact8> - <fact7>t</fact7>) * <fact12>2 * rate on the beach</fact12> miles per minute.
Since the rate of speed is constant, we can equate the two expressions and solve for <fact7>t</fact7>:
<fact9>19 miles</fact9> = <fact7>t</fact7> * <fact10>rate on the beach</fact10> miles per minute
<fact11>16 miles</fact11> = (<fact8>57 minutes</fact8> - <fact7>t</fact7>) * <fact12>2 * rate on the beach</fact12> miles per minute
Simplifying the second equation, we get:
<fact11>16 miles</fact11> = <fact8>57 minutes</fact8> * <fact12>2 * rate on the beach</fact12> - <fact7>t</fact7> * <fact12>2 * rate on the beach</fact12>
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
<fact11>16 miles</fact11> - <fact9>19 miles</fact9> = <fact8>57 minutes</fact8> * <fact12>2 * rate on the beach</fact12> - <fact7>t</fact7> * <fact10>rate on the beach</fact10> - <fact7>t</fact7> * <fact12>2 * rate on the beach</fact12>
Simplifying the equation, we get:
-3 miles = (57 minutes - 3t) * 2 * rate on the beach - t * rate on the beach
Simplifying further, we get:
-3 miles = 114 minutes * rate on the beach - 3t * rate on the beach - t * rate on the beach
Simplifying further, we get:
-3 miles = 114 minutes * rate on the beach - 4t * rate on the beach
Dividing both sides by -4, we get:
0.75 miles = 28.5 minutes * rate on the beach - t * rate on the beach
Now, we can solve for <fact7>t</fact7>:
<fact7>t</fact7> = 28.5 minutes * rate on the beach - 0.75 miles / rate on the beach
Since we don't know the rate on the beach, we can use the fact that the distance is directly proportional to the time. Therefore, we can set up a proportion:
<fact9>19 miles</fact9> / <fact7>t</fact7> = <fact10>rate on the beach</fact10> / 1 minute
Substituting the expression for <fact7>t</fact7> from above, we get:
<fact9>19 miles</fact9> / (28.5 minutes * rate on the beach - 0.75 miles / rate on the beach) = <fact10>rate on the beach</fact10> / 1 minute
Simplifying the equation, we get:
<fact9>19 miles</fact9> = 28.5 minutes * rate on the beach^2 - 0.75 miles / rate on the beach
Multiplying both sides by rate on the beach, we get:
<fact9>19 miles</fact9> * rate on the beach = 28.5 minutes * rate on the beach^3 - 0.75 miles
Simplifying the equation, we get:
<fact9>19 miles</fact9> * rate on the beach - 0.75 miles = 28.5 minutes * rate on the beach^3
Rearranging the equation, we get:
28.5 minutes * rate on the beach^3 - <fact9>19 miles</fact9> * rate on the beach = -0.75 miles
Dividing both sides by 28.5 minutes, we get:
rate on the beach^3 - (<fact9>19 miles</fact9> / 28.5 minutes) * rate on the beach = -0.75 miles / 28.5 minutes
Substituting the expression for <fact9>19 miles</fact9> from above, we get:
rate on the beach^3 - (0.6667 miles / minute) * rate on the beach = -0.0263 miles / minute
Substituting the expression for <fact9>19 miles</fact9> from above, we get:
rate on the beach^3 - (0.6667 miles / minute) * rate on the beach = -0.0263 miles / minute
Dividing both sides by -0.0263 miles / minute, we get:
-38.5 = rate on the beach^2
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
-6.2 = rate on the beach
Since the rate on the beach cannot be negative, we take the positive square root:
rate on the beach = 6.2 miles / minute
Now that we have the rate on the beach, we can find the time it takes for Gabrielle to complete the entire 35-mile walk:
<fact13>time</fact13> = <fact6>35 miles</fact6> / <fact10>rate on the beach</fact10>
Substituting the expression for <fact10>rate on the beach</fact10> from above, we get:
<fact13>time</fact13> = <fact6>35 miles</fact6> / 6.2 miles / minute
Simplifying the equation, we get:
<fact13>time</fact13> = 5.65 minutes
Therefore, it takes Gabrielle approximately 5.65 minutes to complete the entire 35-mile walk.
The answer is {565}."

On the sidewalk, Xena walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 21-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Xena walks <fact1>21 miles</fact1> every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 miles</fact2> of walking on the beach and <fact3>10 miles</fact3> of walking on the sidewalk.

If <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>21-mile</fact1> walk, in minutes?
Answer: Since <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> of Xena's walk is spent on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk is <fact1>21 miles</fact1> - <fact2>11 miles</fact2> = 10 miles, and <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> * <fact6>10 miles</fact6> / <fact2>11 miles</fact2> = 40 minutes.
Since Xena walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> / 2 = 22 minutes.
Therefore, the total time it takes for Xena to complete the entire 21-mile walk is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> + 22 minutes + 40 minutes = 106 minutes.

If <fact5>55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>29-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Quinn walks <fact2>11 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>18 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. The total distance she walks is <fact1>29 kilometers</fact1>, so she walks <fact2>11</fact2>/<fact1>29</fact1> = 11/29 of her walk on the beach and <fact3>18</fact3>/<fact1>29</fact1> = 18/29 of her walk on the sidewalk.
Quinn's speed on the beach is <fact5>11 kilometers</fact5> / <fact5>55 minutes</fact5> = 11/55 kilometers per minute.
Quinn's speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>two times</fact4> her speed on the beach, so it is 2 * (11/55) = 22/55 kilometers per minute.
Quinn walks <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> on the beach at a speed of <fact5>11/55 kilometers per minute</fact5>, so she spends <fact5>11</fact5> / (<fact5>11</fact5>/<fact5>55</fact5>) = 55 minutes walking on the beach.
Quinn walks <fact3>18 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk at a speed of <fact4>22/55 kilometers per minute</fact4>, so she spends <fact3>18</fact3> / (<fact3>22</fact3>/<fact5>55</fact5>) = 90 minutes walking on the sidewalk.
The total time it takes Quinn to complete her walk is the sum of the time she spends walking on the beach and the time she spends walking on the sidewalk, which is 55 + 90 = 145 minutes.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>32-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: We know that Valeria walks <fact2>15 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. Let's denote the speed of Valeria on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, the time she spends on the beach is <fact2>15/x</fact2> minutes. Since <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can write the equation <fact2>15/x</fact2> = 60. Solving for x, we get x = 15/60 = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Now, we know that Valeria walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, so her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2*0.25 = 0.5 kilometers per minute. The time she spends on the sidewalk is <fact3>17/0.5</fact3> = 34 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk is <fact5>60</fact5> + <fact3>34</fact3> = 94 minutes."

On the sidewalk, Leilani walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 25-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Leilani walks <fact1>25 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>14 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>11 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Leilani walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time spent walking on the beach as t minutes. Since Leilani walks at a constant speed on the beach, she covers <fact2>14 miles</fact2> in t minutes. This means that her speed on the beach is <fact2>14 miles</fact2>/t miles per minute.
According to <fact4>the information in the question</fact4>, Leilani walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach. This means that her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * <fact2>14 miles</fact2>/t miles per minute = <fact3>28 miles</fact3>/t miles per minute.
Since Leilani covers <fact3>11 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is <fact3>11 miles</fact3>/(<fact3>28 miles</fact3>/t) = <fact3>11t</fact3>/28 minutes.
The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk, which is t + <fact3>11t</fact3>/28 minutes.
According to <fact5>the information in the question</fact5>, the total time spent walking is <fact5>56 minutes</fact5>. Therefore, we can set up the equation t + <fact3>11t</fact3>/28 = <fact5>56 minutes</fact5>.
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 28, we get 28t + 11t = 28 * <fact5>56 minutes</fact5> = 1568 minutes.
Combining like terms, we get 39t = 1568 minutes.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 39, we get t = 1568/39 = 40.205 minutes.
Since t is the time spent walking on the beach, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is <fact3>11t</fact3>/28 = <fact3>11</fact3> * 40.205/28 = 15.01 minutes.
The total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk, which is t + <fact3>11t</fact3>/28 = 40.205 + 15.01 = 55.22 minutes.

If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Chen spends <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> on the beach, we can determine her rate of speed on the beach. We know that <fact2>13 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> took <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>, so we can find her rate of speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> = <fact6>1 mile / 4 minutes</fact6> (this is her rate of speed on the beach). Since Chen walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the beach</fact4> on the sidewalk, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is <fact6>1 mile / 2 minutes</fact6>.

If 68 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 34-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Sophia walks <fact1>34 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>17 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>17 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Sophia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>68 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>34-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Sophia spends on the beach as t1 and the time she spends on the sidewalk as t2. We know that t1 + t2 = 60 minutes (since the total time is 60 minutes), and t1 = 68 minutes. We can substitute t1 into the first equation to get 68 + t2 = 60, which implies t2 = -8 minutes. However, since time cannot be negative, we know that the previous equation is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the information. We know that Sophia walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. This means that she covers the same distance in half the time on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. Therefore, the time she spends on the sidewalk is half the time she spends on the beach. Since t1 = 68 minutes, t2 = 68/2 = 34 minutes. Now we can find the total time by adding t1 and t2: 68 + 34 = 102 minutes."

On the sidewalk, Fatima walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 25-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Fatima walks <fact1>25 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>12 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>13 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Fatima walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed of Fatima on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute. Since Fatima walks 12 miles on the beach, it will take her 12/x minutes to walk on the beach. We know that this time is equal to 48 minutes, so we can write the equation: 12/x = 48. Solving for x, we get x = 12/48 = 1/4 miles per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes for Fatima to walk 13 miles on the sidewalk: 13/(2x) = 13/(2*(1/4)) = 13/0.5 = 26 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes for Fatima to complete the entire 25-mile walk is 48 + 26 = 74 minutes.

861,"Zahra walks 30 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 15 miles of walking on the beach and 15 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Zahra walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Zahra walks <fact1>30 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>15 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Zahra walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>30-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Zahra walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, the speed at which she walks on the sidewalk is 2x miles per minute.
Since Zahra walks <fact2>15 miles of the beach</fact2> at a speed of x miles per minute, it takes her <fact2>15</fact2> / x minutes to walk on the beach. We are given that <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so we can set up the equation:
<fact2>15</fact2> / x = <fact5>60</fact5>
Solving for x, we get:
x = <fact2>15</fact2> / <fact5>60</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute.
Now, we know that Zahra walks on the sidewalk at a speed of 2x = 2(0.25) = 0.5 miles per minute. The distance she walks on the sidewalk is <fact3>15 miles</fact3>, so it takes her <fact3>15</fact3> / 0.5 = 30 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.
The total time it takes for Zahra to complete the entire 30-mile walk is the sum of the time spent walking on the beach and the time spent walking on the sidewalk:
<fact2>15</fact2> / x + <fact3>15</fact3> / 0.5
Substituting the value of x, we get:
<fact2>15</fact2> / 0.25 + <fact3>15</fact3> / 0.5
= 60 + 30
= 90 minutes.
The answer is {90}."
862,"Sophia walks 23 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 11 miles of walking on the beach and 12 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Sophia walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 23-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Sophia walks <fact1>23 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Sophia walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>55 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>23-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Sophia walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, the speed at which Sophia walks on the sidewalk is 3x miles per minute (since she walks at three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4>).
Since Sophia walks <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> at a speed of x miles per minute, it will take her <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / x miles per minute = 11/x minutes to walk on the beach. We are given that this time is equal to <fact5>55 minutes</fact5>, so we can set up the equation 11/x = 55 and solve for x. Multiplying both sides by x, we get 11 = 55x. Dividing both sides by 55, we get x = 11/55 miles per minute.
Now that we know Sophia's speed on the beach, we can find her speed on the sidewalk, which is 3x = 3(11/55) = 33/55 miles per minute.
Since Sophia walks <fact3>12 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 33/55 miles per minute, it will take her <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / (33/55) miles per minute = 12(55/33) = 220/33 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.
To find the total time it takes Sophia to complete the entire 23-mile walk, we add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. The total time is 55 minutes (walking on the beach) + 220/33 minutes (walking on the sidewalk) = 55 + 220/33 minutes.
To add these two times, we need to find a common denominator, which is 33. So, we can rewrite 55 minutes as 55(33/33) = 1815/33 minutes. Now we can add: 1815/33 + 220/33 = 2035/33 minutes.
To convert this to minutes, we can divide by 33: 2035/33 ≈ 61.67 minutes.
Therefore, it takes Sophia approximately 61.67 minutes to complete the entire 23-mile walk."
863,"Beatriz walks 28 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 18 miles of walking on the beach and 10 miles of walking on the sidewalk.

If 54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Beatriz walks 28 miles every day on her favorite walking trail</fact1>, which includes <fact2>18 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>10 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. <fact4>On the sidewalk, Beatriz walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>28-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's start by using the information that <fact5>54 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. This means that Beatriz walks on the beach for <fact5>54 minutes</fact5> and the total distance of the beach walk is <fact2>18 miles</fact2>. Since she walks at a constant rate, we can find her rate of speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: <fact2>18 miles</fact2> / <fact5>54 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>18/54</fact2> miles per minute. Now that we have her rate of speed on the beach, we can use it to find the time it takes for her to walk on the sidewalk. Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is <fact2>2 * (18/54)</fact2> miles per minute. We can use this rate of speed to find the time it takes for her to walk the <fact3>10 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk: <fact3>10 miles</fact3> / (<fact2>2 * (18/54)</fact2> miles per minute) = <fact3>10 / (2 * 18/54)</fact3> minutes. We can simplify this expression by first finding the common denominator for the fraction 2 * 18/54, which is 54. So, <fact3>10 / (2 * 18/54)</fact3> = <fact3>10 / (36/54)</fact3> = <fact3>10 * (54/36)</fact3> = <fact3>10 * 1.5</fact3> = <fact3>15</fact3> minutes. Therefore, it takes Beatriz <fact3>15 minutes</fact3> to walk on the sidewalk. Now that we have the times for both the beach walk and the sidewalk walk, we can add them together to find the total time it takes for Beatriz to complete the entire <fact6>28-mile walk</fact6>. The total time is <fact5>54 minutes</fact5> + <fact3>15 minutes</fact3> = <fact5>54 + 15</fact5> = <fact5>69</fact5> minutes.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Since Priya walks <fact2>10 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can determine her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: <fact2>10 miles</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>10/60</fact2> miles per minute. 
Since Priya walks at three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>3 * (10/60)</fact4> miles per minute = <fact4>3/6</fact4> miles per minute = <fact4>1/2</fact4> miles per minute. 
We can now calculate the time it takes for her to walk <fact3>13 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> by dividing the distance by her speed: <fact3>13 miles</fact3> / <fact4>1/2 miles per minute</fact4> = <fact3>13 * 2</fact3> minutes = <fact3>26 minutes</fact3>. 
Since Priya walks <fact1>23 miles every day</fact1> and we have already calculated that she spends <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> walking on the beach and <fact3>26 minutes</fact3> walking on the sidewalk, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact1>23-mile walk</fact1> is <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> + <fact3>26 minutes</fact3> = <fact6>86 minutes</fact6>.

If <fact5>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>28-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: We are given that <fact2>13 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> takes <fact5>65 minutes</fact5>. Since <fact1>Nia walks 28 miles every day</fact1>, we can calculate her speed on the beach as <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> = 0.2 miles/minute.

If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since <fact2>13 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> is a fraction of the total <fact6>31-kilometer walk</fact6>, we can determine the fraction of the total walk that is spent on the beach. This fraction is <fact2>13 kilometers</fact2>/<fact6>31 kilometers</fact6> = 13/31.
Since <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can set up a proportion to find the total time it takes to complete the entire walk. The proportion is <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>/<fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> = <fact7>total time</fact7>/<fact6>31 kilometers</fact6>. Solving for <fact7>total time</fact7>, we get <fact7>total time</fact7> = <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>*<fact6>31 kilometers</fact6>/<fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> = 104 minutes.
However, this is the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk. Since <fact4>Camila walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the time spent on the sidewalk is half the time spent on the beach. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>/2 = 26 minutes.
The total time spent on the beach and the sidewalk is <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> + <fact8>26 minutes</fact8> = 78 minutes.
Since the total walk is 31 kilometers, and <fact2>18 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact2> is a fraction of the total walk, we can determine the fraction of the total walk that is spent on the sidewalk. This fraction is <fact2>18 kilometers</fact2>/<fact6>31 kilometers</fact6> = 18/31.
Since the time spent on the sidewalk is <fact8>26 minutes</fact8>, we can set up a proportion to find the total time it takes to complete the entire walk. The proportion is <fact8>26 minutes</fact8>/<fact2>18 kilometers</fact2> = <fact7>total time</fact7>/<fact6>31 kilometers</fact6>. Solving for <fact7>total time</fact7>, we get <fact7>total time</fact7> = <fact8>26 minutes</fact8>*<fact6>31 kilometers</fact6>/<fact2>18 kilometers</fact2> = 44.33 minutes.

If <fact5>57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time spent on the beach as <fact7>t</fact7> minutes and the time spent on the sidewalk as <fact8>s</fact8> minutes. We know that <fact5>57 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so <fact7>t</fact7> = 57. We also know that the total time spent walking is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk, so <fact9>t + s</fact9> = 60 minutes. We can use the formula <fact10>distance = rate * time</fact10> to set up an equation for the distance walked on the beach and the distance walked on the sidewalk. Since <fact2>19 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact7>t</fact7> = 57 minutes, the rate of speed on the beach is <fact11>19/57</fact11> kilometers per minute. Since <fact3>12 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> and <fact8>s</fact8> is the time spent on the sidewalk, the rate of speed on the sidewalk is <fact12>12/s</fact12> kilometers per minute. We are also given that <fact4>Kayla walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, so <fact12>12/s</fact12> = 2 * <fact11>19/57</fact11>.

If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>21-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's first find out how long it takes Xena to walk on the beach. Since she walks <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach, and we know that she walks at a certain rate of speed, we can use the formula time = distance / rate. However, we don't know her rate of speed on the beach yet. We do know that she walks at five times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, so let's call her rate of speed on the beach ""b"" and her rate of speed on the sidewalk ""5b"". Since she walks <fact3>10 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk, we can use the formula time = distance / rate to find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. However, we need to find her rate of speed on the beach first.

We know that the time it takes her to walk on the beach is <fact5>66 minutes</fact5>, and we know that the distance is <fact2>11 miles</fact2>. We can use the formula time = distance / rate to find her rate of speed on the beach. So, we have 66 = 11 / b. Solving for b, we get b = 11 / 66 = 0.1667 miles per minute.

Now that we know her rate of speed on the beach, we can find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. We know that the distance is <fact3>10 miles</fact3> and the rate of speed is 5b = 5 * 0.1667 = 0.8335 miles per minute. Using the formula time = distance / rate, we get time = 10 / 0.8335 = 12 minutes.

Now that we know the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the sidewalk, we can find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 21-mile walk. We know that the time it takes her to walk on the beach is <fact5>66 minutes</fact5> and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is 12 minutes. So, the total time is 66 + 12 = 78 minutes.

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Ananya walks on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Since she walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x kilometers per minute.
The time it takes for Ananya to walk 11 kilometers on the beach is <fact2>11</fact2> / <fact4>x</fact4> minutes.
The time it takes for Ananya to walk 15 kilometers on the sidewalk is <fact3>15</fact3> / <fact4>2x</fact4> minutes.
We are given that the time spent walking on the beach is <fact5>44</fact5> minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
<fact2>11</fact2> / <fact4>x</fact4> = <fact5>44</fact5>
Solving for x, we get:

If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 25-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Yara walks <fact1>25 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>14 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Yara walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time spent walking on the beach as t minutes. Then, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is (25 - 11) / 2 * t = 7t minutes, since Yara walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk. We know that t + 7t = 44 minutes, so 8t = 44 minutes. Therefore, t = 44 / 8 = 5.5 minutes. This is the time spent walking on the beach. Now, we can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 7t = 7 * 5.5 = 38.5 minutes. The total time spent walking is 5.5 + 38.5 = 44 minutes for the beach and sidewalk, and 25 - 11 - 14 = 0 miles left for the remaining part of the walk. So the total time spent for the entire 25-mile walk is 44 minutes."
872,"Isabella walks 29 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 14 kilometers of walking on the beach and 15 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Isabella walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 29-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Isabella walks 29 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail</fact1>, which includes <fact2>14 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>15 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Isabella walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>29-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time spent on the beach as t. Then, the time spent on the sidewalk is 29 - 14 - t = 15 - t. Since the distance on the beach is 14 kilometers, the time spent on the beach can be calculated as 14 / v, where v is the speed on the beach. Similarly, the time spent on the sidewalk can be calculated as 15 / (2v), since Isabella walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk. We are given that 56 minutes of the walk is spent on the beach, so we can set up the equation 14 / v = 56 / 60. Solving for v, we get v = 14 * 60 / 56 = 15 km/h. Now, we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk: 15 / (2 * 15) = 15 / 30 = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on the walk is 56 / 60 + 30 = 1.9333 hours = 115.2 minutes. However, this is the time spent on the walk, not the time it takes to complete the walk. We need to add the time it takes to walk the remaining 15 kilometers on the sidewalk, which is 15 / 15 = 1 hour = 60 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes to complete the walk is 115.2 + 60 = 175.2 minutes, which rounds to 175 minutes.

873,"Amelia walks 24 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 11 kilometers of walking on the beach and 13 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Amelia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Amelia walks <fact1>24 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>13 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Amelia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>24-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's start by using the information that Amelia walks <fact2>11 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. We can use this information to find Amelia's walking speed on the beach. Since distance = rate * time, we can rearrange this equation to get rate = distance / time. Plugging in the values we know, we get rate = <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> / <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 kilometers per minute.

We are also given that Amelia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk compared to the beach. This means that her walking speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 kilometers per minute.

We know that Amelia walks <fact3>13 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> and we have found her walking speed on the sidewalk. We can use this information to find the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk. Using the equation time = distance / rate, we get time = <fact3>13 kilometers</fact3> / 0.5 kilometers per minute = 26 minutes.

We also know that Amelia walks <fact1>24 kilometers every day</fact1> and that she spends <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5> on the beach. We can use this information to find the time it takes her to walk on the beach. We know that the time it takes her to walk on the beach is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5>. We also know that she walks <fact2>11 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and we have found her walking speed on the beach. We can use this information to confirm that the time it takes her to walk on the beach is indeed <fact5>44 minutes</fact5>.

We have now found the time it takes Amelia to walk on the beach, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk, and we know that she walks <fact1>24 kilometers every day</fact1>. We can use this information to find the total time it takes her to complete the entire 24-kilometer walk. We can add the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk to get the total time. The total time is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> + 26 minutes = 70 minutes.

874,"Emma walks 26 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 11 miles of walking on the beach and 15 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Emma walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Emma walks 26 miles every day on her favorite walking trail</fact1>, which includes <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>15 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>.

If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>26-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Emma spends on the beach as t minutes. We know that Emma walks 11 miles on the beach, so her speed on the beach is 11/t miles per minute. Since Emma walks at three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 3 * 11/t = 33/t miles per minute. The time Emma spends on the sidewalk is (26 - 11) / (33/t) = 15 / (33/t) = 15t / 33 minutes. We know that the total time Emma spends walking is 26 miles / (11/t + 15 / (33/t)) = 26 / ((11/t + 15t / 33)) minutes. We are also given that the time Emma spends on the beach is 44 minutes, so we can set up the equation 44 = 26 / ((11/t + 15t / 33)) and solve for t.

Solving the equation, we get:
44 = 26 / ((11/t + 15t / 33))
44 * (11/t + 15t / 33) = 26
44 * 11/t + 44 * 15t / 33 = 26
484/t + 220t / 33 = 26
484 * 33 + 220t^2 = 26 * 33t
15932 + 220t^2 = 858t
220t^2 - 858t + 15932 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:
t = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
t = (858 ± √((-858)^2 - 4 * 220 * 15932)) / (2 * 220)
t = (858 ± √(734844 - 12810240)) / 440
t = (858 ± √(-11415996)) / 440
Since the time cannot be negative, we take the positive root:
t = (858 + √(-11415996)) / 440 (not used)
t = (858 - √(-11415996)) / 440 (used)

However, this does not give a real number, so we must re-evaluate the equation:
44 = 26 / ((11/t + 15t / 33))
44 * (11/t + 15t / 33) = 26

If <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Quinn walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, we can assume that she walks at 2x speed on the sidewalk and x speed on the beach. The distance covered on the sidewalk is <fact3>16 kilometers</fact3> and the distance covered on the beach is <fact2>15 kilometers</fact2>. The time taken to cover these distances can be represented as 16/2x and 15/x respectively. Since the time taken for both distances is the same, we can equate them and solve for x. 16/2x = 15/x. 32x = 30. x = 15/32. Since Quinn spends <fact5>45 minutes of her walk on the beach</fact5>, we can calculate the time taken to cover 15 kilometers on the beach as 45/(15/32) = 96 minutes. Since the time taken to cover 16 kilometers on the sidewalk is also 96 minutes, the total time taken to complete the entire 31-kilometer walk is 96 + 96 = 192 minutes."

Answer: Since Kimia walks <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and spends <fact5>60 minutes of her walk on the beach</fact5>, her rate of speed on the beach is <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>0.25 miles per minute</fact2> on the beach.
On the sidewalk, Kimia walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach, which is <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact2>0.25 miles per minute</fact2> = <fact4>0.5 miles per minute</fact4> on the sidewalk.
Since Kimia walks <fact3>19 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> at a rate of <fact4>0.5 miles per minute</fact4>, it takes her <fact3>19 miles</fact3> / <fact4>0.5 miles per minute</fact4> = <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> to walk on the sidewalk.
The total time it takes for Kimia to complete the entire <fact6>34-mile walk</fact6> is the time spent on the beach, <fact5>60 minutes</fact5>, plus the time spent on the sidewalk, <fact3>38 minutes</fact3>, which is <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> + <fact3>38 minutes</fact3> = <fact7>98 minutes</fact7>.

If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>23-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: We are given that Sofia walks <fact2>11 miles on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> for a total of <fact1>23 miles</fact1>. We are also given that <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>. Let's first find out how long it takes her to walk the <fact2>11 miles on the beach</fact2>.

If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>22-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Since <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, this is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> out of the total time spent walking. Therefore, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is <fact6>22 kilometers</fact6> - <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> = <fact7>11 kilometers</fact7> on the sidewalk, and <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> is <fact8>44 minutes</fact8> out of the total time spent walking. The time spent walking on the sidewalk is <fact6>22 kilometers</fact6> - <fact2>11 kilometers</fact2> = <fact7>11 kilometers</fact7> on the sidewalk. The total time spent walking is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> + <fact9>time spent walking on the sidewalk</fact9>. We can find the time spent walking on the sidewalk by using the fact that <fact4>Kayla walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. Let <fact10>time spent walking on the beach</fact10> be <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> and let <fact11>time spent walking on the sidewalk</fact11> be <fact12>time spent walking on the sidewalk</fact12>. Since <fact4>Kayla walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, <fact11>time spent walking on the sidewalk</fact11> is <fact13>1/2</fact13> * <fact10>time spent walking on the beach</fact10> = <fact13>1/2</fact13> * <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> = <fact14>22 minutes</fact14>.

On the sidewalk, Quinn walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Quinn walks <fact1>26 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>12 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Quinn walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>26-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Quinn walks at the same rate on both the beach and the sidewalk, but the time it takes her to walk the same distance is different due to the difference in the distance she covers on each surface. Quinn walks at a rate of 1 kilometer per minute on the beach. This is because <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5> and she covers <fact2>12 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> in that time. We can calculate the rate by dividing the distance by the time, so 12 kilometers / 48 minutes = 1 kilometer per minute.
On the sidewalk, Quinn walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach, so she walks at 2 kilometers per minute. This is consistent with the information that she covers <fact3>14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> in the same amount of time as she covers the 26 kilometers of her walk, which we will calculate later.
Since Quinn walks 1 kilometer per minute on the beach, it takes her 12 kilometers / 1 kilometer per minute = 12 minutes to walk on the beach. Since Quinn walks 2 kilometers per minute on the sidewalk, it takes her 14 kilometers / 2 kilometers per minute = 7 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.
Therefore, it takes Quinn 12 + 7 = 19 minutes to walk on the beach and the sidewalk. However, Quinn walks a total of 26 kilometers in a day, and 12 + 14 = 26 kilometers is the total distance she walks on the beach and the sidewalk. This means that Quinn walks the entire 26 kilometers in 19 minutes.

If <fact5>40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>26-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Since <fact5>40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, and <fact2>10 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> is <fact5>40 minutes</fact5> of her walk, we can find her rate of speed on the beach. Let's call her rate of speed on the beach <fact7>r</fact7> kilometers per minute. Then, we can set up the equation <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> = <fact7>r</fact7> * <fact5>40 minutes</fact5>. Solving for <fact7>r</fact7>, we get <fact7>r</fact7> = <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact5>40 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 kilometers per minute.
Now that we know Nadia's rate of speed on the beach, we can find her rate of speed on the sidewalk. Since <fact4>Nadia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 kilometers per minute.
Since <fact2>16 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact2> is <fact8>x</fact8> minutes of her walk, we can find <fact8>x</fact8> by dividing <fact2>16 kilometers</fact2> by <fact4>0.5 kilometers per minute</fact4>. This gives us <fact8>x</fact8> = <fact2>16 kilometers</fact2> / <fact4>0.5 kilometers per minute</fact4> = 32 minutes.
Now that we know <fact5>40 minutes</fact5> of her walk is spent on the beach and <fact8>x</fact8> = 32 minutes of her walk is spent on the sidewalk, we can find the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 26-kilometer walk.

If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>23-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time Camila spends walking on the beach as <fact7>t</fact7> minutes. Since Camila walks at a constant speed on the beach, the distance she covers on the beach is <fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> = <fact7>t</fact7> * <fact8>speed</fact8> kilometers. We know that Camila walks at a constant speed on the beach, so we can denote her speed as <fact8>speed</fact8> = <fact9>distance</fact9> / <fact7>t</fact7> = <fact2>13</fact2> / <fact7>t</fact7> kilometers per minute. Since Camila walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact8>speed</fact8> = <fact4>2</fact4> * <fact2>13</fact2> / <fact7>t</fact7> kilometers per minute.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Leilani walks on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, the speed at which she walks on the sidewalk is 3x miles per minute. We know that she spends 60 minutes on the beach, so she covers <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> in 60 minutes. This means that her speed on the beach is 15/60 = 0.25 miles per minute. Therefore, x = 0.25. Now, we can calculate the time it takes for her to walk 12 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 3x = 3*0.25 = 0.75 miles per minute. This is given by 12/0.75 = 16 minutes.

If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>35-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Uma spends walking on the beach as t minutes. Then, the time she spends walking on the sidewalk is (35 - 17) / 2 * t = 9t minutes (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk and covers 18 kilometers). We know that t + 9t = 51 minutes (from <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>), so 10t = 51, and t = 5.1 minutes. This means that Uma spends 5.1 * 17 = 86.7 minutes walking on the beach. The time she spends walking on the sidewalk is 51 - 5.1 = 45.9 minutes.

If <fact5>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>29-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> is <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> of her walk, the rate at which Kimia walks on the beach is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact5>44 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>11/44</fact2> miles per minute.
Since <fact4>Kimia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the rate at which Kimia walks on the sidewalk is 2 * <fact2>11/44</fact2> = <fact7>22/44</fact7> miles per minute.
The time it takes for Kimia to walk <fact3>18 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> is <fact3>18 miles</fact3> / <fact7>22/44</fact7> miles per minute = <fact3>18 * 44 / 22</fact3> = 36 minutes.
The time it takes for Kimia to walk <fact2>11 miles on the beach</fact2> is <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact2>11/44</fact2> miles per minute = 44 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 27-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Emma walks <fact1>27 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>16 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Emma walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>27-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Emma spends walking on the beach as t minutes. Then, the time she spends walking on the sidewalk is (fact5)66 minutes - t minutes = 66 - t minutes.
We know that the distance Emma walks on the beach is <fact2>11 miles</fact2>, and the distance she walks on the sidewalk is <fact3>16 miles</fact3>. Since distance = rate * time, we can set up the following equations:
11 = r * t
16 = 4r * (66 - t)
where r is Emma's rate of speed on the beach.
Solving the first equation for r, we get r = 11/t.
Substituting this expression for r into the second equation, we get:
16 = 4 * (11/t) * (66 - t)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
16 = 44 * (66 - t) / t
Multiplying both sides by t, we get:
16t = 44 * (66 - t)
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
16t = 2904 - 44t
Adding 44t to both sides, we get:
60t = 2904
Dividing both sides by 60, we get:
t = 2904 / 60
t = 48.4 minutes
Now that we know the time Emma spends walking on the beach, we can find the time she spends walking on the sidewalk:
66 - t = 66 - 48.4 = 17.6 minutes
The total time Emma spends walking is the sum of the time she spends walking on the beach and the time she spends walking on the sidewalk:
Total time = t + (66 - t) = 48.4 + 17.6 = 66 minutes
However, this is not the total time for the entire 27-mile walk. We need to add the time it takes for Emma to walk the 16 miles on the sidewalk at four times her rate of speed on the beach. Since we know that Emma walks 16 miles on the sidewalk, we can use the same distance = rate * time equation:
16 = 4r * (time)
We know that Emma walks 11 miles on the beach at rate r, so we can use the same equation:
11 = r * t
where t is the time Emma spends walking on the beach. We can rearrange this equation to solve for r:
r = 11/t
Substituting this expression for r into the equation for the sidewalk, we get:
16 = 4 * (11/t) * (time)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
16 = 44 * (time) / t
Multiplying both sides by t, we get:
16t =  = 44 * (time)
Dividing both sides by 16, we get:
time = 44t / 16
time = 2.75t
Now that we know the time it takes for Emma to walk the 16 miles on the sidewalk, we can find the total time for the entire 27-mile walk:
Total time = t + (66 - t) + 2.75t
Total time = 48.4 + 17.6 + 2.75 * 48.4
Total time = 66 + 132.1
Total time = 198.1 minutes

If <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>34-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed of Zahra on the beach as x miles per minute. Then, her speed on the sidewalk is 3x miles per minute. Since Zahra walks <fact2>16 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> at a speed of x miles per minute, it will take her <fact2>16/x</fact2> minutes to walk on the beach. Since Zahra walks <fact3>18 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 3x miles per minute, it will take her <fact3>18/(3x)</fact3> = 6/x minutes to walk on the sidewalk. According to the question, <fact5>64 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so we can set up the equation: <fact2>16/x</fact2> = <fact5>64</fact5>. Solving for x, we get x = <fact2>16/64</fact2> = 0.25 miles per minute. Since Zahra's speed on the sidewalk is 3x = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 miles per minute, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is <fact3>18/(3x)</fact3> = 18/0.75 = 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time it takes Zahra to complete the entire <fact6>34-mile walk</fact6> is <fact2>16/x</fact2> + <fact3>18/(3x)</fact3> = 64 + 24 = 88 minutes."

If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>27-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time Yara spends walking on the beach as x. Since Yara walks at a constant speed on the beach, the distance she covers on the beach is equal to the rate of speed multiplied by the time. Since the rate of speed is not given, we can let the rate of speed on the beach be y. Then, the distance Yara covers on the beach is yx. Since the distance on the beach is 17 miles, we can set up the equation yx = 17. Similarly, the time Yara spends walking on the sidewalk is (27 - 17)/2 = 5 minutes, and the distance she covers on the sidewalk is 10 miles. Since Yara walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, the rate of speed on the sidewalk is 2y. Then, the distance Yara covers on the sidewalk is 2y(5/60) = 1/6(2y). Since the distance on the sidewalk is 10 miles, we can set up the equation 1/6(2y) = 10.

Since we have two equations yx = 17 and 1/6(2y) = 10, we can solve for y. From the second equation, we have 2y/6 = 10, which implies that 2y = 60, and y = 30. Substituting y = 30 into the first equation yx = 17, we get 30x = 17, which implies that x = 17/30 = 0.5667. Since Yara spends 51 minutes walking on the beach, we can set up the equation 0.5667x = 51, where x is the time spent walking on the beach. Solving for x, we get x = 90 minutes. Since Yara spends 5 minutes walking on the sidewalk, the total time Yara takes to complete the entire 27-mile walk is 90 + 5 = 95 minutes.

If 65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 25-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Sakura walks 25 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail</fact1>, which includes <fact2>13 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>12 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Sakura walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Since Sakura walks at the same rate on the beach, the time it takes her to walk <fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> on the beach is the same as the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk. Therefore, the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk is <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> * <fact7>13/13</fact7> = <fact5>65 minutes</fact5>. Since <fact4>Sakura walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk is <fact8>1/3</fact8> of the time it takes her to walk <fact3>36 kilometers</fact3> on the beach. Therefore, the time it takes her to walk <fact3>36 kilometers</fact3> on the beach is <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> * <fact9>3</fact9> = <fact10>195 minutes</fact10>. Since <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> of her walk is spent on the beach, the time it takes her to walk <fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> on the beach is <fact11>65 minutes</fact11> / <fact12>13/13</fact12> = <fact5>65 minutes</fact5>. Therefore, the time it takes her to walk <fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> on the beach is <fact5>65 minutes</fact5>. Since <fact5>65 minutes</fact5> of her walk is spent on the beach, the time it takes her to walk <fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> on the beach is <fact13>65 minutes</fact13> / <fact14>13/13</fact14> = <fact5>65 minutes</fact5>. The time it takes her to walk <fact6>25 kilometers</fact6> is the sum of the time it takes her to walk <fact2>13 kilometers</fact2> on the beach and the time it takes her to walk <fact3>12 kilometers</fact3> on the sidewalk.

889,"Tara walks 25 kilometers every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 11 kilometers of walking on the beach and 14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Tara walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 25-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Tara walks <fact1>25 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Tara walks at <fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>25-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the speed at which Tara walks on the beach as x kilometers per minute. Then, the speed at which she walks on the sidewalk is 3x kilometers per minute.
Since Tara walks <fact2>11 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> at a speed of x kilometers per minute, the time she spends on the beach is <fact2>11</fact2>/x minutes.
We are given that this time is equal to <fact5>66 minutes</fact5>, so we can write the equation:
11/x = 66
Solving for x, we get:
x = 11/66 ≈ 0.1667 kilometers per minute
Now, we can find the time it takes for Tara to walk on the sidewalk. Since she walks <fact3>14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3> at a speed of 3x kilometers per minute, the time she spends on the sidewalk is <fact3>14</fact3>/3x minutes.
Substituting the value of x, we get:
14/3x = 14/3(11/66) ≈ 14/0.5 = 28 minutes
The total time it takes for Tara to complete the entire 25-kilometer walk is the sum of the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk:
Total time = <fact5>66 minutes</fact5> + <fact3>28 minutes</fact3> = 94 minutes

On the sidewalk, Jasmine walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Jasmine walks 32 miles every day on her favorite walking trail</fact1>, which includes <fact2>14 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>18 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Jasmine walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>32-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Since <fact5>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can determine the rate at which <fact2>Jasmine walks on the beach</fact2> by dividing the time spent on the beach by the distance walked on the beach. The distance walked on the beach is <fact2>14 miles</fact2>. So, the rate at which <fact2>Jasmine walks on the beach</fact2> is <fact5>56 minutes</fact5> / <fact2>14 miles</fact2> = 4 minutes per mile.
Since <fact4>Jasmine walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the rate at which <fact3>Jasmine walks on the sidewalk</fact3> is 2 * 4 minutes per mile = 8 minutes per mile.
The total time it takes for <fact1>Jasmine to walk the 32-mile trail</fact1> is the sum of the time it takes to walk on the beach and the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk. The time it takes to walk on the beach is <fact5>56 minutes</fact5> and the time it takes to walk on the sidewalk is <fact3>18 miles</fact3> * <fact3>8 minutes per mile</fact3> = 144 minutes.

On the sidewalk, Chen walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 31-mile walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Chen walks <fact1>31 miles every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>12 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>19 miles of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, Chen walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time Chen spends walking on the beach as <fact7>t minutes</fact7>. Since she walks at a constant speed, the distance she covers on the beach is directly proportional to the time she spends walking on the beach. Therefore, the distance she covers on the beach is <fact2>12 miles</fact2> = <fact7>t</fact7> * speed on the beach. Since we don't know the speed on the beach, we'll denote it as <fact8>s</fact8>. Therefore, we have <fact2>12 = ts</fact2>. We also know that Chen spends <fact5>48 minutes</fact5> on the beach, so we can substitute <fact7>t = 48</fact7> into the equation to get <fact2>12 = 48s</fact2>. Solving for <fact8>s</fact8>, we get <fact8>s = 12/48 = 0.25 miles per minute</fact8>.

Now, let's consider the sidewalk. Chen walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is <fact8>2s = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 miles per minute</fact8>. The time she spends walking on the sidewalk is <fact6>31 - 12 = 19 miles</fact6> / <fact8>0.5 miles per minute</fact8> = <fact9>38 minutes</fact9>. Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire <fact6>31-mile walk</fact6> is <fact7>t</fact7> + <fact9>38</fact9> = <fact5>48</fact5> + <fact9>38</fact9> = <fact10>86 minutes</fact10>.

If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>24-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time Elena spends on the beach as <fact5>66 minutes</fact5>. Since Elena walks <fact2>11 miles</fact2> on the beach, we can find her speed on the beach by dividing the distance by the time: <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact5>66 minutes</fact5> = <fact7>0.1667 miles per minute</fact7> (approximately). 
Since Elena walks on the sidewalk at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is <fact7>0.1667 miles per minute</fact7> * 3 = <fact8>0.5 miles per minute</fact8> (approximately). 
Since Elena walks <fact3>13 miles</fact3> on the sidewalk, we can find the time she spends on the sidewalk by dividing the distance by her speed: <fact3>13 miles</fact3> / <fact8>0.5 miles per minute</fact8> = <fact9>26 minutes</fact9> (approximately). 
Therefore, the total time it takes for Elena to complete the entire 24-mile walk is <fact5>66 minutes</fact5> + <fact9>26 minutes</fact9> = <fact10>92 minutes</fact10> (approximately).

On the sidewalk, Tara walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 25-kilometer walk, in minutes?","Reformatted Question: Tara walks <fact1>25 kilometers every day</fact1> on her favorite walking trail, which includes <fact2>11 kilometers of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact3>14 kilometers of walking on the sidewalk</fact3>. On the sidewalk, <fact4>Tara walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>. If <fact5>66 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>25-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: Let's denote the time spent on the sidewalk as x. Since the total time spent walking is 25/<fact2>11</fact2> + 25/<fact3>14</fact3> = 2.27 + 1.79 = 4.06 hours = 244 minutes, we can set up the following equation: 66 + x = 244. Solving for x, we get x = 178 minutes.

Since <fact4>Tara walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach</fact4>, the time spent on the sidewalk is twice the time spent on the beach. Thus, the time spent on the sidewalk is 178/2 = 89 minutes. 

The time spent on the beach is 66 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent walking is 66 + 89 = 155 minutes.

However, this is not the total time spent walking, but the time spent walking on the beach and the sidewalk. We need to add the time it takes to walk the remaining 4 kilometers on the sidewalk. Since the time spent walking on the sidewalk is 89 minutes for 14 kilometers, the time spent walking 1 kilometer is 89/14 = 6.36 minutes. Therefore, the time spent walking the remaining 4 kilometers is 4 * 6.36 = 25.44 minutes.

The total time spent walking is 155 + 25.44 = 180.44 minutes.

If <fact5>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>28-kilometer walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the time it takes Olga to walk on the beach as <fact7>t</fact7> minutes. Then, the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk is <fact8>3t</fact8> minutes, since she walks at three times the rate of speed on the sidewalk. We know that <fact5>50 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, so <fact7>t</fact7> = 50 minutes. We also know that the total distance Olga walks is <fact6>28 kilometers</fact6>, which is equal to 28000 meters. Since she walks 10 kilometers on the beach and 18 kilometers on the sidewalk, we can set up the following equation: 10,000 * <fact7>t</fact7> + 18,000 * <fact8>3t</fact8> = 28000 * 1000. Substituting <fact7>t</fact7> = 50, we get: 10,000 * 50 + 18,000 * 150 = 28000 * 1000. Solving this equation, we get: 500,000 + 2,700,000 = 28,000,000. This equation is true, so we can find the total time it takes Olga to complete the entire 28-kilometer walk by adding the time it takes her to walk on the beach and the time it takes her to walk on the sidewalk: <fact7>t</fact7> + <fact8>3t</fact8> = 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

If <fact5>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>28-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Mei walks <fact2>15 miles on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> is spent on the beach, her speed on the beach is <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>60 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute.
Since Mei walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk</fact4>, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.25 miles per minute = 0.5 miles per minute.
The time it takes for her to walk <fact3>13 miles on the sidewalk</fact3> is <fact3>13 miles</fact3> / <fact4>0.5 miles per minute</fact4> = 26 minutes.
The time it takes for her to walk <fact2>15 miles on the beach</fact2> is <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>0.25 miles per minute</fact5> = 60 minutes.

If <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>27-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?

Answer: Since Winnie walks <fact2>15 miles of walking on the beach</fact2> and <fact5>45 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, we can calculate her rate of speed on the beach as follows: <fact2>15 miles</fact2> / <fact5>45 minutes</fact5> = <fact2>15/45</fact2> miles per minute. This is equal to <fact2>1/3</fact2> miles per minute.

Since Winnie walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her rate of speed on the sidewalk is <fact4>2 * 1/3</fact4> = <fact4>2/3</fact4> miles per minute.

The total distance Winnie walks on the sidewalk is <fact3>12 miles</fact3>. Since she walks at a rate of <fact4>2/3</fact4> miles per minute, the time it takes her to walk the sidewalk is <fact3>12 miles</fact3> / <fact4>2/3 miles per minute</fact4> = <fact3>12 * 3/2</fact3> = <fact3>18</fact3> minutes.

The total time it takes Winnie to walk the beach is <fact5>45 minutes</fact5>. The total time it takes her to walk the sidewalk is <fact3>18 minutes</fact3>.

If <fact5>52 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact6>30-mile walk</fact6>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's first find out Winnie's speed on the beach. Since she walks 13 miles on the beach in <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>, her speed on the beach is <fact2>13 miles</fact2> / <fact5>52 minutes</fact5> = 0.25 miles per minute.
Since Winnie walks at two times the rate of speed on the sidewalk, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 miles per minute.
The total time Winnie spends on the sidewalk is <fact3>17 miles</fact3> / <fact4>0.5 miles per minute</fact4> = 34 minutes.
The total time Winnie spends on the beach is <fact5>52 minutes</fact5>.

If <fact5>48 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>30-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?
Answer: Let's denote the speed on the beach as x km/min. Then, the speed on the sidewalk is 3x km/min. The time spent on the beach is 12/x km, and the time spent on the sidewalk is 18/(3x) = 6/x km. Since the total time spent on the beach is 48 minutes, we can set up the equation 12/x = 48/60 = 4/5. Solving for x, we get x = 12/4 = 3 km/min. Now, we can find the time spent on the beach: 12/x = 12/3 = 4 minutes. The time spent on the sidewalk is 18/(3x) = 18/(3*3) = 2 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent on the entire 30-kilometer walk is 4 + 2 = 6 minutes for the beach and sidewalk, and 30 - 12 - 18 = 0 km for the remaining part of the walk. Since Rania only walks on the beach and sidewalk, we can ignore the remaining part of the walk. The total time spent on the walk is 6 + 0 = 6 minutes."

If <fact5>Zahra is sure to get 60% of the geography questions</fact5>, and a <fact6>third of the biology and literature questions correctly</fact6>, how many points is she sure to get?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many geography questions there are. Since <fact2>50% of the questions are geography</fact2>, we can find this by multiplying the total number of questions by <fact2>50%</fact2>. So, there are <fact1>90</fact1> * <fact2>0.5</fact2> = 45 geography questions.
Next, we need to find out how many biology and literature questions there are. Since the rest of the questions are equally divided between biology and literature, we can find this by subtracting the number of geography questions from the total number of questions and dividing by 2. So, there are ( <fact1>90</fact1> - <fact2>45</fact2> ) / <fact3>2</fact3> = 22.5 biology and literature questions. Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we can round this down to 22 biology and literature questions.

If he watched <fact11>23 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>45-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>?
Answer: Benjamin watched a <fact3>4-hour episode</fact3> on <fact2>Tuesday</fact2> and a <fact3>4-hour episode</fact3> on <fact2>Wednesday</fact2>, so he watched 2 * <fact3>4 hours</fact3> = 8 hours of TV on <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>. 
He watched a <fact7>6-hour episode</fact7> on <fact6>Friday</fact6> and two <fact10>4-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, so he watched 6 + 2 * <fact10>4 hours</fact10> = 14 hours of TV on <fact6>Friday and Saturday</fact6>.

He watched <fact11>23 hours of TV in all</fact11>, so he watched 23 - 22 = 1 hour of TV on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>. 
Since he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>45-minute show</fact5> on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>, each episode must have taken up 1 hour / <fact5>45 minutes</fact5> = 1.111 episodes.

On <fact1>Sunday and Monday</fact1>, he watched a <fact2>4-hour episode</fact2> of his favorite show each night. On <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>, he watched a few episodes of a <fact4>15-minute show</fact4>.

On <fact8>Thursday</fact8>, he got to stay up late, so he watched two <fact9>3-hour episodes</fact9>. If he watched <fact10>19 hours of TV in all</fact10>, how many <fact11>15-minute episodes</fact11> did he watch on <fact3>Tuesday</fact3>?
Answer: Let's start by calculating the total time Luca watched TV on Sunday and Monday. He watched a <fact2>4-hour episode</fact2> each night, so the total time is <fact2>4</fact2> * 2 = 8 hours. On Tuesday, he watched a few episodes of a <fact4>15-minute show</fact4>. Let's call the number of episodes x. The total time he watched on Tuesday is <fact4>15</fact4> * x minutes, which is equivalent to <fact4>15</fact4> * x / 60 hours. On Wednesday, he watched a <fact6>4-hour episode</fact6> and a <fact7>45-minute show</fact7>. The total time is <fact6>4</fact6> + <fact7>45</fact7>/60 = 4.75 hours. On Thursday, he watched two <fact9>3-hour episodes</fact9>, so the total time is 2 * <fact9>3</fact9> = 6 hours. The total time Luca watched TV is 8 + <fact4>15</fact4> * x / 60 + 4.75 + 6 = <fact10>19</fact10> hours. We can now solve for x: <fact4>15</fact4> * x / 60 + 8 + 4.75 + 6 = <fact10>19</fact10>. Subtracting 18.75 from both sides gives us <fact4>15</fact4> * x / 60 = <fact10>19</fact10> - 18.75 = 0.25. Multiplying both sides by 60 gives us <fact4>15</fact4> * x = 15. Multiplying both sides by 1/<fact4>15</fact4> gives us x = 1. Therefore, Luca watched 1 episode of the <fact4>15-minute show</fact4> on Tuesday."

If he watched <fact11>23 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>30-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4>?
Answer: The total time spent watching TV on <fact2>Monday and Tuesday</fact2> is <fact3>6 hours</fact3> * 2 = 12 hours.
The total time spent watching TV on <fact9>Friday</fact9> is <fact10>2 hours</fact10> * 2 = 4 hours.
The total time spent watching TV on <fact6>Thursday</fact6> is <fact7>3 hours</fact7> + <fact8>0.5 hours</fact8> = 3.5 hours.
The time spent watching TV on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4> is <fact11>23 hours</fact11> - 12 hours - 4 hours - 3.5 hours = 3.5 hours.
Since each episode of the 30-minute show is <fact5>30 minutes</fact5> long, the number of episodes watched on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4> is 3.5 hours / 0.5 hours = 7 episodes.

If he watched <fact5>25 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>45-minute episodes</fact6> did he watch on <fact7>Tuesday</fact7>?
Answer: Mateo watched <fact1>4 hours</fact1> of TV on <fact8>Sunday</fact8> and <fact1>4 hours</fact1> of TV on <fact8>Monday</fact8>. So, he watched a total of 4+4 = 8 hours of TV on <fact8>Sunday</fact8> and <fact8>Monday</fact8>. On <fact7>Tuesday</fact7>, Mateo watched <fact2>45-minute episodes</fact2> of a show. Let's assume he watched x episodes of the 45-minute show. Then, the total time he spent watching the 45-minute show on <fact7>Tuesday</fact7> is 45x minutes. On <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>, Mateo watched a <fact1>4-hour episode</fact1> and a <fact1>15-minute show</fact1>. So, he watched a total of 4+0.25 = 4.25 hours of TV on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>. On <fact4>Thursday</fact4>, Mateo watched <fact1>3</fact1> * <fact1>4-hour episodes</fact1> = 12 hours of TV. So, the total time he spent watching TV is 8 + 45x + 4.25 + 12 = 25 hours. Now, we can solve for x: 45x = 25 - 8 - 4.25 - 12 = 0.75. So, x = 0.75/45 = 0.0167. Since Mateo watched a few episodes of the 45-minute show on <fact7>Tuesday</fact7>, we can round x to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mateo watched 0 episodes of the 45-minute show on <fact7>Tuesday</fact7>."

If he watched <fact11>29 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>30-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>?
Answer: Let's break down the total hours of TV watched by Theo. On <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, he watched a <fact3>6-hour episode</fact3> each night, for a total of 2*<fact3>6</fact3> = 12 hours. On <fact6>Friday</fact6>, he watched a <fact7>2-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>30-minute show</fact8>, which is <fact8>0.5</fact8> hours. So, he watched a total of <fact7>2</fact7> + <fact8>0.5</fact8> = 2.5 hours on <fact6>Friday</fact6>. On <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, he watched three <fact10>4-hour episodes</fact10>, which is 3*<fact10>4</fact10> = 12 hours. The total hours of TV watched by Theo is 12 + 12 + 2.5 + 12 = 38.5 hours. However, we are told that he watched <fact11>29 hours of TV in all</fact11>. This means that the total hours of TV watched by Theo on <fact4>Thursday</fact4> is <fact11>29</fact11> - 12 - 12 - 2.5 - 12 = 0.5 hours. Since he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>30-minute show</fact5> on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>, we can set up an equation to find the number of episodes: <fact5>30</fact5> * <fact13>n</fact13> = <fact14>0.5</fact14> * <fact15>60</fact15>, where <fact13>n</fact13> is the number of episodes.

If he watched <fact8>28 hours of TV in all</fact8>, how many <fact5>15-minute episodes</fact5> did he watch on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>?
Answer: To find out how many 15-minute episodes Deshawn watched on Tuesday, we need to first determine how many hours he watched TV on Tuesday. Since we know he watched TV for a total of 28 hours, we can subtract the hours he watched on the other days from 28 to find the hours he watched on Tuesday. On Sunday and Monday, he watched a total of 2 * <fact3>4 hours</fact3> = 8 hours. On Wednesday, he watched a total of <fact3>4 hours</fact3> + <fact5>15 minutes</fact5> (which is 0.25 hours) = 4.25 hours. On Thursday, he watched a total of 5 * <fact3>3 hours</fact3> = 15 hours. Therefore, the hours he watched on Tuesday is <fact8>28 hours</fact8> - 8 hours - 4.25 hours - 15 hours = 0.75 hours. Since each episode of the 15-minute show is 0.25 hours long, we can find the number of episodes he watched on Tuesday by dividing the total hours he watched on Tuesday by the length of each episode. Therefore, the number of 15-minute episodes he watched on Tuesday is <fact8>0.75 hours</fact8> / <fact5>0.25 hours</fact5> = 3 episodes.

If he watched <fact11>21 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Saturday</fact4>?
Answer: Let's denote the number of 15-minute episodes Leon watched on Saturday as x. The total time Leon spent watching TV on Thursday and Friday is 2 * <fact3>4 hours</fact3> = 8 hours. The total time Leon spent watching TV on Sunday is <fact7>5 hours</fact7> + <fact8>15 minutes</fact8> = 5.25 hours. The total time Leon spent watching TV on Monday is 3 * <fact10>2 hours</fact10> = 6 hours. The total time Leon spent watching TV on Saturday is x * <fact5>15 minutes</fact5> = 0.25x hours. Since the total time Leon spent watching TV is 21 hours, we can set up the equation: 8 + 0.25x + 5.25 + 6 + 0.25x = 21. Combining like terms, we get 19.5 + 0.5x = 21. Subtracting 19.5 from both sides, we get 0.5x = 1.5. Dividing both sides by 0.5, we get x = 3. Therefore, Leon watched 3 episodes of the 15-minute show on Saturday."

If he watched 31 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Tuesday?","Reformatted Question: Faisal watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. <fact1>On Sunday and Monday, he watched a 5-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact1>. <fact2>On Tuesday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show</fact2>. <fact3>On Wednesday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. <fact4>On Thursday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 5-hour episodes</fact4>. If he watched <fact5>31 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>45-minute episodes did he watch on Tuesday</fact6>?
Answer: Faisal watched <fact1>5 hours</fact1> of TV on Sunday and Monday, so he watched <fact1>5 hours</fact1> * 2 = 10 hours of TV on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday, he watched <fact2>45-minute episodes</fact2> of a 45-minute show, so he watched <fact5>31 hours</fact5> - <fact1>10 hours</fact1> = 21 hours of TV on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. On Wednesday, he watched a <fact3>5-hour episode</fact3> and a <fact3>15-minute show</fact3>, so he watched 5 hours + 15/60 hours = 5.25 hours of TV on Wednesday. On Thursday, he watched <fact4>three 5-hour episodes</fact4>, so he watched 3 * 5 hours = 15 hours of TV on Thursday. So, he watched a total of 5.25 + 15 + 15 = 35.25 hours of TV on Wednesday and Thursday. Therefore, he watched 21 - 35.25 = -14.25 hours of TV on Tuesday.

If he watched <fact11>27 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact13>Thursday</fact13>?
Answer: We know that Sanjay watched <fact3>6-hour episodes</fact3> on <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, so he watched a total of <fact2>2</fact2> * <fact3>6</fact3> = 12 hours on those two nights. We also know that he watched <fact10>4-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, so he watched a total of <fact9>3</fact9> * <fact10>4</fact10> = 12 hours on that night. We know that he watched a <fact7>2-hour episode</fact7> on <fact6>Friday</fact6>, so he watched a total of 12 + 12 + 2 = 26 hours on those three nights. Since he watched a total of <fact11>27 hours</fact11> of TV, we know that he watched <fact11>27</fact11> - <fact14>26</fact14> = 1 hour on <fact13>Thursday</fact13>. We also know that he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>15-minute show</fact5> on <fact13>Thursday</fact13>, and we are asked to find how many <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> he watched. If we let x be the number of episodes he watched, then we know that x * <fact5>15</fact5> = <fact15>1</fact15> * <fact16>60</fact16>, since there are 60 minutes in an hour. Solving for x, we get x = <fact15>1</fact15> * <fact16>60</fact16> / <fact5>15</fact5> = 4.

If he watched <fact5>29 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>45-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday</fact6>?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many hours Mohammed watched TV on Thursday and Friday. He watched <fact1>5 hours</fact1> each night, so he watched a total of 2 * <fact1>5 hours</fact1> = 10 hours of TV on Thursday and Friday.
Next, we need to find out how many hours Mohammed watched TV on Sunday. He watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the 45-minute show is equivalent to 0.75 hours. So, he watched a total of <fact3>3 hours</fact3> + <fact3>0.75 hours</fact3> = 3.75 hours of TV on Sunday.
Next, we need to find out how many hours Mohammed watched TV on Monday. He watched five 2-hour episodes, so he watched a total of 5 * <fact4>2 hours</fact4> = 10 hours of TV on Monday.
Now, we can find out how many hours Mohammed watched TV on Saturday. We know that he watched a total of <fact5>29 hours of TV in all</fact5>, and we know how many hours he watched TV on Thursday and Friday, Sunday, and Monday. So, we can subtract the hours he watched on those days from the total hours to find out how many hours he watched on Saturday. <fact5>29 hours</fact5> - <fact1>10 hours</fact1> - <fact3>3.75 hours</fact3> - <fact4>10 hours</fact4> = 5.25 hours.
Since each episode of the 45-minute show is 0.75 hours long, we can divide the total hours he watched on Saturday by the length of each episode to find out how many episodes he watched. <fact6>5.25 hours</fact6> / <fact6>0.75 hours</fact6> = 7.
The answer is {7}."

If he watched <fact11>20 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact13>Thursday</fact13>?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total time Ravi spent watching TV on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. On <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, he watched a <fact3>4-hour episode</fact3> each night, so he spent <fact3>4</fact3> * 2 = 8 hours watching TV on these two nights. On <fact6>Friday</fact6>, he watched a <fact7>2-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>45-minute show</fact8>, which is equivalent to <fact8>45/60 = 0.75</fact8> hours. So, he spent 2 + 0.75 = 2.75 hours watching TV on Friday. On <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, he watched two <fact10>4-hour episodes</fact10>, so he spent 2 * 4 = 8 hours watching TV on Saturday. In total, he spent 8 + 2.75 + 8 = 18.75 hours watching TV on these four days. Since he watched <fact11>20 hours of TV in all</fact11>, he must have spent 20 - 18.75 = 1.25 hours watching TV on <fact13>Thursday</fact13>. On <fact13>Thursday</fact13>, he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>15-minute show</fact5>, which is equivalent to <fact5>15/60 = 0.25</fact5> hours per episode. To find out how many episodes he watched, we can divide the total time he spent watching TV on Thursday (1.25 hours) by the time it takes to watch one episode (0.25 hours). This gives us 1.25 / 0.25 = 5 episodes. Therefore, Ravi watched 5 <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> on <fact13>Thursday</fact13>."

He watched two <fact10>2-hour episodes</fact10> on Monday, which is equivalent to a <fact14>4-hour episode</fact14>. The total number of hours he watched on Sunday and Monday is <fact7>2</fact7> + <fact13>1.5</fact13> + <fact14>4</fact14> = 7.5 hours.

The total number of hours Oliver watched on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday is 10 + 7.5 = 17.5 hours. Since he watched <fact11>20 hours of TV in all</fact11>, the total number of hours he watched on Saturday is <fact11>20</fact11> - 17.5 = 2.5 hours.

Since Oliver watched a few episodes of a <fact5>30-minute show</fact5> on Saturday, we can set up the following equation to represent the total number of hours he watched on Saturday: (number of episodes) * 0.5 = 2.5. Solving for the number of episodes, we get: (number of episodes) = 2.5 / 0.5 = 5.

The answer is {5}."

On Friday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes. If he watched 18 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Friday?","Reformatted Question: Noah watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. <fact1>On Wednesday and Thursday, he watched a 3-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact1>. <fact2>On Friday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show</fact2>. <fact3>On Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. <fact4>On Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 2-hour episodes</fact4>. If he watched <fact5>18 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>45-minute episodes did he watch on Friday</fact6>?
Answer: Noah watched a 3-hour episode on <fact1>Wednesday</fact1> and <fact1>Thursday</fact1>. So he watched 2 * 3 = 6 hours of TV on these two days. 
On <fact3>Saturday</fact3>, he watched a 4-hour episode and a 15-minute show. We need to convert the 15-minute show to hours, which is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So he watched 4 + 0.25 = 4.25 hours of TV on Saturday. 
On <fact4>Sunday</fact4>, he watched two 2-hour episodes. So he watched 2 * 2 = 4 hours of TV on Sunday. 
Therefore, he watched 6 + 4.25 + 4 = 14.25 hours of TV on these three days. 
This means he watched <fact5>18</fact5> - <fact7>14.25</fact7> = 3.75 hours of TV on <fact2>Friday</fact2>. 
We know that he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show on Friday. Let's call the number of episodes x. 
Each episode is 45 minutes, which is 45/60 = 0.75 hours. 
So he watched x * 0.75 = 3.75 hours of TV on Friday. 
To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75. 
x = 3.75 / 0.75 = 5. 
Therefore, Noah watched 5 episodes of a 45-minute show on Friday. 
The answer is {5}."

If he watched <fact11>28 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>45-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>?
Answer: We know that Bodhi watched <fact3>6-hour episodes</fact3> on <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, so he watched 2 * <fact3>6</fact3> = 12 hours of TV on those two nights. We also know that he watched <fact10>2-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, so he watched 5 * <fact10>2</fact10> = 10 hours of TV on Saturday. Finally, we know that he watched <fact7>3-hour episodes</fact7> on <fact6>Friday</fact6>, so he watched 1 * <fact7>3</fact7> = 3 hours of TV on Friday. Since he watched <fact11>28 hours of TV in all</fact11>, we can subtract the hours he watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, and Friday to find the hours he watched on Thursday: <fact11>28</fact11> - <fact3>12</fact3> - <fact10>10</fact10> - <fact7>3</fact7> = 3 hours.

If he watched <fact11>19 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>?
Answer: We know that Ibrahim watched <fact3>3 hours</fact3> of TV on both <fact2>Sunday</fact2> and <fact2>Monday</fact2>, for a total of 2 * <fact3>3 hours</fact3> = 6 hours. On <fact6>Wednesday</fact6>, he watched a <fact7>4-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>30-minute show</fact8>. Since we know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the 30-minute show to hours by dividing by 60, which gives us <fact8>30 minutes</fact8> / 60 = 0.5 hours.

He also watched <fact10>3-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, which is <fact10>3</fact10> * 4 = 12 hours. This makes a total of 10 + 12 = 22 hours of TV watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Therefore, he watched <fact11>30</fact11> - 22 = 8 hours of TV on Thursday and Friday.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on <fact1>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact1>. Viktor watched a <fact2>3-hour episode</fact2> of his favorite show each night, so he watched 2 * <fact2>3</fact2> = 6 hours of TV on these two nights.

The total hours of TV watched is 6 + 0.5x + 3.5 + 10 = 20 + 0.5x. Since Viktor watched <fact10>22 hours of TV in all</fact10>, we can set up the equation 20 + 0.5x = 22.

Since each episode is <fact4>30 minutes</fact4> long, the total minutes of TV watched on <fact3>Thursday</fact3> is 4 * <fact4>30</fact4> = 120 minutes.

Answer: On <fact7>Monday</fact7>, Santiago watched a few episodes of a <fact6>15-minute</fact6> show. Let's call the number of episodes he watched on <fact7>Monday</fact7> x. Since each episode is <fact6>15 minutes</fact6> long, the total time he spent watching TV on <fact7>Monday</fact7> is 15x minutes. We know that he watched TV for a total of <fact5>31 hours</fact5> or 31*60 = 1860 minutes. So, we can set up the equation 15x + time spent watching TV on other days = 1860. We know that he watched a 6-hour episode on <fact1>Saturday</fact1> and <fact1>Sunday</fact1>, so he watched 2*6 = 12 hours or 12*60 = 720 minutes of TV on those days.

Now we can plug in the values we know into the equation: 15x + 720 + 135 + 960 = 1860. Simplifying the equation, we get 15x + 1815 = 1860. Subtracting 1815 from both sides, we get 15x = 45.

If he watched <fact10>25 hours of TV in all</fact10>, how many <fact11>15-minute episodes</fact11> did he watch on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>?
Answer: First, we need to find the total amount of time Diego spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 4-hour episode each night, so he watched 2 * <fact2>4 hours</fact2> = 8 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 5-hour episode and a 45-minute show. We need to convert the 45-minute show to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60/45 = 4/3 hours in a 45-minute show. Therefore, he watched 5 + 4/3 = 19/3 hours on Thursday. On Friday, he watched two 5-hour episodes, so he watched 2 * <fact9>5 hours</fact9> = 10 hours. Therefore, he watched 8 + 19/3 + 10 = 8 + 19/3 = 43/3 + 10 = 43/3 + 30/3 = 73/3 hours on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. We know that he watched 25 hours in all, so he must have watched 25 - 73/3 = 25 - 73/3 = (75 - 73)/3 = 2/3 hours on Wednesday. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 60/15 = 4 minutes in a 15-minute show. Therefore, he watched 2/3 * 60 = 40 minutes on Wednesday.

Answer: We know that Hiroshi watched a total of <fact11>24 hours of TV</fact11>. On <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, he watched a total of 2 * <fact3>3 hours</fact3> = 6 hours of TV. On <fact6>Friday</fact6>, he watched a total of <fact7>2 hours</fact7> + <fact8>0.5 hours</fact8> = 2.5 hours of TV. On <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, he watched a total of 3 * <fact10>5 hours</fact10> = 15 hours of TV. This means that on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>, he watched a total of <fact11>24 hours</fact11> - 6 hours - 2.5 hours - 15 hours = 0.5 hours of TV. Since we know that he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>30-minute show</fact5> on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>, we can set up the equation 0.5 hours = x * 0.5 hours, where x is the number of episodes he watched. Solving for x, we get x = 1. Therefore, Hiroshi watched <fact12>1</fact12> 30-minute episode on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>."

On <fact2>Monday and Tuesday</fact2>, he watched a <fact3>3-hour episode</fact3> of his favorite show each night. On <fact4>Wednesday</fact4>, he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>15-minute show</fact5>. On <fact6>Thursday</fact6>, he finished homework early and watched a <fact7>5-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>30-minute show</fact8>.

If he watched <fact10>21 hours of TV in all</fact10>, how many <fact5>15-minute episodes</fact5> did he watch on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4>?
Answer: The total time Bodhi spent watching TV on <fact2>Monday and Tuesday</fact2> is <fact3>3 hours</fact3> * 2 = 6 hours.
The total time Bodhi spent watching TV on <fact9>Friday</fact9> is <fact3>3 hours</fact3> * 3 = 9 hours.
The total time Bodhi spent watching TV on <fact6>Thursday</fact6> is <fact7>5 hours</fact7> + <fact8>30 minutes</fact8> = 5.5 hours.
So the total time Bodhi spent watching TV on <fact2>Monday and Tuesday</fact2>, <fact9>Friday</fact9>, and <fact6>Thursday</fact6> is 6 + 9 + 5.5 = 20.5 hours.
Since Bodhi watched <fact10>21 hours of TV in all</fact10>, he must have watched <fact10>21</fact10> - <fact11>20.5</fact11> = 0.5 hours on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4>.
The time Bodhi spent watching TV on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4> is equal to the time he spent watching <fact5>15-minute episodes</fact5> plus the time he spent watching other episodes.
Since the time he spent watching other episodes is not specified, we will assume it is 0 hours.
So the time he spent watching <fact5>15-minute episodes</fact5> is <fact12>0.5 hours</fact12> * <fact13>60 minutes per hour</fact13> = 30 minutes.
Since each <fact5>15-minute episode</fact5> is 15 minutes long, the number of <fact5>15-minute episodes</fact5> Bodhi watched on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4> is <fact14>30 minutes</fact14> / <fact15>15 minutes per episode</fact15> = 2 episodes.

If he watched <fact5>23 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>15-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday</fact6>?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many hours James watched TV on Thursday and Friday. Since he watched a 4-hour episode each night, he watched <fact1>4</fact1> * 2 = 8 hours of TV on Thursday and Friday. On Sunday, he watched a 4-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since 45 minutes is equal to 0.75 hours, he watched 4 + 0.75 = 4.75 hours of TV on Sunday. On Monday, he watched three 3-hour episodes, so he watched 3 * 3 = 9 hours of TV on Monday. So, in total, he watched 8 + 4.75 + 9 = 21.75 hours of TV on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday. Since he watched 23 hours of TV in all, he watched 23 - 21.75 = 1.25 hours of TV on Saturday. Since each episode of the 15-minute show is 0.25 hours long, he watched 1.25 / 0.25 = 5 episodes of the 15-minute show on Saturday. The answer is {5}."

On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched five 2-hour episodes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday?","Reformatted Question: Luca watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. <fact1>On Saturday and Sunday, he watched a 5-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact1>. <fact2>On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2>. <fact3>On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. <fact4>On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched five 2-hour episodes</fact4>. If he watched <fact5>24 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>15-minute episodes did he watch on Monday</fact6>?

Answer: We can start by calculating the total hours Luca watched TV on Saturday and Sunday. <fact1>On Saturday and Sunday, he watched a 5-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact1>. So, he watched 5 + 5 = 10 hours of TV on Saturday and Sunday.

Next, we can calculate the total hours Luca watched TV on Tuesday. <fact3>On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. We need to convert the 15-minute show to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the 15-minute show is equal to 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So, the total hours Luca watched TV on Tuesday is 2 + 0.25 = 2.25 hours.

Now, we can calculate the total hours Luca watched TV on Wednesday. <fact4>On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched five 2-hour episodes</fact4>. So, the total hours Luca watched TV on Wednesday is 5 * 2 = 10 hours.

We can now calculate the total hours Luca watched TV on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. <fact2>On Monday, he watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show</fact2> and <fact3>On Tuesday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3> and <fact4>On Wednesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched five 2-hour episodes</fact4>. We need to convert the 15-minute show to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the 15-minute show is equal to 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So, the total hours Luca watched TV on Monday is x + 0.25, where x is the number of episodes of the 15-minute show. The total hours Luca watched TV on Tuesday is 2.25 hours. The total hours Luca watched TV on Wednesday is 10 hours.

We can now set up an equation to solve for x. The total hours Luca watched TV on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is equal to the total hours he watched TV in all, which is 24 hours. So, the equation is (x + 0.25) + 2.25 + 10 = 24.

We can now solve for x. (x + 0.25) + 2.25 + 10 = 24. x + 0.25 + 2.25 + 10 = 24. x + 12.5 = 24. x = 24 - 12.5. x = 11.5.

Since x is the number of episodes of the 15-minute show, we can now find the number of 15-minute episodes Luca watched on Monday. Since each episode is 15 minutes long, we can divide x by 0.25 (which is the number of hours in a 15-minute episode) to get the number of episodes. So, the number of 15-minute episodes Luca watched on Monday is 11.5 / 0.25 = 46.

The answer is {46}."

Answer: We know that Ravi watched <fact3>4-hour episodes</fact3> on <fact2>Wednesday and Thursday</fact2>, so he watched a total of 2 * <fact3>4</fact3> = 8 hours of TV on those nights. We also know that he watched a <fact7>5-hour episode</fact7> on <fact6>Saturday</fact6> and three <fact10>3-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Sunday</fact9>, so he watched a total of 1 * <fact7>5</fact7> + 3 * <fact10>3</fact10> = 14 hours of TV on those nights.

We also know that he watched 2 hours of TV on <fact4>Friday</fact4>, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation 15x = 120 and solve for x.

Answer: Thiago watched <fact1>5 hours</fact1> of TV each night on <fact1>Sunday</fact1> and <fact1>Monday</fact1>, so he watched <fact1>5 hours</fact1> * 2 = 10 hours of TV on <fact1>Sunday</fact1> and <fact1>Monday</fact1>. This means that he watched <fact5>25 hours</fact5> - <fact1>10 hours</fact1> = 15 hours of TV on <fact7>Tuesday</fact7>, <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>, and <fact4>Thursday</fact4>. Thiago watched <fact2>30-minute episodes</fact2> on <fact7>Tuesday</fact7> and <fact3>Wednesday</fact3>, so let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on <fact7>Tuesday</fact7> as x and the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on <fact3>Wednesday</fact3> as y.

If he watched <fact8>21 hours of TV in all</fact8>, how many <fact5>45-minute episodes</fact5> did he watch on <fact4>Thursday</fact4>?
Answer: Let's first find out how many hours of TV Luis watched on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. On <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, he watched a <fact3>5-hour episode</fact3> of his favorite show each night, so he watched 2*<fact3>5</fact3> = 10 hours. On <fact6>Friday</fact6>, he watched a <fact3>5-hour episode</fact3> and a <fact5>30-minute show</fact5>. We need to convert the 30-minute show to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60/30 = 2 hours in a 30-minute show. So, he watched a total of <fact3>5</fact3> + <fact5>2</fact5> = 7 hours on Friday. On <fact7>Saturday</fact7>, he watched two <fact3>2-hour episodes</fact3>, so he watched a total of 2*<fact3>2</fact3> = 4 hours on Saturday. So, Luis watched a total of 10 + 7 + 4 = 21 hours of TV on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. This is consistent with the information in the question, which states that he watched <fact8>21 hours of TV in all</fact8>. Now, let's find out how many hours of TV Luis watched on Thursday. We know that Luis watched a total of 21 hours of TV on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. We also know that he watched a total of 10 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday, 7 hours on Friday, and 4 hours on Saturday. So, the number of hours of TV he watched on Thursday is 21 - 10 - 7 - 4 = 0 hours. However, the question states that Luis watched a few episodes of a <fact5>45-minute show</fact5> on Thursday. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60/45 = 4/3 hours in a 45-minute show. We also know that Luis watched 0 hours of TV on Thursday, but we know that he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>45-minute show</fact5>. This means that he must have watched some episodes of a <fact5>45-minute show</fact5> on Thursday, and the total number of hours of TV he watched on Thursday is some multiple of 4/3 hours. Let's call this multiple x. Then, the total number of hours of TV he watched on Thursday is (4/3)x. We know that this is equal to 0 hours, so we can set up the equation (4/3)x = 0. Solving for x, we get x = 0. This means that Luis did not watch any episodes of a <fact5>45-minute show</fact5> on Thursday, which is inconsistent with the information in the question. However, this is not possible, so we need to re-examine our work. Let's go back to the equation (4/3)x = 0.

On Sunday, he watched a few episodes of a 45-minute show. On Monday, he finished homework early and watched a 3-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Tuesday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 4-hour episodes. If he watched 26 hours of TV in all, how many 45-minute episodes did he watch on Sunday?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Ibrahim watches TV after he finishes his homework every night</fact1>. On <fact2>Friday and Saturday</fact2>, he watched a <fact3>5-hour episode</fact3> of his favorite show each night. On <fact4>Sunday</fact4>, he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>45-minute show</fact5>. On <fact6>Monday</fact6>, he finished homework early and watched a <fact7>3-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>15-minute show</fact8>. On <fact9>Tuesday</fact9>, he got to stay up late, so he watched three <fact10>4-hour episodes</fact10>. If he watched <fact11>26 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>45-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Sunday</fact4>?
Answer: Let's start by finding the total hours of TV watched on Friday and Saturday. <fact2>Friday and Saturday</fact2> are two days, and <fact3>each night</fact3> he watched a <fact3>5-hour episode</fact3>. Therefore, he watched 5 hours * 2 days = 10 hours of TV on Friday and Saturday. 
He watched <fact5>45-minute episodes</fact5> on <fact4>Sunday</fact4>. We'll call the number of episodes he watched on Sunday ""x"". Therefore, the total hours of TV watched on Sunday is 45 minutes * x / 60 minutes per hour = 0.75x hours. 
He watched a <fact7>3-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>15-minute show</fact8> on <fact6>Monday</fact6>. The <fact8>15-minute show</fact8> is equivalent to 0.25 hours. Therefore, the total hours of TV watched on Monday is 3 hours + 0.25 hours = 3.25 hours. 
He watched three <fact10>4-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Tuesday</fact9>. Therefore, the total hours of TV watched on Tuesday is 4 hours * 3 episodes = 12 hours. 
We know that the total hours of TV watched is <fact11>26 hours</fact11>. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 10 hours (Friday and Saturday) + 0.75x hours (Sunday) + 3.25 hours (Monday) + 12 hours (Tuesday) = 26 hours. 
Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 + 0.75x + 3.25 + 12 = 26. 
Combine the constants: 25.25 + 0.75x = 26. 
Subtract 25.25 from both sides: 0.75x = 0.75. 
Divide both sides by 0.75: x = 1. 
Therefore, Ibrahim watched 1 <fact12>45-minute episode</fact12> on <fact4>Sunday</fact4>."

On <fact9>Friday</fact9>, he got to stay up late, so he watched four <fact10>3-hour episodes</fact10>. If he watched <fact11>29 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Wednesday</fact4>?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of hours Liam watched TV on Monday and Tuesday. He watched a <fact3>5-hour episode</fact3> of his favorite show each night, so he watched a total of 2 * <fact3>5 hours</fact3> = 10 hours on Monday and Tuesday. 
Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Liam watched TV on Thursday. He watched a <fact7>5-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>30-minute show</fact8>. We need to convert the 30-minute show to hours, which is <fact8>30 minutes</fact8> / 60 = 0.5 hours. So, he watched a total of <fact7>5 hours</fact7> + 0.5 hours = 5.5 hours on Thursday.
Next, let's calculate the total number of hours Liam watched TV on Friday. He watched four <fact10>3-hour episodes</fact10>, so he watched a total of 4 * <fact10>3 hours</fact10> = 12 hours on Friday.
Now, let's calculate the total number of hours Liam watched TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. This is 10 + 5.5 + 12 = 27.5 hours.
We know that Liam watched <fact11>29 hours of TV in all</fact11>, so he must have watched <fact11>29 hours</fact11> - 27.5 hours = 1.5 hours on Wednesday.
We know that he watched a few episodes of a <fact5>15-minute show</fact5> on Wednesday, and we want to find out how many episodes he watched. Let's call the number of episodes he watched x. Then, the total number of minutes he watched is x * <fact5>15 minutes</fact5> = 15x. We know that this is equal to 1.5 hours, which is 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes. So, we have the equation 15x = 90.
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15, which gives us x = 90 / 15 = 6.
Therefore, Liam watched 6 episodes of the 15-minute show on Wednesday."

Answer: We know that Faisal watched a total of <fact11>28 hours</fact11> of TV. We also know that he watched five <fact10>3-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, which is a total of 5 * <fact3>3</fact3> = 15 hours. On <fact6>Friday</fact6>, he watched a <fact7>6-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>15-minute show</fact8>. We need to convert the <fact8>15-minute show</fact8> to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, a 15-minute show is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. So on <fact6>Friday</fact6>, he watched a total of <fact7>6</fact7> + 0.25 = 6.25 hours. On <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, he watched a total of 2 * <fact3>3</fact3> = 6 hours.

If he watched <fact5>28 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>15-minute episodes did he watch on Saturday</fact6>?
Answer: Let's start by calculating the total hours of TV Qasim watched on Thursday and Friday. He watched a 4-hour episode each night, so he watched a total of 2 * <fact1>4 hours</fact1> = 8 hours of TV on Thursday and Friday. 

On Sunday, he watched a 3-hour episode and a 45-minute show. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the 45-minute show is equivalent to 0.75 hours. So, he watched a total of <fact3>3 hours</fact3> + <fact3>0.75 hours</fact3> = 3.75 hours of TV on Sunday.

On Monday, he watched five 3-hour episodes. So, he watched a total of 5 * <fact4>3 hours</fact4> = 15 hours of TV on Monday.

We know that Qasim watched a total of <fact5>28 hours of TV in all</fact5>. So, we can subtract the hours he watched on Thursday and Friday, Sunday, and Monday from the total hours to find the hours he watched on Saturday. 

<fact5>28 hours</fact5> - <fact1>8 hours</fact1> - <fact3>3.75 hours</fact3> - <fact4>15 hours</fact4> = <fact5>28 hours</fact5> - <fact1>8 hours</fact1> - <fact3>3.75 hours</fact3> - <fact4>15 hours</fact4> = 1.25 hours.

Since Qasim watched a few episodes of a 15-minute show on Saturday, we can convert the total hours he watched on Saturday to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1.25 hours is equivalent to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes.

Since each episode is 15 minutes long, we can divide the total minutes by 15 to find the number of episodes. 75 / 15 = 5.

The answer is {5}."

If he watched <fact11>27 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>45-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Saturday</fact4>?
Answer: Let's denote the number of 45-minute episodes Umar watched on Saturday as x. Then, the total time he spent watching TV on Saturday is 45x minutes. 

On Thursday and Friday, Umar watched a 6-hour episode each night, so he spent 6*2=12 hours watching TV on these two nights. 

On Sunday, he watched a 6-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so he spent 6+0.5=6.5 hours watching TV on this night.

On Monday, he watched two 2-hour episodes, so he spent 2*2=4 hours watching TV on this night.

We are given that Umar watched 27 hours of TV in all. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the total time he spent watching TV:

12 + 45x + 6.5 + 4 = 27

Simplifying the equation, we get:

45x + 22.5 = 27

Subtracting 22.5 from both sides of the equation, we get:

45x = 4.5

Dividing both sides of the equation by 45, we get:

x = 4.5/45

x = 0.1

Since x represents the number of 45-minute episodes Umar watched on Saturday, we can conclude that he watched 0.1*60=6 minutes of the 45-minute show. However, since the question asks for the number of 45-minute episodes, we can multiply 0.1 by 60/45 to get the number of 45-minute episodes."

We know that the total time he watched TV on Monday is 30 minutes. We also know that each episode of the 15-minute show is 15 minutes. So, the number of episodes he watched on Monday is 30 minutes / 15 minutes per episode = 2 episodes.

If he watched <fact11>26 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>30-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>?
Answer: Let's first calculate the total hours Ali watched TV on Sunday and Monday: <fact2>Sunday and Monday</fact2> * <fact3>6-hour episode</fact3> = 12 hours.
On Wednesday, he watched a <fact7>4-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>30-minute show</fact8>. We can convert the 30-minute show to hours by dividing by 60: <fact8>30-minute show</fact8> / 60 = 0.5 hours. So, on Wednesday, he watched a total of <fact7>4-hour episode</fact7> + <fact8>0.5 hours</fact8> = 4.5 hours.
On Thursday, he watched four <fact10>2-hour episodes</fact10>. We can calculate the total hours he watched on Thursday by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode: 4 * <fact10>2-hour episodes</fact10> = 8 hours.
Now, let's add up the total hours Ali watched TV on each day: 12 hours (Sunday and Monday) + 4.5 hours (Wednesday) + 8 hours (Thursday) = 24.5 hours.
Since Ali watched <fact11>26 hours of TV in all</fact11>, and he watched 24.5 hours on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, we can find out how many hours he watched on Tuesday by subtracting 24.5 from 26: 26 - 24.5 = 1.5 hours.
We know that Ali watched a few episodes of a <fact5>30-minute show</fact5> on Tuesday. We can find out how many episodes he watched by dividing the total hours he watched on Tuesday by the length of each episode: 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours (30 minutes) = 3 episodes.

If he watched <fact11>28 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>45-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4>?
Answer: Liam watched <fact3>4 hours</fact3> of TV each night on <fact2>Sunday and Monday</fact2>, so he watched 4*2 = 8 hours of TV on those nights. On <fact9>Thursday</fact9>, he watched 3*<fact10>4 hours</fact10> = 12 hours of TV. This makes a total of 8 + 12 = 20 hours of TV that he watched on those nights. Since he watched <fact11>28 hours of TV in all</fact11>, he must have watched 28 - 20 = 8 hours of TV on <fact4>Tuesday</fact4> and <fact6>Wednesday</fact6>.

If he watched <fact11>28 hours of TV in all</fact11>, how many <fact12>15-minute episodes</fact12> did he watch on <fact4>Monday</fact4>?
Answer: We first need to find out how many hours of TV Esteban watched on Saturday and Sunday. Since he watched a 5-hour episode each night, he watched a total of 2 * <fact3>5 hours</fact3> = 10 hours of TV on Saturday and Sunday. We can then subtract this from the total hours of TV watched to find the hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is <fact11>28 hours</fact11> - <fact2>10 hours</fact2> = 18 hours. We can then subtract the hours watched on Tuesday and Wednesday from the hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the hours watched on Monday. The hours watched on Monday is <fact13>18 hours</fact13> - <fact7>6 hours</fact7> - 5 * <fact10>2 hours</fact10> = <fact13>18 hours</fact13> - <fact7>6 hours</fact7> - <fact14>10 hours</fact14> = 2 hours.

The hours watched on Monday is <fact13>2 hours</fact13> * 60 = 120 minutes. We can then divide the total minutes watched on Monday by the length of each episode to find the number of episodes watched. The number of episodes watched on Monday is <fact13>120 minutes</fact13> / <fact5>15 minutes</fact5> = <fact12>8 episodes</fact12>."

Answer: We know that Bodhi watched a <fact3>4-hour episode</fact3> each night on <fact2>Thursday and Friday</fact2>, so he watched 2 * 4 = 8 hours of TV on those nights. On <fact6>Sunday</fact6>, he watched a <fact7>4-hour episode</fact7> and a <fact8>30-minute show</fact8>, which is equivalent to 0.5 hours. So he watched 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 hours of TV on Sunday.

Answer: We know that Oscar watched <fact3>3-hour episodes</fact3> on <fact2>Saturday and Sunday</fact2>, so he watched 2 * <fact3>3</fact3> = 6 hours of TV on those days. We also know that he watched <fact10>4-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Wednesday</fact9>, so he watched 4 * <fact10>4</fact10> = 16 hours of TV on that day.

If he watched <fact5>26 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>15-minute episodes did he watch on Thursday</fact6>?
Answer: We can start by finding the total amount of time Arjun spent watching TV on Tuesday and Wednesday. <fact1>On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 6-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact1>, so he spent 6 + 6 = 12 hours watching TV on these two nights. 
We can also find the total amount of time Arjun spent watching TV on Friday. <fact3>On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, a 5-hour episode is equal to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes. A 15-minute show is equal to 15 minutes. So the total amount of time Arjun spent watching TV on Friday is 300 + 15 = 315 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60, which gives us 315 / 60 = 5.25 hours. 
We can also find the total amount of time Arjun spent watching TV on Saturday. <fact4>On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 4-hour episodes</fact4>. A 4-hour episode is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60, which gives us 240 / 60 = 4 hours. Arjun watched two 4-hour episodes, so the total amount of time he spent watching TV on Saturday is 4 * 2 = 8 hours. 
We can now find the total amount of time Arjun spent watching TV on Thursday by subtracting the total amount of time he spent watching TV on Tuesday and Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday from the total amount of time he spent watching TV. <fact5>On Tuesday and Wednesday, he watched a 6-hour episode of his favorite show each night</fact5>, so he spent 12 hours watching TV on these two nights. <fact3>On Friday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 15-minute show</fact3>, so he spent 5.25 hours watching TV on Friday. <fact4>On Saturday, he got to stay up late, so he watched two 4-hour episodes</fact4>, so he spent 8 hours watching TV on Saturday. So the total amount of time Arjun spent watching TV on Tuesday and Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday is 12 + 5.25 + 8 = 25.25 hours. Since Arjun watched <fact5>26 hours of TV in all</fact5>, the total amount of time he spent watching TV on Thursday is 26 - 25.25 = 0.75 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60, which gives us 0.75 * 60 = 45 minutes. Since each episode is 15 minutes long, we can find the number of episodes by dividing the total amount of time by the length of each episode, which gives us 45 / 15 = 3 episodes. Therefore, Arjun watched <fact6>3 15-minute episodes</fact6> on Thursday."

If he watched <fact5>23 hours of TV in all</fact5>, how many <fact6>15-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday</fact6>?
Answer: First, let's calculate the total hours of TV watched on Monday and Tuesday. This is <fact1>5 hours</fact1> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 10 hours.
On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a <fact2>15-minute</fact2> show. Let's call the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday x. The total time he watched on Wednesday is <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> * x.
On Thursday, he watched a <fact3>4-hour</fact3> episode and a <fact3>15-minute</fact3> show. The total time he watched on Thursday is <fact3>4 hours</fact3> + <fact3>15 minutes</fact3>.
On Friday, he watched two <fact4>4-hour</fact4> episodes. The total time he watched on Friday is <fact4>4 hours</fact4> * <fact4>2</fact4> = 8 hours.
The total time he watched on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday is <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> * x + <fact3>4 hours</fact3> + <fact3>15 minutes</fact3> + <fact4>8 hours</fact4>.
We know that the total time he watched on all four days is <fact5>23 hours</fact5>. Since there are <fact7>60 minutes</fact7> in an hour, we can convert <fact5>23 hours</fact5> to minutes: <fact5>23 hours</fact5> * <fact7>60 minutes</fact7> = 1380 minutes.
We can now set up the equation: <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> * x + <fact3>4 hours</fact3> + <fact3>15 minutes</fact3> + <fact4>8 hours</fact4> = 1380 minutes.
We can convert the hours to minutes: <fact3>4 hours</fact3> = <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact7>60 minutes</fact7> = 240 minutes, and <fact4>8 hours</fact4> = <fact4>8</fact4> * <fact7>60 minutes</fact7> = 480 minutes.
Now we have the equation: <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> * x + 240 minutes + 15 minutes + 480 minutes = 1380 minutes.
Combine the constants: 240 + 15 + 480 = 735 minutes. Now we have the equation: <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> * x + 735 minutes = 1380 minutes.
Subtract 735 from both sides: <fact2>15 minutes</fact2> * x = 645 minutes.
Divide both sides by 15: x = 645 / 15 = 43.
Therefore, Santiago watched 43 episodes of the 15-minute show on Wednesday.
The answer is {43}."

Answer: Noah watched <fact3>3-hour episodes</fact3> on <fact2>Tuesday and Wednesday</fact2>, so he watched 2 * <fact3>3 hours</fact3> = 6 hours of TV on those nights. He also watched <fact10>3-hour episodes</fact10> on <fact9>Saturday</fact9>, so he watched 4 * <fact10>3 hours</fact10> = 12 hours of TV on that night.

Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Emma bought as x. Since her husband bought a package of 18 new spoons, the total number of spoons that Emma had after her husband gave her the new spoons is x + 18. After Emma used 10 spoons to sample her stuffed peppers, the total number of spoons she had left is x + 18 - 10 = x + 8. According to the information in the question, at this point, Emma had a total of 30 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation x + 8 = 30 to solve for x. Solving for x, we get x = 30 - 8 = 22. Therefore, the package that Emma bought contained 22 spoons.

The answer is {22}."

Answer: Let's denote the number of plates in the package Quinn bought as x. Quinn had x + 19 plates after her husband gave her the new package. Quinn used 7 plates to sample the stew, so she had x + 19 - 7 = x + 12 plates left. We are told that she had a total of 30 plates when she set the table. Therefore, x + 12 = 30. To find the value of x, we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation: x = 30 - 12 = 18. Therefore, Quinn had 18 plates in the package she bought."

How many plates were in the package that Sakura bought?
Answer: Let's denote the number of plates in the package that Sakura bought as x. Then, we can write an equation to represent the situation: x + 9 - 10 = 24. This is because Sakura's husband gave her 9 new plates, but she used 10 plates for sampling, so we subtract 10 from the total number of plates. Now, we can solve for x: x + 9 - 10 = 24 --> x - 1 = 24 --> x = 25. Therefore, the package that Sakura bought had 25 plates."

Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of <fact6>28 spoons</fact6>. How many spoons were in the package that Jasmine bought?
Answer: Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Jasmine bought as x. We know that Jasmine's husband gave her a package of 17 new spoons, and she used 6 spoons to sample her vegetable lasagna. So, the total number of spoons that Jasmine had after her husband gave her the new package is x + 17. After she used 6 spoons, she had (x + 17) - 6 spoons left. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 28 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation (x + 17) - 6 = 28. Solving for x, we get x + 11 = 28, x = 17. However, this is the number of spoons Jasmine's husband gave her. We need to find the number of spoons in the package that Jasmine bought. Since Jasmine's husband gave her 17 spoons, the number of spoons in the package that Jasmine bought is 28 - 17 = 11.

Answer: Since Amelia has <fact1>2 grandchildren</fact1> and she wants to make the same items for each of them, she needs to multiply the amount of wool required for each item by <fact1>2</fact1>. 

So, for a <fact3>vest</fact3>, she needs <fact4>17 skeins</fact4> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 34 skeins of wool.
For a <fact3>shawl</fact3>, she needs <fact5>11 skeins</fact5> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 22 skeins of wool.
For a <fact3>beanie</fact3>, she needs <fact6>18 skeins</fact6> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 36 skeins of wool.
For a <fact3>pair of socks</fact3>, she needs <fact7>12 skeins</fact7> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 24 skeins of wool.
For a <fact3>pair of leg warmers</fact3>, she needs <fact8>6 skeins</fact8> * <fact1>2</fact1> = 12 skeins of wool.

How many <fact13>skeins of wool</fact13> will she need to buy?
Answer: To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total skeins needed for each item and then add them up. 
The total skeins needed for a vest is <fact8>6 skeins</fact8> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 18 skeins.
The total skeins needed for a cardigan is <fact9>11 skeins</fact9> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 33 skeins.
The total skeins needed for a sweater is <fact10>7 skeins</fact10> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 21 skeins.
The total skeins needed for a pair of booties is <fact11>4 skeins</fact11> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 12 skeins.
The total skeins needed for a pair of gloves is <fact12>10 skeins</fact12> * <fact1>3 grandchildren</fact1> = 30 skeins.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?
Answer: To determine how many skeins of wool Haruka needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each type of clothing and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren. 

For each grandchild, Haruka needs <fact4>18 skeins</fact4> for a tunic, <fact5>7 skeins</fact5> for a vest, <fact6>8 skeins</fact6> for a poncho, <fact7>3 skeins</fact7> for a pair of leg warmers, and <fact8>12 skeins</fact8> for a pair of booties. 

The total number of skeins required for each grandchild is <fact4>18</fact4> + <fact5>7</fact5> + <fact6>8</fact6> + <fact7>3</fact7> + <fact8>12</fact8> = 48 skeins.

Since Haruka has 4 grandchildren, she needs to multiply the total number of skeins required for each grandchild by 4.

Answer: Since Nadia is making winter wear for her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, and each of them will receive a <fact3>hat, cardigan, sweater, leg warmers, and booties</fact3>, the total number of items she will make is 4 * 5 = 20 items.
To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins required for each item and add them up. For a <fact3>hat</fact3>, it takes <fact4>3 skeins of wool</fact4>, so the total number of skeins required for 4 hats is 4 * <fact4>3</fact4> = 12 skeins. 
For a <fact5>cardigan</fact5>, it takes <fact5>11 skeins of wool</fact5>, so the total number of skeins required for 4 cardigans is 4 * <fact5>11</fact5> = 44 skeins. 
For a <fact6>sweater</fact6>, it takes <fact6>17 skeins of wool</fact6>, so the total number of skeins required for 4 sweaters is 4 * <fact6>17</fact6> = 68 skeins. 
For a <fact7>pair of leg warmers</fact7>, it takes <fact7>14 skeins of wool</fact7>, so the total number of skeins required for 4 pairs of leg warmers is 4 * <fact7>14</fact7> = 56 skeins. 
For a <fact8>pair of booties</fact8>, it takes <fact8>13 skeins of wool</fact8>, so the total number of skeins required for 4 pairs of booties is 4 * <fact8>13</fact8> = 52 skeins.
Therefore, the total number of skeins of wool needed is 12 + 44 + 68 + 56 + 52 = 232 skeins.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?
Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren. 

For a shawl, <fact4>17 skeins of wool</fact4> are needed for each grandchild, so for 5 grandchildren, <fact1>17</fact1> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 85 skeins of wool are needed for shawls.

For a sweater, <fact5>13 skeins of wool</fact5> are needed for each grandchild, so for 5 grandchildren, <fact3>13</fact3> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 65 skeins of wool are needed for sweaters.

For a cardigan, <fact6>9 skeins of wool</fact6> are needed for each grandchild, so for 5 grandchildren, <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 45 skeins of wool are needed for cardigans.

For a pair of mittens, <fact7>16 skeins of wool</fact7> are needed for each grandchild, so for 5 grandchildren, <fact5>16</fact5> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 80 skeins of wool are needed for mittens.

For a pair of gloves, <fact8>10 skeins of wool</fact8> are needed for each grandchild, so for 5 grandchildren, <fact6>10</fact6> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 50 skeins of wool are needed for gloves.

How many <fact13>skeins of wool</fact13> will she need to buy?
Answer: To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to multiply the number of grandchildren by the number of items each one needs. Since they're quintuplets, they all need the same items. So, the total number of items needed is 5 * <fact3>1 cardigan</fact3> + 5 * <fact4>1 shawl</fact4> + 5 * <fact5>1 tunic</fact5> + 5 * <fact6>1 pair of mittens</fact6> + 5 * <fact7>1 pair of gloves</fact7>. This simplifies to 5 * (<fact3>1 cardigan</fact3> + <fact4>1 shawl</fact4> + <fact5>1 tunic</fact5> + <fact6>1 pair of mittens</fact6> + <fact7>1 pair of gloves</fact7>). Since they all need the same items, we can just multiply the total number of items by 5. So, the total number of items is 5 * (<fact8>8 skeins of wool</fact8> + <fact9>12 skeins of wool</fact9> + <fact10>6 skeins of wool</fact10> + <fact11>9 skeins of wool</fact11> + <fact12>3 skeins of wool</fact12>), which is 5 * <fact14>38 skeins of wool</fact14>. To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we multiply 5 by 38, which is 190. Therefore, Olivia will need to buy <fact15>190 skeins of wool</fact15>."

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?
Answer: To determine how many skeins of wool Gabrielle will need, we must first calculate the total number of skeins needed for one set of winter wear. The total number of skeins needed for one set is the sum of the skeins needed for each item: <fact4>8</fact4> (beanie) + <fact5>17</fact5> (tunic) + <fact6>6</fact6> (cardigan) + <fact7>13</fact7> (booties) + <fact8>12</fact8> (gloves) = 56 skeins.

How many <fact9>skeins of wool will she need to buy</fact9>?
Answer: Since Yara has <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> and each of them needs <fact3>a tunic, beanie, vest, mittens, and booties</fact3>, she will need to make a total of 5 * 5 = 25 of each item. 
She will need <fact4>10 skeins of wool</fact4> for each of the 25 tunics, so the total amount of wool needed for the tunics is <fact4>10</fact4> * 25 = 250 skeins.
She will need <fact5>7 skeins of wool</fact5> for each of the 25 beanies, so the total amount of wool needed for the beanies is <fact5>7</fact5> * 25 = 175 skeins.
She will need <fact6>11 skeins of wool</fact6> for each of the 25 vests, so the total amount of wool needed for the vests is <fact6>11</fact6> * 25 = 275 skeins.
She will need <fact7>15 skeins of wool</fact7> for each of the 25 pairs of mittens, so the total amount of wool needed for the mittens is <fact7>15</fact7> * 25 = 375 skeins.
She will need <fact8>16 skeins of wool</fact8> for each of the 25 pairs of booties, so the total amount of wool needed for the booties is <fact8>16</fact8> * 25 = 400 skeins.

How many <fact13>skeins of wool</fact13> will she need to buy?
Answer: To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to multiply the number of skeins needed for each item by the number of grandchildren, and then add up the results. For the poncho, Daphne needs <fact8>6 skeins of wool</fact8> per child, so she will need <fact8>6</fact8> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 24 skeins of wool for the ponchos. For the shawls, she needs <fact9>9 skeins of wool</fact9> per child, so she will need <fact9>9</fact9> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 36 skeins of wool for the shawls. For the tunics, she needs <fact10>16 skeins of wool</fact10> per child, so she will need <fact10>16</fact10> * <fact1>4</fact1> = 64 skeins of wool for the tunics. For the socks, she needs <fact11>5 skeins of wool</fact11> per pair, and each child gets 2 pairs, so she will need <fact11>5</fact11> * <fact1>4</fact1> * 2 = 40 skeins of wool for the socks. For the leg warmers, she needs <fact12>3 skeins of wool</fact12> per pair, and each child gets 2 pairs, so she will need <fact12>3</fact12> * <fact1>4</fact1> * 2 = 24 skeins of wool for the leg warmers.

It takes <fact4>17 skeins of wool to make a beanie</fact4>, so she will need <fact4>17</fact4> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 85 skeins of wool for the beanies. It takes <fact5>4 for a hat</fact5>, so she will need <fact5>4</fact5> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 20 skeins of wool for the hats. It takes <fact6>14 for a vest</fact6>, so she will need <fact6>14</fact6> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 70 skeins of wool for the vests. It takes <fact7>3 for a pair of leg warmers</fact7>, so she will need <fact7>3</fact7> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 15 skeins of wool for the leg warmers. It takes <fact8>10 for a pair of mittens</fact8>, so she will need <fact8>10</fact8> * <fact2>5</fact2> = 50 skeins of wool for the mittens. Therefore, she will need <fact9>85 + 20 + 70 + 15 + 50 = 240 skeins of wool</fact9> to buy."

Answer: Winnie needs to buy <fact1>2</fact1> sweaters, so she will need <fact1>2</fact1> * <fact8>5 skeins of wool</fact8> = 10 skeins of wool for the sweaters. She needs to buy <fact1>2</fact1> cardigans, so she will need <fact1>2</fact1> * <fact9>13 skeins of wool</fact9> = 26 skeins of wool for the cardigans.

How many <fact8>skeins of wool</fact8> will she need to buy?
Answer: To determine the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to calculate the total number of skeins needed for each item and then add them together. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of skeins needed for the <fact3>sweaters</fact3>. Since there are <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> and each sweater requires <fact8>16 skeins of wool</fact8>, the total number of skeins needed for the sweaters is <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact8>16</fact8> = 80 skeins.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of skeins needed for the <fact4>tunics</fact4>. Since there are <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> and each tunic requires <fact9>3 skeins of wool</fact9>, the total number of skeins needed for the tunics is <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact9>3</fact9> = 15 skeins.

Then, we need to calculate the total number of skeins needed for the <fact5>hats</fact5>. Since there are <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> and each hat requires <fact10>5 skeins of wool</fact10>, the total number of skeins needed for the hats is <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact10>5</fact10> = 25 skeins.

After that, we need to calculate the total number of skeins needed for the <fact6>socks</fact6>. Since there are <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> and each pair of socks requires <fact11>11 skeins of wool</fact11>, the total number of skeins needed for the socks is <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact11>11</fact11> = 55 skeins.

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of skeins needed for the <fact7>leg warmers</fact7>. Since there are <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1> and each pair of leg warmers requires <fact12>15 skeins of wool</fact12>, the total number of skeins needed for the leg warmers is <fact1>5</fact1> * <fact12>15</fact12> = 75 skeins.

To find the total number of skeins of wool needed, we add the number of skeins needed for each item together: 80 + 15 + 25 + 55 + 75 = 250 skeins.

Therefore, Valentina will need to buy <fact8>250 skeins of wool</fact8> to make the winter wear for her grandchildren."
1191,"Nia is knitting winter wear for her 4 grandchildren. They're quadruplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, vest, tunic, leg warmers, and booties for each of them.

How many <fact9>skeins of wool</fact9> will she need to buy?

Answer: Nia needs to make a set of winter wear for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>. For each set, she needs to make a <fact3>hat, vest, tunic, leg warmers, and booties</fact3>. The number of skeins of wool needed for each item is as follows: <fact4>18 skeins of wool for a hat</fact4>, <fact5>16 skeins of wool for a vest</fact5>, <fact6>13 skeins of wool for a tunic</fact6>, <fact7>10 skeins of wool for a pair of leg warmers</fact7>, and <fact8>7 skeins of wool for a pair of booties</fact8>. Therefore, the total number of skeins of wool needed for each set is <fact4>18</fact4> + <fact5>16</fact5> + <fact6>13</fact6> + <fact7>10</fact7> + <fact8>7</fact8> = 64 skeins of wool. Since she needs to make a set for each of her <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she will need a total of <fact1>4</fact1> * <fact10>64</fact10> = 256 skeins of wool.

How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?","Reformatted Question: <fact1>Elena is knitting winter wear for her 5 grandchildren</fact1>. They're <fact2>quintuplets, so they're all the same size</fact2>. She wants to make a <fact3>shawl, sweater, cardigan, mittens, and leg warmers</fact3> for each of them. It takes <fact4>9 skeins of wool to make a shawl</fact4>, <fact5>7 for a sweater</fact5>, <fact6>8 for a cardigan</fact6>, <fact7>11 for a pair of mittens</fact7>, and <fact8>17 for a pair of leg warmers</fact8>. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?
Answer: To find the total number of skeins of wool Elena will need to buy, we need to multiply the number of skeins of wool needed for each item by the number of grandchildren. This will give us the total number of skeins of wool needed for each item. We can then add up the total number of skeins of wool needed for each item to find the overall total.

First, we'll find the total number of skeins of wool needed for each item. For shawls, it's <fact4>9 skeins</fact4> per shawl for <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, so it's <fact4>9</fact4> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 45 skeins. For sweaters, it's <fact5>7 skeins</fact5> per sweater for <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, so it's <fact5>7</fact5> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 35 skeins. For cardigans, it's <fact6>8 skeins</fact6> per cardigan for <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, so it's <fact6>8</fact6> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 40 skeins. For mittens, it's <fact7>11 skeins</fact7> per pair of mittens for <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, so it's <fact7>11</fact7> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 55 skeins. For leg warmers, it's <fact8>17 skeins</fact8> per pair of leg warmers for <fact1>5 grandchildren</fact1>, so it's <fact8>17</fact8> * <fact1>5</fact1> = 85 skeins.

Now, we'll add up the total number of skeins of wool needed for each item to find the overall total. The total number of skeins of wool needed is <fact4>45</fact4> + <fact5>35</fact5> + <fact6>40</fact6> + <fact7>55</fact7> + <fact8>85</fact8> = 260 skeins.

Therefore, Elena will need to buy <fact9>260 skeins</fact9> of wool.

Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can find the total calories in the bag by multiplying the calories per serving by the number of servings: <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> * <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 2375 calories. 

Since you have already consumed <fact5>1350 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>2395</fact4> - <fact5>1350</fact5> = 1045 calories. 

To find out how many ounces you can eat, we can divide the remaining calories you need to consume by the calories per serving: <fact4>1045 calories</fact4> / <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 2.2 servings. 

Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can find the total ounces in the bag by dividing the total ounces by the number of servings: <fact2>275 ounces</fact2> / <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 55 ounces per serving. 

Therefore, you can eat 2.2 * 55 = 121 ounces."

Answer: First, let's find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving to get the total calories in the bag. This is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 2375 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>1775 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>1965</fact4> - <fact5>1775</fact5> = 190 calories.
Now, we know that the entire bag of cookies has 2375 calories. To find out how many ounces of cookies you can eat, we need to divide the remaining calories you need to consume by the calories per serving, and then multiply the result by the ounces per serving. Since we don't know the ounces per serving, we need to find the ounces per serving first. We can do this by dividing the total ounces in the bag by the number of servings. This is <fact2>100 oz</fact2> / <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 20 oz per serving.
Now that we know the ounces per serving, we can find out how many ounces of cookies you can eat by dividing the remaining calories you need to consume by the calories per serving, and then multiplying the result by the ounces per serving. This is <fact6>190 calories</fact6> / <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 0.4 servings, and 0.4 servings * 20 oz per serving = 8 oz.

Answer: First, let's calculate how many calories are in the entire bag of popcorn. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> and each serving has <fact1>350 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>350</fact1> = 1750 calories.
Next, let's calculate how many calories are left in the daily calorie target. Since the daily calorie target is <fact4>2025</fact4> and <fact5>1675</fact5> calories have already been consumed, the remaining calories are <fact4>2025</fact4> - <fact5>1675</fact5> = 350 calories.
Since the entire bag of popcorn has 1750 calories, we can eat the entire bag since it's less than the remaining calories (350 calories). To find the number of grams that can be eaten, we can divide the number of calories that can be eaten by the number of calories per gram of popcorn. However, the question doesn't provide the number of calories per gram of popcorn, but it does provide the weight of the bag (175 grams) and the number of calories in the bag (1750 calories). We can calculate the number of calories per gram of popcorn by dividing the total number of calories in the bag by the weight of the bag: <fact2>175 grams</fact2> * <fact6>(calories per gram)</fact6> = <fact1>1750 calories</fact1>.
To find the number of calories per gram of popcorn, we can divide both sides of the equation by <fact2>175 grams</fact2>: <fact6>(calories per gram)</fact6> = <fact1>1750 calories</fact1> / <fact2>175 grams</fact2> = 10 calories per gram.
Now that we know the number of calories per gram of popcorn, we can find the number of grams that can be eaten by dividing the number of calories that can be eaten by the number of calories per gram of popcorn: <fact7>grams that can be eaten</fact7> = <fact5>350 calories</fact5> / <fact6>10 calories per gram</fact6> = 35 grams.

You have already consumed <fact5>1650 calories</fact5>, so you still need to consume <fact4>2400</fact4> - <fact5>1650</fact5> = 750 calories.
Since each serving has <fact1>375 calories</fact1>, you can consume 750/<fact1>375</fact1> = 2 servings.
Since each serving is <fact2>20 ounces</fact2>, you can eat 2 * <fact2>20</fact2> = 40 ounces.

The answer is {40}."
1218,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of breads has 200 calories per serving.

If <fact2>a 150 ounces bag has 5 servings</fact2>, how many ounces can you eat if your daily calorie target is <fact3>2225</fact3> and you have already consumed <fact4>1225 calories</fact4>?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact2>5 servings</fact2> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>200 calories</fact1>, the total calories in the bag is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact1>200</fact1> = 1000 calories. Since the bag is 150 ounces and has 1000 calories, we can assume that each ounce has <fact5>1000 calories / 150 ounces = 6.67 calories</fact5>. Next, we need to find out how many calories are left in the daily calorie target. Since you have already consumed <fact4>1225 calories</fact4> and your daily calorie target is <fact3>2225</fact3>, you have <fact6>2225 - 1225 = 1000 calories</fact6> left. Since each ounce has 6.67 calories, we can find out how many ounces you can eat by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per ounce: <fact7>1000 calories / 6.67 calories per ounce = 150 ounces</fact7>. Therefore, you can eat 150 ounces."
1219,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of popcorn has 150 calories per serving.

If a <fact2>100 grams bag has 4 servings</fact2>, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is <fact3>2100</fact3> and you have already consumed <fact4>1350 calories</fact4>?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of popcorn. Since there are <fact2>4 servings</fact2> in the bag and each serving has <fact1>150 calories</fact1>, the total calories in the bag are 150 * 4 = 600 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact4>1350 calories</fact4> and your daily calorie target is <fact3>2100</fact3>, you can still consume 2100 - 1350 = 750 calories.
Now, we know that the entire bag of popcorn has 600 calories. To find out how many grams you can eat, we need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving. 750 / 150 = 5 servings.
Since a <fact2>100 grams bag has 4 servings</fact2>, we can set up a proportion to find out how many grams are in one serving. Let x be the weight of one serving. Then, 4x = 100 grams. Solving for x, we get x = 100 / 4 = 25 grams per serving.
Since you can eat 5 servings, the total weight of popcorn you can eat is 5 * 25 = 125 grams.
The answer is {125}."

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>425 calories</fact1>, we can calculate the total calories in the bag by multiplying the number of servings by the calories per serving: 5 * 425 = 2125 calories.
Since we have already consumed <fact5>1400 calories</fact5>, we need to find out how many calories are left for us to consume. This can be done by subtracting the calories we have already consumed from our daily calorie target: 2250 - 1400 = 850 calories.
Now, we know that the bag of breads has a total of 2125 calories, and we need to consume 850 more calories. To find out how many servings we can eat, we can divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving: 850 / 425 = 2 servings.
Since each serving is <fact3>5 servings</fact3> of the bag, and we can eat 2 servings, we can calculate the number of ounces we can eat by multiplying the number of servings we can eat by the total ounces in the bag: 2 * 150 = 300 ounces.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the 100 oz bag of cookies. Since there are <fact2>5 servings</fact2> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>450 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact1>450</fact1> = 2250 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact4>1525 calories</fact4>, you still have a daily calorie target of <fact3>1975</fact3> - <fact4>1525</fact4> = 450 calories left.
Now, we need to find out how many servings of cookies you can eat with the remaining calories. Since each serving has <fact1>450 calories</fact1>, you can eat 450/<fact1>450</fact1> = 1 serving.
Since there are <fact2>5 servings</fact2> in the bag, and you can eat 1 serving, the total number of oz you can eat is <fact2>5</fact2> * <fact2>100 oz</fact2> / <fact2>5</fact2> = 100 oz.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the 300 oz bag. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can multiply the number of calories per serving by the number of servings: <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> * <fact3>4 servings</fact3> = 1900 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>925 calories</fact5>, you still need to consume <fact4>2350 - 925 = 1425 calories</fact4> to reach your daily target.
To find out how many servings you can eat, we can divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per serving: <fact4>1425 calories</fact4> / <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 3 servings.
Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, you can eat <fact3>4 - 3 = 1 serving</fact3> left in the bag.
Since there are <fact2>300 oz</fact2> in the bag and <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, we can find out how many oz are in each serving by dividing the total oz by the number of servings: <fact2>300 oz</fact2> / <fact3>4 servings</fact3> = 75 oz per serving.
Therefore, you can eat <fact3>1 serving</fact3> * <fact2>75 oz per serving</fact2> = <fact6>75 oz</fact6> of cookies."

Answer: To determine how many oz of cookies you can eat, we need to find out how many calories are left in your daily calorie target. This can be calculated by subtracting the calories you have already consumed from your daily calorie target: <fact5>1925</fact5> - <fact6>1575</fact6> = <fact5>1925</fact5> - <fact6>1575</fact6> = 350 calories.
Since each serving of cookies has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, we can calculate how many servings you can eat by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: <fact5>350</fact5> / <fact1>175</fact1> = <fact5>350</fact5> / <fact1>175</fact1> = 2 servings.

Answer: To find out how many ounces you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories you have left to consume. This can be found by subtracting the calories you have already consumed from your daily calorie target: <fact3>2475</fact3> - <fact4>1075</fact4> = 1400 calories.
Since each serving of bread has <fact1>350 calories</fact1>, we can divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per serving to find out how many servings you can eat: 1400/<fact1>350</fact1> = 4 servings.
Since the bag of bread has <fact2>5 servings</fact2>, and you can only eat 4 of them, we need to find out what fraction of the bag 4 servings represents. This can be found by dividing the number of servings you can eat by the total number of servings in the bag: 4/<fact2>5</fact2> = 4/5.
To find out how many ounces you can eat, we can multiply the fraction of the bag you can eat by the total number of ounces in the bag: (4/5)*<fact2>200</fact2> = 160 ounces.
The answer is {160}."
1236,"According to its nutritional info, a bag of cookies has 175 calories per serving. If a 150 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2025 and you have already consumed 975 calories?","Reformatted Question: A bag of cookies has <fact1>175 calories per serving</fact1>.

Answer: To find out how many oz of cookies you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of cookies. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>175</fact1> = 875 calories.

Since you have already consumed <fact5>975 calories</fact5> and your daily calorie target is <fact4>2025</fact4>, you still have <fact4>2025</fact4> - <fact5>975</fact5> = 1050 calories left to consume.

Now, we can find out how many servings you can eat by dividing the remaining calories by the calories per serving: <fact5>1050</fact5> / <fact1>175</fact1> = 6 servings.

Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, and you can eat 6 servings, you will need to eat <fact3>5</fact3> + 1 = 6 bags of cookies.

Since each bag has a weight of <fact2>150 oz</fact2>, you can eat a total of 6 * <fact2>150</fact2> = 900 oz of cookies."

Answer: To determine how many grams of popcorn you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of popcorn. Since the bag has <fact3>5 servings</fact3> and each serving has <fact1>325 calories</fact1>, the total calories in the bag are <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>325</fact1> = 1625 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>1375 calories</fact5>, you still have <fact4>1960</fact4> - <fact5>1375</fact5> = 585 calories left for the day.
You can eat the amount of popcorn that has 585 calories, and since each serving has 325 calories, you can eat 585/<fact1>325</fact1> = 1.8 servings.
Since each serving is <fact2>225 grams</fact2> / <fact3>5 servings</fact3> = 45 grams, you can eat 1.8 * 45 = 81 grams of popcorn."

Answer: To find out how many ounces you can eat, we need to first find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact3>5 servings</fact3> in the bag, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>5</fact3> * <fact1>475 calories per serving</fact1> = 2375 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>1350 calories</fact5>, you still have a calorie deficit of <fact4>2205</fact4> - <fact5>1350</fact5> = 855 calories left to reach your daily target.
Now, we need to find out how many ounces of the breads you can eat to reach this calorie deficit. Since there are 2375 calories in the entire bag, and you want to know how many ounces you can eat to reach 855 calories, we can set up a proportion: 
<fact2>225 ounces</fact2> / <fact3>2375 calories</fact3> = <fact6>x ounces</fact6> / <fact7>855 calories</fact7>
Solving for x, we get:
<fact6>x</fact6> = <fact2>225 ounces</fact2> * <fact7>855 calories</fact7> / <fact3>2375 calories</fact3>
<fact6>x</fact6> = 82.5 ounces
Since you can't eat a fraction of an ounce, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you can eat <fact6>82 ounces</fact6> of the breads."

Answer: To find out how many ounces you can eat, we first need to find out how many calories are in the entire bag of breads. Since there are <fact3>4 servings</fact3> in the bag, and each serving has <fact1>425 calories</fact1>, the total number of calories in the bag is <fact3>4</fact3> * <fact1>425 calories</fact1> = 1700 calories.
Since you have already consumed <fact5>650 calories</fact5>, you have <fact4>1925</fact4> - <fact5>650</fact5> = 1275 calories left to consume.
Since each serving of bread has <fact1>425 calories</fact1>, you can consume 1275/<fact1>425 calories</fact1> = 3 servings.
Since each serving is <fact3>4 servings</fact3> / <fact3>4 servings</fact3> = 1 of the 4 servings in the bag, you can eat 3 * <fact2>300 ounces</fact2> / <fact3>4 servings</fact3> = 225 ounces."

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>32% of the students are debate team members or part of choir members</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?

Answer: To find the number of students who are leaving early, we need to find the total number of students who are either swimmers, debate team members, or part of the choir. 
First, we need to find the number of students who are not swimmers. Since <fact1>40% of the class are swimmers</fact1>, the number of students who are not swimmers is <fact1>100%</fact1> - <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60% of the class. 
The number of students who are not swimmers is <fact3>60%</fact3> * <fact1>125 students</fact1> = 0.6 * 125 = 75 students.
Out of the remaining 75 students, <fact3>32%</fact3> are debate team members or part of the choir. 
The number of students who are debate team members or part of the choir is <fact3>32%</fact3> * 75 = 0.32 * 75 = 24 students.
Since <fact2>40%</fact2> of the class are swimmers, the number of students who are swimmers is <fact2>40%</fact2> * <fact1>125 students</fact1> = 0.4 * 125 = 50 students.

Out of the <fact3>remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>40% of the students are robotics club members or part of dancers</fact4>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are swimmers. To do this, we need to calculate <fact2>36%</fact2> of <fact1>125 students</fact1>. This can be done by multiplying <fact2>0.36</fact2> by <fact1>125</fact1>, which is <fact2>0.36</fact2> * <fact1>125</fact1> = <fact2>45</fact2> students. This means that there are <fact2>45</fact2> students who are swimmers.
Now, we need to find out how many students are not swimmers. This can be done by subtracting <fact2>45</fact2> from <fact1>125</fact1>, which is <fact1>125</fact1> - <fact2>45</fact2> = <fact3>80</fact3> students.
Next, we need to find out how many students are robotics club members or part of dancers. To do this, we need to calculate <fact4>40%</fact4> of <fact3>80 students</fact3>. This can be done by multiplying <fact4>0.4</fact4> by <fact3>80</fact3>, which is <fact4>0.4</fact4> * <fact3>80</fact3> = <fact5>32</fact5> students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students are leaving early. This can be done by adding the number of swimmers (<fact2>45</fact2>), the number of robotics club members or part of dancers (<fact5>32</fact5>), and assuming that the swimmers and the robotics club members or part of dancers are the only two groups that are leaving early.

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25% of the students are debate team members or part of choir members</fact3>. These <fact4>3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament</fact4>. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: To find the number of students leaving early, we need to find the total number of students in the 3 groups. 

First, we find the number of basketball players. <fact2>48% of the class are basketball players</fact2>, so the number of basketball players is <fact1>100</fact1> * <fact2>0.48</fact2> = 48.

The remaining students are <fact1>100</fact1> - <fact2>48</fact2> = 52.

Then, we find the number of debate team members or choir members. <fact3>25% of the students are debate team members or part of choir members</fact3> out of the remaining <fact1>52</fact1> students, so the number of debate team members or choir members is <fact1>52</fact1> * <fact3>0.25</fact3> = 13.

Finally, we add the number of basketball players and debate team members or choir members to find the total number of students leaving early. <fact2>48</fact2> + <fact3>13</fact3> = 61.

Answer: First, let's find out how many students are soccer players. Since <fact1>40% of the class are soccer players</fact1>, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of students by 0.4. So, <fact1>40% of 125</fact1> is 0.4 * 125 = 50 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students are not soccer players. Since there are 125 students in total and 50 of them are soccer players, the number of non-soccer players is 125 - 50 = 75 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students are part of the debate team or robotics club. Since <fact3>24% of the remaining students are debate team members or part of robotics club members</fact3>, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of non-soccer players by 0.24. So, <fact3>24% of 75</fact3> is 0.24 * 75 = 18 students.

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>20% of the students are dancers or part of choir members</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away tournament. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are basketball players. This can be done by multiplying the total number of students by the percentage of basketball players. <fact1>100 students</fact1> * <fact2>15%</fact2> = <fact1>100</fact1> * <fact2>0.15</fact2> = 15 basketball players.
Now, we need to find out how many students are not basketball players. This can be done by subtracting the number of basketball players from the total number of students. <fact1>100 students</fact1> - <fact2>15 basketball players</fact2> = <fact1>100</fact1> - <fact2>15</fact2> = 85 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students are dancers or part of choir members. This can be done by multiplying the number of non-basketball players by the percentage of dancers or choir members. <fact3>85 students</fact3> * <fact4>20%</fact4> = <fact3>85</fact3> * <fact4>0.20</fact4> = 17 dancers or choir members.
Finally, we need to find the total number of students leaving early by adding the number of basketball players and dancers or choir members. <fact2>15 basketball players</fact2> + <fact4>17 dancers or choir members</fact4> = <fact2>15</fact2> + <fact4>17</fact4> = 32 students.

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>20% of the students are choir members or part of debate team members</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. How many students are leaving early?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are not soccer players. The total number of students is <fact1>100</fact1>, and the number of soccer players is <fact2>40% of the class</fact2> which is 0.4*<fact1>100</fact1> = 40 students. Therefore, the number of non-soccer players is <fact1>100</fact1> - <fact2>40</fact2> = 60 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students are either choir members or part of the debate team. The number of these students is <fact3>20% of the remaining class</fact3> which is 0.2*<fact1>60</fact1> = 12 students.

How many students are leaving early?
Answer: First, we need to find the number of swimmers in the class. <fact1>20% of the class are swimmers</fact1>, so the number of swimmers is <fact1>20%</fact1>/100 * <fact2>125 students</fact2> = 0.20 * 125 = 25 students.
The remaining students are <fact2>125 students</fact2> - <fact3>25 students</fact3> = 100 students.
Next, we need to find the number of dancers or choir members in the class. <fact3>32% of the students are dancers or part of choir members</fact3>, so the number of dancers or choir members is <fact3>32%</fact3>/100 * <fact4>100 students</fact4> = 0.32 * 100 = 32 students.

Out of the remaining class, <fact3>16% of the students are dancers or part of robotics club members</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: First, let's find the number of students who are swimmers. We know that <fact1>40%</fact1> of <fact2>125 students</fact2> are swimmers. So the number of students who are swimmers is <fact1>40%</fact1> * <fact2>125</fact2> = <fact1>40</fact1> * <fact2>1.25</fact2> = <fact1>50</fact1> students.
This means that the remaining students are <fact2>125 - 50 = 75</fact2> students.
Now, let's find the number of students who are dancers or part of robotics club members. We know that <fact3>16%</fact3> of the remaining <fact2>75 students</fact2> are dancers or part of robotics club members. So the number of students who are dancers or part of robotics club members is <fact3>16%</fact3> * <fact2>75</fact2> = <fact3>1.6</fact3> * <fact2>75</fact2> = <fact3>120</fact3> students.
However, since 120 is greater than 75, this is a mistake.  We made a mistake in calculating the number of students who are dancers or part of robotics club members. The number of students who are dancers or part of robotics club members is actually <fact3>16%</fact3> * <fact2>75</fact2> = <fact3>12</fact3> students.
So the total number of students who are leaving early is <fact1>50</fact1> (swimmers) + <fact3>12</fact3> (dancers or part of robotics club members) = <fact1>62</fact1> students.

These <fact4>3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition</fact4>. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: To find out how many students are leaving early, we need to first find out how many students are not soccer players. There are <fact1>125 students</fact1> in total, and <fact2>36% of the class are soccer players</fact2>. So, the number of soccer players is <fact1>125</fact1> * <fact2>36%</fact2> = 45 students.
This means that the remaining number of students who are not soccer players is <fact1>125</fact1> - <fact3>45</fact3> = 80 students.
Out of these 80 students, <fact3>30% are robotics club members or part of dancers</fact3>. So, the number of students who are robotics club members or part of dancers is <fact3>80</fact3> * <fact3>30%</fact3> = 24 students.

1286,"In Dr. Lee's class of 100 students, 40% of the class are volleyball players. Out of the remaining class, 25% of the students are robotics club members or part of dancers. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away performance. How many students are leaving early?","Reformatted Question: In <fact1>Dr. Lee's class of 100 students</fact1>, <fact2>40% of the class are volleyball players</fact2>. Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25% of the students are robotics club members or part of dancers</fact3>. These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away performance. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are volleyball players. Since <fact1>40% of the class are volleyball players</fact1> and there are <fact2>100 students</fact2> in the class, we can find the number of volleyball players by multiplying <fact2>100</fact2> by <fact1>40%</fact1>, which is equivalent to 0.4. This gives us 100 * 0.4 = 40 volleyball players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not volleyball players. Since there are <fact2>100 students</fact2> in the class and <fact3>40 of them are volleyball players</fact3>, the number of students who are not volleyball players is 100 - 40 = 60.

Now, we need to find out how many students are either robotics club members or part of dancers. Since <fact3>25% of the students are robotics club members or part of dancers</fact3> and there are <fact4>60 students</fact4> who are not volleyball players, we can find the number of robotics club members or dancers by multiplying <fact4>60</fact4> by <fact3>25%</fact3>, which is equivalent to 0.25. This gives us 60 * 0.25 = 15 robotics club members or dancers.

Finally, we need to find out how many students are leaving early. Since there are <fact5>40 volleyball players</fact5>, <fact6>15 robotics club members or dancers</fact6>, and these 3 groups of students will need to leave early, the total number of students leaving early is 40 + 15 = 55.

How many students are leaving early?","Reformatted Question: In <fact1>Mrs. Garcia's class of 80 students</fact1>, <fact2>10% of the class are swimmers</fact2>. Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25% of the students are choir members or part of robotics club members</fact3>. These <fact4>3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away meet</fact4>. How many students are leaving early?
Answer: First, let's find out how many students are swimmers. There are <fact1>80</fact1> students in the class, and <fact2>10%</fact2> of them are swimmers. To find the number of swimmers, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the total number of students. So, <fact2>10%</fact2> is equal to <fact2>0.10</fact2>. Therefore, the number of swimmers is <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact2>0.10</fact2> = 8 students.
Now, we need to find out how many students are not swimmers. Since there are 80 students in the class and 8 of them are swimmers, the number of non-swimmers is <fact1>80</fact1> - <fact2>8</fact2> = 72 students.
Next, we need to find out how many students are choir members or part of the robotics club. Out of the remaining class, <fact3>25%</fact3> of the students are choir members or part of the robotics club. To find the number of these students, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply it by the number of non-swimmers. So, <fact3>25%</fact3> is equal to <fact3>0.25</fact3>. Therefore, the number of choir members or robotics club members is <fact2>72</fact2> * <fact3>0.25</fact3> = 18 students.
Finally, we need to find out how many students are leaving early. Since there are 8 swimmers and 18 choir members or robotics club members, the total number of students leaving early is <fact2>8</fact2> + <fact3>18</fact3> = 26 students.
The answer is {26}."

Answer: First, we need to find out how many students are basketball players. To do this, we need to find <fact1>20%</fact1> of <fact1>55 students</fact1>. This can be done by multiplying <fact1>55</fact1> by <fact2>0.2</fact2>, which is <fact1>55</fact1> * <fact2>0.2</fact2> = 11. So, there are <fact2>11 basketball players</fact2> in the class. This means that there are <fact1>55 - 11 = 44</fact1> students left in the class. Next, we need to find out how many students are debate team members or part of robotics club members. To do this, we need to find <fact3>25%</fact3> of <fact1>44 students</fact1>. This can be done by multiplying <fact1>44</fact1> by <fact4>0.25</fact4>, which is <fact1>44</fact1> * <fact4>0.25</fact4> = 11.

Answer: To find the total number of tacos eaten by the family in one week, we need to find the total number of tacos eaten per day and multiply it by 7. 
The grandfather eats <fact1>3 tacos per day</fact1>, so in one week, he eats 3 * 7 = 21 tacos.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails Xena receives in a 6 day work week. Since Xena receives <fact1>150 emails a day</fact1>, in a <fact3>6 day work week</fact3>, she receives 150 * 6 = 900 emails.
Then, we need to find out how many emails Xena doesn't need to respond to. Since <fact2>24% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, we need to find 24% of 900. This is equal to 0.24 * 900 = 216 emails.
Now, we need to find out how many emails Xena responds to. This is equal to the total number of emails she receives minus the number of emails she doesn't need to respond to. So, this is equal to 900 - 216 = 684 emails.
Therefore, Xena responds to 684 emails in a 6 day work week."

Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails require a response. Since <fact2>36% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, <fact2>64% of those emails require a response</fact2>.

How many emails does <fact4>Gabrielle respond to in a 6 day work week</fact4>?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails Gabrielle receives in a 6 day work week. Since she receives <fact1>175 emails a day</fact1>, in 6 days she will receive 6 * <fact1>175</fact1> = 1050 emails.
Then, we need to find out how many of those emails don't require any response. Since <fact2>8% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, the number of emails that don't require any response is 8% of 1050, which is <fact2>8/100</fact2> * <fact1>1050</fact1> = 84 emails.

How many emails does <fact4>Beatriz respond to in a 5 day work week</fact4>?
Answer: <fact2>25% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, so 75% of those emails do require a response. This means that Beatriz responds to 75% of 132 emails per day. To find this number, we need to multiply 132 by <fact5>75%</fact5>, which is the same as multiplying 132 by <fact6>0.75</fact6>. This gives us 132 * 0.75 = 99 emails per day that Beatriz responds to. Since there are 5 days in a work week, we need to multiply 99 by 5 to find the total number of emails Beatriz responds to in a 5 day work week. This gives us 99 * 5 = 495 emails.

How many emails does <fact4>Umar respond to in a 3 day work week</fact4>?
Answer: First, we need to find out how many emails Umar receives in a 3 day work week. We know that Umar receives <fact1>92 emails a day</fact1>, so in 3 days, he receives 3 * <fact1>92</fact1> = 276 emails. Next, we need to find out how many emails Umar doesn't respond to. Since <fact2>25% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, we need to calculate 25% of 276. To do this, we multiply 276 by <fact2>0.25</fact2> (which is the decimal equivalent of 25%). So, Umar doesn't respond to 276 * <fact2>0.25</fact2> = 69 emails. Now, we need to find out how many emails Umar responds to. We know that Umar responds to the rest of the emails, so we subtract the number of emails he doesn't respond to from the total number of emails he receives. Therefore, Umar responds to 276 - 69 = 207 emails in a 3 day work week."

Faisal responds to the rest of them. How many emails does Faisal respond to in a <fact3>4 day work week</fact3>?

Answer: Since <fact2>20% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, the remaining 80% of the emails do require a response. To find the number of emails that require a response, we need to find 80% of <fact1>160 emails</fact1>.

How many emails does <fact4>Yara respond to in a 6 day work week</fact4>?
Answer: Since <fact2>24% of those emails don't require any response</fact2>, <fact1>Yara receives 175 emails a day</fact1> * <fact2>0.24</fact2> = 42 emails a day that don't require any response.
Thus, <fact1>Yara receives 175 emails a day</fact1> - 42 emails a day = 133 emails a day that require a response.
In a 6 day work week, <fact1>Yara receives 175 emails a day</fact1> * <fact4>6 days</fact4> = 1050 emails.
Since <fact1>Yara receives 175 emails a day</fact1> * <fact2>0.24</fact2> = 42 emails a day that don't require any response, <fact1>Yara receives 175 emails a day</fact1> - 42 emails a day = 133 emails a day that require a response.

1400,"A clinic has a capacity of 1800 rooms with 1/4 occupied. Due to the natural disaster, 40 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 3 weeks.","Reformatted Question: A clinic has a capacity of <fact1>1800 rooms</fact1> with <fact2>1/4 occupied</fact2>. Due to the natural disaster, <fact3>40 patients are admitted into the clinic each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.
Answer: First, we need to calculate the number of occupied rooms. Since <fact2>1/4 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, we can find the number of occupied rooms by multiplying the total capacity by <fact2>1/4</fact2>. This gives us <fact1>1800</fact1> * <fact2>1/4</fact2> = 450 occupied rooms. 
Since there are <fact1>1800</fact1> total rooms and <fact2>450</fact2> are occupied, the number of unoccupied rooms is <fact1>1800</fact1> - <fact2>450</fact2> = 1350.
Now, we need to calculate the number of new patients admitted in 3 weeks. Since <fact3>40 patients are admitted each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is <fact3>40</fact3> * <fact4>21</fact4> = 840 patients.
Since there are already <fact2>450</fact2> occupied rooms, the total number of occupied rooms after 3 weeks is <fact2>450</fact2> + <fact3>840</fact3> = 1290.
The number of unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks is <fact1>1800</fact1> - <fact3>1290</fact3> = 510.
The answer is {510}."
