397,"Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need?","To determine the number of vans needed, we first need to calculate the total number of people going on the field trip.

Total number of students = 40
Total number of adults = 14
Total number of people = 40 + 14 = 54

Next, we need to divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van, which is 9.

Number of vans needed = Total number of people / Capacity of each van
= 54 / 9
= 6

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a van, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we need 6 vans to accommodate all the students and adults.

Therefore, the answer is {6}."

If he had to pick up 29 trays from one table and 52 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find out how many trips Henry will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up and divide it by the number of trays he can carry at a time.

First, let's add up the total number of trays:
29 trays (from one table) + 52 trays (from another table) = 81 trays

Since Henry can carry 9 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by 9:
81 trays / 9 trays per trip = 9 trips

However, we need to consider if Henry can make a full 9 trips with the trays from the first table. Since he can only carry 9 trays at a time, he will need to make 4 trips to pick up the 29 trays from the first table (29 / 9 = 3.22, so he will need to make 4 trips to pick up all the trays).

Now, let's calculate the number of trips Henry will need to make to pick up the trays from the second table:
52 trays / 9 trays per trip = 5.78, so he will need to make 6 trips to pick up all the trays from the second table.

Since Henry will need to make 4 trips to pick up the trays from the first table and 6 trips to pick up the trays from the second table, we need to add these two numbers together:
4 trips + 6 trips = 10 trips

So, the total number of trips Henry will make is {10}."

If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?","To find out how long it will take to install the rest of the windows, we first need to determine how many windows are left to install.

The total number of windows needed is 12, and 6 have already been installed. 

So, the number of windows left to install is 12 - 6 = 6.

Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, we multiply the number of windows left by the time it takes to install each one:

6 windows * 4 hours/window = 24 hours

399,"Frank made 5 dollars mowing lawns and 58 dollars weed eating. If he only spent 7 dollar a week, how long would the money last him?","To find out how long the money will last, we need to calculate the total amount Frank earned and subtract the amount he spent.

1. Calculate the total amount Frank earned:
   - Earnings from mowing lawns: $5
   - Earnings from weed eating: $58
   - Total earnings: $5 + $58 = $63

2. Calculate the remaining amount after spending:
   - Total earnings: $63
   - Amount spent: $7
   - Remaining amount: $63 - $7 = $56

3. Since Frank earns a fixed amount each week, we can calculate how many weeks the money will last by dividing the remaining amount by his weekly earnings.

However, the problem doesn't mention Frank's weekly earnings from mowing lawns or weed eating. We only know his earnings from these activities for this specific week. 

But, if we assume that his earnings from mowing lawns and weed eating are consistent, we can calculate his total weekly earnings as follows:

- Total weekly earnings: $5 (mowing lawns) + $58 (weed eating) = $63

Now, we can calculate how many weeks the money will last:
- Remaining amount: $56
- Total weekly earnings: $63
- Number of weeks: $56 / $63 ≈ 0.89 weeks

Since we can't have a fraction of a week, we can round down to the nearest whole number. However, this would mean the money would last less than a week.

Therefore, {The money will last less than a week}."

   Red apples = 6
   Green apples = 15
   Total apples = 6 + 15 = 21

2. Number of apples given to the students: 
   Since only 5 students wanted fruit, we assume they each got one apple. 
   Number of apples given = 5

3. To find the number of extra apples, subtract the number of apples given from the total number of apples:
   Extra apples = Total apples - Number of apples given
   Extra apples = 21 - 5
   Extra apples = 16

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with {16} extra apples."

356,"Haley and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 3 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Haley recycled 11 pounds and her friends recycled 16 pounds, how many points did they earn?","To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned from Haley's recycling and her friends' recycling separately, then add them together.

1. Haley recycled 11 pounds. Since they earn 1 point for every 3 pounds, we need to divide 11 by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 pounds Haley recycled. 
   11 ÷ 3 = 3 with a remainder of 2. This means Haley recycled 3 sets of 3 pounds and 2 extra pounds. Since she can't earn points for the extra 2 pounds, she earned points for 3 sets of 3 pounds.
   3 sets of 3 pounds = 3 * 1 point = 3 points.

2. Haley's friends recycled 16 pounds. We repeat the same process:
   16 ÷ 3 = 5 with a remainder of 1. This means her friends recycled 5 sets of 3 pounds and 1 extra pound. Since they can't earn points for the extra 1 pound, they earned points for 5 sets of 3 pounds.
   5 sets of 3 pounds = 5 * 1 point = 5 points.

3. To find the total points earned, we add the points earned by Haley and her friends together:
   3 points (Haley) + 5 points (friends) = 8 points.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of sodas Tom bought:
   Total sodas = Regular sodas + Diet sodas
   Total sodas = 4 + 52
   Total sodas = 56

2. Next, we need to divide the total number of sodas by the number of sodas each shelf can hold:
   Number of shelves = Total sodas / Number of sodas per shelf
   Number of shelves = 56 / 7
   Number of shelves = 8

Therefore, Tom would fill up {8} shelves."

384,"Luke was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 4 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find out how many trips Luke will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he has to pick up and divide it by the number of trays he can carry at a time.

First, let's add up the number of trays from both tables:
20 trays (from one table) + 16 trays (from another table) = 36 trays

Since Luke can carry 4 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by 4:
36 trays / 4 trays per trip = 9 trips

However, since Luke can't make a fraction of a trip, we need to consider if he can carry any trays on his last trip. 

Let's calculate the number of trays he can carry on his last trip:
9 trips * 4 trays per trip = 36 trays (which is the total number of trays)

This means that Luke can carry all the trays on 9 trips, but he won't have any leftover trays to carry on a 10th trip.

So, the answer is {9}."

   Apples left = Total apples - Apples handed out
   Apples left = 75 - 19
   Apples left = 56

2. Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples:
   Each pie takes 8 apples, so we divide the number of apples left by 8 to find out how many pies can be made:

1. First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy they had combined. 
   Debby had 32 pieces and her sister had 42 pieces, so the total number of pieces is 32 + 42 = 74.

2. Then, we need to subtract the number of pieces they ate on the first night.

If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?","To find the total points earned, we need to calculate the points earned by Paige and her friends separately and then add them together.

1. Paige recycled 14 pounds. Since she earns 1 point for every 4 pounds, we divide 14 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 pounds she has:
   14 / 4 = 3.5
   Since you can't have a fraction of a point, we'll round down to 3 full sets of 4 pounds, which means Paige earns 3 points. However, she also has 2 pounds left over, which is not a full set of 4 pounds. To find out if she earns any points for these extra 2 pounds, we can divide 2 by 4:
   2 / 4 = 0.5
   Since 0.5 is less than 1, Paige doesn't earn any points for the extra 2 pounds. So, Paige earns 3 points.

2. Paige's friends recycled 2 pounds. Since they earn 1 point for every 4 pounds, we divide 2 by 4 to find out how many sets of 4 pounds they have:
   2 / 4 = 0.5
   Since 0.5 is less than 1, Paige's friends don't earn any points.

3. To find the total points earned, we add the points earned by Paige and her friends together:
   Total points = 3 (Paige's points) + 0 (friends' points) = 3

So, the total points earned is {3}."

1. Calculate the total time it takes to paint all 12 rooms:
   Each room takes 3 hours to paint. 
   Total time = Number of rooms * Time per room = 12 * 3 = 36 hours.

2. Calculate the time the painter has already spent painting 4 rooms:
   Time spent = Number of rooms painted * Time per room = 4 * 3 = 12 hours.

3. Calculate the remaining time needed to paint the rest of the rooms:
   Remaining time = Total time - Time spent = 36 - 12 = 24 hours.

4. Calculate the number of rooms left to paint:
   Rooms left = Total rooms - Rooms painted = 12 - 4 = 8 rooms.

5. Calculate the time needed to paint the remaining rooms:
   Time for remaining rooms = Number of rooms left * Time per room = 8 * 3 = 24 hours.

Since the washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, we need to divide the total number of clothing by 9.

27 ÷ 9 = 3

However, since 27 is not exactly divisible by 9, we need to consider the remainder. 

27 = 9 * 3 + 0

This means that 27 is exactly divisible by 9, with no remainder. Therefore, Nancy needs to do {3} loads of laundry."
312,"A vase can hold 6 flowers. If you had 7 carnations and 47 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?","To determine how many vases are needed to hold the flowers, we need to calculate the total number of flowers and divide it by the number of flowers a vase can hold.

First, let's calculate the total number of flowers:
- Carnations: 7
- Roses: 47
Total flowers = 7 + 47 = 54

Now, let's divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers a vase can hold:
- Number of flowers a vase can hold: 6
- Total flowers: 54
Number of vases needed = Total flowers / Number of flowers a vase can hold
= 54 / 6
= 9

Since we can't have a fraction of a vase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, 9 is a whole number.

Therefore, {9} vases are needed to hold the flowers."

If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find out how many trips Jerry will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he has to pick up and divide it by the number of trays he can carry at a time.

First, let's add up the number of trays from both tables:
9 trays (from the first table) + 7 trays (from the second table) = 16 trays

Since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, we need to divide the total number of trays by 8 and round up to the nearest whole number, because we can't make a fraction of a trip.

16 trays / 8 trays per trip = 2 trips (with 0 trays left over)
However, since Jerry can only carry 8 trays at a time, and he has to pick up 16 trays, he will have to make one more trip to pick up the remaining 8 trays. 

So, Jerry will make {3} trips in total."

If she deleted 11 of the files, how many files were still on her flash drive?","To find the total number of files still on Haley's flash drive, we need to first find the total number of files she had initially, and then subtract the number of files she deleted.

1. Find the total number of files initially: 
   Music files = 27
   Video files = 42
   Total files = 27 + 42 = 69

2. Subtract the number of files deleted:
   Total files deleted = 11

   Total files remaining = 69 - 11
   Total files remaining = 58

Therefore, {58} files were still on Haley's flash drive."
262,"Roger was putting his spare change into piles. He had 3 piles of quarters and 3 piles of dimes. If each pile had 7 coins in it, how many coins did he have total?","To find the total number of coins, we need to calculate the number of quarters and dimes separately and then add them together.

1. Calculate the number of quarters:
   - Roger has 3 piles of quarters.
   - Each pile has 7 quarters.
   - So, the total number of quarters is 3 * 7 = 21.

2. Calculate the number of dimes:
   - Roger has 3 piles of dimes.
   - Each pile has 7 dimes.
   - So, the total number of dimes is 3 * 7 = 21.

3. Add the number of quarters and dimes to find the total number of coins:
   - Total number of coins = number of quarters + number of dimes
   - Total number of coins = 21 + 21
   - Total number of coins = 42

401,"A chef needs to cook 16 potatoes. He has already cooked 7. If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, how long will it take him to cook the rest?","To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of potatoes left to cook: 
   Total potatoes = 16
   Potatoes already cooked = 7
   Potatoes left to cook = Total potatoes - Potatoes already cooked
   Potatoes left to cook = 16 - 7
   Potatoes left to cook = 9

2. Calculate the time it will take to cook the remaining potatoes:
   Time per potato = 5 minutes
   Potatoes left to cook = 9
   Total time = Time per potato * Potatoes left to cook
   Total time = 5 * 9
   Total time = 45 minutes

Therefore, {45} minutes will be required to cook the rest of the potatoes."
521,"The cafeteria had 96 apples. For lunch they handed out 42 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 6 apples, how many pies could they make?","To find out how many pies they can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples left after handing out 42 to students:
   Total apples = 96
   Apples handed out = 42

2. Determine how many pies can be made with the remaining apples:
   Each pie takes 6 apples
   Number of pies = Apples left / Apples per pie
   Number of pies = 54 / 6
   Number of pies = 9

So, {9} pies can be made."
317,Wendy's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?,"To find the total number of loads, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of clothing and divide it by the capacity of the washing machine (8 pieces per load).

First, let's add the number of shirts and sweaters:
39 shirts + 33 sweaters = 72 pieces of clothing

Since the washing machine can only wash 8 pieces at a time, we need to divide the total number of pieces by 8:
72 pieces / 8 pieces per load = 9 loads

However, we need to consider if there's any remainder after dividing. To do this, we can use the modulo operator or simply divide the total number of pieces by the capacity of the washing machine and check if there's any remainder.

72 pieces / 8 pieces per load = 9 loads with no remainder (since 72 is exactly divisible by 8), but we can also check this by dividing 72 by 8 and looking at the remainder:
72 ÷ 8 = 9 remainder 0

Since there's no remainder, Wendy will have to do exactly 9 loads.
