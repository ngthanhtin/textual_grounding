397,"Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need?","To find out how many vans are needed, we need to find the total number of people going on the trip. 

There are 40 students and 14 adults going. 
Total number of people = students + adults
Total number of people = 40 + 14
Total number of people = 54

Now, we know that each van can hold 9 people. 
To find out how many vans are needed, we divide the total number of people by the capacity of each van.
Number of vans = Total number of people / capacity of each van
Number of vans = 54 / 9
Number of vans = 6

Since we can't have a fraction of a van, we don't need to worry about any remainder. In this case, 54 is perfectly divisible by 9.

344,"Jerry was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays, but he could only carry 8 trays at a time. If he had to pick up 9 trays from one table and 7 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find the total number of trips Jerry will make, we need to find out how many trays he has to pick up in total and divide that by the number of trays he can carry per trip.

First, let's calculate the total number of trays Jerry needs to pick up:
9 trays (from one table) + 7 trays (from another table) = 16 trays

Now, we'll divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Jerry can carry per trip:
16 trays / 8 trays per trip = 2 trips

However, since 16 is exactly divisible by 8, Jerry will not need to make a partial trip. But if we consider the original problem statement where Jerry picks up trays from two tables, we can also analyze it as follows: 
- 9 trays from one table will take 2 trips (8 trays in the first trip and 1 tray in the second trip).
- 7 trays from another table will take 1 trip.

So, in total, Jerry will make 2 trips for the first table and 1 trip for the second table, making a total of 3 trips.

Total invited = 24
Number of people who didn't show up = 10
Number of people who showed up = Total invited - Number of people who didn't show up
Number of people who showed up = 24 - 10 = 14

Step 2: Calculate the number of tables needed.
Number of people per table = 7
Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Number of people per table
Number of tables needed = 14 / 7 = 2

Since 14 divided by 7 equals 2, they will need 2 tables.

If they ate 35 pieces the first night, how many pieces do they have left?","To find the total number of pieces of candy Debby and her sister have left, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy they have combined. Debby had 32 pieces, and her sister had 42 pieces. 

Total candy = Debby's candy + Sister's candy
Total candy = 32 + 42
Total candy = 74

2. They ate 35 pieces of candy the first night. To find out how many pieces they have left, we need to subtract the number of pieces they ate from the total number of pieces they had.

Candy left = Total candy - Candy eaten
Candy left = 74 - 35
Candy left = 39

So, Debby and her sister have 39 pieces of candy left.

1. Calculate the total number of rooms left to paint: 
   Total rooms = 12
   Rooms already painted = 4
   Rooms left to paint = Total rooms - Rooms already painted
   Rooms left to paint = 12 - 4
   Rooms left to paint = 8

2. Calculate the total time needed to paint the remaining rooms:
   Time to paint each room = 3 hours
   Time to paint the remaining rooms = Rooms left to paint * Time to paint each room
   Time to paint the remaining rooms = 8 * 3
   Time to paint the remaining rooms = 24 hours

If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find the total number of trips Dave will make, we need to find the total number of trays he has to pick up and divide that by the number of trays he can carry at a time.

Step 1: Find the total number of trays Dave has to pick up.
Trays from one table: 17
Trays from another table: 55
Total trays: 17 + 55 = 72

Step 2: Divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Dave can carry at a time.
Total trays: 72
Trays per trip: 9
Total trips: 72 / 9 = 8

However, since 72 is not exactly divisible by 9 (72 = 8 * 9), we need to check if there are any remaining trays. 
8 trips * 9 trays per trip = 72 trays. This accounts for all the trays, but since we cannot have a fraction of a trip, we must consider if the 8 trips are enough.

72 trays / 9 trays per trip = 8 trips. Since 72 is exactly 8 * 9, Dave will make 8 trips.

1. Jerry can carry 8 trays at a time.
2. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table. Since he can only carry 8 trays at a time, he will need to make 2 trips to pick up the 9 trays (8 trays in the first trip and 1 tray in the second trip).

2. He spent 11 dollars buying new mower blades.
3. To find out how much money he had left, we need to subtract the amount he spent from the amount he made: 
   19 dollars - 11 dollars = 8 dollars
4. Now, we need to find out how many 2-dollar games he could buy with the 8 dollars he had left. To do this, we divide the amount of money he had left by the cost of each game:
   8 dollars / 2 dollars per game = 4 games

So, Frank could buy 4 games with the money he had left.
