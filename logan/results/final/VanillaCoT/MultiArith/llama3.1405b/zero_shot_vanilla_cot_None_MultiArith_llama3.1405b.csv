397,"Debby's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold 9 people and there are 40 students and 14 adults going, how many vans will they need?","To find out how many vans Debby's class will need, we need to calculate the total number of people going on the trip and then divide that by the number of people each van can hold.

1. Calculate the total number of people going on the trip:
   Total number of people = number of students + number of adults
   Total number of people = 40 + 14
   Total number of people = 54

2. Divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold:
   Number of vans needed = Total number of people / number of people per van
   Number of vans needed = 54 / 9
   Number of vans needed = 6

Since you can't have a fraction of a van, and 6 vans can hold 54 people (6 * 9 = 54), we don't need to round up in this case.

1. John currently has 5 action figures, but he needs 7 for a complete collection. 
2. To find out how many more action figures he needs, we subtract the number he has from the total number he needs: 7 - 5 = 2.
3. Since each action figure costs $5, we multiply the number of action figures he needs by the cost per action figure: 2 * $5 = $10.

Therefore, John needs $10 to finish his collection.

If 47 of the flowers wilted before the wedding, how many bouquets could she still make?","To find out how many bouquets Wendy can still make, we need to subtract the wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked, then divide the result by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Step 1: Subtract the wilted flowers from the total number of flowers.
Total flowers = 103
Wilted flowers = 47
Remaining flowers = Total flowers - Wilted flowers
Remaining flowers = 103 - 47
Remaining flowers = 56

Step 2: Divide the remaining flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet.
Number of flowers in each bouquet = 8
Number of bouquets = Remaining flowers / Number of flowers in each bouquet
Number of bouquets = 56 / 8
Number of bouquets = 7

1. Calculate the total number of puppies in the shelter after the new puppies are brought in.
   Total puppies = Initial puppies + New puppies
   Total puppies = 9 + 12
   Total puppies = 21

2. Since 3 puppies are adopted per day, we need to divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day to find out how many days it would take for all of them to be adopted.

2. He needs to pick up 9 trays from one table. Since he can only carry 8 trays, he will need to make 2 trips to pick up the 9 trays (8 trays in the first trip and 1 tray in the second trip).
3. After picking up the 9 trays, he needs to pick up 7 trays from another table. Since he can carry 8 trays and he only needs to pick up 7 trays, he can do this in 1 trip.

However, we can optimize the trips. After picking up 8 trays from the first table, Jerry can pick up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and 7 trays from the second table in the next 2 trips, but he can actually do it in just 2 trips total. 

In the first trip, Jerry picks up 8 trays from the first table. 
In the second trip, Jerry picks up the remaining 1 tray from the first table and 7 trays from the second table.

So, Jerry will make a total of 2 trips.

If he had to pick up 20 trays from one table and 16 trays from another, how many trips will he make?","To find out how many trips Luke will make, we need to calculate the total number of trays he needs to pick up and then divide that by the number of trays he can carry per trip.

1. Calculate the total number of trays: 
   Total trays = trays from the first table + trays from the second table
   Total trays = 20 + 16
   Total trays = 36

2. Calculate the number of trips:
   Since Luke can carry 4 trays per trip, we divide the total number of trays by 4.
   Trips = Total trays / 4
   Trips = 36 / 4
   Trips = 9

So, Luke will make 9 trips to pick up all the trays.

   She uploaded 2 pictures from her phone and 4 from her camera. 
   So, the total number of pictures is 2 + 4 = 6.

2. Next, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums. 
   There are 3 albums, and we want the same number of pictures in each album. 
   So, we divide 6 by 3.

3. 6 divided by 3 is 2.

Therefore, there were 2 pictures in each of the albums.

1. Tom initially had 5 books.
2. He sold 4 of them, so he was left with 5 - 4 = 1 book.
3. He used the money from selling the 4 books to buy 38 new books.
4. Now, Tom has the 1 book he didn't sell plus the 38 new books he bought.

So, the total number of books Tom has is 1 + 38 = 39.

1. Calculate the total number of games John bought.
   He bought 21 games from a friend and 8 more at a garage sale.
   Total games = 21 + 8 = 29

2. Determine how many of the games didn't work.
   23 of the games didn't work.

3. Calculate the number of good games by subtracting the number of non-working games from the total number of games.
   Good games = Total games - Non-working games
   Good games = 29 - 23
   Good games = 6

So, John ended up with 6 good games.

342,"Olivia uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera to facebook. If she sorted the pics into 8 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album, how many pictures were in each of the albums?","To find out how many pictures were in each album, we need to first find the total number of pictures Olivia uploaded. 

1. She uploaded 5 pictures from her phone and 35 from her camera. 
   Total pictures = 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40 pictures.

2. Now, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums to find out how many pictures were in each album.
   Number of albums = 8
   Pictures in each album = Total pictures / Number of albums
                          = 40 / 8
                          = 5

So, there were 5 pictures in each of the albums.

If each necklace cost 9 dollars, how much money did she earn?","To find out how much money Megan earned, we need to calculate the total number of necklaces she sold and multiply it by the cost of each necklace.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of necklaces sold.
Total number of necklaces = number of bead necklaces + number of gem stone necklaces
Total number of necklaces = 7 + 3
Total number of necklaces = 10

Step 2: Multiply the total number of necklaces by the cost of each necklace.
Total earnings = total number of necklaces * cost of each necklace
Total earnings = 10 * 9
Total earnings = 90

So, Megan earned 90 dollars.
