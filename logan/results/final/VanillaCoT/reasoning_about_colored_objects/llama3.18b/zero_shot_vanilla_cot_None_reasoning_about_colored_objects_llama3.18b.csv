1. There are two burgundy necklaces on the desk.

3. Since the question asks how many necklaces remain on the desk, we need to consider the number of blue necklaces initially present on the desk.
4. There is one blue necklace on the desk.
5. Since the burgundy items include the two burgundy necklaces, removing them will leave the blue necklaces untouched.
6. Therefore, after removing the burgundy items, the number of necklaces remaining on the desk will be the initial number of blue necklaces.

2. We need to find the number of non-mauve objects to the left of the magenta object.
   - The mauve textbook is to the left of the magenta cat toy, but it's mauve, so it doesn't count as a non-mauve object.

The gold pencil, pink plate, and black envelope are not purple.

The objects to the left of the blue cup are: 
1. Orange scrunchie

Both of these objects are non-grey. Therefore, there are two non-grey objects to the left of the blue object.

Fuchsia is a shade of pink, so we need to identify the pink items. The pink items are the magenta stress ball (note: magenta is actually a different color, but it is often confused with pink) and the pink pair of sunglasses. However, magenta is not pink. 

We are looking for non-fuchsia things, so we exclude the pink pair of sunglasses. We also exclude the magenta stress ball, because it is fuchsia.
