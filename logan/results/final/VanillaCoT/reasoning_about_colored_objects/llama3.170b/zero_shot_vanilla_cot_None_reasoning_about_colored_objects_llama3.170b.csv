Initially, there are:
- 1 mauve cat toy
- 2 purple cat toys
- 3 grey cat toys
- 2 mauve notebooks
- 3 grey notebooks
- 3 burgundy cat toys
- 1 purple notebook

We need to remove all the notebooks from the floor. So, we'll remove:
- 2 mauve notebooks
- 3 grey notebooks
- 1 purple notebook

Now, let's count the grey objects remaining on the floor:
- 3 grey cat toys (since the grey notebooks were removed)

So, there are 3 grey objects remaining on the floor.

5. green notebook

Since fuchsia and burgundy are shades of magenta, we can consider them magenta items. 

The items to the right of the red jug are:
1. gold puzzle
2. burgundy bracelet
3. green notebook

Out of these items, the non-magenta items are:
1. gold puzzle

If the order is: blue envelope, orange mug, grey pen
The thing furthest from the grey pen would be the blue envelope.

If the order is: orange mug, blue envelope, grey pen
The thing furthest from the grey pen would still be the orange mug.

If the order is: grey pen, orange mug, blue envelope
The thing furthest from the grey pen would still be the blue envelope.

In any case, the color of the thing furthest from the grey thing is either orange or blue. Since orange is mentioned in the options and is a possible answer, but the most consistent answer with the given information would be the blue envelope.

Since the pen is in the middle (4th item in the list), we need to look at the first item (at one end) and the last item (at the other end). The first item is the mauve keychain, and the last item is the black crayon.

- one mauve puzzle = 1

Total number of mauve items = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7

Removing the dog leashes does not affect the mauve items, as there are no mauve dog leashes. 

So, the number of mauve things remaining on the table is 7.

1. Red cup (non-turquoise)
2. Turquoise scrunchie/phone charger (turquoise)
3. Yellow dog leash (yellow)

Since we are looking for non-turquoise items to the left of the yellow item, we only consider the items before the yellow leash. There is one non-turquoise item to the left of the yellow leash, which is the red cup.

However, we should also consider the items that come after the turquoise item but before the yellow leash. There are no items between the turquoise item and the yellow leash. But before the turquoise item, there is the red cup. So the total number of non-turquoise items to the left of the yellow leash is one, plus none between the turquoise and yellow items, plus none before the turquoise item but after the red cup. 

So, there is just one non-turquoise item to the left of the yellow leash.

Since we are looking for non-turquoise things to the left of the sheet of paper, we can ignore the sheet of paper itself and the turquoise keychain. The green pen is also to the right of the sheet of paper, so we can ignore that as well.

The only non-turquoise object to the left of the sheet of paper is the pink fidget spinner. Therefore, there is only one non-turquoise thing to the left of the sheet of paper.

Since the paperclip is in the middle (at position 3), the objects furthest from it would be at the ends of the arrangement, which are the green bracelet (at position 1) and the teal cup (at position 4). 

However, since we are looking for a single answer, we need to determine which one is furthest. Both are equidistant from the paperclip, but for the purpose of this question, we can consider either one. 

Considering the options given, the colors of the objects at the ends are green and teal. The closest match for teal is not available, but we do have the option for green.
