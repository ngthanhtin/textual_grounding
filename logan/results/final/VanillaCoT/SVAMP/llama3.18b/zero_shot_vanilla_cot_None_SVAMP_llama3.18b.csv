394,"White t - shirts can be purchased in packages of 13. If mom buys 39 white t - shirts, how many packages will she have?","To find out how many packages of 13 white t-shirts mom will have, we need to divide the total number of t-shirts (39) by the number of t-shirts in each package (13).

First, we divide 39 by 13: 39 ÷ 13 = 3.

However, since we are dealing with packages, we need to consider if there are any remaining t-shirts. To do this, we multiply the result by the number of t-shirts in each package and compare it to the total number of t-shirts.

3 * 13 = 39

Since 3 * 13 equals 39, mom will have exactly 3 packages of 13 white t-shirts. There will be no remaining t-shirts.

776,"There are 87 oranges and 290 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 2 groups and oranges are organized into 93 groups, how big is each group of bananas?","To find the size of each group of bananas, we first need to find the total number of groups of bananas. However, we are given the number of groups of oranges instead. 

Let's start by finding the number of bananas in each group. 

Since there are 290 bananas and they are organized into 2 groups, we can divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups to find the size of each group.

However, we are given the number of groups of oranges. We need to find a relationship between the two. 

Since the oranges are organized into 93 groups, we can divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups to find the number of oranges in each group.

Total oranges = 87
Number of groups of oranges = 93

Number of oranges in each group = Total oranges / Number of groups of oranges
= 87 / 93
= 0.933 (approximately)

Now, we know that the total number of bananas is 290 and they are organized into 2 groups. 

Let's divide the total number of bananas by 2 to find the size of each group of bananas.

Number of bananas in each group = Total bananas / Number of groups of bananas
= 290 / 2
= 145

So, the size of each group of bananas is 145."
911,"Baker made 157 cakes and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries, how many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?","To find out how many more cakes than pastries the baker sold, we need to calculate the difference between the number of cakes sold and the number of pastries sold.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in the number of cakes sold and made (to check if there's a loss or gain in cakes) 
Cakes made: 157
Cakes sold: 158
Difference in cakes: 158 - 157 = 1 (The baker has 1 extra cake)

Step 2: Calculate the difference in the number of pastries sold and made (to check if there's a loss or gain in pastries)
Pastries made: 169
Pastries sold: 147
Difference in pastries: 169 - 147 = 22 (The baker has 22 extra pastries)

Step 3: Now, let's find out the difference between the number of cakes sold and the number of pastries sold
Cakes sold: 158
Pastries sold: 147
Difference: 158 - 147 = 11

41,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?,"To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park, we need to first determine how many bottle caps and wrappers he found in total.

Initially, Danny found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps. Now, he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. 

Let's find out how many bottle caps and wrappers he already had before going to the park. 

Since he now has 21 bottle caps and initially found 50, he must have had 21 - 50 = -29 bottle caps before going to the park. This means he had 29 bottle caps at home before going to the park.

Similarly, since he now has 52 wrappers and initially found 46, he must have had 52 - 46 = 6 wrappers before going to the park.

Now, let's find out how many bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park. 

He found 50 - 29 = 21 bottle caps at the park.
He found 46 - 6 = 40 wrappers at the park.

Now we know that Danny found 21 bottle caps and 40 wrappers at the park. 

To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found at the park, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps. 

21 (bottle caps) - 40 (wrappers) = -19

So, Danny found 19 fewer wrappers than bottle caps at the park.

265,Robin has 43 packages of gum. There are 23 pieces in each package. Robin has 8 extra pieces of gum. How many pieces of gum does Robin have?,"To find the total number of pieces of gum Robin has, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in the packages and add the extra pieces.

1. First, we multiply the number of packages by the number of pieces in each package:
43 packages * 23 pieces/package = 989 pieces

2. Next, we add the extra pieces to the total number of pieces:
989 pieces + 8 pieces = 997 pieces

Therefore, Robin has {997} pieces of gum."

Melissa scored 109 points in each game.
She also got 82 bonus points in each game.

Total points in each game = 109 (points) + 82 (bonus points) = 191 points

Now, we multiply the total points in each game by the number of games:
191 points/game * 79 games = 15,009 points

So, Melissa scored {15009} points in 79 games."

497,Dan has $ 4. He bought 99 candy bar for $ 3 each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?,"To find out how much money is left, we need to calculate the total cost of the candy bars and subtract it from Dan's initial amount of money.

1. Dan bought 99 candy bars for $3 each. 
   Total cost = Number of candy bars * Cost per candy bar
   Total cost = 99 * $3
   Total cost = $297

2. Dan initially had $4. 
   Now, we need to subtract the total cost from his initial amount of money.
   Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
   Money left = $4 - $297
   Money left = -$293

Since Dan doesn't have enough money to buy the candy bars, the money left is a negative value.

414,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 11 bottle caps and 28 wrappers at the park. Now he has 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps did danny find at the park?,"To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny found at the park, we need to first determine how many bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park.

Initially, Danny had some unknown number of bottle caps and wrappers. After finding 11 bottle caps and 28 wrappers at the park, he had 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers in total.

Let's denote the initial number of bottle caps as 'x' and the initial number of wrappers as 'y'.

We know that after finding 11 bottle caps, he had 68 in total. So, the equation for bottle caps is:
x + 11 = 68

Solving for 'x', we get:
x = 68 - 11
x = 57

Now, we know that Danny initially had 57 bottle caps.

Similarly, for wrappers, we know that after finding 28 wrappers, he had 51 in total. So, the equation for wrappers is:
y + 28 = 51

Solving for 'y', we get:
y = 51 - 28
y = 23

Now, we know that Danny initially had 23 wrappers.

To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps he found at the park, we need to subtract the initial number of wrappers from the initial number of bottle caps, and then add the number of wrappers he found at the park.

So, the calculation is:
(Initial bottle caps - Initial wrappers) + (Wrappers found at the park)
= (57 - 23) + 28
= 34 + 28
= 62

Therefore, Danny found 62 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.

If he works overtime every week, how much money does he earn during harvest season?","To find out how much Lewis earns during the harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings from regular work and overtime work.

1. First, we calculate Lewis's total earnings from regular work:
   Regular earnings per week = $28
   Number of weeks = 1091
   Total earnings from regular work = Regular earnings per week * Number of weeks
   Total earnings from regular work = $28 * 1091
   Total earnings from regular work = $30,508

2. Next, we calculate Lewis's total earnings from overtime work:
   Overtime earnings per week = $939
   Number of weeks = 1091
   Total earnings from overtime work = Overtime earnings per week * Number of weeks
   Total earnings from overtime work = $939 * 1091
   Total earnings from overtime work = $1,024,649

3. Now, we add the total earnings from regular work and overtime work to find Lewis's total earnings during the harvest season:
   Total earnings = Total earnings from regular work + Total earnings from overtime work
   Total earnings = $30,508 + $1,024,649
   Total earnings = $1,055,157

So, Lewis earns {1,055,157} during the harvest season."

How many more bottle caps did danny find at the park than those he threw away?,"To find out how many more bottle caps Danny found at the park than those he threw away, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he went to the park. We know he had some old ones and after throwing away 6, he still had some. Since he ended up with 60 after finding 50 new ones, let's denote the number of old bottle caps he had before going to the park as 'x'. Then, after throwing away 6, he had (x - 6) old ones left.

2. Now, let's find the total number of bottle caps he had before going to the park. We know he had (x - 6) old ones and he found 50 new ones, so the total number of bottle caps he had after going to the park is (x - 6) + 50 = 60.

3. Now, let's solve the equation (x - 6) + 50 = 60 to find the value of 'x'. 
   (x - 6) + 50 = 60
   x - 6 = 10
   x = 16

4. So, Danny had 16 old bottle caps before going to the park. Now, let's find out how many more bottle caps he found at the park than those he threw away. He found 50 new ones and threw away 6 old ones, so the difference is 50 - 6 = 44.

1. Danny threw away 60 old bottle caps.
2. He found 58 new bottle caps.
3. Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection.

Let's denote the initial number of bottle caps as 'x'. After throwing away 60, he had 'x - 60' bottle caps. Then, he found 58 new ones, so he had 'x - 60 + 58' bottle caps. This number is equal to 67.

Now, let's write the equation:

Add 2 to both sides:
x = 69

1. Paul had 62 books left after selling some and giving 35 books to his friend. 
2. To find out how many books he had before giving 35 books to his friend, we need to add the number of books he gave away to the number of books he had left. 
   62 (books left) + 35 (books given away) = 97 books

Now, we know that Paul had 97 books before giving 35 books to his friend. 

3. To find out how many books he had before selling some, we need to add the number of books he sold to the number of books he had before giving some away. 
   Let's call the number of books he sold 'x'. 
   So, the total number of books he had before selling some is 97 + x.

4. We know that Paul had 108 books initially. 
   So, we can set up an equation: 
   108 = 97 + x

5. To find the value of 'x', we need to subtract 97 from both sides of the equation: 
   x = 108 - 97
   x = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

63,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, how many cups of flour did she put in?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. This means the amount of flour she still needs is 2 cups more than the amount of sugar she still needs.
2. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar. Since Mary still needs some cups of sugar, let's call the amount of sugar she still needs 'x' cups. Then, the amount of flour she still needs is 'x + 2' cups.
3. The total amount of flour the recipe calls for is 11 cups. Since Mary already put in some cups of flour, the amount of flour she still needs is 11 - (the amount of flour she already put in).
4. We can set up an equation based on the information above:

   11 - (the amount of flour she already put in) = x + 2
5. We also know that the amount of sugar she still needs is 'x' cups. The total amount of sugar the recipe calls for is 7 cups. Since Mary already put in some cups of sugar, the amount of sugar she still needs is 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in).
6. Since the amount of sugar she still needs is 'x' cups, we can set up another equation:

   x = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
7. We are given that the amount of flour she still needs is 2 more than the amount of sugar she still needs. This means:

   x + 2 = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
8. Simplifying the equation, we get:

   x + 2 = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
   x + 2 = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
   x = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in) - 2
   x = 5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
9. Since the amount of flour she still needs is x + 2, we can substitute x with 5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in):

   x + 2 = (5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)) + 2
   x + 2 = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
   x = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in) - 2
   x = 5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
10. We are given that the amount of flour she still needs is 2 more than the amount of sugar she still needs. We can substitute x with 5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in):

    11 - (the amount of flour she already put in) = (5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)) + 2
11. We are given that the amount of flour she still needs is 2 more than the amount of sugar she still needs. We can substitute x with 5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in):

    11 - (the amount of flour she already put in) = (5 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)) + 2
    11 - (the amount of flour she already put in) = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
12. We can solve for (the amount of flour she already put in):

    11 - (the amount of flour she already put in) = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
    11 - (the amount of flour she already put in) = 7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in)
    (the amount of flour she already put in) = 11 - (7 - (the amount of sugar she already put in))
    (the amount of flour she already put in) = 11 - 7 + (the amount of sugar she already put in)
    (the amount of flour she already put in) = 4 + (the amount of sugar she already put in)
13. We are given that the amount of sugar she still needs is 'x' cups. The total amount of sugar the recipe calls for is 7 cups. Since Mary already put in some cups of sugar, the amount of sugar she already put in is 7 - x.

    (the amount of flour she already put in) = 4 + (the amount of sugar she already put in)
    (the amount of flour she already put in) = 4 + (7 - x)
    (the amount of flour she already put in) = 11 - x

So the amount of flour Mary already put in is 11 - x, where x is the amount of sugar she still needs.

Since we don't know the exact amount of sugar she still needs, we can't give a specific number for the amount of flour she already put in. However, we can say that the amount of flour she already put in is less than 11, because she still needs some cups of flour."

1. Initially, there were 13 roses in the vase.
2. Jessica cut some more roses from her garden, which had a total of 12 roses. This means she took some roses from the garden to add to the vase.
3. After adding the roses, there are now 21 roses in the vase.

Since Jessica took some roses from the garden to add to the vase, the total number of roses in the vase now is the sum of the initial number of roses in the vase and the number of roses she took from the garden.

Let's denote the number of roses Jessica took from the garden as 'x'. Then, the equation can be written as:

1. First, we know that there were initially 21 roses in the vase.
2. After throwing away 34 roses, the number of roses left in the vase is 21 - 34 = -13 (since you can't have a negative number of roses). However, this is not the correct approach, we should consider the roses she cut from her garden.
3. Let's denote the number of roses cut from her garden as 'x'. Then, the total number of roses in the vase after cutting and throwing away should be 21 - 34 + x = 15 (since there are 15 roses in the vase now).
4. Simplify the equation: -13 + x = 15
5. Solve for 'x': x = 15 + 13 = 28

640,Dan has $ 2. He bought some candy bar for $ 6 each one costing $ 3. How many candy bar did he buy?,"To find out how many candy bars Dan bought, let's break down the information:

1. Dan has $2 initially.
2. Each candy bar costs $6.
3. Dan also spent $3 on something else.

First, let's calculate how much money Dan spent on the candy bars. Since we don't know how many candy bars he bought, let's call the number of candy bars 'x'. 

The total cost of the candy bars would be $6x.

We know that Dan spent a total of $3 on something else. So, the total amount of money Dan spent is $6x + $3.

Since Dan initially had $2, the total amount of money he spent is equal to the initial amount he had. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$6x + $3 = $2

Now, let's solve for x:

$6x = $2 - $3
$6x = -$1

Since we can't have a negative number of candy bars, this means that Dan didn't buy any candy bars.

505,"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 705 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 191 visitors the previous day and 457 visitors the day before that, how many more visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous 245 days?","To find the number of visitors on the previous 245 days, we need to find the total number of visitors on those days and then subtract the visitors on the current day.

First, let's find the total number of visitors on the previous two days:
Previous day: 191 visitors
Day before that: 457 visitors
Total visitors on the previous two days: 191 + 457 = 648 visitors

Since we want to know the number of visitors on the previous 245 days, we can multiply the total visitors on the previous two days by 123.5 (245/2), assuming the number of visitors remains constant.
Total visitors on the previous 245 days ≈ 648 * 123.5 ≈ 79986

Now, let's find the number of visitors on the current day: 705 visitors

The difference between the number of visitors on the current day and the previous 245 days is:
Difference ≈ 79986 - 705 ≈ 79281

However, we can't assume the number of visitors remains constant. To find the actual difference, we need to find the average number of visitors on the previous 245 days.

Average number of visitors on the previous 245 days = Total visitors on the previous 245 days / 245
Average number of visitors on the previous 245 days ≈ 79986 / 245 ≈ 326.7

Now, we can find the total number of visitors on the previous 245 days:
Total visitors on the previous 245 days ≈ 326.7 * 245 ≈ 80016.5

The difference between the number of visitors on the current day and the previous 245 days is:
Difference ≈ 80016.5 - 705 ≈ 79311.5

2. He bought 2 candy bars.
3. Since the candy bars cost the same amount, let's call the cost of each candy bar 'x'.
4. The total cost of 2 candy bars is 2x.
5. We know that the total cost is $4, so we can set up the equation: 2x = 4.

1. Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase.
2. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase. So, the number of roses left after throwing away 4 would be 2 - 4 = -2. However, since we can't have a negative number of roses, this means that the vase was empty after throwing away 4 roses.

3. To have 23 roses in the vase, Jessica must have added 23 roses to the vase. But since the vase was empty after throwing away 4 roses, the 23 roses must be the combination of the new roses she cut from her garden and the 4 roses she threw away.

4. So, let's say she cut x roses from her garden. Then, the total number of roses in the vase would be x + 4 = 23.

5. To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation x + 4 = 23.

6. Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: x = 23 - 4
x = 19

195,Rachel has 4 apple trees. She picked 7 apples from each of her trees. Now the trees have a total 29 apples still on them. How many apples did Rachel pick in all?,"To find the total number of apples Rachel picked, we need to first find the total number of apples on the trees initially. 

Let's denote the initial number of apples on each tree as 'x'. Since Rachel has 4 trees, the total number of apples on the trees initially is 4x.

After picking 7 apples from each tree, the number of apples left on each tree is (x - 7). The total number of apples left on the trees is 4(x - 7).

We are given that the total number of apples left on the trees is 29. So, we can set up the equation:

4x - 28 = 29
4x = 29 + 28
4x = 57
x = 57/4
x = 14.25

Since x represents the initial number of apples on each tree, it must be a whole number. However, we can continue with the calculation to find the total number of apples initially.

The initial number of apples on each tree is 14.25, but since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we can assume that the trees initially had 14 apples each and some extra. Let's assume the extra apples were 0.25 * 4 = 1 apple.

The initial number of apples on each tree is 14, and the total number of apples on the trees initially is 4 * 14 = 56.

After picking 7 apples from each tree, the total number of apples picked is 4 * 7 = 28.

244,Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. We can represent this as an equation:

Ed = Doug + 19

2. After Ed lost some marbles, he had 8 more marbles than Doug. We can represent this as another equation:

New Ed = Doug + 8

3. Since Ed lost some marbles, the new number of marbles Ed has is less than the initial number. We can represent this as:

New Ed < Ed

4. We can substitute the expression for Ed from the first equation into the second equation:

Doug + 8 = Doug + 19 - (Ed - New Ed)

5. Simplify the equation:

8 = 19 - (Ed - New Ed)

6. Rearrange the equation to isolate Ed - New Ed:

Ed - New Ed = 19 - 8
Ed - New Ed = 11

7. Since Ed - New Ed represents the number of marbles Ed lost, we can conclude that Ed lost 11 marbles.

145,In a school there are 135 girls and 214 boys. 496 more girls and 910 more boys joined the school. How many boys are there in the school now?,"To find the number of boys in the school now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total number of boys in the school.
   Initial number of boys = 214

2. Calculate the increase in the number of boys.
   Increase in boys = 910

3. Add the increase in the number of boys to the initial number of boys.
   New number of boys = Initial number of boys + Increase in boys
   New number of boys = 214 + 910
   New number of boys = 1124

So, there are {1124} boys in the school now."

   - The frog's jump distance = 36 inches + 17 inches = 53 inches.

Therefore, the frog jumped {53} inches."
556,Bobby had 21 pieces of candy. He ate 5 pieces of candy. Then he ate 9 more. How many pieces of candy does he still have left?,"To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby still has left, we need to subtract the number of pieces he ate from the total number of pieces he had initially.

1. Bobby had 21 pieces of candy initially.
2. He ate 5 pieces of candy. Now, he has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces left.
3. Then, he ate 9 more pieces of candy. Now, we subtract 9 from the remaining 16 pieces. 16 - 9 = 7.

So, Bobby still has {7} pieces of candy left."
458,41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing and hiking in all?,"To find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking, we need to find the overlap between the two activities. 

First, let's find the total number of campers who went rowing. 
- 41 campers went rowing in the morning.
- 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon.
- Total campers who went rowing = 41 + 26 = 67

However, this count includes the campers who went rowing twice (once in the morning and once in the afternoon). To find the actual number of unique campers who went rowing, we don't need to do anything because we have only been told the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.

Next, let's find the total number of campers who went hiking. 
- 4 campers went hiking in the morning.

Now, to find the number of campers who went rowing and hiking, we need to find the overlap. Since we don't know the exact number of campers who went rowing and hiking, we will represent it as x. 

The total number of campers who went rowing is the sum of the campers who went rowing in the morning and the campers who went rowing in the afternoon minus the campers who went rowing and hiking (because they are counted twice). So, the equation becomes: 
41 + 26 - x = 67
67 - x = 67
-x = 0
x = 0

However, this is not possible because at least one camper went rowing and hiking. The equation is not correct. We need to reconsider our approach.

Let's consider the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking as x. Then, the total number of campers who went rowing is 41 + 26 - x (because the x campers are counted twice). The total number of campers who went rowing and hiking is the same as the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning because they went rowing and hiking. The total number of campers who went rowing in the morning is 41.

The total number of campers who went rowing and hiking is the same as the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning minus the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning minus the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking. This is the same as the total number of campers who went rowing in the morning minus the total number of campers who went rowing minus the total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon plus the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking. 

This can be written as the equation: 
41 - (41 + 26 - x) = x
41 - 67 + x = x
-26 + x = x
-26 = 0

However, this is not possible because -26 is not equal to 0. We need to reconsider our approach.

Let's consider the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking as x. Then, the total number of campers who went rowing is 41 + 26 - x (because the x campers are counted twice).

If she had a total of 6 bags altogether, how many bags did she find on the next day?","To find out how many bags Tiffany found on the next day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday.
2. The next day, she found some more bags of cans.
3. After finding more bags, she had a total of 6 bags altogether.

Now, let's find out how many bags she found on the next day:

Let x be the number of bags she found on the next day.

We know that the total number of bags she had after finding more is 6, which includes the initial 4 bags she had on Monday.

So, we can write an equation:

4 (initial bags) + x (bags found) = 6 (total bags)

Now, let's solve for x:

4 + x = 6

Subtract 4 from both sides:

x = 2

Therefore, Tiffany found 2 bags of cans on the next day.

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of gum:
   Robin has 28 packages of gum, and each package contains 6 pieces. 
   Total pieces of gum = 28 packages * 6 pieces/package = 168 pieces

2. Calculate the total number of pieces of candy:
   Robin has 14 packages of candy, and each package contains 6 pieces. 
   Total pieces of candy = 14 packages * 6 pieces/package = 84 pieces

3. Add the total number of pieces of gum and candy to find the total number of pieces Robin has:

If you read 19 of the books and watched 13 of the movies, how many more books than movies are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?","To find out how many more books than movies are there in the 'crazy silly school' series, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books and movies in the series.
   Total books = 16
   Total movies = 14

2. Calculate how many books and movies have been read and watched.
   Books read = 19
   Movies watched = 13

3. Calculate the remaining books and movies that haven't been read or watched.
   Remaining books = Total books - Books read = 16 - 19 = -3 (This is incorrect, we need to consider the total number of books available which is 16. Since 19 books have been read, it means we have read more books than available. So we should use the total number of books available which is 16. Remaining books = 16 - 19 = -3. However, since we can't have a negative number of books, we will consider that we have read all the books available. Therefore, remaining books = 0)
   Remaining movies = Total movies - Movies watched = 14 - 13 = 1

4. Now, let's calculate the difference between the remaining books and movies.
   Difference = Remaining books - Remaining movies = 0 - 1 = -1

However, since we are looking for how many more books than movies are there in the series, we need to consider the difference between the total number of books and movies, not the remaining ones.

5. Calculate the difference between the total number of books and movies.
   Difference = Total books - Total movies = 16 - 14 = 2

So, there are 2 more books than movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.

553,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. How many bottle caps did danny have at first?,"To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, let's denote the initial number of bottle caps as 'x'. 

We know that Danny found 22 bottle caps at the park. Therefore, the total number of bottle caps he has now is the sum of the initial number of bottle caps and the number of bottle caps he found, which is (x + 22).

We are also given that Danny now has 28 bottle caps. So we can set up the equation:

x + 22 = 28

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 22 from both sides:

x + 22 - 22 = 28 - 22
x = 6

Therefore, Danny had {6} bottle caps at first."

617,Katie had 57 new games and 39 old games. Her friends had 34 new games. How many more games does Katie have than her friends?,"To find out how many more games Katie has than her friends, we need to first calculate the total number of games Katie has and the total number of games her friends have.

Katie has 57 new games and 39 old games. To find the total number of games Katie has, we add these two numbers together:
57 + 39 = 96

Her friends have 34 new games. We don't know if they have any old games, but we only need to compare the number of games Katie has to the number of games her friends have. Since we are only comparing the number of games, we can ignore any old games her friends may have.

Now, we subtract the number of games her friends have from the number of games Katie has:
96 - 34 = 62

Therefore, Katie has 62 more games than her friends.

695,Dave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 24 files and 2 apps left. How many more files than apps does he have left on the phone?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Initially, Dave had 11 apps and 3 files.

After deleting some apps and files, he had:
- 2 apps left (which means he deleted 11 - 2 = 9 apps)
- 24 files left (which means he deleted 3 - 24 = -21 files, but this is impossible as you can't delete more files than you had initially, so we'll assume he had more files initially)

Let's rephrase the problem to find the initial number of files: 
After deleting some apps and files, he had 24 files left. This means he deleted 24 - x = 3 files initially (x is the initial number of files), but this is also impossible. However, we can try to find the initial number of files by assuming he had x files initially and deleting y apps and z files, where x = 3 + z and y = 11 - 2.

Since Dave had 2 apps left, he deleted 11 - 2 = 9 apps. This means the initial number of apps was 11, and the number of apps deleted was 9.

We can also assume that the number of files deleted was equal to the initial number of files minus the number of files left, i.e., z = x - 24. 

Since Dave had 24 files left, we can assume that the initial number of files was x = 24 + z. We already know that z = x - 24, so we can substitute z into the equation x = 24 + z to get x = 24 + (x - 24), which simplifies to x = x. This is a contradiction, so we can't solve for x using this method.

However, we can try to find the initial number of files by assuming he had x files initially and deleting y apps and z files, where x = 3 + z and y = 11 - 2 (we don't know the exact number of files deleted, so we'll use z). 

We also know that the number of apps deleted was 9, and the number of files deleted was z. Since Dave had 2 apps left, we can set up the equation 11 - 2 = 9, which is true.

Now, let's try to find the initial number of files by assuming he had x files initially and deleting y apps and z files, where x = 3 + z and y = 9.

We know that Dave had 24 files left, so we can set up the equation x - z = 24, where x is the initial number of files and z is the number of files deleted.

Since x = 3 + z, we can substitute this into the equation x - z = 24 to get 3 + z - z = 24, which simplifies to 3 = 24. This is a contradiction, so we can't solve for x using this method.

498,5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?,"To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus.
3. After the bus stop, there were 14 children altogether on the bus.

Now, let's find out how many children were on the bus after 63 got off. Since 63 got off, the number of children left on the bus would be the initial number minus 63. 

However, we are told that after 63 children got off, there were 14 children altogether on the bus. So the number of children that got on the bus after 63 got off is the total number of children now (14) minus the number of children left after 63 got off. 

Let's call the number of children that got on the bus 'x'. Then, the equation would be:

Initial children + x = 14 (since 63 got off)

We know that initially there were 5 children. So the equation becomes:
5 + x = 14

To find 'x', we subtract 5 from both sides:
x = 14 - 5
x = 9

Now, we know that 9 children got on the bus. To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we subtract the number of children that got off from the number of children that got on:

9 (children that got on) - 63 (children that got off) = -54

Since we can't have a negative number of children, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem. However, if we are asked to find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we would still provide the correct calculation based on the given information.

So, the answer would be { -54} (but negative) which is incorrect."

697 - 228 = x
469 = x

If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days, how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day?","To find out the number of visitors on the previous day, we first need to find the average number of visitors per day. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of visitors within the past 327 days. 
Total visitors = 406

Step 2: Calculate the average number of visitors per day.
Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Total days
Average visitors per day = 406 / 327
Average visitors per day ≈ 1.24

Step 3: Since we want to find the number of visitors on the previous day, we need to subtract 1 from the current day.
So, the number of visitors on the previous day = Average visitors per day - 1
Number of visitors on the previous day ≈ 1.24 - 1
Number of visitors on the previous day ≈ 0.24

However, we can't have a fraction of a visitor, so we need to consider the context of the problem. Since we know that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day, we can find the number of visitors on the previous day by subtracting the current day's visitors from the average number of visitors per day.

Number of visitors on the previous day = Average visitors per day - Current day's visitors
Number of visitors on the previous day ≈ 1.24 - 132
However, we should consider the average as a rough estimate of the number of visitors, so let's round the average to the nearest whole number.
Average visitors per day ≈ 1.24 ≈ 1

Number of visitors on the previous day = Average visitors per day - Current day's visitors
Number of visitors on the previous day = 1 - 132
However, we should note that this method will not give an accurate result as the average number of visitors per day is not an exact number. 

Let's try another approach. We can use the information given in the problem to find the number of visitors on the previous day.

Number of visitors within the past 327 days = 406
Number of visitors on the current day = 132
Number of visitors on the previous day = Number of visitors within the past 327 days - Number of visitors on the current day - Number of visitors on the day before the current day.

We don't know the number of visitors on the day before the current day, so let's assume the number of visitors on the day before the current day is x.

Number of visitors on the previous day = Number of visitors within the past 327 days - Number of visitors on the current day - Number of visitors on the day before the current day
Number of visitors on the previous day = 406 - 132 - x
However, we know that the number of visitors on the day before the current day is also part of the total number of visitors within the past 327 days. 

Since the number of visitors on the day before the current day is x, the number of visitors on the day before the day before the current day is also part of the total number of visitors within the past 327 days. 

However, we can't find the number of visitors on the day before the day before the current day. So, let's try to find the number of visitors on the day before the current day.

Let's assume the number of visitors on the day before the current day is y.

Number of visitors within the past 327 days = Number of visitors on the current day + Number of visitors on the day before the current day + Number of visitors on the day before the day before the current day + ... + Number of visitors on the day 327 days ago
406 = 132 + y + Number of visitors on the day before the day before the current day + ... + Number of visitors on the day 327 days ago

However, we can't find the number of visitors on the day before the day before the current day. So, let's try to find the number of visitors on the day before the current day.

Let's assume the number of visitors on the day before the current day is y.

Number of visitors on the previous day = Number of visitors within the past 327 days - Number of visitors on the current day - Number of visitors on the day before the current day
Number of visitors on the previous day = 406 - 132 - y

However, we don't know the value of y. But we can use the fact that the number of visitors on the day before the current day is also part of the total number of visitors within the past 327 days.

Let's try to find the number of visitors on the day before the current day by using the fact that the average number of visitors per day is approximately 1.24.

Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Total days
Average visitors per day = 406 / 327
Average visitors per day ≈ 1.24

Number of visitors on the day before the current day = Average visitors per day - 1
Number of visitors on the day before the current day ≈ 1.24 - 1
Number of visitors on the day before the current day ≈ 0.24

However, we can't have a fraction of a visitor, so we need to consider the context of the problem. Since we know that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day, we can find the number of visitors on the previous day by subtracting the current day's visitors from the average number of visitors per day.

Number of visitors on the previous day = Number of visitors within the past 327 days - Number of visitors on the current day - Number of visitors on the day before the current day

Since we know that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day, we can find the number of visitors on the previous day by subtracting the current day's visitors from the total number of visitors within the past 327 days.

Number of visitors on the previous day = Number of visitors within the past 327 days - Number of visitors on the current day
Number of visitors on the previous day = 406 - 132
Number of visitors on the previous day = 274

However, we should note that this method will not give an accurate result as it doesn't take into account the number of visitors on the day before the current day.

Since we can't find the number of visitors on the day before the current day, we can't find the exact number of visitors on the previous day."

If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes, how many students suggested bacon?","To find the number of students who suggested adding bacon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is x.
2. Since 166 more students suggested adding bacon, the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166.
3. We are given that the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 182 + (number of students who suggested adding bacon).
4. Since the total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is the sum of the students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and the students who suggested adding bacon, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 166) = 182 + (number of students who suggested adding bacon).
5. However, we can simplify this equation by using the information given. The total number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon is 182. We can rewrite the equation as: x + (x + 166) = 182.
6. We can combine like terms: 2x + 166 = 182.
7. We can subtract 166 from both sides: 2x = 16.
8. We can divide both sides by 2: x = 8.
9. Since the number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + 166, we can substitute x = 8 into this expression: 8 + 166 = 174.

Therefore, {174}."

Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, and he had 13 crackers initially, he must have given away 13 crackers in total. 

We can calculate how many crackers each person got by dividing the total number of crackers given away (13) by the number of friends (28):

13 crackers / 28 friends = 0.464 (approximately) or 9/19 of a cracker per friend (if we consider whole crackers only)

However, since Matthew had 15 cakes initially and gave equal numbers of cakes to his friends, he must have given away a total of 15 cakes. 

We can calculate how many cakes each person got by dividing the total number of cakes given away (15) by the number of friends (28):

15 cakes / 28 friends = 0.536 (approximately) or 10/19 of a cake per friend (if we consider whole cakes only)

Difference in roses: 14 (final) - 13 (initial) = 1 rose

Since the difference in the number of orchids is 7, and the difference in the number of roses is 1, we can conclude that Jessica cut 7 roses and 6 orchids (84 - 91 = -7, but we can't cut a negative number of orchids, so we assume she cut 6 more orchids than roses).

However, we need to find out how many roses she cut. We know that the difference in the number of roses is 1, which means she cut 1 rose.

650,Rachel has 3 apple trees. She picked 8 apples from each of her trees. Now the trees have a total 9 apples still on them. How many apples were there on all trees initially?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rachel has 3 apple trees.
2. She picked 8 apples from each of her trees. 
   - This means she picked a total of 3 * 8 = 24 apples from all trees.
3. Now the trees have a total of 9 apples still on them.

Since Rachel picked 24 apples, and there are 9 apples left, the initial number of apples on all trees can be found by adding the number of apples picked to the number of apples left:

Initial number of apples = Number of apples picked + Number of apples left
= 24 + 9
= 33

872,"Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 21 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 91 marbles, how many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ed had 91 marbles after losing some.
2. Ed lost 21 marbles at the playground. To find out how many marbles Ed had before losing any, we add the marbles he lost to the marbles he had after losing some:
   91 (marbles after losing) + 21 (marbles lost) = 112
3. So, Ed had 112 marbles before losing any.
4. It's given that Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. Let's denote the number of marbles Doug had as 'x'. Then, Ed had 'x + 30' marbles.
5. Since Ed had 112 marbles before losing any, we can equate this to 'x + 30' to find the number of marbles Doug had:
   x + 30 = 112
6. Solving for 'x', we get:
   x = 112 - 30
   x = 82
7. Now that we know Doug had 82 marbles, we can find the difference between the number of marbles Ed had and the number of marbles Doug had:
   Ed's marbles - Doug's marbles = 112 - 82
   = 30

So, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug."
620,"Jake brought 6 balloons to the park. If Jake brought 4 more balloons than the number of balloons that Allan brought, how many balloons did Allan bring to the park?","To find out how many balloons Allan brought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Jake brought 6 balloons to the park.
2. Jake brought 4 more balloons than Allan brought.
3. Let's represent the number of balloons Allan brought as 'x'.
4. Since Jake brought 4 more balloons than Allan, we can write an equation: x + 4 = 6 (because Jake brought 6 balloons).
5. To solve for 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation: x + 4 - 4 = 6 - 4.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 2.

So, Allan brought {2} balloons to the park."

Let's denote the number of bags Tiffany had on Monday as 'x'. 

Since she found 4 more bags on Tuesday and she had a total of 8 bags, we can write the equation as:
x + 4 = 8

To find 'x', we need to isolate it. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:
x + 4 - 4 = 8 - 4
x = 4

So, Tiffany had 4 bags of cans on Monday.

852,Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds. If together their strawberries weighed 47 pounds. How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?,"To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to first find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed.

Let's denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as M and the weight of his dad's strawberries as D. 

We know that M = 30 pounds and M + D = 47 pounds.

To find D, we can subtract M from both sides of the equation: 
D = M + D - M 
D = 47 - M 
D = 47 - 30 
D = 17 pounds

Now that we know the weight of Marco's and his dad's strawberries, we can find the difference:
Difference = M - D 
Difference = 30 - 17 
Difference = 13 pounds

So, Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds more than his dad's.

   Total houses = 19 houses/block * 78 blocks
   Total houses = 1482 houses

3. Now, we can divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses to find out how many pieces each house should receive:

   Junk mail per house = Total junk mail / Total houses
   Junk mail per house = 2964 pieces / 1482 houses

635,Faye had 31 packs of pencils each one having 6 pencils. She was placing her pencils into rows with 19 pencils in each row. How many pencils does she have?,"To find out how many pencils Faye has, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many pencils are in total in the 31 packs. 
   Since each pack has 6 pencils, we multiply 31 packs by 6 pencils per pack.
   31 * 6 = 186 pencils.

2. Next, we need to find out how many rows Faye can make with 19 pencils in each row.
   Since we already know she has 186 pencils, we divide 186 by 19 pencils per row.
   186 / 19 = 9.789 (we can't have a fraction of a row, so we'll consider it as 9 full rows and remaining pencils).

3. Now, let's calculate the number of remaining pencils after making 9 full rows.
   We multiply 9 rows by 19 pencils per row.
   9 * 19 = 171 pencils.
   Then, we subtract the total number of pencils in the 9 rows from the total number of pencils.
   186 - 171 = 15 pencils.

4. Finally, we add the number of pencils in the 9 rows (171) to the number of remaining pencils (15) to get the total number of pencils.
   171 + 15 = 186

So, Faye has {186} pencils."
810,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, how many more cups of flour does she need to add?","Let's break it down step by step:

1. Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. If we let the number of cups of sugar she still needs be 'x', then the number of cups of flour she still needs is 'x + 8'.

2. The total amount of sugar required is 13 cups, so the amount of sugar she still needs is 13 - (the amount of sugar she has already put in).

3. Since we don't know how much sugar she has already put in, let's represent the amount of sugar she has already put in as 's'. The amount of sugar she still needs is 13 - s.

4. From step 1, the amount of flour she still needs is x + 8. From step 3, the amount of flour she still needs is also 13 - s (since the total amount of flour required is 6 cups).

5. We can equate the two expressions for the amount of flour she still needs: x + 8 = 13 - s.

6. However, we don't know what 's' is, but we do know that the total amount of sugar required is 13 cups. We also know that Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. 

7. Let's represent the amount of flour she has already put in as 'f'. Then, the amount of flour she still needs is 6 - f.

8. We know that the amount of flour she still needs is 8 more than the amount of sugar she still needs. If we let the amount of sugar she still needs be 'y', then the amount of flour she still needs is y + 8.

9. From step 7, the amount of flour she still needs is 6 - f. From step 8, the amount of flour she still needs is also y + 8.

10. We can equate the two expressions for the amount of flour she still needs: 6 - f = y + 8.

10. Since the total amount of sugar required is 13 cups, we can equate the amount of sugar she still needs to 13 - (the amount of sugar she has already put in): y = 13 - s.

11. We can substitute the expression for y from step 10 into the equation from step 9: 6 - f = 13 - s + 8.

12. We can simplify the equation from step 11: 6 - f = 21 - s.

13. We know that Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. If we let the amount of sugar she still needs be 'z', then the amount of flour she still needs is z + 8.

14. From step 12, the amount of flour she still needs is 6 - f. From step 13, the amount of flour she still needs is also z + 8.

15. We can equate the two expressions for the amount of flour she still needs: 6 - f = z + 8.

16. We know that the total amount of sugar required is 13 cups. We also know that Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.

17. Let's represent the amount of sugar she has already put in as 't'. Then, the amount of sugar she still needs is 13 - t.

18. We can equate the amount of sugar she still needs to 13 - t: z = 13 - t.

19. We can substitute the expression for z from step 18 into the equation from step 15: 6 - f = 13 - t + 8.

20. We can simplify the equation from step 19: 6 - f = 21 - t.

21. We know that Mary has already put in some cups of flour. If we let the amount of flour she has already put in be 'p', then the amount of flour she still needs is 6 - p.

22. From step 20, the amount of flour she still needs is 6 - f. From step 21, the amount of flour she still needs is also 6 - p.

23. We can equate the two expressions for the amount of flour she still needs: 6 - f = 6 - p.

24. We can simplify the equation from step 23: f = p.

25. We can substitute the expression for f from step 24 into the equation from step 20: 6 - p = 21 - t.

26. We can simplify the equation from step 25: 6 - 21 = -t + p.

27. We can simplify the equation from step 26: -15 = -t + p.

28. We know that Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. If we let the amount of sugar she still needs be 'v', then the amount of flour she still needs is v + 8.

29. From step 27, the amount of flour she still needs is -t + p. From step 28, the amount of flour she still needs is also v + 8.

30. We can equate the two expressions for the amount of flour she still needs: -t + p = v + 8.

31. We can substitute the expression for v from step 18 into the equation from step 30: -t + p = 13 - t + 8.

37. We can simplify the equation from step 36: t = 36.

38. We know that the total amount of sugar required is 13 cups. We also know that Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.

39. Let's represent the amount of sugar she has already put in as 'u'. Then, the amount of sugar she still needs is 13 - u.

40. We can equate the amount of sugar she still needs to 13 - u: v = 13 - u.

41. We can substitute the expression for v from step 40 into the equation from step 30: -t + p = 13 - u + 8.

42. We can simplify the equation from step 41: -t + p = 21 - u.

43. We can substitute the expression for p from step 33 into the equation from step 42: -t + 21 = 21 - u.

47. We can simplify the equation from step 46: 0 = -36.

48. We can simplify the equation from step 47: This equation is false.

49. Since the equation from step 48 is false, we can conclude that our assumption in step 45 is false.

662,"Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 17 marbles, how many marbles does Doug have now?","To find out how many marbles Doug has, we need to work backwards from Ed's current situation.

1. Ed currently has 17 marbles.
2. Ed lost 20 marbles at the playground, but since he currently has 17, it means he didn't lose 20 marbles. Instead, he must have lost 20 marbles from his original amount. 
3. To find Ed's original amount, we add the marbles he lost (20) to his current amount (17), which equals 37 marbles.
4. Since Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug originally, we can find Doug's original amount by subtracting 12 from Ed's original amount (37). This equals 25 marbles.
5. However, the problem asks for Doug's current amount of marbles, not his original amount. Since there is no information about Doug losing any marbles, we can assume that Doug still has his original amount of marbles.

If you read 13 of the books and watched 63 of the movies, how many more movies than books are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series?","To find out how many more movies than books there are in the 'crazy silly school' series, we need to subtract the number of books read from the number of movies watched.

First, let's find out how many movies and books are there in total. 
There are 11 books and 17 movies in total.

You read 13 books, so the number of books left is 11 - 13 = -2 (this means there are 2 books you haven't read).

You watched 63 movies, so the number of movies left is 17 - 63 = -46 (this means there are 46 movies you haven't watched).

However, the question is asking for the difference between the total number of movies and the total number of books. To find this out, we need to compare the total number of movies and the total number of books, not the number of movies and books that you have read or watched.

First, we know that Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. This means that he gave away the same number of crackers as cakes to each person.

Since he had 98 cakes and gave them away in equal numbers to 4 people, we can divide 98 by 4 to find out how many cakes each person got:

98 cakes / 4 people = 24.5 cakes per person

However, since Matthew can't give a fraction of a cake, and we are given that he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, it's likely that he gave each person a whole number of cakes. Therefore, we can assume that he gave each person 24 cakes (the closest whole number to 24.5).

Now, we know that Matthew gave away 24 cakes to each person. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, he must have given away the same number of crackers to each person. To find out how many crackers each person got, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of people:

Initially, Haley had 3 trees. 
After the typhoon, 13 trees died. 
This means the number of trees that survived is 3 - 13 = -10. However, the number of trees cannot be negative, as we are dealing with a real-world scenario. 

This means that all the trees that initially survived were actually the trees that were already dead, and the 13 trees that died were actually the trees that initially survived.

However, this is impossible in the real world. A more likely explanation is that there were initially more trees than 3 in Haley's backyard. 

If we assume that there were initially 13 trees, then 3 died, and 13 died in the typhoon, this is consistent with the information given.

However, we are asked to find the difference between the number of trees that died in the typhoon and the number of trees that survived.

If there were initially 13 trees, and 3 died before the typhoon, then 10 trees survived the typhoon.

So, the number of trees that died in the typhoon is 13, and the number of trees that survived is 10.

Therefore, the difference is 13 - 10 = 3.

774,Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie. How many apples does He have?,"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Together Adam and Jackie have 12 apples. 
   Let's denote the number of apples Adam has as A and the number of apples Jackie has as J. 
   So, A + J = 12.

2. He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do.
   This means He has 12 + 9 = 21 apples.

3. Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie.
   This means A = J + 8.

Now we have two equations:
A + J = 12
A = J + 8

We can substitute A from the second equation into the first equation:
(J + 8) + J = 12
Combine like terms:
2J + 8 = 12
Subtract 8 from both sides:
2J = 4
Divide both sides by 2:
J = 2

Now that we know J, we can find A:
A = J + 8
A = 2 + 8
A = 10

However, we are asked to find how many apples He has. From step 2, we know He has 21 apples.

1. Matthew had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, we can assume that he gave out 10/4 = 2.5 crackers to each friend. However, since you can't give a fraction of a cracker, this must mean that he actually gave 2 crackers to each friend (as 2 * 4 = 8, which matches the number of crackers he had).

2. Since Matthew gave 2 crackers to each friend, and he had 8 cakes, he must have given 8/4 = 2 cakes to each friend.

3. Now we know that each friend received 2 cakes. However, we are asked how many cakes each person ate, not how many they received. We don't have any information about how many cakes each person ate, so we can't determine this.

First, let's find out how many books and pens Paul sold. 

Initial number of books: 51
Final number of books: 82
Number of books sold = 51 - 82 = -31 (this is incorrect as you can't sell a negative number of books, we'll need to adjust this)

Initial number of pens: 106
Final number of pens: 14
Number of pens sold = 106 - 14 = 92

Since we can't sell a negative number of books, let's recalculate the number of books sold:

Initial number of books: 51
Final number of books: 82
Number of books sold = 82 - 51 = 31

Now, let's find out the total number of items sold. 

Total items sold = Number of books sold + Number of pens sold
Total items sold = 31 + 92
Total items sold = 123

However, we still need to find out how many pens were sold. We know that the total number of items sold is 123, and we also know that 31 books were sold. 

To find out how many pens were sold, we can subtract the number of books sold from the total number of items sold:

Number of pens sold = Total items sold - Number of books sold
Number of pens sold = 123 - 31

Initially, Nell had 438 baseball cards and 18 Ace cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she had 178 baseball cards and 55 Ace cards left.

Let's calculate the number of baseball cards and Ace cards Nell gave away:

Baseball cards given away: 438 - 178 = 260
Ace cards given away: 18 - 55 = -37 (This means she actually received 37 Ace cards from Jeff, but we'll ignore this for now as it's not relevant to the calculation)

Since we know she gave away 260 baseball cards, we can use this information to find out how many Ace cards she gave away. However, the problem states that she received 37 Ace cards from Jeff, so we need to add this to the initial number of Ace cards to find the number of Ace cards she gave away.

Initial Ace cards: 18
Received Ace cards: 37
Total Ace cards before giving some away: 18 + 37 = 55
Ace cards given away: 55 - 55 = 0 (This means she actually didn't give any Ace cards away, but rather received 37 Ace cards from Jeff)

Since she received 37 Ace cards, we can ignore the initial 18 Ace cards for now. To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has, we can subtract the number of Ace cards from the number of baseball cards:

Baseball cards: 178
Ace cards: 55
Difference: 178 - 55 = 123

So, Nell has 123 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

196,Jake has 8 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than Steven. Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches. How many more peaches than apples does Steven have?,"To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we first need to determine the number of peaches and apples Jake has in relation to Steven.

Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches.

Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 18 peaches, Jake has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.

Jake has 10 more apples than Steven. Since Steven has 11 apples, Jake has 11 + 10 = 21 apples.

Now we need to compare Steven's peaches and apples. Steven has 18 peaches and 11 apples.

To find the difference between the number of peaches and apples Steven has, we subtract the number of apples from the number of peaches: 18 - 11 = 7.

So, Steven has 7 more peaches than apples.

163,Steven has 14 peaches. Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven and 3 more peaches than Jill. How many peaches does Jill have?,"To find out how many peaches Jill has, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. Steven has 14 peaches.
2. Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven. 
   So, Jake has 14 - 6 = 8 peaches.
3. Jake has 3 more peaches than Jill.
   Let's denote the number of peaches Jill has as 'x'.
   Then, according to the information, Jake has 'x + 3' peaches.
   We already know that Jake has 8 peaches, so we can set up the equation:
   x + 3 = 8
4. Solving the equation for 'x', we subtract 3 from both sides:
   x = 8 - 3
   x = 5

So, Jill has 5 peaches. {5}"

1. After picking 2 apples, the tree has 7 apples left.
2. This means the tree had 7 (remaining apples) + 2 (apples picked) = 9 apples after the picking.
3. Since the tree had 9 apples right after the picking, it means it had 9 + 2 (apples picked) = 11 apples before the picking.

Therefore, the tree had {11} apples to begin with."

652,"The school is planning a field trip. The school has 17 classrooms. There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full, how many seats are in each bus?","To find out how many seats are in each bus, we need to determine the total number of students and divide it by the number of buses.

1. Total number of students: 92
2. Number of buses: 46
3. To find the number of seats in each bus, divide the total number of students by the number of buses:
   92 students / 46 buses = 2 students per bus

However, this calculation assumes that the total number of students is equal to the total number of seats in all buses. Since the problem doesn't provide information about the total number of seats, we'll assume that the total number of students is less than or equal to the total number of seats in all buses.

Since we don't know the exact number of seats in each bus, let's calculate the total number of seats in all buses by assuming that all buses are full. We can do this by multiplying the number of buses by the number of students per bus.

However, since the problem does not provide information about the number of seats in each bus, we can only assume that all buses are full and the number of students is equal to or less than the total number of seats.

Given that we do not have the total number of seats, we cannot calculate the exact number of seats per bus. However, we can say that the number of students per bus is 2, and we can assume that each bus has at least 2 seats.

However, if we assume that each bus is full and there are 46 buses, we can assume that the total number of students is less than or equal to the total number of seats. If we assume that the total number of students is 92, we can assume that the total number of seats is at least 92.

Therefore, if we assume that the total number of seats is 92 (which is the total number of students), we can calculate the number of seats per bus by dividing the total number of seats by the number of buses.

Let's denote the number of boys as 'x'. Since there are 281 more girls than boys, we can set up the equation:

Number of girls = Number of boys + 281
868 = x + 281

To find 'x', we subtract 281 from both sides of the equation:

x = 868 - 281
x = 587

So, there are 587 boys in the school.

To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of pupils = 587 + 868
Total number of pupils = 1455

997,Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow?,"To find the total number of flowers they grew, we need to determine how many flower beds they planted. 

1. They planted 55 seeds in total.
2. Each flower bed has 15 seeds planted.
3. To find the number of flower beds, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds in each bed: 55 / 15 = 3.67 (round down to 3 because you can't have a fraction of a bed).

However, this is not the correct answer. They planted 15 seeds in each flower bed but only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. This means the flower beds have a different capacity than the seeds planted.

4. To find the number of seeds planted per flower bed that grew into flowers, we divide the seeds that grew by the seeds planted in each bed: 60 / 15 = 4.

5. Since the capacity of each bed increased to 4 seeds growing into flowers per 15 seeds planted, we can now find the total number of seeds that grew into flowers: 55 seeds planted * 4 seeds that grew per 15 seeds planted = 55 * 4 / 3 = 220 / 3 = 73.33 (round down to 73 because you can't have a fraction of a flower).

6. To find the number of flower beds, we divide the total number of seeds that grew into flowers by the number of seeds that grew per bed: 73 / 4 = 18.25 (round down to 18 because you can't have a fraction of a bed).

7. Finally, we multiply the number of flower beds by the number of seeds that grew into flowers per bed to find the total number of flowers: 18 * 4 = 72.

1. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches. 
   So, the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + 3 = 7.

2. We are given that there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets. 
   Since each basket has 7 peaches, the number of baskets can be found by dividing the total number of peaches by the number of peaches per basket.

3. However, we cannot simply divide 7 by 7, because the total number of peaches (7) is a multiple of the number of peaches per basket (7). This means that there must be at least one basket.

4. To find the number of baskets, we can divide the total number of peaches (7) by the number of peaches per basket (7), but we must also consider the fact that the result is a whole number.

5. Since 7 divided by 7 equals 1, there must be at least one basket.

However, if there is only one basket, then there are 7 peaches in that basket, but we are told that each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches. 

6. If each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, then each basket has a total of 7 peaches. But we are given that there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets. This means that there can be only one basket, and this basket must have 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches.

3. After the loss, Marco's strawberries weighed 12 pounds.
4. Since the total weight of strawberries initially was 36 pounds, and Marco's dad lost 8 pounds, the total weight of strawberries after the loss is 36 - 8 = 28 pounds.
5. Since Marco's strawberries now weigh 12 pounds, his dad's strawberries must weigh the remaining weight after Marco's strawberries are subtracted from the total weight after the loss.
6. Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 28 - 12 = 16 pounds.

949,There were some roses in the vase. Jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses were there in the vase at the beginning?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the initial number of roses in the vase as 'x'.
2. Jessica cut 16 more roses from her garden and added them to the vase. This means the total number of roses in the vase now is 'x + 16'.
3. We are given that there are now 23 roses in the vase. This can be represented as 'x + 16 = 23'.
4. To find the initial number of roses, we need to solve the equation 'x + 16 = 23'.
5. Subtract 16 from both sides of the equation: x = 23 - 16
6. x = 7

So, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning. {7}"

203,"Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially, how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?","To find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind, we need to first determine how many bird families stayed behind.

We know that initially, there were 45 bird families living near the mountain. We also know that 86 bird families flew away for the winter.

To find out how many bird families stayed behind, we can subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the initial number of bird families:

45 (initial bird families) - 86 (bird families that flew away) = -41

However, this is not possible as you can't have a negative number of bird families. This means that our initial calculation is incorrect. We need to re-examine the problem.

Therefore, Tiffany had {20} bags of cans altogether."
286,Paul got a box of 589 crayons for his birthday. During the school year he gave 571 crayons to his friends while he lost 161 crayons. How many more crayons did he give to his friends than those he lost?,"To find out how many more crayons Paul gave to his friends than those he lost, we need to compare the number of crayons he gave to his friends and the number of crayons he lost.

First, let's find out how many crayons Paul has left after giving some to his friends and losing some.

Initial number of crayons = 589
Number of crayons given to friends = 571
Number of crayons lost = 161

Number of crayons left = 589 - (571 + 161)
= 589 - 732
= -143

However, since we cannot have a negative number of crayons, this means that Paul gave away more crayons than he had initially. This is not possible in reality, but we can still calculate the difference.

Number of crayons given to friends - Number of crayons lost = 571 - 161
= 410

So, Paul gave 410 more crayons to his friends than those he lost.

186,"Matthew had 15 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends and still had 10 crackers left, how many crackers did each friend eat?","To find out how many crackers each friend ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Matthew started with 15 crackers.
2. He gave an equal number of crackers to his 5 friends.
3. After giving crackers to his friends, Matthew had 10 crackers left.

Let's assume the number of crackers Matthew gave to each friend is x. Since he gave an equal number to his 5 friends, the total number of crackers he gave away is 5x.

We know that the total number of crackers Matthew started with (15) minus the number of crackers he had left (10) is equal to the number of crackers he gave away (5x). We can write this as an equation:

15 - 10 = 5x
5 = 5x

To find x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 5 / 5

   Cost per book = $16 / 92
   Cost per book = $0.1739 (approximately)

2. Since the cost of each book is the same, we can multiply the cost per book by the number of books to find the total amount spent: 
   Total amount spent = Cost per book * Number of books
   Total amount spent = $0.1739 * 92
   Total amount spent ≈ $16

3. We are given that Edward spent $16 and had $6 left. So, the total amount he had initially is the sum of the amount he spent and the amount he has left:
   Total initial amount = Total amount spent + Amount left
   Total initial amount = $16 + $6
   Total initial amount = $22

Therefore, {Edward had $22 before he spent his money}."
888,"They decided to hold the party in their backyard. If they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, how many more chairs than tables do they have?","To find the number of chairs and tables, we need to multiply the number of sets by the number of chairs per set and the number of tables per set.

Number of tables: 5 sets * 1 table/set = 5 tables
Number of chairs: 5 sets * 10 chairs/set = 50 chairs

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of chairs and tables. 
Difference = Number of chairs - Number of tables
Difference = 50 - 5
Difference = 45

So, they have {45} more chairs than tables."
324,Edward spent $ 6 to buy books and $ 16 to buy pens. Now he has $ 19. How much did Edward have before he spent his money?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens. 
   So, the total amount he spent is $6 + $16 = $22.

2. After spending $22, Edward has $19 left.
   This means he had $19 + $22 = $41 before spending his money.

So, the amount Edward had before he spent his money is {41}."
193,Last week Fred had 19 dollars and Jason had 16 dollars. They washed cars over the weekend and now Fred has 40 dollars and Jason has 69 dollars. How much money did Fred earn over the weekend?,"To find out how much money Fred earned over the weekend, we need to subtract the amount of money he had last week from the amount of money he has now.

Last week, Fred had 19 dollars.
Now, Fred has 40 dollars.

So, the amount of money Fred earned over the weekend is: 
40 (now) - 19 (last week) = 21 dollars.

Therefore, {21}."
603,"Bobby had 22 pieces of candy. He ate some pieces of candy. Then he ate 5 more. If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, how many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Bobby initially had 22 pieces of candy.
2. He ate some pieces of candy, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call this number 'x'.
3. After eating 'x' pieces, he had some candy left.
4. Then, he ate 5 more pieces.
5. After eating 5 more pieces, he had 8 pieces of candy left.

To find out how many pieces of candy he had eaten at the start, we need to find out how many pieces he had left before eating the 5 additional pieces.

Let's call the number of pieces he had left before eating the 5 additional pieces 'y'. We know that 'y + 5 = 8', because after eating 5 more pieces, he had 8 pieces left.

So, 'y = 8 - 5 = 3'.

Now, we know that 'y' is the number of pieces he had left after eating 'x' pieces. We also know that 'y + x = 22', because he initially had 22 pieces.

So, '3 + x = 22'.

To find 'x', we need to subtract 3 from both sides: 'x = 22 - 3 = 19'.

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 19 pieces of candy at the start. 

{19}"
504,Bobby had 20 pieces of candy. He ate 34 pieces of candy. Then he ate 18 more. How many pieces of candy did Bobby eat?,"To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby ate, we need to add the number of pieces he ate in each step.

Step 1: Bobby ate 34 pieces of candy.
Step 2: Then, he ate 18 more pieces of candy.

To find the total number of pieces Bobby ate, we add 34 and 18.

34 + 18 = 52

So, Bobby ate {52} pieces of candy."
