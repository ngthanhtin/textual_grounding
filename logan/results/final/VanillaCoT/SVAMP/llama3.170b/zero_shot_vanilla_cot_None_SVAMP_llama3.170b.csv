911,"Baker made 157 cakes and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries, how many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?","To find out how many more cakes than pastries the baker sold, we need to first find out how many cakes and pastries he sold, then subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes.

Baker made 157 cakes, but he sold 158 cakes. Since he can't sell more than he made, this information is likely incorrect. However, we will proceed with the given information.

Number of cakes sold: 158
Number of pastries sold: 147

Now, let's subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes to find the difference.

Difference = Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold
= 158 - 147

How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?,"To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park, we need to first find out how many bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park, then subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps.

Step 1: Find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny already had in his collection before going to the park. We can do this by subtracting the number of bottle caps and wrappers he has now from the number he found at the park.

Bottle caps found at the park = 50
Bottle caps he has now = 21
Bottle caps he already had = Bottle caps found at the park - Bottle caps he has now
Bottle caps he already had = 50 - 21
Bottle caps he already had = 29

497,Dan has $ 4. He bought 99 candy bar for $ 3 each one costing the same amount of money. How much money is left?,"To find out how much money is left, we need to calculate the total cost of the candy bars and subtract that from the initial amount of money Dan had.

1. Dan bought 99 candy bars, each costing $3.
2. Total cost of candy bars = 99 * 3 = $297.
3. Dan initially had $4.
4. Since Dan can't buy 99 candy bars with $4, the initial statement is incorrect. He can't afford to buy 99 candy bars.

However, if we still want to calculate the remaining money assuming he somehow managed to buy them, we would subtract the total cost from the initial amount, but since the total cost is more than the initial amount, we would get a negative number.

Remaining money = $4 - $297 = -$293.

But in reality, this situation is not possible."
414,Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 11 bottle caps and 28 wrappers at the park. Now he has 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers in his collection.

First, let's find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny already had before he found the ones at the park. 

We know that after finding the ones at the park, he had 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers. We also know that he found 11 bottle caps and 28 wrappers at the park.

So, to find out how many he already had, we subtract the ones he found at the park from the total he has now:

Bottle caps he already had: 68 - 11 = 57
Wrappers he already had: 51 - 28 = 23

Now, we know that he found 11 bottle caps and 28 wrappers at the park. To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps he found, we subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers:

28 (wrappers found) - 11 (bottle caps found) = 17

So, Danny found 17 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.

1. Danny threw away 60 old bottle caps at the park.
2. He found 58 new bottle caps.
3. Now he has 67 bottle caps in his collection.

Let's denote the number of bottle caps Danny had at first as 'x'.

When he threw away 60 old bottle caps, he had x - 60 bottle caps left.

Then, he found 58 new bottle caps. So, the total number of bottle caps he had now is (x - 60) + 58.

We are given that the total number of bottle caps he has now is 67.

So, we can set up the equation: (x - 60) + 58 = 67

63,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, how many cups of flour did she put in?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar.
2. Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. This means the amount of flour she needs is 2 more than the amount of sugar she needs.
3. Let's say the amount of sugar she needs is x cups. Then, the amount of flour she needs is x + 2 cups.
4. We know that the total amount of flour needed is 11 cups. Since Mary already put in some cups of flour, the amount of flour she needs is the difference between the total amount of flour needed and the amount she already put in.
5. Let's say the amount of flour she already put in is y cups. Then, the amount of flour she needs is 11 - y cups.
6. From steps 3 and 5, we can set up the equation: x + 2 = 11 - y
7. We also know that the amount of sugar she needs is 7 - x cups (since the total amount of sugar needed is 7 cups).
8. Since Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up the equation: 11 - y = 7 - x + 2
9. Simplifying the equation, we get: 11 - y = 9 - x
10. Rearranging the equation, we get: y = x + 2
11. We also know that x + 2 = 11 - y. Substituting y = x + 2 into this equation, we get: x + 2 = 11 - (x + 2)
12. Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 2 = 9 - x
13. Solving for x, we get: 2x = 7
14. x = 7/2 = 3.5
15. Since Mary already put in y cups of flour, and y = x + 2, we get: y = 3.5 + 2 = 5.5

However, we can't have a fraction of a cup of flour. This means our initial assumption about the amount of sugar Mary needs is incorrect.

Let's re-examine the problem. Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. This means the amount of flour she needs is 2 more than the amount of sugar she needs.

Let's say the amount of sugar she needs is x cups. Then, the amount of flour she needs is x + 2 cups.

We know that the total amount of flour needed is 11 cups. Since Mary already put in some cups of flour, the amount of flour she needs is the difference between the total amount of flour needed and the amount she already put in.

Let's say the amount of flour she already put in is y cups. Then, the amount of flour she needs is 11 - y cups.

We also know that the total amount of sugar needed is 7 cups. Since Mary already put in some cups of sugar, the amount of sugar she needs is the difference between the total amount of sugar needed and the amount she already put in.

Let's say the amount of sugar she already put in is z cups. Then, the amount of sugar she needs is 7 - z cups.

Since Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up the equation: 11 - y = 7 - z + 2

We also know that the amount of sugar she needs is equal to the amount of sugar she still needs to put in, which is 7 - z.

So, x = 7 - z

We can substitute x into the equation 11 - y = 7 - z + 2:

11 - y = 7 - z + 2

We can simplify the equation:

11 - y = 9 - z

We can rearrange the equation:

y = z + 2

We know that the total amount of flour needed is 11 cups, and the total amount of sugar needed is 7 cups.

We can set up the equation:

y + (11 - y) = z + (7 - z) + 2

We can simplify the equation:

11 = 9 + 2

This equation is true.

Now, let's try to find the value of y.

We know that y = z + 2.

We also know that the total amount of flour needed is 11 cups, and the total amount of sugar needed is 7 cups.

Let's say the amount of sugar Mary already put in is 4 cups.

Then, the amount of sugar she needs is 7 - 4 = 3 cups.

Since Mary still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar, the amount of flour she needs is 3 + 2 = 5 cups.

We know that the total amount of flour needed is 11 cups.

So, the amount of flour Mary already put in is 11 - 5 = 6 cups.

Therefore, the value of y is 6.

195,Rachel has 4 apple trees. She picked 7 apples from each of her trees. Now the trees have a total 29 apples still on them. How many apples did Rachel pick in all?,"To find out how many apples Rachel picked, we need to first determine the total number of apples on the trees initially.

Rachel has 4 apple trees. She picked 7 apples from each tree, but we don't know how many apples were on each tree initially. Let's call the initial number of apples on each tree 'x'. 

Since there are 4 trees, the total number of apples initially is 4x.

After picking 7 apples from each tree, the number of apples left on each tree is x - 7. Since there are 4 trees, the total number of apples left is 4(x - 7).

We are given that the trees have a total of 29 apples still on them. So, we can set up the equation:

4(x - 7) = 29

Expanding the equation, we get:

4x - 28 = 29

Adding 28 to both sides, we get:

4x = 57

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

x = 14.25

Since the number of apples can't be a fraction, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, we are trying to find the number of apples picked, so we'll use the value of x as 14.25 for now.

The total number of apples initially is 4x = 4(14.25) = 57.

The total number of apples picked is the difference between the initial number of apples and the number of apples left. The number of apples left is 29, so the total number of apples picked is:

57 - 29 = 28

However, we can also calculate the total number of apples picked by multiplying the number of apples picked from each tree (7) by the number of trees (4):

7 * 4 = 28

So, the total number of apples picked is indeed 28.

244,Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost some of his marbles at the playground. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than doug. How many marbles did Ed lose?,"To find out how many marbles Ed lost, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. We can represent this as:
   Ed's marbles = Doug's marbles + 19

2. After Ed lost some marbles, he had 8 more marbles than Doug. We can represent this as:
   Ed's marbles (after losing) = Doug's marbles + 8

3. Since the number of marbles Doug has doesn't change, we can set up an equation using the information from steps 1 and 2. Let's say the number of marbles Ed lost is x. Then:
   Ed's marbles (after losing) = Ed's marbles (initially) - x

4. We can substitute the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into the equation from step 3:
   Doug's marbles + 8 = (Doug's marbles + 19) - x

5. Now, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms:
   Doug's marbles + 8 = Doug's marbles + 19 - x
   8 = 19 - x

6. To solve for x, we can subtract 19 from both sides of the equation:
   -11 = -x
   x = 11

So, Ed lost 11 marbles.

How much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?,"To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to first find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed.

We know that together, their strawberries weighed 4 pounds, but that is not correct because Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds. So the total weight of their strawberries must be 19 pounds (Marco's strawberries) + x pounds (his dad's strawberries).

We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, and the total weight of their strawberries is not 4 pounds but 19 + x. However, we are given a wrong total weight of 4 pounds for both of them. We can assume the correct total weight of their strawberries is actually 19 + x = 23 pounds, and the total weight of 4 pounds was for just Marco's dad.

However, that is still not correct. Let's try another approach.

If Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, and the total weight of their strawberries was 4 pounds, that would mean his dad's strawberries weighed 4 - 19 = -15 pounds. That doesn't make sense because the weight can't be negative.

However, if the total weight of their strawberries was actually 4 pounds more than Marco's strawberries, then the total weight of their strawberries would be 19 + 4 = 23 pounds.

So, his dad's strawberries weighed 23 - 19 = 4 pounds.

Now we can find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's.

Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds, and his dad's strawberries weighed 4 pounds.

The difference between the two is 19 - 4 = 15 pounds.

So, Marco's strawberries weighed 15 pounds more than his dad's.

Since the given information seems incorrect, let's assume the problem meant to say ""read 16 of the books"" and ""watched 19 of the movies"" or that the numbers were swapped.

However, if we follow the original statement, it is not possible to read 19 movies or watch 16 books.

If we correct the problem statement to something like ""read 16 of the books"" and ""watched 19 of the movies"" is still not possible since there are only 5 movies and 8 books.

Correcting the problem statement to ""read 5 of the movies"" and ""watched 8 of the books"" would be more accurate, but we would still need to know how many movies were watched and how many books were read to solve the problem.

However, if we correct the problem statement to something like ""read 16 of the books"" and ""watched 5 of the movies"", we can solve the problem.

- Books read: 16 (However, this is not possible since there are only 8 books. Let's assume the correct number is 8, and the remaining 8 are movies watched, which is also incorrect. So let's assume the correct number is 8 for books read and 5 for movies watched.)

461,Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour 14 cups of sugar and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?,"To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she already added (2 cups) from the total amount of flour required (12 cups). 

12 cups (total flour required) - 2 cups (flour already added) = 10 cups

Now, we need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add than cups of salt. The recipe requires 7 cups of salt, and she hasn't added any salt yet. 

So, to find the difference, we subtract the amount of salt required from the amount of flour she still needs to add:

10 cups (flour needed) - 7 cups (salt required) = 3 cups

676,"The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. How far did the frog jump?","To find out how far the frog jumped, let's start with what we know about the grasshopper's jump and its relation to the frog's jump.

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog.

So, if the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, we subtract 4 inches from the grasshopper's jump to find the frog's jump.

Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 4 inches
Frog's jump = 19 inches - 4 inches
Frog's jump = 15 inches

We don't need the information about the mouse to find the frog's jump, but we can verify it for consistency.

3. The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog.

If the frog jumped 15 inches, then the mouse jumped:

Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 44 inches
Mouse's jump = 15 inches - 44 inches
Mouse's jump = -29 inches

Since a negative value doesn't make sense in this context (you can't jump a negative distance), there seems to be an inconsistency in the given information. However, based on the direct comparison between the grasshopper and the frog, we can still conclude the frog's jump.

498,5 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus. Then there were 14 children altogether on the bus. How many more children got on the bus than those that got off?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus. To find the number of children left on the bus, we subtract 63 from 5. However, since 5 is less than 63, it means all the initial 5 children got off, and 58 more children got off from the ones that got on before this stop (as the bus had some children before these 5 got on). So, we still have to consider those that got off before these 5 and the 5 themselves. So the net number of children that got off is still 63.

   Now let's consider the children that got on. Let's denote the number of children that got on as 'x'. 
3. The total number of children on the bus after the stop is 14. We know that the number of children left on the bus is the difference between the number of children that got on and the number of children that got off (63), plus the initial 5 that were already on the bus is not needed here as we considered them as part of the 63. So, we have the equation:
   x - 63 = 14

   Now, let's solve for 'x':
   x = 14 + 63
   x = 77

   So, the number of children that got on the bus is 77.

4. To find the difference between the number of children that got on and the number of children that got off, we subtract the number of children that got off (63) from the number of children that got on (77):
   77 - 63 = 14

Therefore, {14} more children got on the bus than those that got off."

Since we are given the total number of visitors in 327 days, and we know the number of visitors on the current day, we can find the total number of visitors in 326 days by subtracting the current day's visitors from the total number of visitors in 327 days.

406 - 132 = 274 

However, this doesn't tell us the number of visitors on the previous day. We need more information to find the exact number of visitors on the previous day.

Since we cannot find the exact number of visitors on the previous day, we will assume that the number of visitors on the previous day is the average number of visitors per day.

To find the average number of visitors per day, we divide the total number of visitors in 327 days by 327.

406 / 327 โ 1.24

Since we cannot have a fraction of a person, this average is not helpful in finding the exact number of visitors on the previous day.

However, we can round the average to the nearest whole number.

1.24 โ 1

So, the number of visitors on the previous day is approximately 1.

However, since the number of crackers and cakes are not equal, we will find the number of items of each type that he gave to his friends.

Let's find the total number of items of each type that he gave to his friends. Since he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, the number of items of each type that he gave must be less than or equal to the smaller number, which is 13.

Now we know that Ed had 91 marbles and Doug had 82 marbles. To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract the marbles Doug had from the marbles Ed had.
Difference in marbles = Marbles Ed had - Marbles Doug had
Difference in marbles = 91 - 82
Difference in marbles = 9

So Ed had 9 more marbles than Doug.

810,"Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, how many more cups of flour does she need to add?","To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step.

1. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar.
2. Mary still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. This means if she needs x cups of sugar, she needs x + 8 cups of flour.
3. Since the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar, Mary needs 13 cups of sugar in total.
4. According to step 2, Mary needs 13 + 8 = 21 cups of flour in total.
5. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour initially, but Mary needs 21 cups of flour in total. Since she already put in some cups of flour, let's call the cups of flour she already put in 'y'. We know that y + (the cups of flour she still needs) = 21.
6. We also know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour initially. This means y + (the cups of flour she still needs) = 6 + (the cups of flour she still needs) = 21.
7. Now, let's find out how many cups of flour she still needs. We know that y + (the cups of flour she still needs) = 6 + (the cups of flour she still needs) = 21. We can rewrite this as (the cups of flour she still needs) = 21 - 6 = 15.

However, we know that the initial recipe calls for 6 cups of flour. Mary already put in some cups of flour (y). To find out how many cups of flour she still needs, we need to know how many cups of flour she already put in (y). 

Since we are given that Mary needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar and she needs 13 cups of sugar, we can say that she needs 13 + 8 = 21 cups of flour in total. We also know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour initially.

Let's assume that Mary already put in 'y' cups of flour. We know that y + (the cups of flour she still needs) = 21. We also know that the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour initially.

4. We know that after losing marbles, Ed had 17 marbles. So, we can set up the equation: (x + 12) - 20 = 17.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get: x - 8 = 17.
6. Adding 8 to both sides, we get: x = 25.

So, Doug had 25 marbles initially. The problem doesn't mention Doug losing any marbles, so he still has 25 marbles.

There are 17 movies in total, but you watched 63. Since you can't watch more movies than exist, this information is incorrect. However, I will proceed with the assumption that you meant to say you watched 7 movies (since 17 - 7 = 10, and 7 is less than 17).

There are 11 books in total, and you read 13. Again, this information is incorrect, as you can't read more books than exist. I will proceed with the assumption that you meant to say you read 7 books (since 11 - 7 = 4, and 7 is less than 11).

Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of movies and books left.

Movies left: 17 - 7 = 10
Books left: 11 - 7 = 4

The difference between the number of movies and books left is: 10 - 4 = 6

However, since the initial information was incorrect, let's recalculate the difference using the actual numbers of movies and books.

350,"After a typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died. If she had grown 3 trees initially, how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?","To find the answer, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Haley had 3 trees in her backyard.
2. After the typhoon, 13 trees died.
3. To find the number of trees that survived, we subtract the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees. However, since the number of trees that died is more than the initial number of trees, we can infer that more trees were planted or grew after the initial 3 trees.
4. Let's assume the total number of trees after more were planted or grew is x. We know that 13 trees died, so the number of trees that survived is x - 13.
5. We are also given that initially, there were 3 trees. This means that the number of trees that survived the typhoon is at least 3 (assuming no new trees were planted after the typhoon, but more trees grew). However, we know that the number of trees that died is more than the initial number of trees. This implies that more trees were planted or grew after the initial 3 trees.
6. Since we don't know the exact number of trees that were planted or grew after the initial 3 trees, we can't determine the exact number of trees that survived. However, we can say that the number of trees that survived is at least 3 (x - 13 โฅ 3).
7. To find the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived, we subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died: 13 - (x - 13). Since we don't know the exact value of x, we can't determine the exact difference.
8. However, we can say that the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived is at least 7 (13 - (3) = 10, but since x - 13 โฅ 3, the difference is at least 7 if x - 13 = 3 and x = 16, 13 - (16 - 13) = 13 - 3 = 10, but if x - 13 = 6, 13 - (6) = 7).

However, we can calculate the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived if we consider the minimum number of trees that survived, which is 3 (x - 13 โฅ 3), and the maximum number of trees that died, which is 13.

Let's assume x - 13 = 3, then x = 16, and the number of trees that survived is 3 (16 - 13 = 3). The difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived is 13 - 3 = 10.

However, if we consider the problem statement, it says 'If she had grown 3 trees initially'. This implies that the 13 trees that died include the initial 3 trees. In that case, the number of trees that survived is 0 (since the initial 3 trees died), and the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived is 13 - 0 = 13.

However, the problem statement also says 'how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived'. This implies that the 13 trees that died are in addition to the initial 3 trees. In that case, the number of trees that survived is 3 (since the initial 3 trees survived), and the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived is 13 - 3 = 10.

But since the problem statement says 'If she had grown 3 trees initially', and '13 trees in Haley's backyard died', this implies that the 13 trees that died are in addition to the initial 3 trees, and the initial 3 trees survived.

So, the number of trees that survived is 3, and the difference between the number of trees that died and those that survived is 13 - 3 = {10}."

582,"Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. If she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework, how many pages did she have to complete in all?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework.
2. She had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework. This means if she had to complete x pages of reading homework, then x + 3 = 8 (since math homework is 3 more than reading homework).
3. To find the number of pages of reading homework, we need to solve the equation: x + 3 = 8. Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us x = 5.
4. So, Rachel had to complete 5 pages of reading homework and 8 pages of math homework.
5. To find the total number of pages, we add the pages of reading and math homework: 5 + 8 = 13.

How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?,"To find the cost difference between a t-shirt and a jersey, we first need to know the prices of each item. We can calculate the total revenue from each item type, then divide by the number of items sold to find the price per item.

The total revenue from jerseys is $210 * 23 = $4830.
The total revenue from t-shirts is $240 * 177 = $42480.

Now, we can divide the total revenue by the number of items sold to find the price per item:
Price per jersey = $4830 / 23 = $210
Price per t-shirt = $42480 / 177 = $240

The difference in price between a t-shirt and a jersey is $240 - $210 = $30.

1. Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus, but some more got on the bus. Let's call the number of children who got on the bus 'x'.
3. After 68 children got off the bus, there were 36 - 68 = -32 children left on the bus. However, we know that some children got on the bus, so we need to add 'x' to -32 to get the final number of children on the bus.
4. We are told that there were 12 children altogether on the bus after some got on. This means that -32 + x = 12.
5. To find 'x', we need to isolate 'x' in the equation. We can do this by adding 32 to both sides of the equation: -32 + 32 + x = 12 + 32.
6. This simplifies to x = 44.

Now we know that 68 children got off the bus and 44 children got on the bus. To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to subtract the number of children who got on the bus from the number of children who got off the bus: 68 - 44 = 24.

652,"The school is planning a field trip. The school has 17 classrooms. There are 46 school buses and a total of 92 students in the school. If all buses are full, how many seats are in each bus?","To find out how many seats are in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of buses. 

Total number of students = 92
Number of buses = 46

Now, let's divide the total number of students by the number of buses:
92 students / 46 buses = 2 students per bus

However, the problem states that all buses are full. This implies that the buses can accommodate more than 2 students. Since the total number of students is 92 and there are 46 buses, we can assume that the buses can accommodate more than 2 students.

Let's re-examine the problem. The number of classrooms is given as 17, but this information is not necessary to solve the problem.

If we assume that each bus is full, we can divide the total number of students by the number of buses to find the minimum number of seats in each bus. However, the result we got earlier (2 students per bus) is not realistic.

Let's try to find a more realistic answer. If we assume that the buses are full, we can try to find the maximum number of seats in each bus. However, we don't have enough information to find the exact number of seats in each bus.

But if we consider the given data, 92 students and 46 buses, a more realistic answer would be that each bus has at least 2 seats. But that is not the case, the buses have more seats than that.

Considering the usual capacity of a school bus, it can accommodate around 50-60 students. But in this case, we have 92 students and 46 buses.

Let's try to find a number that is close to the usual capacity of a school bus and also divides 92.

A possible answer is that each bus has 2 seats, but that is not realistic. Another possible answer is that each bus has more than 2 seats.

If we divide 92 by 2, we get 46. If we divide 92 by 4, we get 23. If we divide 92 by a number close to the usual capacity of a school bus, we get a number close to 2.

Let's try to divide 92 by a number that is close to the usual capacity of a school bus.

92 / 2 = 46
92 / 4 = 23
92 / 8 = 11.5
92 / 10 = 9.2
92 / 12 = 7.67
92 / 20 = 4.6
92 / 40 = 2.3

905,"Jesse's room is 2 feet long and 12 feet wide. If each tile is of size 4 square feet, how many tiles does she need to cover the whole floor?","To find the number of tiles Jesse needs, we need to calculate the total area of her room and then divide it by the area of each tile.

Step 1: Calculate the area of Jesse's room.
The area of a room is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.
Length (L) = 12 feet
Width (W) = 2 feet
Area of room = L * W = 12 * 2 = 24 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of each tile.
The area of each tile is given as 4 square feet (since the tile size is not explicitly mentioned, we assume it's a square tile with equal length and width, and the area is 4 square feet).

Step 3: Calculate the number of tiles needed.
Number of tiles = Total area of room / Area of each tile
= 24 square feet / 4 square feet
= 6

Let's denote the number of boys as B. We are given that there are 281 more girls than boys. So, the number of girls (868) is equal to the number of boys (B) plus 281.

868 = B + 281

To find the number of boys (B), we subtract 281 from both sides of the equation:

B = 868 - 281
B = 587

Now that we have the number of boys (587) and the number of girls (868), we can find the total number of pupils in the school by adding the two:

Total pupils = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total pupils = 587 + 868
Total pupils = 1455

They planted 55 seeds in total, and they put 15 seeds in each flower bed. To find out how many flower beds they have, we divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds in each flower bed:

55 seeds / 15 seeds per flower bed = 3.67 flower beds

Since we can't have a fraction of a flower bed, we round down to 3 flower beds (as we can't plant a fraction of a seed) and 10 seeds left over (55 - 45 = 10 seeds).

However, the question states that 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. But we only planted 15 seeds per flower bed, so we can't have 60 seeds growing into flowers per flower bed with the initial information given.

1. Total nails used: 11
2. Additional nails used: 8
3. Total nails used for planks: 11 - 8 = 3
4. Nails needed per plank: 3

Since 3 nails are used for the planks and each plank needs 3 nails, we can divide the total nails used for planks by the nails needed per plank:

However, this calculation doesn't seem right because we initially subtracted 8 nails that were used additionally. Let's recalculate:

Total nails used: 11 + 8 (additional nails) = 19
Nails used for planks: 19 - 8 (additional nails) = 11
Nails needed per plank: 3

Now, let's divide the total nails used for planks by the nails needed per plank:

1. Paul initially had 2 books.
2. After selling some books, he bought 150 new ones.
3. He now has a total of 58 books.

Let's assume the number of books Paul sold is 'x'. 

So, after selling 'x' books, he had (2 - x) books left.

Then, he bought 150 new books. Now, he has (2 - x + 150) books.

We know that he now has 58 books. So, we can set up the equation:

2 - x + 150 = 58

Combine like terms:
152 - x = 58

Subtract 152 from both sides:
-x = -94

Multiply both sides by -1:
x = 94

However, Paul only had 2 books initially, so he couldn't have sold 94 books. This means he sold (94 - 2) = 92 books more than he had. Since he only had 2 books, he must have sold 2 books and then bought 150 more to have 152, then he must have gotten rid of 94 books to have 58. Since he only sold 2 books, he must have gotten rid of 92 books some other way.

If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially, how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?","To find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bird families that stayed behind. 
   Initially, there were 45 bird families. 
   86 bird families flew away for the winter. 
   So, the number of bird families that stayed behind is 45 - 86. 
   However, this will result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense. 
   This means that the initial number of bird families must be more than 86. 
   Let's assume the problem meant that 86 bird families flew away for the winter from the initial number of bird families.

2. Since we don't know the initial number of bird families, let's use the information given: 
   86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain, and there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. 
   This means that the initial number of bird families is 86 (flew away) + 45 (stayed behind) = 131.

3. Calculate the number of bird families that stayed behind. 
   We already know this number, which is 45.

4. Calculate the difference between the number of bird families that flew away and those that stayed behind. 
   The number of bird families that flew away is 86.

469,Zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 9 push-ups less than David. How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?,"To find the answer, let's break it down step by step.

1. Zachary did 15 push-ups.
2. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary. So, David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups.
3. John did 9 push-ups less than David. So, John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups.
4. Now, let's compare Zachary's and John's push-ups. Zachary did 15 push-ups, and John did 45 push-ups. To find out how many more push-ups John did than Zachary, we subtract: 45 - 15 = 30.

However, the question asks how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. Since John did more push-ups than Zachary, we can say that Zachary did fewer push-ups than John. The correct answer would be the difference in the opposite direction.

So, John did 30 more push-ups than Zachary. But since the question is asking for the opposite, we say that Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John.

550,Robin has some packages of gum. There are 7 pieces in each package. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum. In all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41. How many packages does Robin have?,"To find the number of packages Robin has, we need to subtract the extra pieces of gum from the total number of pieces and then divide by the number of pieces in each package.

Total number of pieces = 41
Extra pieces = 6
Number of pieces in each package = 7

First, subtract the extra pieces from the total number of pieces:
41 - 6 = 35

Now, divide the result by the number of pieces in each package:
35 รท 7 = 5

So, Robin has 5 packages of gum.

895,Edward spent $ 6 to buy 2 books each book costing him the same amount of money. Now he has $ 12. How much did each book cost?,"To find out how much each book cost, we need to first determine how much money Edward spent in total on the books and how much money he had before buying the books.

We know Edward spent $6 on 2 books. We also know that he now has $12.

Since he spent $6 on the books, he must have had $12 + $6 = $18 before buying the books.

However, we already know he spent $6 on the books, so we don't need to find the total amount he had before buying the books. We just need to divide the $6 by the 2 books.
