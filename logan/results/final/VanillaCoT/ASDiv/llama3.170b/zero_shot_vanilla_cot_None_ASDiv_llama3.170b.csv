1180,"The teacher is handing out note cards to her students. She gave 3 note cards to the first student, 12 note cards to the second student, 48 note cards to the third student, and 192 note cards to the fourth student. If this pattern continues, how many note cards will the teacher give to the fifth student?","To find the pattern, let's examine the number of note cards given to each student:

1. First student: 3
2. Second student: 12 = 3 * 4
3. Third student: 48 = 12 * 4

1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's assume the current age of the father is F and the current age of the son is S.

Five years ago, the father's age was F - 5, and the son's age was S - 5. According to the problem, the father was thrice as old as the son five years ago, so we can set up the equation:

F - 5 = 3(S - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

F - 5 = 3S - 15
F = 3S - 10

Now, let's consider the situation ten years later. The father's age will be F + 10, and the son's age will be S + 10. According to the problem, the father will be twice as old as the son ten years later, so we can set up the equation:

F + 10 = 2(S + 10)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

F + 10 = 2S + 20
F = 2S + 10

Now we have two equations:

F = 3S - 10 ... (1)
F = 2S + 10 ... (2)

Equating the two equations, we get:

3S - 10 = 2S + 10
S = 20

Now that we know the son's current age, we can find the father's current age by substituting S into one of the equations:

F = 3S - 10
F = 3(20) - 10
F = 60 - 10
F = 50

So, the father's current age is 50, and the son's current age is 20.

{The father is 50 years old, and the son is 20 years old.}"

1502,A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?,"To find the area of the border, we first need to find the area of the entire floor and the area of the carpet, then subtract the area of the carpet from the area of the floor.

1. The area of the entire floor is the length times the width: 
   Area = length * width
   Area = 12 * 10
   Area = 120 square feet

2. The carpet has a 2-foot border around it, so we subtract 2 feet from the length and width of the floor to find the dimensions of the carpet:
   Carpet length = 12 - 2 - 2 = 8 feet
   Carpet width = 10 - 2 - 2 = 6 feet

3. The area of the carpet is the length times the width:
   Carpet area = carpet length * carpet width
   Carpet area = 8 * 6
   Carpet area = 48 square feet

4. The area of the border is the area of the floor minus the area of the carpet:

For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the fixed charge be x dollars and the charge per km be y dollars.

For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75, so we can set up the equation:
x + 10y = 75 ... (Equation 1)

For a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110, so we can set up the equation:
x + 15y = 110 ... (Equation 2)

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get:
5y = 35
y = 7

Now, substitute the value of y into Equation 1:
x + 10(7) = 75
x + 70 = 75
x = 5

So, the fixed charge is $5 and the charge per km is $7.

Now, we can find the charge for a journey of 25 km:
Charge = Fixed charge + (Charge per km * Distance)
= 5 + (7 * 25)
= 5 + 175
= 180

Therefore, a person will have to pay {180} dollars for traveling a distance of 25 km."

(A + C) - (C + S) = 95 - 87
A - S = 8

This means Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara.

Combine like terms:
3M = 15000

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for M:
M = 15000 / 3

1457,The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than the first. Find the three angles.,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Let the first angle be x.

The second angle is double the first, so the second angle is 2x.

The third angle is 40 less than the first, so the third angle is x - 40.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + (x - 40) = 180

Combine like terms:

4x - 40 = 180

Add 40 to both sides:

4x = 220

Divide by 4:

x = 55

Now that we know the first angle, we can find the other two angles:

Second angle: 2x = 2(55) = 110

Third angle: x - 40 = 55 - 40 = 15

So, the three angles are 55, 110, and 15.

1. Virginia had 13 Sweettarts initially.
2. She gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends. This means the total number of Sweettarts she gave away must be divisible by 4.
3. Since 13 is not divisible by 4, we can subtract the closest multiple of 4 from 13, which is 12. This leaves 1 Sweettart for Virginia to eat.
4. Now, we divide the 12 Sweettarts she gave away by 4 friends: 12 / 4 = 3 Sweettarts per friend.

First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors:
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 28 = 2^2 * 7

Now, let's find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor:
- LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 7
- LCM = 4 * 3 * 7
- LCM = 84

Since Randy bought the same number of slices of each type, he must have bought a multiple of the LCM. The smallest multiple is the LCM itself, which is 84.

However, we need to find the number of slices of each type that Randy bought, not the total number of slices. To do this, we divide the LCM by the number of slices in each package:
- Cheddar cheese: 84 / 12 = 7
- Swiss cheese: 84 / 28 = 3

So, Randy bought 7 packages of cheddar cheese (7 * 12 = 84 slices) and 3 packages of Swiss cheese (3 * 28 = 84 slices).

Therefore, the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought is 84 slices of each type, but since we need the number of slices in one package, the answer is {84/12 = 7 and 84/28 = 3 but since we want slices, not packages, the answer is 84/12 = 7*12 = 84 slices of cheddar and 84/28 = 3*28 = 84 slices of swiss, but the number of slices in each type is the same so we can just give one number, the number of slices in one type so the answer is 84}."

Two stops later, 7 people got on 15 people got off the bus at the terminal station.

Initially, let's consider the last event: 7 people got on and 15 people got off at the terminal station. Since 15 people got off, that means there were 15 people on the bus before that stop. And since 7 people got on, the total number of people after that stop is 15 - 7 = 8 people.

Now, let's consider the event before that: 5 people got on and 2 people got off. Since 8 people were on the bus after the last stop, and 7 people got on at the last stop, that means there were 8 - 7 = 1 people on the bus before the last stop. However, we also need to account for the people who got off before the last stop. Since 2 people got off, we add them to the 1 person who was on the bus before the last stop. So, there were 1 + 2 = 3 people on the bus before the second stop. And since 5 people got on at the second stop, the total number of people after the second stop is 3 + 5 = 8 people.

Now, let's consider the first event: we don't know how many people got on or off, but we know that Jose got on the bus. Since 8 people were on the bus after the second stop, and 5 people got on at the second stop, that means there were 8 - 5 = 3 people on the bus before the second stop. And since 2 people got off at the first stop, we add them to the 3 people who were on the bus before the second stop. So, there were 3 + 2 = 5 people on the bus before the first stop. And since 5 people got on at the first stop, the total number of people after the first stop is 5 + 5 = 10 people.

If Zayed creates the greatest number of identical packages possible, how many pencils will be in each package?","To find the greatest number of identical packages possible, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 24. 

First, let's list the factors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.

Next, let's list the factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

Now, let's find the common factors of 72 and 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

The greatest common factor is 24, but since Zayed must use all the pencils, we should divide 72 by the common factors to see which one results in a whole number of packages.

72 / 24 = 3
72 / 12 = 6
72 / 8 = 9
72 / 6 = 12
72 / 4 = 18
72 / 3 = 24
72 / 2 = 36
72 / 1 = 72

Since 72 / 24 = 3, this means we can create 3 identical packages with 24 pencils each. But we can also create more packages with fewer pencils. 

However, the question asks for the greatest number of identical packages possible. So we should look for the greatest number of packages, which is 72 / 1 = 72, but that would mean 1 pencil per package, or 72 / 2 = 36, but that would mean 2 pencils per package, and so on.

Looking at the options, we can see that the greatest number of packages is 72 / 1 = 72, but that would mean 1 pencil per package, or 72 / 2 = 36, but that would mean 2 pencils per package, or 72 / 3 = 24, but that would mean 3 pencils per package, or 72 / 4 = 18, but that would mean 4 pencils per package, or 72 / 6 = 12, but that would mean 6 pencils per package, or 72 / 8 = 9, but that would mean 8 pencils per package, or 72 / 12 = 6, but that would mean 12 pencils per package, or 72 / 24 = 3, but that would mean 24 pencils per package.

Since the question asks for the greatest number of identical packages possible, and since 72 / 24 = 3, 72 / 12 = 6, and 72 / 8 = 9, we can see that the greatest number of packages with the most pencils per package would be 72 / 24 = 3, but that would mean 24 pencils per package.

However, looking at the other options, 72 / 12 = 6 would mean 12 pencils per package and 72 / 8 = 9 would mean 8 pencils per package, but 72 / 6 = 12 would mean 6 pencils per package, and 72 / 4 = 18 would mean 4 pencils per package, and 72 / 3 = 24 would mean 3 pencils per package, and 72 / 2 = 36 would mean 2 pencils per package, and 72 / 1 = 72 would mean 1 pencil per package.

516 รท 9 = 57.3333

Since we can't have a fraction of a penny, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. This means each stack can have 57 pennies.

However, this shows that Megan has more pennies than needed for 9 equal stacks. To find out how many more pennies she would need to have more equal stacks of 58 pennies, we calculate:

Let the present age of Lewis be x and the present age of Brown be 2x, since their ages are in the ratio 1:2.

Three years from now, Lewis's age will be x + 3 and Brown's age will be 2x + 3.

According to the problem, three years from now, their ages will be in the ratio 3:5. We can set up an equation based on this:

(x + 3) / (2x + 3) = 3/5

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

5(x + 3) = 3(2x + 3)

Expanding both sides, we get:

5x + 15 = 6x + 9

Subtracting 5x from both sides gives:

15 = x + 9

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives:

6 = x

Now that we know x, we can find the present ages of Lewis and Brown:

1460,"A bicycle and a bicycle helmet cost 240 dollars. How much did each cost, if the bicycle cost 5 times as much as the helmet?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total cost of the bicycle and the helmet is $240.
2. The bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet. Let's call the cost of the helmet 'x'. Then, the cost of the bicycle is 5x.
3. The total cost is the sum of the cost of the bicycle and the helmet, which is x + 5x = 6x.
4. We know that the total cost is $240, so we can set up the equation: 6x = 240.
5. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6: x = 240 / 6 = 40.
6. So, the helmet costs $40.
7. Since the bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet, the bicycle costs 5x = 5(40) = $200.

Therefore, the bicycle costs $200 and the helmet costs $40.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Ana is 5 years more than Jack. 
   This can be written as A = J + 5.

2. The sum of their ages is 29. 
   This can be written as A + J = 29.

Now, we can substitute the value of A from the first equation into the second equation:

t1 + t2 = 15  ... (Equation 1)

We also know the distances covered uphill and downhill. Let's denote the distance covered uphill as 'd1' and the distance covered downhill as 'd2'. We know the total distance covered is 650 km, so we can write the equation:

d1 + d2 = 650  ... (Equation 2)

We are given the speeds of the car uphill and downhill, which are 30 km/h and 50 km/h respectively. We can use these speeds to express the distances in terms of the times:

d1 = 30t1
d2 = 50t2

Substituting these expressions into Equation 2, we get:

30t1 + 50t2 = 650

Now we have two equations (Equation 1 and the equation above) and two variables (t1 and t2). We can solve for t1 and t2 by substituting Equation 1 into the equation above:

30t1 + 50(15 - t1) = 650

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

30t1 + 750 - 50t1 = 650

Combine like terms:

-20t1 = -100

Divide both sides by -20:

t1 = 5

Now that we have t1, we can find t2 by substituting t1 into Equation 1:

t2 = 15 - t1
= 15 - 5
= 10

So the car spent 5 hours going uphill and 10 hours going downhill.

{5 hours uphill, 10 hours downhill}"
2071,"At the movie theatre, they give out a free drink to every 75th customer and a free bag of popcorn to every 30th customer. On Monday 3,000 customers came to the theatre. How many people received both free items?","To find out how many people received both free items, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 30. 

First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors:
- 75 = 3 * 5^2
- 30 = 2 * 3 * 5

Now, we take the highest power of each prime factor:
- LCM = 2 * 3 * 5^2 = 150

This means that every 150th customer will receive both a free drink and a free bag of popcorn.

Now, let's find out how many customers received both free items on Monday:
- Number of customers who received both free items = Total customers / LCM
- Number of customers who received both free items = 3000 / 150
- Number of customers who received both free items = 20

2125,A fast food restaurant sold fifty-eight small hotdogs and twenty-one large hotdogs. How many hotdogs did they sell total?,"To find the total number of hotdogs sold, we need to add the number of small hotdogs and the number of large hotdogs.

Step 1: Identify the number of small hotdogs sold. 
The number of small hotdogs sold is 58.

Step 2: Identify the number of large hotdogs sold. 
The number of large hotdogs sold is 21.

Step 3: Add the number of small hotdogs and large hotdogs. 
Total hotdogs = small hotdogs + large hotdogs
Total hotdogs = 58 + 21
Total hotdogs = 79

Therefore, the fast food restaurant sold a total of 79 hotdogs.

1214,"There are 40 girls and 32 boys who want to participate in 6th grade intramurals. If each team must have the same number of girls and the same number of boys, what is the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals?","To find the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and the number of boys.

First, let's find the factors of 40 (the number of girls):
1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40

Next, let's find the factors of 32 (the number of boys):
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32

Now, let's find the common factors of 40 and 32:
1, 2, 4, 8

The greatest common factor (GCD) of 40 and 32 is 8.

Since each team must have the same number of girls and the same number of boys, the greatest number of teams that can participate in intramurals is the GCD of 40 and 32, which is 8.

However, we need to check if we can actually form 8 teams with 8 girls and 8 boys. 
For girls: 40 / 8 = 5 (not 8, so we can't have 8 teams with 8 girls)
For boys: 32 / 8 = 4 (not 8, so we can't have 8 teams with 8 boys)

For girls: 40 / 1 = 40 (we can have 1 girl in each team)
For boys: 32 / 1 = 32 (we can have 1 boy in each team)

Now let's try the next common factor, which is 8. However, we already tried 8. 
Now let's try the next common factor, which is 4. However, we already tried 4. 
Now let's try the next common factor, which is 2. However, we already tried 2.

1437,"A train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed. If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the speed of the train as 's' km/hr, and the scheduled time as 't' hours. Then, the distance covered by the train is 'd' km, which is equal to the product of the speed and the time.

d = s * t    ... (1)

If the train were 6 km/hr faster, the new speed would be (s + 6) km/hr, and the new time would be (t - 8) hours. The distance remains the same, so we can write:

d = (s + 6) * (t - 8)    ... (2)

If the train were 6 km/hr slower, the new speed would be (s - 6) km/hr, and the new time would be (t + 12) hours. Again, the distance remains the same, so we can write:

d = (s - 6) * (t + 12)    ... (3)

Now, we can equate equations (1) and (2), and also equations (1) and (3), since the distance 'd' is the same in all cases.

Equating (1) and (2):
s * t = (s + 6) * (t - 8)
Expanding and simplifying:
st = st - 8s + 6t - 48
8s - 6t = 48
4s - 3t = 24    ... (4)

Equating (1) and (3):
s * t = (s - 6) * (t + 12)
Expanding and simplifying:
st = st + 12s - 6t - 72
12s - 6t = 72
6s - 3t = 36    ... (5)

Now, we can multiply equation (4) by 3 and equation (5) by 2, and then subtract equation (5) from equation (4) to eliminate 't':

12s - 9t = 72    ... (6) (multiplied equation 4 by 3)
12s - 6t = 72    ... (multiplied equation 5 by 2)

Subtracting the two equations:
-3t = 0
t = 0 is not possible, as it would mean the train didn't move. This is an indication that we should revisit our equations.

However, we can multiply equation (4) by 2 and equation (5) by 1, and then subtract equation (5) from equation (4) to eliminate 't':

8s - 6t = 48    ... (7) (multiplied equation 4 by 2)
6s - 3t = 36    ... (5)

Subtracting the two equations:
2s - 3t = 12    ... (8)

Now we have two equations (4) and (8):

4s - 3t = 24    ... (4)
2s - 3t = 12    ... (8)

Subtracting equation (8) from equation (4):
2s = 12
s = 6

Now, substitute the value of 's' in equation (4):
4(6) - 3t = 24
24 - 3t = 24
-3t = 0
t = 0 is not possible, as it would mean the train didn't move. However, this is an indication that we should revisit our equations.

However, we can multiply equation (4) by 3 and equation (5) by 4, and then subtract equation (5) from equation (4) to eliminate 't':

12s - 9t = 72    ... (6) (multiplied equation 4 by 3)
24s - 12t = 144    ... (multiplied equation 5 by 4)

Subtracting the two equations:
-12s + 3t = -72
12s - 3t = 72    ... (9)

Now we have two equations (4) and (9):

4s - 3t = 24    ... (4)
12s - 3t = 72    ... (9)

Subtracting equation (4) from equation (9):
8s = 48
s = 6

Now, substitute the value of 's' in equation (4):
4(6) - 3t = 24
24 - 3t = 24
-3t = 0 is not possible, however, we can try another equation.

Substitute the value of 's' in equation (5):
6(6) - 3t = 36
36 - 3t = 36
-3t = 0 is not possible, however, we can try another equation.

Substitute the value of 's' in equation (9):
12(6) - 3t = 72
72 - 3t = 72
-3t = 0 is not possible, however, we can try another equation.

Substitute the value of 's' in equation (1):
d = s * t
d = 6t

Substitute the value of 's' in equation (2):
d = (s + 6) * (t - 8)
d = (6 + 6) * (t - 8)
d = 12 * (t - 8)

Now equate the two equations:
6t = 12 * (t - 8)
6t = 12t - 96

Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round down to 6 students per group, but that would leave some students left over. To find the number of leftover students, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of students per group and subtract that from the total number of students:

5 x 6 = 30
32 - 30 = 2

So, 2 students would be left over. However, if we round up to 6.4 students per group, we can't have a fraction of a student. But we can have 6 students in 4 groups and 7 students in 1 group (6 x 4 = 24, 24 + 7 + 1 = 32). Alternatively, we can say that 6.4 students per group is the average.

1. Total apples in all three bags: 24
2. First and second bags together: 11 apples
3. Second and third bags together: 18 apples

We can start by finding the number of apples in the second bag. Since the first and second bags have 11 apples together, and the second and third bags have 18 apples together, we can subtract the total number of apples from the sum of the two pairs of bags to find the number of apples in the second bag.

First and second bags + Second and third bags = 11 + 18 = 29
However, this counts the second bag twice. So, to find the number of apples in the second bag, we subtract the total number of apples from this sum.

29 - 24 = 5 apples in the second bag

Now that we know the second bag has 5 apples, we can find the number of apples in the first bag by subtracting 5 from the total number of apples in the first and second bags.

First and second bags: 11 apples
Second bag: 5 apples
First bag: 11 - 5 = 6 apples

Similarly, we can find the number of apples in the third bag by subtracting 5 from the total number of apples in the second and third bags.

Second and third bags: 18 apples
Second bag: 5 apples
Third bag: 18 - 5 = 13 apples

Finally, we can find the total number of apples in the first and third bags together by adding the number of apples in the first and third bags.

1285,Zoe picked five apples from her tree. Now the tree has six apples still on it. What's the difference between the number of apples Zoe picked and now the tree has?,"To find the difference between the number of apples Zoe picked and the number of apples the tree has now, we need to subtract the number of apples the tree has now from the number of apples Zoe picked.

Number of apples Zoe picked: 5
Number of apples the tree has now: 6

However, we are looking for the difference, and since Zoe picked 5 apples, the correct subtraction would be the number Zoe picked minus the number the tree has now is not the correct way to look at this problem. The correct way to look at this problem is to see how many more apples the tree has now compared to Zoe's pick. 

So, the correct subtraction is 6 (the number of apples the tree has now) minus 5 (the number of apples Zoe picked).

6 - 5 = 1

So, the tree has 1 more apple than Zoe picked.

1997,Zoe bought two coloring books. One had 44 pictures and the other had 44. After one week she had already colored 20 of the pictures. How many pictures does she still have to color?,"To find out how many pictures Zoe still has to color, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the total number of pictures in both coloring books. 
   Zoe bought two coloring books with 44 pictures each. 
   Total pictures = 44 + 44 = 88

2. Subtract the number of pictures Zoe has already colored from the total number of pictures.
   Zoe colored 20 pictures. 
   Pictures left to color = Total pictures - Pictures colored
   Pictures left to color = 88 - 20
   Pictures left to color = 68

Length of the hangar: 300 feet
Length of each plane: 40 feet

Number of planes that can fit = Length of the hangar / Length of each plane
= 300 feet / 40 feet

1. Let's say the son has x dollars.
2. Since Mr. Brown has 10 times as much as his son, Mr. Brown has 10x dollars.
3. Together, they have $220, so we can set up the equation: x + 10x = 220
4. Combine like terms: 11x = 220
5. Divide both sides by 11: x = 20

So, the son has $20, and Mr. Brown has 10 times that, which is $200.

1. Robin started with 30 songs.
2. She deleted 8 old songs, so we subtract 8 from 30: 30 - 8 = 22

1. Weight of 4 watermelons = 5 kg 200 g
   Weight of 1 watermelon = 5 kg 200 g / 4
   Weight of 1 watermelon = 1 kg 300 g

2. Total weight of 3 watermelons = 3 * 1 kg 300 g
   Total weight of 3 watermelons = 3 kg 900 g

3. Total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples = 5 kg 700 g
   Total weight of 4 pineapples = Total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples - Total weight of 3 watermelons
   Total weight of 4 pineapples = 5 kg 700 g - 3 kg 900 g
   Total weight of 4 pineapples = 1 kg 800 g

7 (regular milk ratio) = 49 (cartons of regular milk sold)
2 (chocolate milk ratio) = x (cartons of chocolate milk sold)

We can set up a proportion to solve for x:

7/2 = 49/x

Cross-multiplying:

7x = 49 * 2
7x = 98

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 98/7
x = 14

So, 14 cartons of chocolate milk were sold.

The combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold is:
49 (cartons of regular milk) + 14 (cartons of chocolate milk) = 63

1682,"At a restaurant the ratio of kids meals sold to adult meals sold was 2:1. If there were 8 kids meals sold, what is the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold?","To find the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold, we need to first determine the number of adult meals sold. 

Given that the ratio of kids meals to adult meals is 2:1, we can set up a proportion to represent the number of meals sold. Let's assume the number of kids meals is 2x and the number of adult meals is x.

Since we know that 8 kids meals were sold, we can set up the equation:

2x = 8

To find x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 8 / 2
x = 4

So, the number of adult meals sold is 4.

Now, we can find the combined amount of kids and adult meals sold by adding the number of kids meals (8) and the number of adult meals (4):

Combined meals = 8 + 4
Combined meals = 12

If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?","To find out how many pounds of clothes the washing machine that isn't fully loaded washes per day, we need to subtract the amount of clothes it can wash from the total amount of clothes to be washed.

However, in this case, the washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day, but there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day. This means the washing machine can't wash all the clothes in one day.

To find out how many times the washing machine needs to be loaded to wash all the clothes, we divide the total amount of clothes by the amount the washing machine can wash:

200 pounds / 28 pounds = 7.14 (round up to 8, since you can't load a fraction of a load)

Since the washing machine can't wash all the clothes in one day, it will be loaded 8 times to wash all the clothes. However, this still doesn't answer the question of how many pounds of clothes the washing machine that isn't fully loaded washes per day.

If the washing machine is loaded 8 times, it will be fully loaded 7 times (since 7 x 28 = 196 pounds) and not fully loaded 1 time (since 200 - 196 = 4 pounds).

So, the washing machine that isn't fully loaded will wash 4 pounds of clothes per day.

Since there are 9 friends and 865 tickets, we can divide 865 by 9 to find the number of tickets each friend would get:

865 รท 9 = 96.11

Since you can't split a ticket, we round down to 96 tickets per friend. 

Now, we multiply the number of tickets per friend (96) by the number of friends (9) to find the total number of tickets needed for an even split:

96 * 9 = 864

The friends currently have 865 tickets, but they need 864 tickets for an even split. They actually have 1 extra ticket. However, this extra ticket can't be split evenly among the friends.

Since we can't have a fraction of a watch, this means Tom will fix 13 full sets of 12 watches. To find out how many watches he will have fixed in these 13 days, we multiply 13 by 12:
13 * 12 = 156

This means Tom will have fixed 156 watches in the first 13 days. To find out how many watches he will fix on the last day, we subtract 156 from the total number of watches (158):

Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Let's denote the original speed of the man as 's' km/hr and the distance covered as 'd' km.

We know that time = distance/speed.

So, the original time taken by the man to cover the distance 'd' is d/s.

If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, his new speed is (s + 1/2) km/hr. The time taken in this case is d/(s + 1/2).

Given that he takes 1 hour less when he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, we can write:

d/s - d/(s + 1/2) = 1

To simplify, let's find a common denominator, which is s(s + 1/2):

(d(s + 1/2) - ds)/(s(s + 1/2)) = 1

d(s + 1/2 - s)/(s(s + 1/2)) = 1

d(1/2)/(s(s + 1/2)) = 1

d = 2s(s + 1/2)  ... (equation 1)

Now, if he walks 1 km/hr slower, his new speed is (s - 1) km/hr. The time taken in this case is d/(s - 1).

Given that he takes 3 more hours when he walks 1 km/hr slower, we can write:

d/(s - 1) - d/s = 3

To simplify, let's find a common denominator, which is s(s - 1):

(ds - d(s - 1))/(s(s - 1)) = 3

d(s - s + 1)/(s(s - 1)) = 3

d/(s(s - 1)) = 3

d = 3s(s - 1)  ... (equation 2)

Now, we have two equations and two variables. We can equate equation 1 and equation 2:

2s(s + 1/2) = 3s(s - 1)

Expanding both sides:

2s^2 + s = 3s^2 - 3s

Rearranging:

s^2 - 4s = 0

s(s - 4) = 0

s = 0 or s = 4

Since speed cannot be zero, s = 4 km/hr.

Now, substitute s = 4 in equation 1 or equation 2 to find the distance:

d = 2s(s + 1/2)
d = 2(4)(4 + 1/2)
d = 2(4)(9/2)
d = 36 km

So, the distance covered by the man is 36 km, and his original rate of walking is 4 km/hr.

3. B is twice as old as his sister C:
   B = 2C

4. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years:
   D = C + 40 or D = C - 40

Since D is older than C, we can use the equation D = C + 40.

Now, we can substitute the equations to find the relationship between B and C.

D = 2A
D = 2(B + 2) 
D = 2B + 4

D = C + 40
2B + 4 = C + 40

Weight of 1 fox = 25 kg / 5
Weight of 1 fox = 5 kg

Now, we know that the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. We can find the total weight of the 3 foxes:

Total weight of 3 foxes = Weight of 1 fox * Number of foxes
Total weight of 3 foxes = 5 kg * 3
Total weight of 3 foxes = 15 kg

Since the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg, we can subtract the weight of the 3 foxes to find the total weight of the 5 dogs:

Total weight of 5 dogs = Total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs - Total weight of 3 foxes
Total weight of 5 dogs = 65 kg - 15 kg

However, the question is asking how many feet of rope his friends gave to him. Since he only needed 57 feet at the moment, the rope his friends gave to him is the difference between the rope he needed at the moment and the rope he already had:
57 (he needed at the moment) - 46 (he already has) = 11 feet

1446,The larger of two supplementary angles exceeds the smaller by 18 degrees. Find them.,"To find the two supplementary angles, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smaller angle 'x' and the larger angle 'x + 18' (since it exceeds the smaller angle by 18 degrees).

2. We can set up an equation based on the fact that the two angles are supplementary:
   x + (x + 18) = 180

3. Combine like terms:
   2x + 18 = 180

4. Subtract 18 from both sides:
   2x = 162

5. Divide both sides by 2:
   x = 81

6. Now that we have the value of 'x' (the smaller angle), we can find the value of the larger angle by adding 18:
   Larger angle = x + 18 = 81 + 18 = 99

So, the two supplementary angles are 81 degrees and 99 degrees.

1. Dennis has 70 marbles.
2. Kurt has 45 marbles less than Dennis. So, Kurt has 70 - 45 = 25 marbles.
3. Laurie has 12 more marbles than Kurt. So, Laurie has 25 + 12 = 37 marbles.

808,"Mr. Lee harvested 495 apples and he packed them evenly in some baskets. If there are 25 apples in each basket, how many apples were left unpacked?","To find out how many apples were left unpacked, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket.

Total apples = 495
Apples per basket = 25

First, divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per basket:
495 รท 25 = 19.8

Since you can't have a fraction of a basket, this means that Mr. Lee was able to pack 19 baskets with 25 apples each.

Now, let's find out how many apples were packed:
19 baskets * 25 apples per basket = 475 apples

To find out how many apples were left unpacked, subtract the number of packed apples from the total number of apples:
495 (total apples) - 475 (packed apples) = 20 apples

So, there were 20 apples left unpacked.

Now, we need to isolate the length by dividing both sides by 5:

Length = 20 / 5
Length = 4

So, the length of the lawn is 4 feet.

She wants all the pages to be set up in the same way, with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page. She also wants to make sure that no items are left over. What is the greatest number of scrapbook pages that Aylin can create?","To find the greatest number of scrapbook pages Aylin can create, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of photos (18) and the number of newspaper clippings (20). This is because the GCD will give us the largest number of items that can be evenly divided between the two.

To find the GCD, we can list the factors of 18 and 20:

Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20

The greatest common factor is 2.

Now, we can divide the number of photos and newspaper clippings by the GCD to find the number of items per page:

Photos per page: 18 / 2 = 9
Newspaper clippings per page: 20 / 2 = 10

However, this doesn't seem right, as Aylin wants the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings on every page.

Let's try again, this time using the factors to find the GCD:

Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20

The greatest common factor is indeed 2. However, we can also see that both 18 and 20 can be divided by 2.

Photos per page: 18 / 2 = 9
Newspaper clippings per page: 20 / 2 = 10

1433,A railway half ticket costs half the full fare and the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket. One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"Let's denote the basic first class full fare as 'x' and the reservation charge as 'y'. 

The cost of one reserved first class ticket is the basic fare plus the reservation charge, which is $216. So, we can write the equation:
x + y = 216

The cost of one full and one half reserved first class ticket is $327. The half ticket costs half the basic fare plus the same reservation charge. So, we can write the equation:
x + (x/2) + 2y = 327

To simplify the second equation, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
2x + x + 4y = 654
Combine like terms:
3x + 4y = 654

Now we have two equations:
x + y = 216
3x + 4y = 654

We can solve these equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. Multiply the first equation by -3 to eliminate 'x':
-3x - 3y = -648
Now add this equation to the second equation:
3x + 4y - 3x - 3y = 654 - 648
This simplifies to:
y = 6

Now that we have the value of 'y', substitute it into the first equation to find 'x':
x + 6 = 216
x = 210

So, the basic first class full fare is $210 and the reservation charge is $6.

1. The number is a two-digit number, so let's represent it as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit.

2. The sum of the two digits is 9, so we can write an equation: a + b = 9.

3. If the digits are reversed, the new number is 10b + a. According to the problem, this new number is 9 more than the original number, so we can write another equation: 10b + a = (10a + b) + 9.

4. Simplify the second equation: 10b + a = 10a + b + 9. Rearrange the terms: 10b - b = 10a - a + 9, which becomes 9b = 9a + 9.

5. Divide both sides of the equation by 9: b = a + 1.

6. Now, substitute b = a + 1 into the first equation (a + b = 9): a + (a + 1) = 9. Combine like terms: 2a + 1 = 9.

7. Solve for a: 2a = 8, so a = 4.

8. Since b = a + 1, b = 4 + 1 = 5.

Let's call the length 'L' and the width 'W'. We know that W = 2L.

The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. Since the perimeter is 60 feet, we can set up the equation:

2L + 2W = 60

Now, we can substitute W = 2L into the equation:

2L + 2(2L) = 60
2L + 4L = 60
6L = 60

Now, divide both sides by 6:

L = 60 / 6
L = 10

1. We know that two angles of the triangle are the same size. Let's call this angle 'x'.
2. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, which is 'x'. So, the third angle is 'x - 12'.
3. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Now, we can set up an equation using the above information:

x + x + (x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

3x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

3x = 192

Divide by 3:

x = 64

Now that we have the value of 'x', we can find the other two angles:

The two equal angles are x = 64 degrees each.
The third angle is x - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.
