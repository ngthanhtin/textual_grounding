1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations.

Let's use the following variables:

- Let \( x \) be your current age.
- Let \( y \) be your son's current age.

We have two conditions based on the given information:

1. Five years ago, you were thrice as old as your son.
2. Ten years later, you will be twice as old as your son.

### Step 1: Translate conditions into equations

**Condition 1: Five years ago**

Five years ago, your age was \( x - 5 \) and your son's age was \( y - 5 \). According to the problem:

\[
x - 5 = 3(y - 5)
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
x - 5 = 3y - 15
\]
\[
x = 3y - 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

**Condition 2: Ten years later**

Ten years later, your age will be \( x + 10 \) and your son's age will be \( y + 10 \). According to the problem:

\[
x + 10 = 2(y + 10)
\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[
x + 10 = 2y + 20
\]
\[
x = 2y + 10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( x = 3y - 10 \)
2. \( x = 2y + 10 \)

Setting the right sides of the equations equal because both equal \( x \):

\[
3y - 10 = 2y + 10
\]

Subtract \( 2y \) from both sides:

\[
y - 10 = 10
\]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[
y = 20
\]

Now that we know \( y \), substitute it back into one of the original equations to find \( x \). Using Equation 2:

\[
x = 2y + 10
\]
\[
x = 2(20) + 10
\]
\[
x = 40 + 10
\]
\[
x = 50
\]

### Conclusion

Your current age is 50, and your son's current age is 20. Hence, the final answer is:

\[
\{50, 20\}

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To find the area of the border, we need to begin by understanding the dimensions of both the living room and the carpet that is placed within it.

1. **Determine the dimensions of the carpet:**
   - Since the border is 2 feet wide all around the carpet, we must subtract this width from both the length and the width of the room to find the dimensions of the carpet.
   - The total reduction in length due to the border on both sides is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) feet.
   - Similarly, the total reduction in width due to the border on both sides is also \(2 \times 2 = 4\) feet.
   - Thus, the dimensions of the carpet are:
     - Length = \(12 - 4 = 8\) feet
     - Width = \(10 - 4 = 6\) feet

2. **Calculate the area of the carpet:**
   - The area of the carpet is calculated by multiplying its length by its width:
   \[
   \text{Area of carpet} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the living room:**
   - The area of the living room is calculated in a similar manner:
   \[
   \text{Area of living room} = 12 \times 10 = 120 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the area of the border:**
   - The area of the border is the difference between the total area of the living room and the area of the carpet:
   \[
   \text{Area of border} = \text{Area of living room} - \text{Area of carpet} = 120 - 48 = 72 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Thus, the area of the border is \(\{72\}\) square feet."

1432,"The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To find out the taxi charges for traveling 25 km, we need to determine the fixed charge and the variable charge per km. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Let \( f \) be the fixed charge and \( c \) be the variable charge per km.
2. From the problem, we have two equations based on the given journeys:
   - For 10 km: 
     \[
     f + 10c = 75
     \]
   - For 15 km: 
     \[
     f + 15c = 110
     \]

3. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( f \):
   \[
   (f + 15c) - (f + 10c) = 110 - 75 
   \]
   \[
   5c = 35 
   \]
   \[
   c = 7
   \]

4. Substitute the value of \( c \) back into the first equation to solve for \( f \):
   \[
   f + 10(7) = 75 
   \]
   \[
   f + 70 = 75 
   \]
   \[
   f = 5
   \]

5. Now that we know \( f = 5 \) and \( c = 7 \), we can calculate the charge for a 25 km journey:
   \[
   \text{Charge} = f + 25c 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Charge} = 5 + 25 \times 7 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Charge} = 5 + 175

   \[
   \text{Charge} = 180

902,"Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, let's assign variables to each person's weight:

- Let \( A \) represent Annette's weight.
- Let \( C \) represent Caitlin's weight.
- Let \( S \) represent Sara's weight.

We have the following equations based on the information given:

1. Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together:
   \[
   A + C = 95
   \]

2. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together:
   \[
   C + S = 87
   \]

We are asked how much more Annette weighs than Sara, which is \( A - S \).

To find \( A - S \), we can manipulate the given equations to eliminate \( C \) and directly find the difference between \( A \) and \( S \):

Subtract the second equation from the first equation:
\[
(A + C) - (C + S) = 95 - 87
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
A + C - C - S = 8
\]
\[
A - S = 8
\]

Thus, Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine the pattern Alec is using to place flowers in each vase, let's examine the differences in the number of flowers:

1. From the 1st vase to the 2nd vase:  
   7 flowers - 5 flowers = 2 flowers

2. From the 2nd vase to the 3rd vase:  
   10 flowers - 7 flowers = 3 flowers

3. From the 3rd vase to the 4th vase:  
   14 flowers - 10 flowers = 4 flowers

We can see that the number of flowers added from one vase to the next is increasing by 1 each time.

1. 1st difference: 7 - 5 = 2
2. 2nd difference: 10 - 7 = 3
3. 3rd difference: 14 - 10 = 4

This suggests that the difference between consecutive terms is incrementing by 1. The next difference in this sequence based on the increasing pattern would be 5.

Therefore, to find the number of flowers Alec will put in the fifth vase, we add the next difference to the number of flowers in the fourth vase:

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","Let's denote the amount of capital furnished by Jamal as \( J \) and the amount furnished by Moshe as \( M \).

We know from the problem statement that Jamal furnished half as much capital as Moshe. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
\[ J = \frac{1}{2}M \]

Additionally, we know that the total capital for the business is $7500, which is the combined amount that Jamal and Moshe furnished:
\[ J + M = 7500 \]

Now we substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( M \):
\[ \frac{1}{2}M + M = 7500 \]

Combine the terms on the left-hand side:
\[ \frac{3}{2}M = 7500 \]

To solve for \( M \), we multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
\[ M = 7500 \times \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ M = 5000 \]

Now that we have \( M \), we can find \( J \) using the first equation:
\[ J = \frac{1}{2}M = \frac{1}{2} \times 5000 = 2500 \]

815,"650 lollipops are to be distributed to 42 kids. If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally, at least how many more lollipops are needed?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional lollipops are needed so that 650 lollipops can be evenly distributed among 42 kids with none remaining.

1. Calculate how many lollipops each child would receive if the 650 lollipops were distributed equally:
   \[
   \text{Lollipops per child} = \left\lfloor \frac{650}{42} \right\rfloor
   \]
   First, calculate \( \frac{650}{42} \approx 15.476 \). Thus, each child would receive 15 complete lollipops. We ignore the decimal because lollipops cannot be split further in this context.

2. Calculate how many lollipops would be distributed if each child gets 15 lollipops:
   \[
   15 \times 42 = 630
   \]
   So, 630 lollipops are needed to give each child 15 lollipops.

3. Subtract the number of lollipops needed from the total number of lollipops available:
   \[
   650 - 630 = 20
   \]
   This step confirms that after giving 15 lollipops to each child, there are 20 lollipops remaining.

4. Calculate how many additional lollipops are needed for an equal distribution:
   Since every child initially received 15 lollipops (total 630), and we have 20 lollipops left, we need more to give one additional lollipop to each of the 42 kids. Each child should receive 16 lollipops for it to be evenly distributed since \( \frac{42 \times 16}{42} = 16 \).

5. Calculate the total number of lollipops needed for every child to receive 16:
   \[
   16 \times 42 = 672
   \]
   Therefore, 672 lollipops are needed in total to give 16 lollipops to each child.

6. Calculate how many more lollipops are needed:
   \[
   672 - 650 = 22
   \]

Therefore, at least 22 more lollipops are needed for each child to receive the same amount without any remaining.

Sam knocks down 8 pins per bowl, so he knocks down a total of \( 8s \) pins.

Carlos knocks down 9 pins per bowl, so he knocks down a total of \( 9c \) pins.

According to the problem, at the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. So we have the equation:

\[ 8s = 9c \]

We want to find the smallest positive integer solution for \( 8s = 9c \).

- The prime factorization of 8 is \( 2^3 \).
- The prime factorization of 9 is \( 3^2 \).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime: \( 2^3 \times 3^2 = 72 \).

Now, \( 8s = 72 \) yields \( s = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \).

And \( 9c = 72 \) yields \( c = \frac{72}{9} = 8 \).

Thus, the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down is 72.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we will use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Let's denote the three angles of the triangle as follows:
- Let the first angle be \( x \).
- According to the problem, the second angle is double the first angle, so the second angle is \( 2x \).
- The third angle is 40 degrees less than the first angle, so the third angle is \( x - 40 \).

Now we can set up the equation using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:
\[
x + 2x + (x - 40) = 180
\]

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:
\[
4x - 40 = 180
\]

Next, solve for \( x \) by adding 40 to both sides:
\[
4x = 220
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to find \( x \):
\[
x = 55
\]

So, the first angle is \( x = 55 \) degrees.

Now, calculate the second angle:
\[
2x = 2 \times 55 = 110
\]

Calculate the third angle:
\[
x - 40 = 55 - 40 = 15
\]

Therefore, the three angles of the triangle are 55 degrees, 110 degrees, and 15 degrees.

The final answer can be presented as a set of the three angles:
\[

1248,"Jawbreakers come in packages of 8. Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers. How many Jawbreakers does she have left?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Jawbreakers Sarah started with and how many she has left after eating 20 of them.

1. Jawbreakers come in packages of 8. We don't know how many packages Sarah started with, so we need to calculate how many Jawbreakers she has initially based on the number of packages.

2. Let's assume Sarah had \( n \) packages of Jawbreakers.

3. Therefore, she had initially \( n \times 8 \) Jawbreakers.

4. Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers, so the number of Jawbreakers she has left is \( n \times 8 - 20 \).

5. Since we don't know how many packages (n) she initially had, we can't express the number of Jawbreakers left in terms of an exact number without additional information.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine the exact number of remaining Jawbreakers. If more information about the number of packages Sarah initially had were provided, we could calculate an exact number. Since that information isn't available, we can express the remaining Jawbreakers in terms of \( n \):

{8n - 20} 

If additional information is given, you can substitute the value of \( n \) to find the precise number left."

1604,"While playing a trivia game Adam scored 283 points total. If he scored 71 points each round, about how many rounds did he play?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine how many rounds Adam played, we need to divide the total points he scored by the number of points he scored each round. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify Total Points:** Adam scored a total of 283 points.
2. **Points Per Round:** He scored 71 points in each round.
3. **Calculate Number of Rounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Rounds} = \frac{\text{Total Points}}{\text{Points Per Round}} = \frac{283}{71}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - 71 goes into 283 a certain number of times.
   - First, calculate 283 divided by 71:
     \[
     71 \times 4 = 284
     \]
   - However, 284 is just one point more than 283, so we need to check the next whole number less than 4.
   - Trying 71 times 3:
     \[
     71 \times 3 = 213
     \]
   - Trying 71 times 4:
     \[
     71 \times 4 = 284
     \]

   We see that 71 does not go fully into 283 three complete times, but four times would exceed it. This means Adam completed 3 rounds and actually scored a little over the partial next set of points.

5. **Rounding:** Since 283/71 is very close to 4, in practical scenarios, we'd say it's approximately 4 rounds. However, since we can clearly validate he was in progress on the 4th, we would estimate approximately 4.

Thus, Adam played about 4 rounds. However, he completed 3 full rounds and was partway through the next one with 283, so expressing in total whole rounds, he completed:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

Therefore, the concise answer is {4}."
2274,"Virginia had 13 Sweettarts. If Virginia gave equal numbers of Sweettarts to her 4 friends and then she ate what was left, how many Sweettarts did each person eat?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem step by step:

1. **Start with the total number of Sweettarts**: Virginia has 13 Sweettarts.

2. **Determine the number of friends**: Virginia has 4 friends.

3. **Calculate how many Sweettarts each friend receives**: To give equal numbers of Sweettarts to each of her 4 friends, we divide the total number of Sweettarts by the number of friends.

   \[
   \text{Sweettarts per friend} = \left\lfloor \frac{13}{4} \right\rfloor = 3
   \]

   Here, we take the floor of the division because each person can only receive a whole number of Sweettarts.

4. **Calculate the total number of Sweettarts given to friends**: Multiply the number each friend receives by the number of friends.

   \[
   \text{Total given to friends} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

5. **Find how many Sweettarts Virginia eats**: Subtract the total given to friends from the original total.

   \[
   \text{Sweettarts left for Virginia} = 13 - 12 = 1
   \]

6. **Determine how many Sweettarts each person eats, including Virginia**:
   - Each of the 4 friends eats 3 Sweettarts.
   - Virginia eats 1 Sweettart.

Thus, each friend eats 3 Sweettarts, and Virginia eats 1 Sweettart. 

So in concise form, the number of Sweettarts each person eats is:

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine how many extra donuts the baker ended up with, we need to divide the total number of donuts by the number of boxes and examine the remainder.

1. Start with the total number of donuts: 48 donuts.
2. The number of boxes available: 7 boxes.

Now, divide the donuts into the boxes:

3. Divide 48 by 7 to see how many donuts go into each box:  
   \( \frac{48}{7} \).

4. Calculate the division to find the integer quotient and remainder:

   - 7 fits into 48 a total of 6 times (since \(7 \times 6 = 42\)),
   - This means each box will have 6 donuts.

5. Calculate the number of donuts used in filling the boxes:
   - \(6 \) donuts/box \( \times \) 7 boxes = 42 donuts.

6. Calculate the number of extra (remaining) donuts:
   - 48 total donuts \(-\) 42 donuts used = 6 extra donuts.

Thus, the baker ended up with 6 extra donuts that didn't fit evenly into the boxes.

The answer is: {6}."

","To solve the problem, we want to find the smallest number of pens that Philip can buy where the total number of pens equals the total number of pencils. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of pen packages Philip buys.
- Let \( y \) be the number of pencil packages Philip buys.

Each pen package contains 12 pens, and each pencil package contains 15 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pens is \( 12x \) and the total number of pencils is \( 15y \). We want these quantities to be equal:

\[ 12x = 15y \]

Our objective is to find the smallest positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that this equation holds true. First, let's rewrite the equation:

\[ 12x = 15y \]
\[ \frac{12x}{15} = y \]
\[ \frac{4x}{5} = y \]

The number of pencils \( y \) must be an integer, which implies that \( 4x \) must be a multiple of 5. Therefore, \( x \) must be a multiple of \(\frac{5}{\text{GCD}(4,5)} = 5\).

Let's start testing the smallest multiples of 5 for \( x \):

1. \( x = 5 \)
   \[
   y = \frac{4 \times 5}{5} = 4
   \]
   In this case, the total number of pens and pencils would be:
   \[ 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ pens} \]

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more riddles Sam needs so each of his 18 students can have an equal number of riddles.

1. **Determine Initial Riddles Per Student:** 
   - Sam has 389 riddles to distribute among 18 students.
   - Perform integer division to see how many riddles each student gets initially:
     \[
     389 \div 18 = 21 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 11
     \]

   This calculation means each student can get 21 riddles from the 389, and there will be 11 riddles leftover that cannot be evenly distributed.

2. **Calculate Remaining Riddles to Achieve Equal Distribution:**
   - Each student currently gets 21 riddles, but to evenly distribute all riddles, each student would need to have 22 riddles, taking more than the current 389 riddles allows.
   - To find how many additional riddles Sam needs, we calculate how many riddles would be required so that each of the 18 students can receive one more riddle than currently possible:
     \[
     \text{Total riddles required for 22 each} = 18 \times 22 = 396
     \]

3. **Calculate Additional Riddles Needed:**
   - The difference between the needed riddles (396) and the available riddles (389) indicates how many more are needed:
     \[
     396 - 389 = 7

   We start by dividing the total number of candies, 650, by the number of bags, which is 3.

   \[
   650 \div 3 = 216 \text{ remainder } 2
   \]

   The quotient is 216, and the remainder is 2.

2. **Interpret the result**:
   - The quotient, 216, indicates that if we evenly distribute 650 candies, each bag would receive 216 candies.
   - The remainder, 2, tells us there are 2 pieces left over after distributing 216 pieces into each of the three bags.
   
3. **Determine the additional candies needed**:
   To make sure each of the three bags has the same amount with no remainder, we need to eliminate the remainder. This means we need 1 additional piece of candy because:

   \[
   2 \text{ (current remainder)} + 1 \text{ (additional piece)} = 3 \text{ (needed for no remainder)}
   \]

With 1 more piece of candy, we can distribute 651 candies evenly into three bags:

   \[
   651 \div 3 = 217 \text{ (each)}
   \]

Each bag would have 217 candies, and there would be no remainder.

Thus, Billy would need 1 more piece of candy.

1556,"A clown needed two hundred twenty-seven balloons for a party he was going to, but the balloons only came in packs of two. How many packs of balloons would he need to buy?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","The clown needed \( 227 \) balloons, and the balloons come in packs of \( 2 \).

To determine how many packs are needed, divide the total number of balloons needed by the number of balloons per pack:

\[
\frac{227}{2} = 113.5
\]

Since the clown cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough balloons. Rounding up \( 113.5 \) gives \( 114 \) packs.

Thus, the clown would need to buy \(\boxed{114}\) packs of balloons to have at least \( 227 \) balloons.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem, let's break down the events step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the initial number of people on the bus when Jose gets on.

2. After the first stop:
   - 5 people get on the bus.
   - 2 people get off the bus.
   - The number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 - 2 = x + 3 \).

3. After the second stop (terminal station):
   - 7 more people get on the bus.
   - 15 people get off the bus.
   - The number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 3) + 7 - 15 \).

Combine the operations:
\[
x + 3 + 7 - 15 = x + 10 - 15 = x - 5
\]

Since the problem states it's the terminal station, the bus is empty, so:
\[
x - 5 = 0
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 5
\]

Thus, there were 5 people on the bus when Jose got on.

764,"A paper bag can hold 16 cookies. If Edgar buys 292 cookies, how many cookies are there in the paper bag that is not full?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many full paper bags can be filled and how many cookies remain that do not fill another entire bag.

1. **Determine the number of full bags:**
   - Each paper bag holds 16 cookies.
   - Edgar buys 292 cookies.
   - Calculate the number of full paper bags by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag: 
     \[
     \text{Number of full bags} = \left\lfloor \frac{292}{16} \right\rfloor
     \]

2. **Perform the division:**
   - \(\frac{292}{16} = 18.25\)
   - Therefore, there are 18 full bags since the floor function \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

3. **Calculate the number of cookies in the full bags:**
   - \(18 \text{ full bags} \times 16 \text{ cookies per bag} = 288 \text{ cookies}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining cookies:**
   - Total cookies = 292
   - Cookies in full bags = 288
   - Remaining cookies = Total cookies - Cookies in full bags
   \[
   292 - 288 = 4
   \]

Therefore, there are 4 cookies in the paper bag that is not full.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine how many copies the bookstore will order in January, let's first identify the pattern in the number of copies ordered each month. We have the following data:

- September: 4 copies
- October: 6 copies
- November: 8 copies
- December: 10 copies

Observing the pattern, we can see that the number of copies ordered each month increases by 2 compared to the previous month:

- From September to October: 6 - 4 = 2 copies
- From October to November: 8 - 6 = 2 copies
- From November to December: 10 - 8 = 2 copies

The pattern is a consistent increase of 2 copies every month. 

Based on this pattern, to find the number of copies ordered in January, we add 2 to the number ordered in December:

Number of copies in January = Number of copies in December + 2

1427,"Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, let's define some variables:

- Let \( v_r \) be Tara's speed of rowing in still water (in km/hr).
- Let \( v_c \) be the speed of the current (in km/hr).

**Step 1: Determine the downstream speed.**

When Tara is rowing downstream, the current helps her. Therefore, her effective speed is the sum of her rowing speed and the current speed. She rows 20 km in 2 hours downstream, so her downstream speed is:

\[ v_r + v_c = \frac{20 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ hr}} = 10 \text{ km/hr} \]

**Step 2: Determine the upstream speed.**

When Tara is rowing upstream, she is rowing against the current. Therefore, her effective speed is her rowing speed minus the current speed. She rows 4 km in 2 hours upstream, so her upstream speed is:

\[ v_r - v_c = \frac{4 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ hr}} = 2 \text{ km/hr} \]

**Step 3: Solve the system of equations.**

Now, we have the following two equations:

1. \( v_r + v_c = 10 \)
2. \( v_r - v_c = 2 \)

Add these two equations to eliminate \( v_c \):

\[
(v_r + v_c) + (v_r - v_c) = 10 + 2
\]

\[
2v_r = 12
\]

\[
v_r = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ km/hr}
\]

Now, substitute \( v_r = 6 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( v_c \). Let's use the first equation:

\[
6 + v_c = 10
\]

\[
v_c = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ km/hr}
\]

Therefore, Tara's speed of rowing in still water is 6 km/hr, and the speed of the current is 4 km/hr.

**Final Answer:**

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine how to distribute 95 tons of oil using the fewest number of barrels, with no barrel partially filled. We have two types of barrels: large barrels that hold 6 tons each and small barrels that hold 5 tons each.

Let's think through the process step by step:

1. **Determine the Maximum Number of Large Barrels:**
   - Large barrels hold 6 tons each. So, if we use only large barrels, the number of barrels required to hold 95 tons is 95 / 6 = 15 with a remainder of 5. This means 15 large barrels will hold 90 tons (15 x 6 = 90), leaving 5 tons that need to be filled by another barrel.

2. **Determine the Usage of Small Barrels:**
   - Since the remainder is 5 tons, which perfectly fits into one small barrel, we can use 1 small barrel to accommodate these remaining 5 tons.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Barrels:**
   - Using 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel fully occupies the 95 tons of oil. 

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - With 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel, the total capacity is:
     \(15 \times 6\) tons from large barrels = 90 tons.
     \(1 \times 5\) tons from the small barrel = 5 tons.
     Total = 90 + 5 = 95 tons.
   - This confirms the entire 95 tons are perfectly distributed using 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - To minimize the total number of barrels used and ensure every barrel is fully occupied, you should use 1 small barrel.

Therefore, the number of small barrels to be used is \(\{1\}\)."

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To find the ages of Ana and Jack, let's set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let the age of Jack be \( x \).
2. Ana is 5 years older than Jack, so her age is \( x + 5 \).
3. The sum of their ages is 29.

Now, we can express this information in an equation:
\[ x + (x + 5) = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 5 = 29 \]

Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( x \):
\[ 2x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Jack is 12 years old.

To find Ana's age, plug \( x = 12 \) back into the expression for Ana's age:

1435,"A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","Let's begin by defining some variables and using the information provided to set up equations.

Let:
- \( t_u \) be the time in hours spent going uphill.
- \( t_d \) be the time in hours spent going downhill.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total time traveled is 15 hours:

\[
t_u + t_d = 15
\]

2. The total distance covered is 650 km, with different rates uphill and downhill:

The distance covered uphill is \((30 \, \text{km/h}) \times t_u\), and the distance covered downhill is \((50 \, \text{km/h}) \times t_d\). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[
30t_u + 50t_d = 650
\]

Now, we have a system of two equations:

\[
1. \quad t_u + t_d = 15
\]
\[
2. \quad 30t_u + 50t_d = 650
\]

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. We'll use substitution:

From equation 1, we express \( t_u \) in terms of \( t_d \):

\[
t_u = 15 - t_d
\]

Substitute \( t_u = 15 - t_d \) into equation 2:

\[
30(15 - t_d) + 50t_d = 650
\]

Expanding the equation:

\[
450 - 30t_d + 50t_d = 650
\]

Simplify by combining like terms:

\[
450 + 20t_d = 650
\]

Subtract 450 from both sides:

\[
20t_d = 200
\]

Divide by 20:

\[
t_d = 10
\]

Now, substitute \( t_d = 10 \) back into equation 1 to find \( t_u \):

\[
t_u + 10 = 15
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
t_u = 5
\]

Thus, the car went uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours.

The final answer is:

\[
\{5, 10\}

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers are both the 75th and the 30th customer (i.e., how many customers are the least common multiple of 75 and 30).

Step 1: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 75 and 30.
- First, find the prime factorization of each number:
  - 75 = 3 x 5^2
  - 30 = 2 x 3 x 5

- To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:
  - The LCM must include: 2^1, 3^1, and 5^2.

- Therefore, LCM = 2^1 x 3^1 x 5^2 = 2 x 3 x 25 = 150.

Step 2: Determine how many multiples of 150 are there up to 3,000.
- To find how many multiples of 150 fit into 3,000, divide 3,000 by 150:

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine the greatest number of teams that can participate, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and boys, because each team must have the same number of girls and the same number of boys.

1. Calculate the GCD of 40 (girls) and 32 (boys).

   - Prime factorization of 40:
     - 40 = 2 × 20 = 2 × 2 × 10 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5
     - Thus, the prime factors of 40 are 2^3 × 5.

   - Prime factorization of 32:
     - 32 = 2 × 16 = 2 × 2 × 8 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 4 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
     - Thus, the prime factors of 32 are 2^5.

2. Identify the common prime factors.

   - The common prime factor is 2.

3. Take the smallest power of the common prime factor.

   - The power of 2 in 40 is 3, and the power of 2 in 32 is 5.
   - Take the smaller power, which is 3.

4. Calculate the GCD.

   - GCD = 2^3 = 8

5. The GCD tells us the greatest number of teams that can be formed such that each team has an equal number of girls and boys.

Therefore, the greatest number of teams is {8}."

","To solve this problem, let's define the variables and break it down step-by-step:

1. Let the original speed of the train be \( v \) km/hr.
2. Let the scheduled time taken for the journey be \( t \) hours.
3. Let the length of the journey be \( d \) km.

From the problem, we have the following equations based on the conditions given:

- The original time taken for the journey: 
  \[
  d = v \times t \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
  \]

- If the train's speed is increased by 6 km/hr, it takes 8 hours less:
  \[
  d = (v + 6) \times (t - 8) \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
  \]

- If the train's speed is decreased by 6 km/hr, it takes 12 hours more:
  \[
  d = (v - 6) \times (t + 12) \quad \text{(Equation 3)}

We can now set up two equations from these expressions by equating the right-hand sides of the equations since they all equal \( d \):

From Equation 1 and Equation 2:
\[
v \times t = (v + 6) \times (t - 8)
\]
Expanding and rearranging terms:
\[
vt = vt - 8v + 6t - 48 
\]
\[
8v - 6t = -48 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}

Simplifying:
\[

Now, solve Equations 4 and 5 simultaneously:

Equation 5:
\[
t = 2v + 12 
\]

Substitute \( t = 2v + 12 \) into simplified Equation 4:
\[
4v - 3(2v + 12) = -24

\[
4v - 6v - 36 = -24

\[
-2v = 12

There's an error here, so revert and check:
Solving the equations correctly, an error in previous simplification attempt:

Equation 4:

2236,"Faye's team won their baseball game and scored sixty-eight points total. If Faye scored twenty-eight of the points and everyone else scored eight points each, how many players were on her team?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we start by understanding the total points scored by Faye's team and how these points were distributed among the players.

1. **Total Points Scored by the Team**: 68 points.
2. **Points Scored by Faye**: 28 points.

First, we calculate how many points were scored by the rest of the team:

\[ 
\text{Points scored by the rest of the team} = \text{Total points scored by the team} - \text{Points scored by Faye} 
\]

\[ 
= 68 - 28 
\]

\[ 
= 40 
\]

Next, we know that each of the other players scored 8 points each. Let \( x \) represent the number of other players.

\[ 
8x = 40 
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 8:

\[ 
x = \frac{40}{8} 
\]

\[ 
x = 5 
\]

The 5 represents the other players on the team. Including Faye, the total number of players on the team would be:

\[ 
\text{Total players} = x + 1 = 5 + 1 
\]

\[ 
= 6 
\]

Thus, the total number of players on Faye's team is {6}."
791,"There are 32 students in the class. The teacher divided them into 5 equal groups. How many students are there in each group?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine how many students are in each group, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

1. Start with the total number of students: 32.
2. The teacher divides them into 5 equal groups.

Now, perform the division:

\[ 32 \div 5 = 6.4 \]

Since 6.4 is not a whole number, it indicates that it's not possible to divide 32 students into 5 equal groups without having some students left over or dividing a student, which is not possible in practical terms.

Each of the 5 groups would have 6 students, with 2 students remaining, because:

- \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- \( 32 - 30 = 2 \) students would be left over.

Therefore, it's not possible to divide the 32 students into 5 equal groups consistently without remainders. With the given condition of ""equal groups,"" the division results in groups of 6 students each with 2 students left over ungrouped.

In conclusion, the problem will have these equally-sized groups: \(6\) students per group and 2 students left. Or informally for equal size groups: {6} students in each."

149,"Mrs. Hilt spent 1 hour and 30 minutes shoveling snow on Saturday morning and 45 minutes shoveling snow on Saturday afternoon. How much total time did she spend shoveling snow?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine the total time Mrs. Hilt spent shoveling snow, we need to add the time she shoveled in the morning and the time she shoveled in the afternoon.

1. In the morning, she shoveled snow for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
2. In the afternoon, she spent 45 minutes shoveling snow.

To add these times together, it's helpful to convert everything to a single unit, such as minutes.

- 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes. Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is:
  \[
  1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
  \]
  \[
  60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- The afternoon time is already in minutes, which is 45 minutes.

Now, add the two amounts together:
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 45 \text{ minutes} = 135 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, Mrs. Hilt spent a total of 135 minutes shoveling snow. To express this in hours and minutes:

- 135 minutes can be divided by 60 (since 60 minutes equals 1 hour):
  \[
  \text{135 divided by 60 equals 2 with a remainder of 15}
  \]
  This means she shoveled for 2 hours and 15 minutes in total.

Thus, the total time spent shoveling snow is \{2 hours and 15 minutes\}."
1472,"The second angle of a triangle is three times the first, and the third is 12 degrees less than twice the first. Find the measures of the angles.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","Let the measure of the first angle be \( x \) degrees.

According to the problem, the second angle is three times the first angle, so it can be expressed as \( 3x \).

The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first angle, so it can be expressed as \( 2x - 12 \).

In a triangle, the sum of the angles is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 3x + (2x - 12) = 180 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ x + 3x + 2x - 12 = 180 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6x - 12 = 180 \]

Add 12 to both sides:

\[ 6x = 192 \]

Divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 32 \]

Now, we can find the measures of the three angles:

1. The first angle is \( x = 32 \) degrees.
2. The second angle is \( 3x = 3 \times 32 = 96 \) degrees.
3. The third angle is \( 2x - 12 = 2 \times 32 - 12 = 64 - 12 = 52 \) degrees.

Thus, the measures of the angles are:

- First angle: 32 degrees
- Second angle: 96 degrees
- Third angle: 52 degrees

Final answer: \{32, 96, 52\}"

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples in the first and third bags together. Let's define:

- \( x \) as the number of apples in the first bag,
- \( y \) as the number of apples in the second bag,
- \( z \) as the number of apples in the third bag.

We are given the following equations based on the problem statement:

1. \( x + y + z = 24 \)  (total number of apples is 24),
2. \( x + y = 11 \)  (the first and second bags contain 11 apples),
3. \( y + z = 18 \)  (the second and third bags contain 18 apples).

We need to find the sum \( x + z \).

**Step-by-step solution:**

First, let's use equations 2 and 3:

\[
x + y = 11
\]

\[
y + z = 18
\]

We subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( y \):

\[
(y + z) - (x + y) = 18 - 11
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
z - x = 7
\]

So, we have the equation:

\[
z = x + 7
\]

Now, substitute \( z = x + 7 \) into the total apples equation \( x + y + z = 24 \):

\[
x + y + (x + 7) = 24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + y + 7 = 24
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
2x + y = 17
\]

Now, we have the system of equations:

1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 17 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second to solve for \( x \):

\[
(2x + y) - (x + y) = 17 - 11
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), substitute it back into the equation \( x + y = 11 \):

\[
6 + y = 11
\]

Solve for \( y \):

\[
y = 5
\]

Now, using \( z = x + 7 \):

\[
z = 6 + 7 = 13
\]

Finally, calculate \( x + z \):

\[
x + z = 6 + 13 = 19
\]

Thus, the number of apples in the first and third bags together is \(\boxed{19}\).

Final answer: \(\{19\}\)"
2049,"By coincidence, Luther's Paint Supplies sold equal quantities of two paint colors yesterday: yellow and blue. All yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers while blue paint is sold in containers of 19 liter. What is the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest amounts of yellow and blue paints sold such that the total quantity of both paints is equal.

Given that:

- Yellow paint is sold in 2-liter containers.
- Blue paint is sold in 19-liter containers.

Let's denote:
- \( y \) as the number of yellow paint containers.
- \( b \) as the number of blue paint containers.

Each yellow paint container is 2 liters, so the total quantity of yellow paint is \( 2y \) liters.
Each blue paint container is 19 liters, so the total quantity of blue paint is \( 19b \) liters.

We need \( 2y = 19b \).

Since we're looking for the smallest must-have sold amounts of yellow and blue, we need the smallest positive integers \( y \) and \( b \) that satisfy this equation.

Thus, \( y \) and \( b \) must be multiples of the smallest common multiple of the coefficients 2 and 19. 

The lowest common multiple of 2 and 19 is simply their product, as 19 is a prime number not dividing any smaller numbers, giving 38.

So, let’s set \( 2y = 38 \) and \( 19b = 38 \):
- \( y = 38 / 2 = 19 \)
- \( b = 38 / 19 = 2 \)

Thus, the smallest quantities sold in terms of containers are:
- 19 yellow paint containers.
- 2 blue paint containers.

This results in equal total volumes: \( 2 \times 19= 38 \) liters for both colors.

Therefore, the store must have sold at least 38 liters of each color.

The concise form of the answer is: {38}."

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To find out how much Mr. Brown and his son each had, let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the amount of money Mr. Brown's son had.
- Then Mr. Brown had \( 10x \) because he had 10 times as much as his son.

According to the problem, together they had $220. Therefore, we can express their total as:

\[ x + 10x = 220 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 11x = 220 \]

To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ x = \frac{220}{11} \]

\[ x = 20 \]

So, Mr. Brown's son had $20.

Since Mr. Brown had 10 times that amount:

\[ 10x = 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

So, Mr. Brown had $200.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine when P and Q will meet again at the starting point, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their round completion times. This is because the LCM will be the earliest time at which both P and Q have completed an integer number of laps, ensuring they meet at the starting point again.

P completes one round in 252 seconds.

Q completes one round in 198 seconds.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**

1. Factorize 252:
   - 252 is divisible by 2: 252 ÷ 2 = 126
   - 126 is divisible by 2: 126 ÷ 2 = 63
   - 63 is divisible by 3: 63 ÷ 3 = 21
   - 21 is divisible by 3: 21 ÷ 3 = 7
   - 7 is a prime number.
   - Prime factors of 252: \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7\)

2. Factorize 198:
   - 198 is divisible by 2: 198 ÷ 2 = 99
   - 99 is divisible by 3: 99 ÷ 3 = 33
   - 33 is divisible by 3: 33 ÷ 3 = 11
   - 11 is a prime number.
   - Prime factors of 198: \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 11\)

**Step 2: Find the LCM**

To find the LCM, take the highest power of each prime number from the factorizations:

- Highest power of 2: \(2^2\)
- Highest power of 3: \(3^2\)
- Highest power of 7: \(7^1\)
- Highest power of 11: \(11^1\)

LCM = \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \times 11\)

**Step 3: Calculate the LCM**

LCM = \(4 \times 9 \times 7 \times 11\)

- First calculate \(4 \times 9 = 36\)
- Then \(36 \times 7 = 252\)
- Finally \(252 \times 11\)

252 multiplied by 11:
\[
252 \times 11 = 2772

1069,"Last year, Springtown Hardware ordered 3 hammers in June, 4 hammers in July, 6 hammers in August, and 9 hammers in September. If this pattern continues, how many hammers will the store order in October?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the number of hammers ordered each month. Let's analyze the given data:

- June: 3 hammers
- July: 4 hammers
- August: 6 hammers
- September: 9 hammers

Now, let's look at the differences between the number of hammers ordered each month:

- From June to July: 4 - 3 = 1
- From July to August: 6 - 4 = 2
- From August to September: 9 - 6 = 3

The differences between consecutive months form the sequence: 1, 2, 3. This indicates that the differences between months are increasing by 1 each month.

Given this pattern, let's predict the number of hammers for October:

- The difference from September to October will be 3 + 1 = 4
- Therefore, the number of hammers ordered in October is 9 (from September) + 4 = 13

Thus, the store will order {13} hammers in October."
754,"A washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day. If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many washing machines are required to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day and then how many pounds the washing machine that isn't fully loaded washes per day.

First, we calculate the number of full loads that can be handled by washing machines:

1. A single washing machine can wash 28 pounds per day.
2. Total clothes to be washed: 200 pounds per day.

Now, determine the number of full washing machines:

1. Divide the total weight of clothes by the capacity of one washing machine:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{28 \text{ pounds/machine}} \approx 7.14
   \]

This result implies we need more than 7 machines but less than 8 machines (since the outcome is not a whole number).

2. Since we can't have a fraction of a machine operating, round up to the nearest whole number for the number of machines, which is 8 machines. These 8 machines can handle more than 200 pounds since:
   \[
   8 \times 28 = 224 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. Now calculate how much work the 8th machine actually needs to do to reach exactly 200 pounds. If 7 machines operate fully:
   \[
   7 \times 28 = 196 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the remaining clothes that the 8th machine needs to wash are:
   \[
   200 - 196 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the washing machine that isn't fully loaded washes 4 pounds of clothes per day.

1384,"Benny sold half of his comic books and then bought 6 more. He now has 17. How many did he begin with ?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","Let's denote the number of comic books Benny initially had as \( x \).

1. Benny sold half of his comic books. Therefore, he had \( \frac{x}{2} \) left after selling half.
2. Then, he bought 6 more comic books. So now he has \( \frac{x}{2} + 6 \) comic books.
3. According to the problem, Benny now has 17 comic books.

So we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{2} + 6 = 17
\]

4. To solve for \( x \), start by subtracting 6 from both sides:
\[
\frac{x}{2} = 11
\]

5. Next, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 22
\]

Thus, Benny initially had 22 comic books.

2238,"For Halloween Bianca received seventeen pieces of candy. She ate two pieces then placed the rest into piles with three in each pile. How many piles could she make?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of pieces of candy Bianca received: 17 pieces.

2. Subtract the 2 pieces of candy that Bianca ate:
   \[
   17 - 2 = 15
   \]

3. Now Bianca has 15 pieces of candy remaining.

4. We need to determine how many piles Bianca can make if each pile contains 3 pieces. To do this, we divide the remaining number of candies by the number of candies per pile:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]

5. This division tells us that Bianca can make 5 piles of candy, with each pile containing 3 pieces.

Thus, the number of piles Bianca can make is \{5\}."
1536,"At the carnival, nine friends bought eight hundred sixty-five tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To find out how many more tickets they need to buy so that each of the nine friends gets the same amount, we should follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of tickets they want to distribute evenly.**  
   The friends want to evenly distribute a number of tickets such that each of the 9 friends receives the same whole number of tickets.

2. **Calculate the number of tickets each friend would receive without buying more tickets.**  
   Divide the existing tickets by the number of friends:  
   \[
   \text{Tickets per friend} = \frac{865}{9}
   \]

3. **Perform the division to find the quotient and remainder.**  
   When you divide 865 by 9:  
   \[
   865 \div 9 = 96 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
   \]  
   This means each friend would get 96 tickets, and there would be 1 ticket left over.

4. **Determine how many more tickets are needed for each friend to receive an equal and whole number of tickets.**  
   Since we want no remainder, we need to increase the total number of tickets so it becomes a multiple of 9.

5. **Calculate the next multiple of 9 that is greater than 865.**  
   The current situation gives us \(865 + 1 = 866\) as a leftover required to reach the next multiple of 9.  
   However, the required number of tickets to reach the next full quota would be \(9 - 1 = 8\) (since adding this to the existing remainder will make 9).

6. **Add the difference (8 tickets) to balance the distribution perfectly.**  
   Therefore, they need to buy 8 more tickets.

The concise form of the final answer, representing the additional number of tickets they need to buy, is:  
\[
\boxed{\{8\}}

768,"If Tom plans to fix 158 watches at the rate of 12 watches per day, how many watches will he fix on the last day?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine how many watches Tom will fix on the last day, we need to first figure out how many full days he will work and how many watches will be left for him to fix on the last day.

1. **Calculate the Number of Full Days:**
   Tom fixes 12 watches per day. To find out how many full days he will work, divide the total number of watches by his daily rate:

   \[
   \text{Full days} = \left\lfloor \frac{158}{12} \right\rfloor
   \]

   \( \frac{158}{12} \approx 13.1667 \)

   The whole number part is 13 full days.

2. **Calculate the Total Watches Fixed in Full Days:**
   Multiply the full days by the number of watches he fixes per day:

   \[
   13 \times 12 = 156 \text{ watches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Remaining Watches (for the Last Day):**
   Subtract the watches fixed in full days from the total number of watches:

   \[
   158 - 156 = 2 \text{ watches}
   \]

Given these calculations, Tom will fix 2 watches on the last day.

The number of watches Tom will fix on the last day is \({2}\)."

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To find the height of the right-angled triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle. The area \( A \) of a right-angled triangle is given by:

\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

We are given:
- The area \( A = 32 \, \text{sq. cm} \)
- The base \( \text{base} = 8 \, \text{cm} \)

We need to find the height \( \text{height} \).

Substituting the known values into the area formula:

\[ 
32 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times \text{height} 
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 
32 = 4 \times \text{height}

Solve for the height by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ 
\text{height} = \frac{32}{4}

1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to introduce some variables and set up equations based on the word problem.

Let's use:
- \( d \) for the distance covered by the man,
- \( s \) for the original speed of the man in km/hr.

According to the problem, we can set up the following relationships:

1. **Normal Scenario:**
   \[
   \text{Time taken} = \frac{d}{s}
   \]

2. **Faster Scenario:**
   - Speed is \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/hr,
   - Time taken is 1 hour less:
   \[
   \frac{d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{d}{s} - 1
   \]

3. **Slower Scenario:**
   - Speed is \( s - 1 \) km/hr,
   - Time taken is 3 hours more:
   \[
   \frac{d}{s - 1} = \frac{d}{s} + 3
   \]

We now have two equations:
- Equation 1:
  \[
  \frac{d}{s + \frac{1}{2}} - \frac{d}{s} = -1
  \]
  By clearing fractions, this becomes:
  \[
  ds - d(s + \frac{1}{2}) = -s(s + \frac{1}{2})
  \]
  \[
  -\frac{d}{2} = -s(\frac{1}{2})
  \]
  \[
  d = s
  \]

- Equation 2:
  \[
  \frac{d}{s - 1} - \frac{d}{s} = 3
  \]
  By clearing fractions, this becomes:
  \[
  (ds - d(s - 1)) = 3s(s - 1)
  \]
  \[
  d = s - 1 + 3 \cdot s - 3
  \]
  \[
  d = 4s - 3
  \]

Using the fact that \( d = s \) from Equation 1, substitute \( d = s \) into Equation 2:
\[
s = 4s - 3
\]
\[
3s = 3
\]
\[
s = 1
\]

Now substitute \( s = 1 \) back to Equation 1, \( d = s \):
\[
d = 1
\]

Thus, the distance covered is 4 km and the original rate of walking is 2 km/hr.

","To solve this problem, let's:

1. Define the variables:
   - Let B's age be \( b \).
   - Then A's age will be \( b + 2 \) because A is two years older than B.
   - Let C's age be \( c \).

2. Establish the given relationships:
   - D's age is twice A's age, so:
     \[
     D = 2(b + 2)
     \]
   - B is twice as old as C, so:
     \[
     b = 2c
     \]
   - The ages of D and C differ by 40 years, so:
     \[
     D - c = 40
     \]

3. Substitute the expression for \( D \) into the equation:
   \[
   2(b + 2) - c = 40
   \]

4. Substitute \( b = 2c \) into the equation:
   \[
   2(2c + 2) - c = 40
   \]

5. Simplify and solve for \( c \):
   - Expand:

We know from the problem that:
- The width of the woods is 8 miles.
- The area of the woods is 24 square miles.

Substituting these values into the area formula gives:
\[ 24 = 8 \times \text{length} \]

To find the length, we need to solve for the 'length' by dividing both sides of the equation by the width (which is 8):

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we'll let the first angle be \( x \).

1. **Establish expressions for the other angles:**

   - The second angle is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle. So, the second angle can be written as:
     \[
     3x - 32
     \]

   - The third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle. So, the third angle is:
     \[
     2x - 28
     \]

2. **Use the triangle angle sum property:**

   The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we set up the equation:

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to remember that supplementary angles sum up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smaller angle \( x \). Then, the larger angle will be \( x + 18 \) since it exceeds the smaller angle by 18 degrees.

The equation to express the fact that they are supplementary angles is:

\[ x + (x + 18) = 180 \]

Simplify this equation:

\[ 2x + 18 = 180 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):

\[ 2x = 162 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 81 \]

So, the smaller angle is 81 degrees. The larger angle, being 18 degrees more than the smaller, is:

979,"An event has 12 adults and 20 children. The event planner wants to make each table identical, with the same combination of adults and children and no people left over. What is the greatest number of tables the planner can set up?

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To find the greatest number of identical tables with no people left over, the event planner needs to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of adults (12) and the number of children (20). The GCD will give the largest number of tables that can be set up with an equal number of adults and children at each table.

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of each number.

- The prime factorization of 12 is:
  \[
  12 = 2^2 \times 3
  \]

- The prime factorization of 20 is:
  \[
  20 = 2^2 \times 5

Step 2: Identify the common factors from the factorizations.

- The common prime factor between 12 and 20 is \(2\), and the lowest power of 2 is \(2^2\).

Step 3: Calculate the GCD.

- The GCD is the product of all common factors using the lowest power: 
  \[
  \text{GCD} = 2^2 = 4
  \]

Thus, the greatest number of tables the planner can set up is 4. With 4 tables, each table would have:
- \( \frac{12}{4} = 3\) adults
- \( \frac{20}{4} = 5\) children

Therefore, the answer is \(\{4\}\)."

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to determine the greatest number of teams that can be formed such that each team has the same combination of male and female students, and all students are included without anyone being left out.

Given:
- Total male students = 14
- Total female students = 7

We are looking for the greatest number of teams that can be formed, which means we should look for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of male and female students. The GCD will give us the maximum number of teams possible where each team has the same number of male and female students.

1. **Find the GCD of 14 and 7:**

   - Prime factorization of 14: \( 14 = 2 \times 7 \)
   - Prime factorization of 7: \( 7 = 7 \) (since 7 is a prime number)

   The common prime factor is 7.

2. **Calculate the greatest number of teams:** 

   The GCD of 14 and 7 is 7. This means that we can form a maximum of 7 teams because 7 is the largest number that evenly divides both 14 (number of male students) and 7 (number of female students).

3. **Determine the composition of each team:** 

   - If there are 7 teams, divide the total number of students by the number of teams: 
     - Male students per team = \( \frac{14}{7} = 2 \)
     - Female students per team = \( \frac{7}{7} = 1 \)

Thus, each team will consist of 2 male students and 1 female student, with all students distributed evenly across the 7 teams.

The greatest number of teams that can be formed is \(\boxed{7}\).

   - From the second row to the third row, the number of plants doubles again: 8 to 16.
   - This doubling continues for each subsequent row.

3. Therefore, the number of tomato plants in each row \( n \) can be represented by the formula:

   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = 4 \times 2^{(n-1)}
   \]

   where \( n \) is the row number.

4. Calculate the number of plants in the sixth row (\( n = 6 \)):

   F + 0.5F + R + R = 327
   \]

   Simplifying the second equation, we get:

   \[
   1.5F + 2R = 327
   \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( F + R = 216 \)
2. \( 1.5F + 2R = 327 \)

To solve this system, we begin by solving the first equation for \( R \):

\[
R = 216 - F
\]

Next, substitute \( R \) in the second equation:

\[
1.5F + 2(216 - F) = 327
\]

Expand and simplify:

\[
1.5F + 432 - 2F = 327
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
-0.5F + 432 = 327
\]

Subtract 432 from both sides:

\[
-0.5F = 327 - 432
\]

\[
-0.5F = -105
\]

Divide by -0.5 to solve for \( F \):

\[
F = 210
\]

Using the value of \( F \) in the equation \( R = 216 - F \):

\[
R = 216 - 210
\]

\[
R = 6
\]

Thus, the basic first class full fare is \( 210 \), and the reservation charge is \( 6 \).

The final answer is \(\{210, 6\}\)."

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine how many school vans are needed to transport 554 students, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem:** We have a total of 554 students and each van can hold 9 students. We need to find out how many vans are required to transport all the students.

2. **Division for total vans:** First, we divide the total number of students by the capacity of each van to calculate how many full vans are needed:

   \[
   \frac{554}{9} = 61.555\ldots
   \]

3. **Whole number of full vans:** Since a van can’t carry a fraction of a student, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. The result of the division, 61.555... indicates that 61 vans will not be enough because more than half a van (0.555...) worth of students will remain, which means at least one more full van is necessary.

4. **Rounding up:** Therefore, we need to use 62 vans in total to ensure all students are accommodated.

5. **Verification:** With 62 vans, the capacity is:

   \[
   62 \times 9 = 558 \text{ students}

1422,"In a two digit number, the sum of the two digits is 9. If the digits are reversed , the number is increased by 9. Find the number.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","Let's define the two-digit number as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. We have two conditions given in the problem:

1. The sum of the digits is 9:
   \[
   a + b = 9
   \]

2. If the digits are reversed, the number increases by 9:
   \[
   10b + a = 10a + b + 9
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

**Step 1: Simplify the second condition equation**

Rearrange the equation from condition 2 to isolate the terms involving \( a \) and \( b \):
\[
10b + a = 10a + b + 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 10b - b = 10a - a + 9
\]
\[
9b = 9a + 9
\]

**Step 2: Divide the whole equation by 9**

To simplify further, divide the whole equation by 9:
\[
b = a + 1
\]

**Step 3: Substitute into the first condition**

Now substitute \( b = a + 1 \) into the first condition equation:
\[
a + (a + 1) = 9
\]
\[
2a + 1 = 9
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( a \)**

Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the term with \( a \):
\[
2a = 8
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
a = 4
\]

**Step 5: Find \( b \) using the relationship \( b = a + 1 \)**

Substitute \( a = 4 \) back into the equation \( b = a + 1 \):
\[
b = 4 + 1 = 5
\]

**Conclusion: Construct the original number**

The original number is:
\[
10a + b = 10 \times 4 + 5 = 40 + 5 = 45
\]

Thus, the two-digit number is \(\boxed{45}\).

The complete solution to the problem gives us the number in the final form:

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine the measures of the angles in this triangle, we need to consider the following facts and steps:

1. **Understand the properties of a triangle:** The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.

2. **Set variables for the angles:** Let’s denote the measures of the two identical angles as \( x \).
   
3. **Express the third angle:** The problem states that the third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Therefore, the measure of the third angle can be expressed as \( x - 12 \).

4. **Set up the equation for the angles:** Since the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + x + (x - 12) = 180
   \]
   Simplifying this equation gives:
   \[
   3x - 12 = 180
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):** Add 12 to both sides of the equation to isolate the terms with \( x \):
   \[
   3x = 192
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine the total number of items Mrs. Heine will buy, you can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Heart biscuits**: Mrs. Heine wants to buy 5 heart biscuits for each dog. Since she has 2 dogs, she needs to buy:
   \[
   5 \text{ biscuits/dog} \times 2 \text{ dogs} = 10 \text{ heart biscuits}
   \]

2. **Puppy boots**: She wants to buy a set of puppy boots for each dog. Assuming ""1 set of puppy boots"" means one complete set per dog, she will need:
   \[
   1 \text{ set/dog} \times 2 \text{ dogs} = 2 \text{ sets of puppy boots}
   \]

3. **Total items**: Combine the number of heart biscuits and sets of puppy boots to find the total number of items:
   \[
   10 \text{ heart biscuits} + 2 \text{ sets of puppy boots} = 12 \text{ items}
   \]

Thus, the total number of items Mrs. Heine will buy is \(\{12\}\)."
