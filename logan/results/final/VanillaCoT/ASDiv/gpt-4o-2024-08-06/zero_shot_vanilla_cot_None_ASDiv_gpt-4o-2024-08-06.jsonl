Each child should receive 16 lollipops for it to be evenly distributed since \\( \\frac{42 \\times 16}{42} = 16 \\).\n\n5. Calculate the total number of lollipops needed for every child to receive 16:\n   \\[\n   16 \\times 42 = 672\n   \\]\n   Therefore, 672 lollipops are needed in total to give 16 lollipops to each child.\n\n6.

We have two types of barrels: large barrels that hold 6 tons each and small barrels that hold 5 tons each.\n\nLet's think through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Determine the Maximum Number of Large Barrels:**\n   - Large barrels hold 6 tons each. So, if we use only large barrels, the number of barrels required to hold 95 tons is 95 / 6 = 15 with a remainder of 5. This means 15 large barrels will hold 90 tons (15 x 6 = 90), leaving 5 tons that need to be filled by another barrel.\n\n2. **Determine the Usage of Small Barrels:**\n   - Since the remainder is 5 tons, which perfectly fits into one small barrel, we can use 1 small barrel to accommodate these remaining 5 tons.\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Barrels:**\n   - Using 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel fully occupies the 95 tons of oil. \n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - With 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel, the total capacity is:\n     \\(15 \\times 6\\) tons from large barrels = 90 tons.\n     \\(1 \\times 5\\) tons from the small barrel = 5 tons.\n     Total = 90 + 5 = 95 tons.\n   - This confirms the entire 95 tons are perfectly distributed using 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - To minimize the total number of barrels used and ensure every barrel is fully occupied, you should use 1 small barrel.\n\nTherefore, the number of small barrels to be used is \\(\\{1\\}\\).", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 101, "completion_tokens": 384, "total_tokens": 485, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}
