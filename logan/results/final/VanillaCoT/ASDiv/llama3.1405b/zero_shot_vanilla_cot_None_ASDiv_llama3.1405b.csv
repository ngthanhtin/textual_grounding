1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let my current age be 'M' and my son's current age be 'S'.

2. Five years ago, I was 'M - 5' years old, and my son was 'S - 5' years old.

3. According to the problem, five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son. So, we can write the equation:
   M - 5 = 3(S - 5)
   M - 5 = 3S - 15
   M = 3S - 10

4. Ten years later, I will be 'M + 10' years old, and my son will be 'S + 10' years old.

5. According to the problem, ten years later, I will be twice as old as my son. So, we can write the equation:
   M + 10 = 2(S + 10)
   M + 10 = 2S + 20
   M = 2S + 10

6. Now we have two equations:
   M = 3S - 10 ... (1)
   M = 2S + 10 ... (2)

7. Equating the two equations, we get:
   3S - 10 = 2S + 10
   3S - 2S = 10 + 10
   S = 20

8. Now that we know my son's current age, we can find my current age using equation (1):
   M = 3S - 10
   M = 3(20) - 10
   M = 60 - 10
   M = 50

So, my current age is 50, and my son's current age is 20.

1502,A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?,"To find the area of the border, we need to find the area of the entire room and subtract the area of the carpet.

1. Find the area of the entire room:
   Room length (L) = 12 feet
   Room width (W) = 10 feet
   Area of room = L * W = 12 * 10 = 120 square feet

2. Find the dimensions of the carpet:
   Since the border is 2 feet wide all around, we subtract 2 feet from the length and width of the room twice (once for each side).
   Carpet length = Room length - 2 * 2 = 12 - 4 = 8 feet
   Carpet width = Room width - 2 * 2 = 10 - 4 = 6 feet

3. Find the area of the carpet:
   Area of carpet = Carpet length * Carpet width = 8 * 6 = 48 square feet

4. Find the area of the border:

163 ÷ 84 = 1.94

Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This is because even if the shelf isn't full, we still need a whole shelf to hold the remaining games.

Rounding up 1.94 to the nearest whole number gives us 2.

So, the store would need approximately 2 shelves to hold all 163 video games.

For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","To find the charge for a 25 km journey, we need to determine the fixed charge and the charge per km.

Let's denote the fixed charge as F and the charge per km as C.

We are given two sets of information:

1. For a 10 km journey, the charge is $75.
   F + 10C = 75

2. For a 15 km journey, the charge is $110.
   F + 15C = 110

Now, we can solve these two equations to find the values of F and C.

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
(F + 15C) - (F + 10C) = 110 - 75
5C = 35

Dividing both sides by 5:
C = 7

Now that we know the charge per km (C), we can substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the fixed charge (F).

Using the first equation:
F + 10C = 75
F + 10(7) = 75
F + 70 = 75
F = 5

Now that we know the fixed charge (F) and the charge per km (C), we can calculate the charge for a 25 km journey.

Charge = F + 25C
= 5 + 25(7)
= 5 + 175
= 180

So, the person will have to pay $180 for traveling a distance of 25 km.

902,Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together. How much more does Annette weigh than Sara?,"To find out how much more Annette weighs than Sara, we need to first find their individual weights.

Let's denote Annette's weight as A, Caitlin's weight as C, and Sara's weight as S.

From the given information, we have two equations:

1. A + C = 95
2. C + S = 87

We can rearrange equation 2 to isolate C:
C = 87 - S

Now, substitute this expression for C into equation 1:
A + (87 - S) = 95

Combine like terms:
A - S = 95 - 87
A - S = 8

This equation tells us that Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara.

We know that the total capital is $7500, so we can write the equation:
J + M = 7500

We also know that Jamal furnished half as much capital as Moshe, so we can write the equation:
J = (1/2)M

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

Combine like terms:
(3/2)M = 7500

Multiply both sides by 2/3:
M = 7500 * (2/3)
M = 5000

Now that we know M, we can find J:
J = (1/2)M

At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. What is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?","To find the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 9.

Let's denote the number of bowls Sam made as 's' and the number of bowls Carlos made as 'c'. Since Sam knocks down 8 pins per bowl and Carlos knocks down 9 pins per bowl, the total number of pins they knocked down can be represented as:

8s = 9c

We want to find the smallest values of 's' and 'c' that satisfy this equation. To do this, we can find the LCM of 8 and 9.

The multiples of 8 are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, ...
The multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, ...

The first number that appears in both lists is 72. Therefore, the LCM of 8 and 9 is 72.

Now, we can set up the equation:

8s = 9c = 72

To find the values of 's' and 'c', we can divide both sides of the equation by 8 and 9, respectively:

s = 72 / 8 = 9
c = 72 / 9 = 8

So, Sam made 9 bowls and Carlos made 8 bowls. The total number of pins they each knocked down is 72.

1457,The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than the first. Find the three angles.,"To find the three angles of the triangle, let's denote the first angle as x.

Since the second angle is double the first, the second angle is 2x.

The third angle is 40 less than the first, so the third angle is x - 40.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + (x - 40) = 180

Combine like terms:

4x - 40 = 180

Add 40 to both sides:

4x = 220

Divide by 4:

x = 55

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the other two angles:

First angle: x = 55
Second angle: 2x = 2(55) = 110
Third angle: x - 40 = 55 - 40 = 15

So, the three angles are 55, 110, and 15.

1248,Jawbreakers come in packages of 8. Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers. How many Jawbreakers does she have left?,"To find out how many Jawbreakers Sarah has left, we first need to know how many she started with. Since Jawbreakers come in packages of 8, we can assume she bought a certain number of packages.

Let's say Sarah bought x packages of Jawbreakers. Then, the total number of Jawbreakers she had initially is 8x.

We know that Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers. To find out how many she has left, we need to subtract 20 from the initial number of Jawbreakers:

Number of Jawbreakers left = Initial number of Jawbreakers - Number of Jawbreakers eaten
= 8x - 20

However, we don't know the exact value of x (the number of packages Sarah bought). Since we can't determine the exact number of Jawbreakers she had initially, we can't find the exact number of Jawbreakers she has left.

But we can express the condition that she must have bought at least 3 packages (since 2 packages would only have 16 Jawbreakers, which is less than the 20 she ate).

If she bought exactly 3 packages, she would have had 24 Jawbreakers initially (3 * 8 = 24). After eating 20, she would have:

Number of Jawbreakers left = 24 - 20
= 4

So, if Sarah bought exactly 3 packages, she would have 4 Jawbreakers left.

First, we know that Virginia gave an equal number of Sweettarts to her 4 friends. To find out how many she gave to each friend, we need to divide the total number of Sweettarts (excluding the ones she ate) by 4. However, we don't know how many she ate yet.

Let's assume the number of Sweettarts she gave to each friend is x. Since she has 4 friends, the total number of Sweettarts she gave away is 4x.

We know that the total number of Sweettarts is 13. Since Virginia ate what was left after giving some to her friends, the number of Sweettarts she ate is 13 - 4x.

Since Virginia also ate some Sweettarts, we need to include her in the total number of people. So, the total number of people is 5 (4 friends + Virginia).

Now, we know that the total number of Sweettarts is 13, and there are 5 people in total. To find out how many Sweettarts each person ate, we can divide 13 by 5.

However, we can't divide 13 evenly by 5, so we'll divide 13 by 5 to get 2 with a remainder of 3. This means each of the 5 people (including Virginia) gets 2 Sweettarts, and there are 3 Sweettarts left over.

Since we can't divide the remaining 3 Sweettarts evenly among the 5 people, and we know that Virginia ate what was left, we can assume that Virginia ate the remaining 3 Sweettarts in addition to her share of 2.

So, each of Virginia's friends ate 2 Sweettarts (their share), and Virginia ate 2 (her share) + 3 (the remainder) = 5 Sweettarts.

However, the question asks how many Sweettarts each person ate, assuming that Virginia and her friends ate an equal number initially, and then Virginia ate the remainder. In that case, we can say that initially, each person ate 2 Sweettarts, and then Virginia ate the remaining 3.

But to answer the question directly, we need to consider that the ""equal number"" refers to the initial sharing, not the final amount eaten. In that case, we can say that each person, including Virginia, initially got 2 Sweettarts.

Since Luke wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount, the total number of pieces must be even. 

The closest even number to 9 that is greater than 9 is 10. However, if Luke had 10 pieces, he would have 5 in each bag. 

To see if 10 is the minimum, let's try to see if we can get an even number by adding 1 to 9 to make 10. When we divide 10 by 2, we get 5, which is an integer. However, we added 1, and we need to see if there are other numbers that would work.

However, if we add another piece to make 11, 11 is not divisible by 2 evenly, so that won't work.

2272,Crackers come in packages of 18. Betty ate 45 crackers. How many crackers does she have left?,"To find out how many crackers Betty has left, we need to first determine how many packages of crackers she had. Since we know she ate 45 crackers and each package has 18 crackers, we can calculate the number of packages she had by dividing 45 by 18.

45 / 18 = 2.5

Since you can't have a fraction of a package, we can assume she had at least 3 packages (2 full packages would be 36 crackers, which is less than 45). 

3 packages would be 3 * 18 = 54 crackers.

Now, we subtract the number of crackers she ate (45) from the total number of crackers she had (54).

54 - 45 = 9

So, Betty has 9 crackers left.

How many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus?","To find out how many people were in the bus when Jose got on, we need to work backwards from the information given.

Let's start with the last event: 7 people got on and 15 people got off at the terminal station. Since we don't know the exact number of people at this point, let's represent it as x.

After 7 people got on and 15 people got off, the number of people is x - 8 (since 15 - 7 = 8).

Now, let's go back to the previous event: 5 people got on and 2 people got off. Before this event, the number of people was (x - 8) - 3 (since 5 - 2 = 3).

We can represent this as: x - 8 - 3 = x - 11.

However, we still don't know the value of x - 11. Since the question asks for the initial number of people when Jose got on the bus, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of people when Jose got on the bus.

However, if we let the number of people on the bus when Jose got on be y, we can represent the sequence of events as:

y -> y + 3 -> y + 3 - 8

Since we don't know the value of y, we can't provide a numerical answer.

However, if we had to provide an expression for y in terms of x, we could say y = x - 11 + 8 - 3 = x - 6.

1. Let the present age of Lewis be x and the present age of Brown be 2x, since their ages are in the ratio 1:2.

2. Three years from now, Lewis' age will be x + 3 and Brown's age will be 2x + 3.

3. According to the problem, three years from now, their ages will be in the ratio 3:5. We can set up the following equation:

   (x + 3) / (2x + 3) = 3/5

4. Cross-multiply to solve for x:

   5(x + 3) = 3(2x + 3)
   5x + 15 = 6x + 9
   15 - 9 = 6x - 5x
   6 = x

5. Now that we know x, we can find the present ages of Lewis and Brown:

   Lewis' present age = x = 6
   Brown's present age = 2x = 2(6) = 12

So, the present ages of Lewis and Brown are 6 and 12, respectively.

How much did each cost, if the bicycle cost 5 times as much as the helmet?","To find the cost of the bicycle and the helmet, let's denote the cost of the helmet as 'x'. Since the bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet, the cost of the bicycle is 5x.

The total cost of both the bicycle and the helmet is 240 dollars. We can write an equation to represent this:

x + 5x = 240

Combine like terms:

6x = 240

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for x:

x = 240 / 6
x = 40

So, the helmet costs 40 dollars. Since the bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet, the bicycle costs:

1. Total number of cookies = 292
2. Number of cookies per bag = 16

Now, let's divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag:

292 ÷ 16 = 18.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, this means that Edgar will have 18 full bags and 1 bag that is not full.

To find out how many cookies are in the bag that is not full, we need to multiply the number of full bags by the number of cookies per bag, and then subtract this from the total number of cookies:

1. Let's denote Tara's speed of rowing in still water as 'r' and the speed of the current as 'c'.

2. When Tara rows downstream, her speed is the sum of her speed in still water and the speed of the current. We know that she can row 20 km in 2 hours downstream, so her downstream speed is 20 km / 2 hours = 10 km/h.

   Downstream speed = r + c = 10 km/h

3. When Tara rows upstream, her speed is the difference between her speed in still water and the speed of the current. We know that she can row 4 km in 2 hours upstream, so her upstream speed is 4 km / 2 hours = 2 km/h.

   Upstream speed = r - c = 2 km/h

4. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for 'r' and 'c' by adding the two equations:

   (r + c) + (r - c) = 10 + 2
   2r = 12
   r = 6 km/h

5. Now that we have 'r', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'c'. We'll use the downstream equation:

   6 + c = 10
   c = 4 km/h

So, Tara's speed of rowing in still water is 6 km/h, and the speed of the current is 4 km/h.

1295,Ana is 5 years more than Jack. The sum of their ages is 29. Find the ages of Ana and Jack.,"To find the ages of Ana and Jack, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's represent Jack's age as 'J' and Ana's age as 'A'. We know Ana is 5 years more than Jack, so we can write an equation:
   A = J + 5

2. The sum of their ages is 29, so we can write another equation:
   A + J = 29

3. Now, we can substitute the expression for A from the first equation into the second equation:
   (J + 5) + J = 29

4. Combine like terms:
   2J + 5 = 29

5. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   2J = 24

6. Divide both sides by 2:
   J = 12

7. Now that we know Jack's age, we can find Ana's age by substituting J into the first equation:
   A = J + 5
   A = 12 + 5
   A = 17

So, Ana is 17 years old, and Jack is 12 years old.

{Ana = 17, Jack = 12}"
1435,A car goes uphill at the rate of 30 km an hour and downhill at the rate of 50 km an hour after 15 hours it has covered 650 km. How long did it go downhill and uphill respectively?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the time the car went uphill as 'u' hours and the time it went downhill as 'd' hours.

Given:
- Uphill speed = 30 km/h
- Downhill speed = 50 km/h
- Total time = 15 hours
- Total distance = 650 km

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. The total time equation: u + d = 15
2. The total distance equation: 30u + 50d = 650

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously. 

First, let's isolate 'u' in the total time equation:
u = 15 - d

Now, substitute 'u' in the total distance equation:
30(15 - d) + 50d = 650

Expand the equation:
450 - 30d + 50d = 650

Combine like terms:
20d = 200

Divide by 20:
d = 10

Now that we have 'd', we can find 'u' using the total time equation:
u = 15 - d
u = 15 - 10
u = 5

So, the car went uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours.

{5 hours uphill, 10 hours downhill}"
2071,"At the movie theatre, they give out a free drink to every 75th customer and a free bag of popcorn to every 30th customer. On Monday 3,000 customers came to the theatre. How many people received both free items?","To find out how many people received both free items, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 30. 

First, let's break down 75 and 30 into their prime factors:
- 75 = 3 * 5 * 5
- 30 = 2 * 3 * 5

Now, let's find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor:
- LCM = 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 = 150

So, every 150th customer will receive both a free drink and a free bag of popcorn.

To find out how many people received both free items on Monday, we can divide the total number of customers (3,000) by 150:
- 3,000 / 150 = 20

If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","To solve this problem, let's denote the uniform speed of the train as 's' km/hr and the scheduled time as 't' hours. The distance covered by the train is then 'd' = s * t.

If the train were 6 km/hr faster, its speed would be (s + 6) km/hr. The time taken to cover the same distance 'd' would be d / (s + 6). According to the problem, this time is 8 hours less than the scheduled time 't'. So, we can write:

d / (s + 6) = t - 8

Substituting d = s * t, we get:

s * t / (s + 6) = t - 8

Multiplying both sides by (s + 6), we get:

s * t = (t - 8) * (s + 6)

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

s * t = t * s + 6 * t - 8 * s - 48

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0 = 6 * t - 8 * s - 48

Now, let's consider the case where the train is slower by 6 km/hr. Its speed would be (s - 6) km/hr. The time taken to cover the same distance 'd' would be d / (s - 6). According to the problem, this time is 12 hours more than the scheduled time 't'. So, we can write:

d / (s - 6) = t + 12

Substituting d = s * t, we get:

s * t / (s - 6) = t + 12

Multiplying both sides by (s - 6), we get:

s * t = (t + 12) * (s - 6)

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

s * t = t * s - 6 * t + 12 * s - 72

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0 = -6 * t + 12 * s - 72

Now we have two equations:

6 * t - 8 * s = 48 ... (1)
-6 * t + 12 * s = 72 ... (2)

Adding equations (1) and (2), we get:

4 * s = 120

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

s = 30

Now, substituting s = 30 into equation (1), we get:

6 * t - 8 * 30 = 48

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6 * t = 48 + 240

6 * t = 288

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

t = 48

Now that we have the speed 's' and the scheduled time 't', we can find the distance 'd':

d = s * t
= 30 * 48
= 1440

So, the length of the journey is 1440 km.

The second angle is three times the first, so it's 3x.

The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first, so it's 2x - 12.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can set up the equation:

If she gave $175.00 to the first orphanage and $250.00 to the third, how much did she donate to the second orphanage?","To find out how much she donated to the second orphanage, we need to subtract the amounts she donated to the first and third orphanages from the total amount.

Total amount donated = $650.00
Amount donated to the first orphanage = $175.00
Amount donated to the third orphanage = $250.00

Total amount donated to the first and third orphanages = $175.00 + $250.00 = $425.00

Now, we subtract the total amount donated to the first and third orphanages from the total amount donated to find the amount donated to the second orphanage:

Amount donated to the second orphanage = Total amount donated - Total amount donated to the first and third orphanages

1. The cost of one box of cupcakes is $6.
2. To find out how many boxes you can buy, divide the total amount of money ($821) by the cost of one box ($6).
   $821 ÷ $6 = 136.83

Since you can't buy a fraction of a box, you can buy 136 boxes of cupcakes.

3. To find out the total cost of 136 boxes, multiply the number of boxes by the cost of one box.
   136 boxes * $6/box = $816

4. To find out how much money you would have left, subtract the total cost of the boxes from the initial amount of money.
   $821 - $816 = $5

2. He gives 18 pencils to a friend, so we subtract 18 from 39: 39 - 18 = 21 pencils.
3. Then, he buys 22 more pencils, so we add 22 to 21: 21 + 22 = 43 pencils.

Therefore, Brian now has 43 pencils.

Step 1: Identify the total amount of orange juice and the number of glasses.
Total amount of orange juice = 153 pints
Number of glasses = 5

Step 2: Divide the total amount of orange juice by the number of glasses.
Amount in each glass = Total amount of orange juice / Number of glasses
Amount in each glass = 153 / 5

Total number of people = 320

Now, we know that 156 of the people served are male. To find the number of females, we subtract the number of males from the total number of people.

Number of females = Total number of people - Number of males

Step 1: Calculate the total area covered by both groups.
Lizzie's group covered 250 square feet of land.
The other group covered 265 square feet of land.
Total area covered = 250 + 265 = 515 square feet.

Step 2: List the factors of 24 (yellow flowers): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
Step 3: Find the common factors: 1, 2, 4, 8
Step 4: Find the greatest common factor (GCD): 8

So, Sara can make 8 bouquets with 2 red flowers and 3 yellow flowers in each, but to have the same number of each color, she can make 8 bouquets with 2 flowers of each color (2 red and 2 yellow) and have some flowers left over. 

However, to use the greatest possible number of flowers in each bouquet and have the same number of each color, we should divide both 16 and 24 by the GCD (8). This will give us 2 red flowers and 3 yellow flowers in each bouquet. Since we want the same number of each color, we should use the lowest number of flowers we can have in each bouquet. 

2 red flowers and 2 yellow flowers in each bouquet is the best we can do to have the same number of each color and use the greatest possible number of flowers.

16 red flowers / 2 red flowers per bouquet = 8 bouquets
24 yellow flowers / 3 yellow flowers per bouquet does not work since we cannot have the same number of each color.
24 yellow flowers / 2 yellow flowers per bouquet = 12, but we only have 16 red flowers / 2 red flowers per bouquet = 8 bouquets.

904,Three paper bags contain a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples. How many apples are in the first and third bags together?,"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of apples in the first, second, and third bags as A, B, and C, respectively.

We are given the following information:
1. A + B + C = 24 (total apples in all three bags)
2. A + B = 11 (total apples in the first and second bags)
3. B + C = 18 (total apples in the second and third bags)

We need to find A + C (the total apples in the first and third bags).

From equation (2), we can express B as B = 11 - A.

From equation (3), we can express B as B = 18 - C.

Since both expressions represent B, we can set them equal to each other:
11 - A = 18 - C

Now, let's rearrange this equation to find A + C:
A + C = 11 + C - (18 - C)
A + C = 11 + C - 18 + C
A + C = 11 - 18 + 2C
A + C = -7 + 2C

However, we still need to find the value of C. We can use the fact that A + B + C = 24 and B + C = 18. Rearranging the second equation gives us C = 18 - B.

Substituting B = 11 - A (from equation 2) into C = 18 - B, we get:
C = 18 - (11 - A)
C = 18 - 11 + A
C = 7 + A

Now, substitute C = 7 + A into A + C = -7 + 2C:
A + C = -7 + 2(7 + A)
A + C = -7 + 14 + 2A
A + C = 7 + 2A

However, we still need to find A. We can use the fact that A + B = 11 and A + B + C = 24. Rearranging the first equation gives us A = 11 - B.

Substituting B = 18 - C (from equation 3) into A = 11 - B, we get:
A = 11 - (18 - C)
A = 11 - 18 + C
A = -7 + C

Now, substitute C = 7 + A into A = -7 + C:
A = -7 + (7 + A)
A = -7 + 7 + A
A = A

However, we can use A + B = 11 and B + C = 18 to find A + C. 
Rearranging A + B = 11 gives B = 11 - A. 
Substituting B = 11 - A into B + C = 18 gives (11 - A) + C = 18.
Rearranging gives C = 18 - 11 + A = 7 + A.

Substituting C = 7 + A into A + B + C = 24 gives A + B + (7 + A) = 24.
Substituting B = 11 - A into this gives A + (11 - A) + (7 + A) = 24.
So 18 + A = 24.
Rearranging gives A = 24 - 18 = 6.

Substituting A = 6 into A + B = 11 gives 6 + B = 11.
Rearranging gives B = 11 - 6 = 5.

Substituting B = 5 into B + C = 18 gives 5 + C = 18.
Rearranging gives C = 18 - 5 = 13.

Now we can find A + C:
A + C = 6 + 13
A + C = 19

Since 2 and 19 are relatively prime (i.e., they have no common factors), the LCM is simply their product: 2 * 19 = 38.

So, the store must have sold at least 38 liters of each color. Since yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers, the store must have sold 38 / 2 = 19 containers of yellow paint. Since blue paint comes in 19-liter containers, the store must have sold 38 / 19 = 2 containers of blue paint.

The smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold is 38 liters.

How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?,"To find the weight difference between a watermelon and a pineapple, we need to first find the weight of one watermelon and one pineapple.

The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. We can convert this to grams: 
5 kg = 5000 g
5000 g + 200 g = 5200 g

Now, we can find the weight of one watermelon:
Weight of 4 watermelons = 5200 g
Weight of 1 watermelon = 5200 g / 4 = 1300 g

The total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. We can convert this to grams:
5 kg = 5000 g
5000 g + 700 g = 5700 g

We already know the weight of 1 watermelon (1300 g), so we can find the weight of 3 watermelons:
Weight of 3 watermelons = 3 * 1300 g = 3900 g

Now, we can find the weight of 4 pineapples:
Weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples = 5700 g
Weight of 3 watermelons = 3900 g
Weight of 4 pineapples = 5700 g - 3900 g = 1800 g

Now, we can find the weight of one pineapple:
Weight of 4 pineapples = 1800 g
Weight of 1 pineapple = 1800 g / 4 = 450 g

Finally, we can find the weight difference between a watermelon and a pineapple:
Weight of 1 watermelon = 1300 g
Weight of 1 pineapple = 450 g
Weight difference = 1300 g - 450 g = 850 g

If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?","To find out how many washing machines are needed to wash 200 pounds of clothes per day, we need to divide the total amount of clothes by the capacity of one washing machine.

Number of washing machines = Total amount of clothes / Capacity of one washing machine

If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?","To find out how many tickets each friend would get, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends.

Total tickets = 865
Number of friends = 9

Tickets per friend = Total tickets / Number of friends
Tickets per friend = 865 / 9
Tickets per friend = 96.11 (approximately)

Since we can't divide tickets into fractions, we need to round down to the nearest whole number to find out how many tickets each friend can get. 

Tickets per friend = 96

Now, let's find out the total number of tickets the friends would have if each friend got 96 tickets.

Total tickets = Tickets per friend * Number of friends
Total tickets = 96 * 9
Total tickets = 864

The friends are short 1 ticket (865 - 864 = 1) to make it so each friend gets 96 tickets, but actually they need 1 more ticket so each friend can have 97 tickets,  so they need to buy more tickets to make the tickets per friend a whole number.

To make the tickets per friend a whole number, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 that is greater than 865. 

However, we can simply find the next multiple of 9 after 865.

Next multiple of 9 = 9 * 97
Next multiple of 9 = 873

1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Let's denote the original speed of the man as 's' km/hr and the distance covered as 'd' km.

We know that time = distance / speed. 

Let's denote the original time taken as 't' hours. Then, t = d / s.

If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, his new speed is s + 1/2 = s + 0.5 km/hr. The new time taken is t - 1 hours. 

We can write the equation: 
d / (s + 0.5) = t - 1

We can also write the original time equation as: 
d / s = t 

Substituting the value of t from the original time equation into the new time equation, we get: 
d / (s + 0.5) = d / s - 1

If he walks 1 km/hr slower, his new speed is s - 1 km/hr. The new time taken is t + 3 hours.

We can write the equation: 
d / (s - 1) = t + 3

Substituting the value of t from the original time equation into the new time equation, we get: 
d / (s - 1) = d / s + 3

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously.

From the first equation: 
d / (s + 0.5) = d / s - 1
d / (s + 0.5) - d / s = -1
d(s - (s + 0.5)) / (s(s + 0.5)) = -1
d(-0.5) / (s(s + 0.5)) = -1
-0.5d = -s(s + 0.5)
0.5d = s(s + 0.5)

From the second equation: 
d / (s - 1) = d / s + 3
d / (s - 1) - d / s = 3
d(s - (s - 1)) / (s(s - 1)) = 3
d(1) / (s(s - 1)) = 3
d = 3s(s - 1)

Now we can substitute the value of d from the second equation into the first equation:
0.5(3s(s - 1)) = s(s + 0.5)
1.5s(s - 1) = s(s + 0.5)
1.5s^2 - 1.5s = s^2 + 0.5s
0.5s^2 - 2s = 0
s(0.5s - 2) = 0

This gives us two possible values for s: s = 0 or s = 4.

Since s = 0 is not a valid speed, we take s = 4 km/hr as the original speed.

Now we can find the distance d:
d = 3s(s - 1)
d = 3(4)(4 - 1)
d = 3(4)(3)
d = 36 km

So, the distance covered by the man is 36 km and his original rate of walking is 4 km/hr.

1. Let's denote the age of B as x. Since A is two years older than B, A's age is x + 2.

2. We know that B is twice as old as his sister C, so C's age is x/2.

3. A's father D is twice as old as A, so D's age is 2(x + 2).

4. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years, so we can set up the equation:
   2(x + 2) - x/2 = 40

5. To solve for x, let's simplify the equation:
   2x + 4 - x/2 = 40

6. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   4x + 8 - x = 80

7. Combine like terms:
   3x + 8 = 80

8. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   3x = 72

9. Divide both sides by 3:
   x = 24

10. Now that we know B's age is 24, we can find A's age:

1. The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. To find the weight of one fox, we divide 25 kg by 5:
   Weight of one fox = 25 kg / 5 = 5 kg.

2. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. We already know the weight of one fox is 5 kg, so the weight of 3 foxes is:
   Weight of 3 foxes = 3 * 5 kg = 15 kg.

3. Now, we subtract the weight of 3 foxes from the total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs to find the weight of 5 dogs:
   Weight of 5 dogs = Total weight - Weight of 3 foxes = 65 kg - 15 kg = 50 kg.

4. To find the weight of one dog, we divide the weight of 5 dogs by 5:
   Weight of one dog = 50 kg / 5 = 10 kg.

Now, we divide the total number of Starbursts by the total number of people:
45 / 19 = 2.368421052631578947 (approximately)

Since we can't divide Starbursts into fractions, we round down to 2 Starbursts per person, as that is the whole number that can be evenly distributed. 

However, this leaves some Starbursts unaccounted for. To find out how many, we multiply the number of people by the number of Starbursts each person got:
2 * 19 = 38

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of Starbursts to find out how many are left:
45 - 38 = 7

These 7 Starbursts are left for Sean. Since he ate what was left, he ate 7 + 2 = 9 Starbursts in total (the 2 he got initially and the 7 that were left).

However, the question asks how many Starbursts each person ate. Since each of Sean's friends ate 2 Starbursts and Sean ate 9, we can't give a single number that applies to everyone.

The second angle is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle, so the second angle is 3x - 32.

The third angle is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle, so the third angle is 2x - 28.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can set up the equation:

Total number of apples = 495
Number of apples in each basket = 25

First, we divide 495 by 25:
495 ÷ 25 = 19.8

Since we can't have a fraction of a basket, we'll take the whole number part, which is 19. This means Mr. Lee can fill 19 baskets with 25 apples each.

Now, we multiply the number of baskets by the number of apples in each basket:
19 x 25 = 475

This is the total number of apples packed. To find the number of apples left unpacked, we subtract this from the total number of apples:
495 - 475 = 20

So, there are 20 apples left unpacked.

Area = Length x Width

We are given the area (20 square feet) and the width (5 feet). We can plug these values into the formula and solve for the length.

20 = Length x 5

To find the length, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

Length = 20 / 5
Length = 4

So, the length of the lawn is 4 feet.

1. Ethan rowed from 10:50 to 11:15. To find the time he rowed, we subtract the start time from the end time. 
   11:15 - 10:50 = 25 minutes

2. Frank rowed twice as long as Ethan. Since Ethan rowed for 25 minutes, Frank rowed for 2 * 25 = 50 minutes.

3. Now, we add the time Ethan rowed and the time Frank rowed to find the total time.
   25 minutes (Ethan) + 50 minutes (Frank) = 75 minutes

So, the boys rowed the boat for a total of 75 minutes.

1507,Grandma has an old family recipe for blueberry pancakes. She can make 8 pancakes that are each 10 inches in diameter. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?,"To find out how many small pancakes Grandma's recipe will make, we need to compare the area of the large pancakes to the area of the small pancakes.

The area of a circle (such as a pancake) is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle.

The diameter of the large pancakes is 10 inches, so the radius is 10/2 = 5 inches. The area of a large pancake is A = π(5)^2 = 25π square inches.

The diameter of the small pancakes is 2 inches, so the radius is 2/2 = 1 inch. The area of a small pancake is A = π(1)^2 = π square inches.

Since Grandma's recipe makes 8 large pancakes, the total area of the large pancakes is 8 x 25π = 200π square inches.

To find out how many small pancakes this area is equivalent to, we can divide the total area by the area of a single small pancake: 200π / π = 200.

So, Grandma's recipe will make 200 small pancakes.

What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let the basic first class full fare be x and the reservation charge be y.

The cost of one reserved first class ticket is $216, which is the sum of the basic fare and the reservation charge. So, we can write:

x + y = 216 ... (Equation 1)

The cost of one full and one half reserved first class tickets is $327. The half ticket costs half the basic fare (x/2) and the same reservation charge (y). So, the total cost is:

x + (x/2) + 2y = 327

Combine like terms:

(3/2)x + 2y = 327 ... (Equation 2)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x and y.

First, multiply Equation 1 by 2 to make the coefficients of y in both equations the same:

2x + 2y = 432 ... (Equation 3)

Now, subtract Equation 3 from Equation 2 to eliminate y:

(3/2)x - 2x = 327 - 432
(-1/2)x = -105

Multiply both sides by -2:

x = 210

Now that we have x, substitute it into Equation 1 to find y:

210 + y = 216
y = 6

So, the basic first class full fare is $210 and the reservation charge is $6.

2. Dime: A dime is worth 10 cents.
3. Nickels: 2 nickels are worth 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents.

Now, let's add up the values:
25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (dime) + 10 cents (nickels) = 45 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 45 cents to dollars by dividing by 100:
45 cents / 100 = 0.45 dollars

Since the longer piece is 10 inches longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 'x + 10'.

We know that the total length of the two pieces is 40 inches. So, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 10) = 40

Combine like terms:

2x + 10 = 40

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 15

So, the length of the shorter piece of rope is 15 inches.

1. The two-digit number can be represented as 10x + y, where x is the tens digit and y is the units digit.

2. The sum of the two digits is 9, so we can write the equation: x + y = 9.

3. If the digits are reversed, the new number is 10y + x.

4. The problem states that the new number is increased by 9, so we can write the equation: 10y + x = (10x + y) + 9.

5. Simplify the equation: 10y + x = 10x + y + 9.

6. Rearrange the equation: 10y - y = 10x - x + 9.

7. Simplify the equation: 9y = 9x + 9.

8. Divide both sides by 9: y = x + 1.

9. Now we have two equations: x + y = 9 and y = x + 1.

10. Substitute y = x + 1 into the first equation: x + (x + 1) = 9.

11. Simplify the equation: 2x + 1 = 9.

12. Subtract 1 from both sides: 2x = 8.

13. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4.

1486,Mrs. Hilt owns a house on a lot shaped like a rectangle. The width is twice its length. The perimeter of the lot is 60 feet. What is the length and the width of the lot?,"To find the length and width of the lot, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width).

Given that the width is twice the length, we can write: Width = 2 * Length.

We are also given that the perimeter is 60 feet. So, we can write: 60 = 2(Length + Width).

Substituting Width = 2 * Length into the equation, we get: 
60 = 2(Length + 2 * Length)
60 = 2(3 * Length)
60 = 6 * Length

Now, we can solve for Length: 
Length = 60 / 6
Length = 10

Since Width = 2 * Length, we can find the width: 
Width = 2 * 10
Width = 20

So, the length of the lot is 10 feet and the width is 20 feet.

2009,"The school cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?","To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of apples taken by the students from the total number of apples ordered.

First, let's find the total number of apples ordered:
Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
Total apples = 25 + 17
Total apples = 42

Since 10 students wanted fruit, we'll assume each student took one apple:
Apples taken = 10

Now, let's find the number of extra apples:
Extra apples = Total apples - Apples taken
Extra apples = 42 - 10
Extra apples = 32

1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"To find the measure of the angles, let's denote the first angle as x. Since two angles are the same size, the second angle is also x.

The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so the third angle is x - 12.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + x + (x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

3x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

3x = 192

Divide by 3:

x = 64

Now that we know the first angle is 64 degrees, the second angle is also 64 degrees, and the third angle is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

743,"Antonia has 79 Barbie Dolls. She packs away them in two wardrobes. If there are 35 Barbie Dolls in the first wardrobe, how many more Barbie Dolls are there in the second wardrobe than the first?","To find out how many more Barbie Dolls are in the second wardrobe than the first, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many Barbie Dolls are in the second wardrobe.
   Since Antonia has 79 Barbie Dolls in total and 35 are in the first wardrobe, we subtract 35 from 79 to find the number in the second wardrobe.
   79 - 35 = 44

2. Now that we know there are 44 Barbie Dolls in the second wardrobe, we need to find out how many more are in the second wardrobe than the first.
   To do this, we subtract the number of Barbie Dolls in the first wardrobe from the number in the second wardrobe.
   44 - 35 = 9

Therefore, there are 9 more Barbie Dolls in the second wardrobe than the first.

Since Rachel has always been fascinated by the French people, they began their tour with a visit to France. During their stay there, Rachel went to the famous Eiffel Tower. If she climbed 567 flights of stairs going up and 325 going down, what is the total number of steps that she took?","To find the total number of steps Rachel took, we need to add the number of steps going up and the number of steps going down. 

However, the problem gives us the number of flights of stairs, not the number of steps. Since we don't know the exact number of steps per flight, we can assume a standard number of steps per flight is around 12-16 steps. But for simplicity, let's assume it's 12 steps per flight for our calculation.

Number of steps going up: 567 flights * 12 steps/flight = 6804 steps
Number of steps going down: 325 flights * 12 steps/flight = 3900 steps

Now, let's add the number of steps going up and down:
Total steps = 6804 steps + 3900 steps = 10704 steps
