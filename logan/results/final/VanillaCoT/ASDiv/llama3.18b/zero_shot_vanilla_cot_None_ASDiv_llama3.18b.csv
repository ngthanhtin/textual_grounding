1180,"The teacher is handing out note cards to her students. She gave 3 note cards to the first student, 12 note cards to the second student, 48 note cards to the third student, and 192 note cards to the fourth student. If this pattern continues, how many note cards will the teacher give to the fifth student?","To find the pattern, let's analyze the given information:

- The first student received 3 note cards.
- The second student received 12 note cards (4 times the first student's amount).
- The third student received 48 note cards (4 times the second student's amount).
- The fourth student received 192 note cards (4 times the third student's amount).

We can see that each student receives 4 times the amount of the previous student. 

To find the amount given to the fifth student, we need to multiply the amount given to the fourth student by 4:

192 * 4 = 768

So, the teacher will give 768 note cards to the fifth student.

2198,"A vase can hold nine flowers. If you had four carnations and twenty-three roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?","To determine the number of vases needed, we need to calculate the total number of flowers and divide it by the capacity of each vase.

1. Calculate the total number of flowers:
   - Carnations: 4
   - Roses: 23
   Total flowers: 4 + 23 = 27

2. Determine the capacity of each vase: 9 flowers

3. Divide the total number of flowers by the capacity of each vase:
   - 27 flowers / 9 flowers per vase = 3

Since we can't have a fraction of a vase, we need to round up to the nearest whole number if there's any remainder. In this case, 27 is exactly divisible by 9, so we don't need to round up.

Therefore, {3} vases are needed to hold the flowers."

593,"Uncle Dave bought 143 ice cream sandwiches. If he wants to give them to his 11 hungry nieces, how many can each niece get?","To find out how many ice cream sandwiches each niece can get, we need to divide the total number of ice cream sandwiches (143) by the number of nieces (11).

Step 1: Divide 143 by 11
143 ÷ 11 = 13

Since we can't divide an ice cream sandwich, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. 

Step 2: Determine if there are any leftovers
To check if there are any leftovers, we can multiply the number of ice cream sandwiches each niece gets (13) by the number of nieces (11) and compare it to the total number of ice cream sandwiches (143).

13 * 11 = 143

Since the product equals the total number of ice cream sandwiches, each niece can get 13 ice cream sandwiches without any leftovers.

1407,"Five years ago, I was thrice as old as my son and ten years later I shall be twice as old as my son. How old are we now?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Five years ago, you were thrice as old as your son. Let's denote your current age as 'A' and your son's current age as 'S'. Five years ago, your age was A - 5 and your son's age was S - 5. According to the problem, A - 5 = 3(S - 5).

2. Now, let's simplify the equation: A - 5 = 3S - 15.
   A = 3S - 10.

3. Ten years later, you shall be twice as old as your son. So, your age will be A + 10 and your son's age will be S + 10. According to the problem, A + 10 = 2(S + 10).

4. Now, let's simplify the equation: A + 10 = 2S + 20.
   A = 2S + 10.

5. We have two equations for A: A = 3S - 10 and A = 2S + 10. We can set these two equations equal to each other.

6. 3S - 10 = 2S + 10.
   3S - 2S = 10 + 10.
   S = 20.

7. Now that we know S, we can find A using the equation A = 3S - 10.
   A = 3(20) - 10.
   A = 60 - 10.
   A = 50.

So, your current age is 50 and your son's current age is 20.

{Your current age is 50, your son's current age is 20}"
424,"After the day, they were able to make 6 institutions happy. If each institution has 80 people.

322,"The exit door leads to a river 487 inches across, if the bridge he needs to cross is only 295 inches, how much longer does he need to build if he wants to cross the river using the bridge?","To find out how much longer the bridge needs to be, we need to subtract the length of the bridge from the width of the river.

1. Convert the width of the river from inches to feet (since bridge lengths are often measured in feet). 
1 foot = 12 inches
Width of the river in feet = 487 inches / 12 = 40.583 feet

2. Convert the length of the bridge from inches to feet.
Length of the bridge in feet = 295 inches / 12 = 24.583 feet

3. Subtract the length of the bridge from the width of the river.
Length needed = Width of the river - Length of the bridge
Length needed = 40.583 - 24.583
Length needed = 16 feet

So, the bridge needs to be 16 feet longer to cross the river.

1502,A rectangular living room measures 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet placed on the floor leaves a border 2 feet wide all around it. What is the area of the border?,"To find the area of the border, we need to first find the area of the entire room and the area of the carpet, then subtract the area of the carpet from the area of the room to get the area of the border.

1. Find the area of the entire room:
   Area of room = length * width
   Area of room = 12 * 10
   Area of room = 120 square feet

2. Find the dimensions of the carpet:
   The carpet is 2 feet smaller on each side due to the border, so its dimensions are:
   Length of carpet = 12 - 2 * 2 = 8 feet
   Width of carpet = 10 - 2 * 2 = 6 feet

3. Find the area of the carpet:
   Area of carpet = length * width
   Area of carpet = 8 * 6
   Area of carpet = 48 square feet

4. Find the area of the border:
   Area of border = Area of room - Area of carpet
   Area of border = 120 - 48
   Area of border = 72 square feet

However, since the border is on all sides of the carpet, we need to add the areas of the four borders together. 

The length of each border is 2 feet and the width of each border is the difference between the length of the room and the length of the carpet, which is 12 - 8 = 4 feet.

So, the area of each border is:
Area of each border = length * width
Area of each border = 2 * 4
Area of each border = 8 square feet

Since there are four borders, the total area of the border is:
Total area of border = 4 * area of each border
Total area of border = 4 * 8
Total area of border = 32 square feet

However, the previous calculation of 72 square feet was actually the total area of the border would be if it was just on the edges of the room and not the entire area of the room. We have to consider the area of the border in a different way. The area of the border is actually the area of the room minus the area of the carpet.

However, we can also think of it as the area of the room minus the area of the inner rectangle, which is the area of the carpet. 

So, the area of the border is the area of the room minus the area of the inner rectangle, which is 120 - 48 = 72 square feet.

However, the border is 2 feet wide on all sides, so the area of the border is actually the area of the room minus the area of the inner rectangle, which is 72 square feet.

But the inner rectangle is 8 feet by 6 feet, and the area of the inner rectangle is 48 square feet. 

So the area of the border is 72 square feet.

However, this is the area of the border, not the area of the four borders. 

The area of the four borders is 32 square feet.

The area of the border, not the four borders, is actually the area of the room minus the area of the inner rectangle.

1432,"The taxi charges in a city comprise of a fixed charge together with the charge for the distance covered. For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let the fixed charge be 'x' and the charge per km be 'y'.

For a journey of 10 km, the total charge is $75. This can be represented by the equation:
x + 10y = 75

For a journey of 15 km, the total charge is $110. This can be represented by the equation:
x + 15y = 110

Now, we have two equations and two variables. We can solve these equations to find the values of 'x' and 'y'.

First, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate 'x':
(x + 15y) - (x + 10y) = 110 - 75
5y = 35
y = 35/5
y = 7

Now that we have the value of 'y', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find the value of 'x'. Let's use the first equation:
x + 10y = 75
x + 10(7) = 75
x + 70 = 75
x = 75 - 70
x = 5

Now that we have the values of 'x' and 'y', we can find the total charge for a journey of 25 km:
Total charge = x + 25y
Total charge = 5 + 25(7)
Total charge = 5 + 175
Total charge = 180

So, the person will have to pay $180 for traveling a distance of 25 km.

First, let's express C in terms of S from the second equation:
C = 87 - S

Now, substitute C in the first equation:
A + (87 - S) = 95

Simplify the equation:
A - S = 95 - 87
A - S = 8

Therefore, Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara.

1. Jamal and Moshe started a business with a total capital of $7500.
2. Jamal furnished half as much capital as Moshe. This means if Moshe's capital is x, Jamal's capital is x/2.
3. The total capital is the sum of their individual capitals, so we can write an equation: x + x/2 = 7500.
4. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + x = 15000.
5. Combine like terms: 3x = 15000.
6. Divide both sides by 3: x = 5000.
7. Since Moshe's capital is x, Moshe furnished $5000. 
8. Since Jamal's capital is x/2, Jamal furnished $5000/2 = $2500.

At the end of the day, Sam and Carlos have knocked down the same total number of pins. What is the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down?","To find the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, let's analyze their bowling performance.

Let's assume Sam bowls x times and Carlos bowls y times. Since Sam knocks down 8 pins on every bowl and Carlos knocks down 9 pins on every bowl, the total number of pins they knocked down can be represented as:

Sam: 8x
Carlos: 9y

Since they have knocked down the same total number of pins, we can set up the equation:

8x = 9y

We want to find the least number of total pins, which means we want to find the smallest possible values of x and y that satisfy the equation. 

To simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by the greatest common divisor of 8 and 9, which is 1. However, the equation is already in its simplest form.

We can rewrite the equation as:

8x = 9y
x = (9/8)y

Since x must be an integer (you can't bowl a fraction of a time), y must be a multiple of 8. The smallest possible value of y is 8.

x = (9/8)(8)
x = 9

Now we can find the total number of pins knocked down by Sam and Carlos:

Sam: 8x = 8(9) = 72
Carlos: 9y = 9(8) = 72

However, this is not the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down, because they both knocked down the same number of pins. To find the least number of total pins, we can try to find a different solution.

Let's try to find a solution where Sam bowls a different number of times than Carlos. 

x = 16, y = 18
Sam: 8x = 8(16) = 128
Carlos: 9y = 9(18) = 162

However, this solution doesn't work because Carlos knocked down more pins than Sam.

x = 18, y = 16
Sam: 8x = 8(18) = 144
Carlos: 9y = 9(16) = 144

This solution works, but we can try to find a smaller solution.

x = 36, y = 32
Sam: 8x = 8(36) = 288
Carlos: 9y = 9(32) = 288

This solution doesn't work because Sam and Carlos knocked down the same number of pins.

x = 32, y = 36
Sam: 8x = 8(32) = 256
Carlos: 9y = 9(36) = 324

However, this solution doesn't work because Carlos knocked down more pins than Sam.

x = 72, y = 64
Sam: 8x = 8(72) = 576
Carlos: 9y = 9(64) = 576

This solution works, but we can try to find a smaller solution.

x = 64, y = 72
Sam: 8x = 8(64) = 512
Carlos: 9y = 9(72) = 648

However, this solution doesn't work because Carlos knocked down more pins than Sam.

x = 48, y = 54
Sam: 8x = 8(48) = 384
Carlos: 9y = 9(54) = 486

This solution doesn't work because Carlos knocked down more pins than Sam.

x = 54, y = 48
Sam: 8x = 8(54) = 432
Carlos: 9y = 9(48) = 432

This solution works.

So, the least number of total pins that Sam and Carlos could have each knocked down is {432}."

1457,The second angle of a triangle is double the first. The third angle is 40 less than the first. Find the three angles.,"Let's denote the first angle as x. 

Since the second angle is double the first, the second angle is 2x.

The third angle is 40 less than the first, so the third angle is x - 40.

We know that the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. 

Therefore, we can write the equation: x + 2x + (x - 40) = 180.

Combine like terms: 4x - 40 = 180.

Add 40 to both sides: 4x = 220.

Divide by 4: x = 55.

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the other two angles:

- The second angle is 2x = 2(55) = 110.
- The third angle is x - 40 = 55 - 40 = 15.

So, the three angles are 55, 110, and 15.

1. First, we need to find out how many Sweettarts Virginia gave to each friend. Since she gave equal numbers to 4 friends, we need to divide the total number of Sweettarts (13) by the number of friends (4).

13 ÷ 4 = 3.25

Since we can't divide Sweettarts into fractions, Virginia must have given 3 Sweettarts to each friend, and then she would have had some left over. 

2. To find out how many Sweettarts Virginia had left, we need to multiply the number of Sweettarts given to each friend (3) by the number of friends (4) and then subtract that from the total number of Sweettarts (13).

3 x 4 = 12
13 - 12 = 1

So, Virginia had 1 Sweettart left.

3. Since Virginia ate the remaining Sweettarts, we need to add 1 to the number of Sweettarts given to each friend to find out how many each person ate, including Virginia.

3 + 1 = 4

However, this doesn't make sense as 4 is the number of friends and not the number of Sweettarts each friend ate. Since the remaining Sweettart was eaten by Virginia, we can say that each person, including Virginia, ate 3 Sweettarts initially, and then Virginia ate 1 more Sweettart.

1241,A baker had 7 boxes for donuts. He ended up making 48 donuts and splitting them evenly between the boxes. How many extra donuts did he end up with?,"To find the number of extra donuts, we need to determine how many donuts the baker put in each box and then find the remainder when 48 is divided by 7.

1. First, let's divide 48 by 7 to find the number of donuts in each box:
   48 ÷ 7 = 6 with a remainder of 6.

2. This means the baker put 6 donuts in each box. Since there are 7 boxes, the total number of donuts is 6 * 7 = 42.

3. However, the baker made 48 donuts. To find the number of extra donuts, we subtract the total number of donuts in the boxes (42) from the total number of donuts made (48):
   48 - 42 = 6.

So, the baker ended up with {6} extra donuts."
714,Debby makes 67 pancakes. She adds blueberries to 20 of them and bananas to 24 of them. The rest are plain. How many plain pancakes are there?,"To find the number of plain pancakes, we need to subtract the number of pancakes with blueberries and bananas from the total number of pancakes.

First, let's add the number of pancakes with blueberries and bananas:
20 (blueberries) + 24 (bananas) = 44

Now, subtract this number from the total number of pancakes:
67 (total pancakes) - 44 (pancakes with blueberries or bananas) = 23

So, there are 23 plain pancakes.

1865,Megan gave seven acorns to her sister. Now Megan has nine acorns left. How many acorns did Megan have in the beginning?,"To find out how many acorns Megan had in the beginning, we need to work backwards from the information given.

1. Megan gave seven acorns to her sister.
2. After giving seven acorns, Megan has nine acorns left.

Let's assume Megan had 'x' acorns in the beginning. After giving seven acorns to her sister, she would have (x - 7) acorns left.

Since we know that after giving seven acorns, Megan has nine acorns left, we can set up the equation:

x - 7 = 9

To solve for 'x', we need to add 7 to both sides of the equation:

x = 9 + 7
x = 16

So, Megan had 16 acorns in the beginning.

2096,"At a comic convention Janet wanted to buy 8 comics, but each one costs 4 dollars, plus it costs 2 to even get in. How much money should she take with her so she can get in and buy what she wants?","To find out how much money Janet should take with her, we need to calculate the total cost of the comics and add the cost of admission.

1. Calculate the total cost of the comics:
   Janet wants to buy 8 comics, and each comic costs $4. 
   Total cost of comics = Number of comics * Cost per comic
   Total cost of comics = 8 * $4
   Total cost of comics = $32

2. Add the cost of admission:
   The cost of admission is $2.
   Total cost = Total cost of comics + Cost of admission
   Total cost = $32 + $2
   Total cost = $34

Therefore, Janet should take { $34 } with her to the comic convention."
1226,"Packages of cheddar cheese come with 12 slices, while packages of Swiss cheese come with 28 slices. If Randy bought the same number of slices of each type of cheese, what is the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought?","To find the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 28.

First, let's break down the numbers into their prime factors:
- 12 = 2^2 * 3
- 28 = 2^2 * 7

Now, we need to find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number:
- LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 7 = 84

Therefore, the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought is 84 slices of each type.

436,"Next on his checklist are the strawberry fields. There he found out that they can get 268 kg of fruit for every row of strawberry plants. If there are 7 rows of strawberry plants, how many kilograms of strawberries can they harvest?","To find the total kilograms of strawberries they can harvest, we need to multiply the amount of fruit they can get per row by the number of rows.

Step 1: Find the amount of fruit per row - 268 kg
Step 2: Find the number of rows - 7
Step 3: Multiply the amount of fruit per row by the number of rows
268 kg/row * 7 rows = 1876 kg

So, they can harvest {1876} kilograms of strawberries."
2181,"Luke had 48 dollars in January. By March he had spent 11 dollars. If he got another 21 dollars from his mom, how much money would he have?","To find out how much money Luke would have, let's break it down step by step:

1. Luke started with 48 dollars.
2. He spent 11 dollars, so we subtract 11 from 48:
   48 - 11 = 37 dollars
3. He then received 21 dollars from his mom, so we add 21 to 37:
   37 + 21 = 58 dollars

So, Luke would have {58} dollars."
1834,A pet store had 4 snakes. They had the snakes in cages with 2 snakes in each cage. How many cages did the pet store have?,"To find the number of cages, we need to divide the total number of snakes by the number of snakes per cage.

1. Sandy has 57 dollars left after buying the pie.
2. The cost of the pie is 6 dollars.

1240,"Luke had 9 pieces of candy. If he wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag, how many more pieces would he need to make sure each bag had the same amount?","To find out how many more pieces Luke needs, we need to determine the total number of pieces he needs to divide evenly into 2 bags.

1. Luke wants to split the candy into 2 bags with the same amount of candy in each bag. 
2. To find the total number of pieces in each bag, we divide the total number of pieces (9) by 2. 
   9 / 2 = 4.5 (since we can't have half a piece of candy, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each bag has the same amount)
3. Since 4.5 is not a whole number, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 
   To do this, we can multiply 4.5 by 2 to get 9, then add 1 to get 10.
4. Since Luke already has 9 pieces, he needs 10 - 9 = 1 more piece to make sure each bag has the same amount.

1333,A rectangular cupboard is of length 6 m and perimeter 20 m. Find the width of the cupboard.,"To find the width of the cupboard, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Given that the perimeter is 20 m and the length is 6 m, we can substitute these values into the formula:

20 = 2(6 + width)

Now, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 2:

10 = 6 + width

Next, we can isolate the width by subtracting 6 from both sides:

width = 10 - 6
width = 4

So, the width of the cupboard is 4 m.

1356,Your dog ate 12 of your notecards for school. That was 3/4 of your notecards that you need to turn in. How many notecards had you completed?,"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The dog ate 3/4 of the notecards. This means the dog ate 3 parts out of a total of 4 parts.
2. Since the dog ate 3/4 of the notecards, that means 1/4 of the notecards are left.
3. We know that the dog ate 12 notecards, which is 3/4 of the total notecards.
4. To find the total number of notecards, we can set up a proportion: 3/4 = 12/x, where x is the total number of notecards.
5. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 3x = 12 * 4.
6. Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x = 48.
7. Dividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 16.
8. So, the total number of notecards is 16.
9. Since 12 notecards were eaten, the number of notecards left is 16 - 12 = 4.
10. But we are told that the 12 eaten notecards were 3/4 of the total, which means 4 is 1/4 of the total, not the total number of notecards completed.
11. If 4 is 1/4 of the total, then the total number of notecards completed is 4 * 4 = 16.

So, the total number of notecards completed is {16}."

So, the house has a total of {10} bedrooms."
821,"Sam has 389 riddles for 18 of his students to guess. If he wants the students to guess the same number of riddles, at least how many more riddles does he need to distribute?","To find out how many more riddles Sam needs to distribute, we need to find the remainder when 389 is divided by 18. 

1. Divide 389 by 18: 
   389 ÷ 18 = 21.61 (approximately)

2. Since we can't distribute a fraction of a riddle, we need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 21.

3. To find out how many riddles are left to distribute, we multiply 21 (the number of riddles each student gets) by 18 (the number of students):
   21 * 18 = 378

4. Now, subtract 378 from 389 to find the number of riddles left to distribute:
   389 - 378 = 11

So, Sam needs at least 11 more riddles to distribute.

4. To solve for 'S', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, let's subtract 2 from both sides:
   12 - 2 = (1/2)S + 2 - 2
   10 = (1/2)S
5. Now, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
   10 * 2 = (1/2)S * 2
   20 = S

So, the age of Steven is {20}."

2272,Crackers come in packages of 18. Betty ate 45 crackers. How many crackers does she have left?,"To find out how many crackers Betty has left, we need to subtract the number of crackers she ate from the total number of crackers in the package.

1. Total number of crackers in the package: 18
2. Number of crackers Betty ate: 45
3. Since 45 is more than 18, we can't simply subtract. We need to find out how many packages Betty had. 
   To do this, we divide the total number of crackers she ate by the number of crackers in a package: 45 / 18 = 2.5
   This means Betty had 2 full packages and a fraction of another package.

1556,"A clown needed two hundred twenty-seven balloons for a party he was going to, but the balloons only came in packs of two. How many packs of balloons would he need to buy?","To find the number of packs of balloons the clown needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of balloons (227) by the number of balloons in each pack (2).

Step 1: Divide 227 by 2.
227 ÷ 2 = 113.5

Since the clown can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure he has enough balloons.

Step 2: Round up 113.5 to the nearest whole number.
113.5 → 114

Therefore, the clown needs to buy {114} packs of balloons."
865,"When Jose rode on a bus, he noticed some people sitting. At the next bus stop, 5 people got on and 2 people got off. Two stops later, 7 people got on 15 people got off the bus at the terminal station. How many people were in the bus when Jose got on the bus?","To find the number of people in the bus when Jose got on, we need to work backwards from the last stop.

1. At the terminal station, 15 people got off, and 7 people got on. 
   So, the number of people at the terminal station = 7 (people who got on) + (15 - 7) (people who were already on the bus) 
   = 7 + 8 
   = 15

2. Two stops before the terminal, 15 people got off. 
   So, the number of people two stops before the terminal = 15 (people who got on at the previous stop) + 15 (people who were already on the bus) 
   = 15 + 15 
   = 30

3. At the stop before the previous one, 2 people got off, and 5 people got on. 
   So, the number of people at this stop = 5 (people who got on) + (30 - 2) (people who were already on the bus) 
   = 5 + 28 
   = 33

4. Now, we need to find the number of people when Jose got on the bus. 
   Since we don't know the initial number of people, let's call it x. 
   At the first stop, 5 people got on, and 2 people got off. 
   So, the number of people at this stop = x + 5 - 2 
   = x + 3 

Now, we can equate the number of people at this stop to 33 (from step 3), since this is the stop before Jose got on the bus. 
x + 3 = 33 
x = 30 

Therefore, {30}."

502,"They had 119 matchboxes wrapped in colorful shiny wrappers. If they are to distribute the matchboxes equally to the 9 houses in the first block, how may matchboxes will each house receive?","To find out how many matchboxes each house will receive, we need to divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses.

Total number of matchboxes: 119
Number of houses: 9

Now, let's divide 119 by 9:

119 ÷ 9 = 13.22

Since we can't distribute a fraction of a matchbox, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, we can still distribute 13 matchboxes to 8 houses, and the remaining 5 matchboxes can be distributed to the remaining house.

So, each house will receive {13} matchboxes."
1936,"A store has thirty-five shirts. If they sold thirty of them, how many shirts would they have?","To find out how many shirts the store would have left after selling thirty of them, we need to subtract the number of shirts sold from the total number of shirts.

1307,"The present ages of Lewis and Brown are in the ratio 1:2. Three years from now, the ages will be in the ratio 3:5. Find the present ages of Lewis and Brown.","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: Let's assume the present age of Lewis is x and the present age of Brown is 2x (since their ages are in the ratio 1:2).

Step 2: Three years from now, Lewis's age will be x + 3 and Brown's age will be 2x + 3.

Step 3: According to the problem, three years from now, their ages will be in the ratio 3:5. So, we can set up the equation:

(x + 3) / (2x + 3) = 3/5

Step 4: Cross-multiply to solve the equation:

5(x + 3) = 3(2x + 3)

Step 5: Expand and simplify the equation:

5x + 15 = 6x + 9

Step 6: Subtract 5x from both sides:

15 = x + 9

Step 7: Subtract 9 from both sides:

6 = x

Step 8: Since the present age of Lewis is x, we can find the present age of Brown by multiplying x by 2:

1092,"Ann has $777 and Bill has $1,111. How much does Bill need to give to Ann, so that they would have the same amount of money?","To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money Bill needs to give to Ann so that they have the same amount.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in the amount of money Ann and Bill have.
Ann has $777, and Bill has $1,111. The difference is $1,111 - $777 = $334.

Step 2: Since Bill needs to give money to Ann, we need to subtract the difference from Bill's amount.
Bill needs to give $334 to Ann.

Step 3: Verify the result by adding the amount Bill gives to Ann's original amount.
Ann's new amount = $777 + $334 = $1,111.

1460,"A bicycle and a bicycle helmet cost 240 dollars. How much did each cost, if the bicycle cost 5 times as much as the helmet?","Let's denote the cost of the helmet as x. Since the bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet, the cost of the bicycle is 5x.

We know that the total cost of the bicycle and the helmet is $240. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 5x = 240

Combine like terms:

6x = 240

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 40

So the helmet costs $40. Since the bicycle costs 5 times as much as the helmet, the bicycle costs 5 * 40 = $200.

The final answer is {Bicycle: $200, Helmet: $40}."
1591,"There are 396 students going to a trivia competition. If each school van can hold 9 students, how many vans will they need?","To find out how many vans are needed, we need to divide the total number of students (396) by the number of students each van can hold (9).

Step 1: Divide 396 by 9.
396 ÷ 9 = 44

Since we can't have a fraction of a van, we need to consider if there are any students left over after filling the vans.

Step 2: Check if there are any students left over.
44 * 9 = 396 (this is the total number of students, so we've accounted for all of them)

However, since we're dividing 396 by 9, we can actually use the division to find out how many vans are needed, including any extra space in the last van.

Step 3: Round down to the nearest whole number (as we can't have a fraction of a van).

292 ÷ 16 = 18.25

This means there are 18 full bags and a fraction of a bag. Since you can't have a fraction of a bag, Edgar must have 18 full bags and some cookies left over.

To find out how many cookies are left over, we multiply the number of full bags (18) by the number of cookies each bag can hold (16).

18 x 16 = 288

Now we subtract the number of cookies in the full bags (288) from the total number of cookies Edgar buys (292) to find the number of cookies in the paper bag that is not full.

292 - 288 = 4

So, there are {4} cookies in the paper bag that is not full."

1. Bruno had some story books initially. Let's call the number of books he had initially 'x'.
2. He lost 4 books, so the number of books he had after losing 4 is 'x - 4'.
3. His dad gave him 10 more books, so the number of books he had after receiving 10 more is 'x - 4 + 10' or 'x + 6'.
4. After receiving the 10 books, Bruno had 39 books in total. So, we can set up the equation: x + 6 = 39.
5. To find the initial number of books, we need to solve for 'x'. We can do this by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation: x = 39 - 6.
6. x = 33.

1331,A number equals 5 times the difference between the number and 4. Find the number.,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the number be 'x'.
2. The difference between the number and 4 is 'x - 4'.
3. The problem states that the number equals 5 times the difference between the number and 4, so we can write the equation as:
   x = 5(x - 4)
4. Now, let's simplify the equation by distributing 5 to the terms inside the parentheses:
   x = 5x - 20
5. Next, let's move all the terms with 'x' to one side of the equation by subtracting 'x' from both sides:
   x - 5x = -20
   -4x = -20
6. Finally, let's solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by -4:
   x = -20 / -4
   x = 5

So, the number is {5}."
1427,"Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, and upstream 4 km in 2 hours. Find her speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current.","To find Tara's speed of rowing in still water and the speed of the current, we need to use the concept of relative speed.

Let's denote:
- Tara's speed in still water as 's'
- Speed of the current as 'c'

When Tara rows downstream, her speed relative to the ground is the sum of her speed in still water and the speed of the current. So, her downstream speed is 's + c'.

When Tara rows upstream, her speed relative to the ground is the difference between her speed in still water and the speed of the current. So, her upstream speed is 's - c'.

Given that Tara can row downstream 20 km in 2 hours, her downstream speed is 20 km / 2 hours = 10 km/h.

Given that Tara can row upstream 4 km in 2 hours, her upstream speed is 4 km / 2 hours = 2 km/h.

Now, we can set up two equations based on the above information:

1. s + c = 10 (downstream speed)
2. s - c = 2 (upstream speed)

To solve these equations, we can add them together to eliminate 'c':

(s + c) + (s - c) = 10 + 2
2s = 12
s = 6

Now that we have the value of 's', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'c'. Let's use the first equation:

6 + c = 10
c = 4

So, Tara's speed of rowing in still water is {6} km/h, and the speed of the current is {4} km/h."

1661,"Kaleb deleted 20 songs from his MP3 player. If the ratio of songs he deleted to songs he kept was 10:3, how many songs did he originally have on his MP3 player?","To find the original number of songs, we need to set up an equation based on the given ratio.

Let's say the number of songs Kaleb deleted is 10x and the number of songs he kept is 3x. We know that the number of songs he deleted is 20, so we can set up the equation:

10x = 20

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 10:

x = 20 / 10
x = 2

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of songs Kaleb kept by multiplying 3x:

Number of songs kept = 3x
= 3 * 2
= 6

Since the number of songs deleted is 20, the total number of songs is the sum of the songs deleted and the songs kept:

Total number of songs = 20 (deleted) + 6 (kept)
= 26

Therefore, Kaleb originally had {26} songs on his MP3 player."

Let's assume the number of stations visited is 'x'. 

Since they left exactly 7 nails in every station, the total number of nails left is 7x.

The initial number of nails was 140, and they left 7x nails in the stations. Therefore, the number of nails left is 140 - 7x.

Since the number of nails left in the stations is also 7x, we can set up the equation:

140 - 7x = 7x

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. Let's assume the car went uphill for 'x' hours and downhill for 'y' hours. We know that the total time is 15 hours, so we can write an equation:
   x + y = 15

2. The car's speed uphill is 30 km/h and downhill is 50 km/h. We know that the total distance covered is 650 km. We can write another equation using the formula distance = speed * time:
   30x + 50y = 650

3. Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

4. From the first equation, we can express x in terms of y:
   x = 15 - y

5. Substitute x in the second equation:
   30(15 - y) + 50y = 650

6. Expand and simplify the equation:
   450 - 30y + 50y = 650
   20y = 200
   y = 10

7. Now that we know y, we can find x using the first equation:

   x = 15 - 10
   x = 5

So, the car went uphill for 5 hours and downhill for 10 hours.

If the train would have been 6 km/hr faster it would have 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and if the train were slower by 6 km/hr,it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. Find the length of the journey.","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Let the original speed of the train be 'v' km/hr and the original time taken be 't' hours.

Given that the train covered a certain distance at a uniform speed.

1. If the train were 6 km/hr faster, it would have taken 8 hours less than the scheduled time. This can be represented as:

   v + 6 * (t - 8) = distance
   v * t = distance

   Since the distance remains the same, we can equate the two expressions:

   v + 6 * (t - 8) = v * t

   Expanding the equation:

   v + 6t - 48 = vt

   Rearranging the terms:

   6t - 48 = vt - v

   Factoring out 't' and 'v':

   6t - vt = 48 - v

   t(6 - v) = 48 - v

   t = (48 - v)/(6 - v)

2. If the train were slower by 6 km/hr, it would have taken 12 hours more than the scheduled time. This can be represented as:

   v - 6 * (t + 12) = distance
   v * t = distance

   Since the distance remains the same, we can equate the two expressions:

   v - 6 * (t + 12) = v * t

   Expanding the equation:

   v - 6t - 72 = vt

   Rearranging the terms:

   -6t - 72 = vt - v

   Factoring out 't' and 'v':

   -6t - vt = -72 - v

   t(-6 - v) = -72 - v

   t = (-72 - v)/(-6 - v)

Now, we can equate the two expressions for 't':

   (48 - v)/(6 - v) = (-72 - v)/(-6 - v)

   Cross-multiplying:

   (48 - v)(-6 - v) = (-72 - v)(6 - v)

   Expanding the equation:

   -288 - 48v + 6v + v^2 = -432 + 72v - 6v - v^2

   Rearranging the terms:

   -288 - 42v + v^2 = -432 + 66v - v^2

   Combining like terms:

   2v^2 - 108v + 144 = 0

   Dividing by 2:

   v^2 - 54v + 72 = 0

   Factoring the quadratic equation:

   (v - 36)(v - 2) = 0

   This gives us two possible values for 'v':

   v = 36 or v = 2

Since the speed cannot be 2 km/hr (as it would take an infinite amount of time to cover any distance), we take v = 36 km/hr.

Now, we can find the length of the journey by using the formula:

   distance = speed * time

   Substituting v = 36 km/hr and t = (48 - v)/(6 - v):

   distance = 36 * ((48 - 36)/(6 - 36))

   distance = 36 * (12/-30)

   distance = 36 * (-2/5)

   distance = 36 * -2/5

   distance = -72/5

   The length of the journey is -72/5 km.

However, since distance cannot be negative, there seems to be an issue with the problem or the solution."

Since the second angle is three times the first, its measure is 3x.

The third angle is 12 degrees less than twice the first, so its measure is 2x - 12.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

x + 3x + (2x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

6x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

6x = 192

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 32

Now that we have the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the other two angles:

Second angle: 3x = 3(32) = 96
Third angle: 2x - 12 = 2(32) - 12 = 52

So, the measures of the angles are 32, 96, and 52 degrees.

1. The total number of apples in all three bags is 24.
2. The first and second bags contain a total of 11 apples.
3. The second and third bags contain a total of 18 apples.

We can start by finding the number of apples in the second bag. Since the second and third bags contain 18 apples, and the first and second bags contain 11 apples, the difference in the number of apples between the second and third bags and the first and second bags is the number of apples in the third bag.

Let's denote the number of apples in the first bag as A, in the second bag as B, and in the third bag as C.

From the given information:

- A + B = 11 (Equation 1)
- B + C = 18 (Equation 2)
- A + B + C = 24 (Equation 3)

We can find the number of apples in the third bag by subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(B + C) - (A + B) = 18 - 11
C - A = 7

Now, we know that A + C = A + (A + 7) = 2A + 7.

Since A + B + C = 24, we can substitute the value of A + B from Equation 1:

A + B + C = 24
11 + C = 24
C = 13

Now that we have the number of apples in the third bag, we can find the number of apples in the first and third bags together:

A + C = 2A + 7
We know that C = 13
A + 13 = 2A + 7
2A - A = 13 - 7
A = 6

Now that we have the number of apples in the first bag, we can find the number of apples in the first and third bags together:

A + C = 6 + 13 = {19}"

1477,"If Mr. Brown and his son together had $220, and Mr. Brown had 10 times as much as his son, how much money had each?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the amount of money Mr. Brown's son has as 'x'. 
2. Since Mr. Brown has 10 times as much as his son, Mr. Brown has 10x.
3. The total amount of money they have together is $220. So, the equation becomes: x + 10x = 220
4. Combining like terms, we get: 11x = 220
5. To find the value of 'x', we divide both sides by 11: x = 220 / 11
6. x = 20. So, Mr. Brown's son has $20.
7. Since Mr. Brown has 10 times as much as his son, Mr. Brown has 10 * 20 = $200.

The final answer is: {Mr. Brown's son has $20, Mr. Brown has $200}."

   22 + 10 = 32

So, Robin now has {32} songs on her mp3 player."
836,The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. The total weight of 3 such watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. How much heavier is a watermelon than a pineapple?,"To find out how much heavier a watermelon is than a pineapple, we need to first calculate the total weight of 4 watermelons and 4 pineapples, and then the total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples.

1. The weight of 4 watermelons is 5 kg 200 g. To make calculations easier, let's convert this to grams: 
   5 kg = 5000 g
   5000 g + 200 g = 5200 g

2. The total weight of 3 such watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. Converting this to grams:
   5 kg = 5000 g
   5000 g + 700 g = 5700 g

3. Now, let's find the total weight of 4 watermelons and 4 pineapples. Since we know the weight of 4 watermelons (5200 g) and the weight of 3 watermelons (from the given weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples), we need to find the weight of 1 watermelon first. 

   The weight of 3 watermelons is (5700 g - 4 * weight of 1 pineapple) because the weight of 4 pineapples is not given. However, we can still proceed with the given information to find the weight of 1 watermelon.

   Let's denote the weight of 1 watermelon as 'w' and the weight of 1 pineapple as 'p'. We know that the weight of 4 watermelons is 5200 g and the weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5700 g. 

   So, we can write the equation as: 
   3w + 4p = 5700 g
   w + w = 5200 g (weight of 4 watermelons)
   4w = 5200 g + 4p
   4p = 5200 g - 4w
   4p = 4(5700 g - 3w) - 4w
   4p = 22800 g - 12w - 4w
   4p = 22800 g - 16w
   p = 5700 g - 4w

   Now, we have the weight of 1 pineapple in terms of the weight of 1 watermelon.

4. The weight of 4 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5200 g + 4p. Substituting the value of 'p' in terms of 'w', we get:
   5200 g + 4(5700 g - 4w)
   5200 g + 22800 g - 16w
   26800 g - 16w

5. Since we know the weight of 4 watermelons and 4 pineapples (26800 g - 16w) and the weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples (5700 g), we can set up an equation to find the weight of 1 watermelon:
   26800 g - 16w = 5700 g
   -16w = 5700 g - 26800 g
   -16w = -21100 g
   w = 1326.25 g

6. Now that we know the weight of 1 watermelon (1326.25 g), we can find the weight of 1 pineapple by substituting the value of 'w' in the equation p = 5700 g - 4w:
   p = 5700 g - 4 * 1326.25 g
   p = 5700 g - 5300 g
   p = 400 g

7. Finally, we can find the difference in weight between a watermelon and a pineapple:
   w - p = 1326.25 g - 400 g
   w - p = 926.25 g

2200,"Gwen's class is going on a field trip to the zoo. If each van can hold seven people and there are thirty-three students and nine adults going, how many vans will they need?","To determine the number of vans needed, we need to find the total number of people going on the field trip and divide that by the number of people each van can hold.

1. Calculate the total number of people:
   Total people = students + adults
   Total people = 33 + 9
   Total people = 42

2. Divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold:
   Number of vans = Total people / 7
   Number of vans = 42 / 7
   Number of vans = 6

However, we need to check if there are any remaining people after filling the vans. 

3. Calculate the remainder:
   Remainder = Total people % 7
   Remainder = 42 % 7
   Remainder = 0

Since the remainder is 0, it means all the people can be accommodated in the vans without any extra space. Therefore, they will need {6} vans."
1496,Math Magazine charges $8 per square inch for advertising. Jason decides to order a half page ad. Each page of the magazine measures 9 inches by 12 inches. How much will Jason have to pay?,"To find out how much Jason will have to pay, we need to calculate the area of the half page ad.

1. First, let's find the area of a full page:
   Area = Length * Width
   Area = 9 * 12
   Area = 108 square inches

2. Since Jason is ordering a half page ad, we need to find half of the area of a full page:
   Half Area = 108 / 2
   Half Area = 54 square inches

3. Now, we know that Math Magazine charges $8 per square inch for advertising. To find out how much Jason will have to pay, we multiply the half area by the cost per square inch:
   Cost = Half Area * Cost per square inch
   Cost = 54 * 8
   Cost = 432

So, Jason will have to pay {432}."

1. First, we divide 927 by 2 (the number of employees).
927 ÷ 2 = 463.5

Since we can't have a fraction of a uniform, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure each employee gets an equal number of uniforms.

2. We round up 463.5 to 464.

Now, we need to find out how many more uniforms the store owner should buy. 

3. We subtract the total number of uniforms he already has (927) from the total number of uniforms he needs (464 * 2 = 928).

Since the ratio of regular milk sold to chocolate milk sold is 7:2, we can set up the following proportion:

7 parts (regular milk) / 2 parts (chocolate milk) = 49 cartons (regular milk) / x cartons (chocolate milk)

We can cross-multiply and solve for x:

7x = 49 * 2
7x = 98
x = 98 / 7
x = 14

So, the cafeteria sold 14 cartons of chocolate milk.

Now, we can find the combined amount of chocolate and regular milk sold:

Combined amount = 49 cartons (regular milk) + 14 cartons (chocolate milk)
Combined amount = 63 cartons

If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?","To find out how many tickets each friend should get, we need to divide the total number of tickets by the number of friends.

Total tickets = 865
Number of friends = 9

Tickets per friend = Total tickets / Number of friends

= 96.11 (approximately)

Since we can't split tickets into fractions, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Each friend should get 96 tickets.

To find out how many tickets they need in total, we multiply the number of friends by the number of tickets each friend should get:

Total tickets needed = Number of friends * Tickets per friend
= 9 * 96

1434,"A man walks certain distance with certain speed. If he walks 1/2 km/hr faster, he takes 1 hr less. But if he walks 1 km/hr slower, he takes 3 more hours. Find the distance covered by the man and his original rate of walking.","Let's denote the original speed of the man as 'v' km/hr and the distance covered as 'd' km.

When the man walks 1/2 km/hr faster, his speed becomes v + 0.5 km/hr. In this case, he takes 1 hour less, so the time taken is d / (v + 0.5). 

We can set up an equation based on the fact that time is equal to distance divided by speed. The original time taken is d / v, and the time taken when he walks faster is d / (v + 0.5). Since he takes 1 hour less, we can write:

d / v - d / (v + 0.5) = 1

When the man walks 1 km/hr slower, his speed becomes v - 1 km/hr. In this case, he takes 3 hours more, so the time taken is d / (v - 1).

We can set up another equation based on the fact that time is equal to distance divided by speed. The original time taken is d / v, and the time taken when he walks slower is d / (v - 1). Since he takes 3 hours more, we can write:

d / (v - 1) - d / v = 3

Now we have two equations:

1) d / v - d / (v + 0.5) = 1
2) d / (v - 1) - d / v = 3

We can solve these equations to find the values of 'd' and 'v'.

First, let's simplify equation 1:

d / v - d / (v + 0.5) = 1
d(v + 0.5 - v) = v(v + 0.5)
0.5d = 0.5v^2 + 0.25v
d = v^2 + 0.5v

Now, let's simplify equation 2:

d / (v - 1) - d / v = 3
d(v - d / v) = 3v(v - 1)
dv - d^2 / v = 3v^2 - 3v
v^2 - dv + d = 3v^2 - 3v
2v^2 - dv - 3v + d = 0

Now we have two equations:

1) d = v^2 + 0.5v
2) 2v^2 - dv - 3v + d = 0

Substituting the value of 'd' from equation 1 into equation 2, we get:

2v^2 - v(v^2 + 0.5v) - 3v + v^2 + 0.5v = 0
2v^2 - v^3 - 0.5v^2 - 3v + v^2 + 0.5v = 0
-v^3 + 2.5v^2 - 2.5v = 0
-v(v^2 - 2.5v + 2.5) = 0
-v(v - 2.5)(v - 1) = 0

This gives us three possible values for 'v':

v = 0 (not possible, since speed cannot be zero)
v = 1
v = 2.5

Now, we can substitute these values of 'v' into equation 1 to find the corresponding values of 'd':

1) v = 1: d = v^2 + 0.5v = 1^2 + 0.5(1) = 1.5
2) v = 2.5: d = v^2 + 0.5v = 2.5^2 + 0.5(2.5) = 6.25 + 1.25 = 7.5

Therefore, the possible values of 'd' and 'v' are:

1) d = 1.5, v = 1
2) d = 7.5, v = 2.5

The final answer is {d = 7.5, v = 2.5}."

1408,A is two years older than B. A's father D is twice as old as A and B is twice old as his sister C. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years. Find the ages of A and B.,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of A as 'a' and the age of B as 'b'.
   Since A is two years older than B, we can write the equation: a = b + 2.

2. The age of D is twice as old as A, so we can write the equation: d = 2a.

3. The age of B is twice as old as C, so we can write the equation: b = 2c.

4. The ages of D and C differ by 40 years, so we can write the equation: d - c = 40.

Now, we can substitute the expressions for 'd' and 'b' from steps 2 and 3 into the equation from step 4.

d - c = 40
2a - c = 40

Substituting a = b + 2 from step 1 into the equation above:
2(b + 2) - c = 40
2b + 4 - c = 40

Now, we can substitute b = 2c from step 3 into the equation above:
2(2c) + 4 - c = 40
4c + 4 - c = 40
3c + 4 = 40

Now, we can solve for 'c':
3c = 36
c = 12

Now that we know the age of C, we can find the age of B:
b = 2c
b = 2(12)
b = 24

Now that we know the age of B, we can find the age of A:
a = b + 2
a = 24 + 2
a = 26

So, the ages of A and B are {26, 24}."

1. The weight of 5 foxes is 25 kg. To find the weight of a single fox, we divide the total weight by the number of foxes:
   Weight of a single fox = 25 kg / 5 = 5 kg

2. The total weight of 3 foxes and 5 dogs is 65 kg. To find the weight of the 3 foxes, we multiply the weight of a single fox by 3:
   Weight of 3 foxes = 5 kg * 3 = 15 kg

3. Now, we subtract the weight of the 3 foxes from the total weight to find the weight of the 5 dogs:
   Weight of 5 dogs = 65 kg - 15 kg = 50 kg

4. To find the weight of a single dog, we divide the total weight of the 5 dogs by 5:
   Weight of a single dog = 50 kg / 5 = 10 kg

5. Finally, we subtract the weight of a single fox from the weight of a single dog to find out how much heavier a dog is than a fox:
   Difference in weight = Weight of a single dog - Weight of a single fox = 10 kg - 5 kg = 5 kg

1. First, we need to find out how many Starbursts Sean gave to his friends. Since he gave equal numbers of Starbursts to his 18 friends, we divide the total number of Starbursts (45) by the number of friends (18).

   45 ÷ 18 = 2.5

   Since we can't give a fraction of a Starburst, we round down to 2 Starbursts per friend. However, this leaves 9 Starbursts unaccounted for (45 - 36 = 9). 

2. Now, we need to find out how many Starbursts each person ate, including Sean. Since there are 19 people in total (18 friends + Sean), we divide the remaining Starbursts (9) by the total number of people (19).

   9 ÷ 19 = 0.4737 (approximately)

   Since we can't eat a fraction of a Starburst, we round down to 0 Starbursts per person. However, this is incorrect as Sean ate the remaining Starbursts. 

3. To find the correct answer, we need to subtract 1 from the total number of people (since Sean ate the remaining Starbursts) and divide the remaining Starbursts (9) by the new total number of people (18).

   9 ÷ 18 = 0.5

   Since we can't eat a fraction of a Starburst, we round down to 0 Starbursts per person is incorrect. However, we can round up to 1 Starburst per person is also incorrect as the question asks for how many Starbursts each person ate and not how many Starbursts each person got. 

4. Since Sean ate the remaining Starbursts, we need to find out how many Starbursts each person got and then add 1 to that the number of Starbursts each person ate.

1347,If the second angle is 32 degree less than thrice the first angle and the third angle is 28 degree less than twice the first angle. Find the angles of the triangle.,"To find the angles of the triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

Let's denote the first angle as A, the second angle as B, and the third angle as C.

We are given the following information:

1. The second angle (B) is 32 degrees less than thrice the first angle (A): B = 3A - 32
2. The third angle (C) is 28 degrees less than twice the first angle (A): C = 2A - 28

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can write the equation:

A + B + C = 180

Substituting the expressions for B and C from the given information, we get:

A + (3A - 32) + (2A - 28) = 180

Combine like terms:

6A - 60 = 180

Add 60 to both sides:

6A = 240

Divide by 6:

A = 40

Now that we have the value of A, we can find the values of B and C:

B = 3A - 32 = 3(40) - 32 = 120 - 32 = 88
C = 2A - 28 = 2(40) - 28 = 80 - 28 = 52

GCD of 18 and 20 is 2.

Step 5: Since Aylin wants to create pages with the same combination of photos and newspaper clippings, and no items left over, the number of pages she can create is equal to the GCD of 18 and 20 divided by the number of items on each page. 
However, since we don't know the number of items on each page, we can assume that Aylin will put the GCD number of items on each page. 

Step 6: Since Aylin has 18 photos and 20 newspaper clippings, and the GCD is 2, she can create 2 photos and 2 newspaper clippings on each page. 
To find the greatest number of scrapbook pages, we divide the total number of items by the number of items on each page. 
Total number of items = 18 (photos) + 20 (newspaper clippings) = 38. 
Number of items on each page = 2 (photos) + 2 (newspaper clippings) = 4.

   However, since we can't have a fraction of a fish, and we know that we have 3 penguins left, we will give them a fish each, but we have 49 fish left and we have given 19 fish to the penguins, so the number of fish left is 49 - 19 = 30, and we have 3 penguins that need a fish each, so we have 3 * 1 = 3 fish to give to the penguins, so we have 30 - 3 = 27 fish left."

1507,Grandma has an old family recipe for blueberry pancakes. She can make 8 pancakes that are each 10 inches in diameter. Grandma decided that the pancakes were way too large for her grandchildren and decided to make pancakes that were only 2 inches in diameter. How many small pancakes will Grandma's recipe make?,"To find out how many small pancakes Grandma's recipe will make, we need to compare the area of the large pancakes to the area of the small pancakes.

1. Calculate the area of one large pancake: 
   Area = πr^2, where r is the radius of the pancake.
   Since the diameter of the large pancake is 10 inches, the radius is 5 inches.
   Area = π(5)^2 = 25π square inches.

2. Calculate the area of one small pancake:
   Since the diameter of the small pancake is 2 inches, the radius is 1 inch.
   Area = π(1)^2 = π square inches.

3. Find the ratio of the area of the small pancake to the area of the large pancake:
   Ratio = Area of small pancake / Area of large pancake
   Ratio = π / (25π)
   Ratio = 1 / 25

4. Since the recipe makes 8 large pancakes, we can multiply the ratio by 8 to find the number of small pancakes:
   Number of small pancakes = Ratio * 8
   Number of small pancakes = (1 / 25) * 8
   Number of small pancakes = 8 / 25

So, {8/25}"

2092,A teacher is to arrange 60 boys and 72 girls in rows. He wishes to arrange them in such a way that only boys or girls will be there in a row. Find the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row.,"To find the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row, we need to consider the maximum number of boys or girls that can be in a row. 

Since the teacher wants to arrange them in such a way that only boys or girls will be there in a row, we need to find the maximum number between the number of boys and the number of girls.

Number of boys = 60
Number of girls = 72

The maximum number is 72 (number of girls).

Now, we need to find the greatest number of students that can be arranged in a row with 72 girls. This can be done by dividing the total number of girls by the number of rows.

However, since we are looking for the maximum number of students that can be arranged in a row, we should consider the scenario where the remaining students (boys) are also arranged in a row. 

To maximize the number of students in a row, we should minimize the number of rows. 

Since the number of rows must be a factor of the total number of students, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of boys and the number of girls to minimize the number of rows.

GCD of 60 and 72 = 12

Now, we can divide the total number of students by the GCD to find the number of rows.

Total number of students = 60 + 72 = 132
Number of rows = 132 / 12 = 11

Now, we can find the greatest number of students that can be arranged in a row by multiplying the number of rows by the maximum number of students per row.

Maximum number of students per row = 72
Number of rows = 11

Greatest number of students that can be arranged in a row = 72 * 11 = 792

1. The school wants 4 teams with the same number of students on each team.
2. To divide the students evenly into 4 teams, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 that is also divisible by 4. 
3. The GCD of 14 and 4 is 2, since 2 is the largest number that divides both 14 and 4 without a remainder.
4. To find the number of students per team, we divide 14 by the GCD (2), which equals 7 students per team.
5. Since each team should have 7 students and there are 4 teams, the total number of students needed is 7 * 4 = 28.
6. The school currently has 14 students signed up, so to reach 28 students, they need 28 - 14 = 14 more students.

1433,A railway half ticket costs half the full fare and the reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket. One reserved first class from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216 and one full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327. What is the basic first class full fare and what is the reservation charge?,"Let's denote the basic first class full fare as F and the reservation charge as R.

1. A half ticket costs half the full fare, so the cost of a half ticket is F/2.
2. The reservation charge is the same on half ticket as on full ticket, so the cost of a half ticket with reservation is F/2 + R.
3. One reserved first class ticket from Michigan to Massachusetts costs $216, so F + R = 216.
4. One full and one half reserved first class tickets cost $327, so F + (F/2 + R) = 327.

Now, let's simplify the second equation:

F + F/2 + R = 327
(2F + F)/2 + R = 327
(3F)/2 + R = 327

Now we have two equations:

F + R = 216
(3F)/2 + R = 327

Let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate R:

(3F)/2 + R - (F + R) = 327 - 216
(3F)/2 - F = 111

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3F - 2F = 222
F = 222

Now that we have F, we can find R by substituting F into one of the original equations:

F + R = 216
222 + R = 216

Subtract 222 from both sides:

R = -6

However, the reservation charge cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's go back to the second equation:

F + F/2 + R = 327

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2F + F + 2R = 654
3F + 2R = 654

Now we have two equations:

F + R = 216
3F + 2R = 654

Multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of R the same:

2F + 2R = 432
3F + 2R = 654

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate R:

3F - 2F = 654 - 432
F = 222

Now that we have F, we can find R by substituting F into one of the original equations:

F + R = 216
222 + R = 216

Subtract 222 from both sides:

R = -6

However, the reservation charge cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's go back to the first equation:

F + R = 216

Multiply both sides by 2 to make the coefficients of R the same:

2F + 2R = 432

Now we have two equations:

2F + 2R = 432
3F + 2R = 654

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate R:

3F - 2F = 654 - 432
F = 222

Now that we have F, we can find R by substituting F into one of the original equations:

F + R = 216
222 + R = 216

Subtract 222 from both sides:

R = -6

However, the reservation charge cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Let's go back to the first equation:

F + R = 216

Multiply both sides by 3 to make the coefficients of R the same:

3F + 3R = 648

Now we have two equations:

3F + 3R = 648
3F + 2R = 654

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate R:

3F + 2R - (3F + 3R) = 654 - 648
- R = -6

Divide both sides by -1:

R = 6

Now that we have R, we can find F by substituting R into one of the original equations:

F + R = 216
F + 6 = 216

Subtract 6 from both sides:

F = 210

So, the basic first class full fare is {210} and the reservation charge is {6}."

1. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as 'x'. Since the longer piece is 10 inches longer than the shorter piece, its length would be 'x + 10'.

2. The total length of the two pieces is given as 40 inches. So, we can set up an equation: x + (x + 10) = 40.

3. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 10 = 40.

4. Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with 'x': 2x = 30.

5. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for 'x': x = 15.

Therefore, the shorter piece is 15 inches long. {15}"

1. The two-digit number can be represented as 10a + b, where 'a' is the tens digit and 'b' is the units digit.

2. The sum of the two digits is 9, so we can write an equation: a + b = 9.

3. When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10b + a.

4. According to the problem, the new number is increased by 9, so we can write another equation: (10b + a) - (10a + b) = 9.

5. Simplifying the equation, we get: 9b - 9a = 9.

6. Dividing both sides by 9, we get: b - a = 1.

7. Now we have two equations: a + b = 9 and b - a = 1.

8. Adding the two equations, we get: 2b = 10.

9. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: b = 5.

1. Let's denote the length of the lot as 'L' and the width as 'W'. We know that the width is twice the length, so we can write this as W = 2L.

2. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width). In this case, the perimeter is 60 feet. So, we can write the equation as 60 = 2(L + W).

3. Substitute W = 2L from step 1 into the equation from step 2: 60 = 2(L + 2L).

4. Simplify the equation: 60 = 2(3L), which becomes 60 = 6L.

5. Divide both sides by 6 to solve for L: L = 60 / 6, which simplifies to L = 10.

6. Now that we have the length, we can find the width using W = 2L from step 1: W = 2(10), which simplifies to W = 20.

Step 3: Add the miles walked on Monday and Tuesday to find the total miles walked.
9 miles (Monday) + 18 miles (Tuesday) = 27 miles

So, Jerry walked {27} miles."
2009,"The school cafeteria ordered 25 red apples and 17 green apples for students lunches. But, if only 10 students wanted fruit, how many extra did the cafeteria end up with?","To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we need to calculate the total number of apples ordered and subtract the number of apples given to the students.

1. Calculate the total number of apples ordered:
   Total apples = Red apples + Green apples
   Total apples = 25 + 17
   Total apples = 42

2. Calculate the number of apples given to the students:
   Since only 10 students wanted fruit, and we assume each student got one fruit, the number of apples given is 10.

3. Calculate the number of extra apples:
   Extra apples = Total apples - Apples given to students
   Extra apples = 42 - 10
   Extra apples = 32

So, the cafeteria ended up with {32} extra apples."
1468,Two angles of a triangle are the same size. The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle. Find the measure the angles.,"Let's denote the measure of the first angle as x. Since the two angles are the same size, the measure of the second angle is also x.

The third angle is 12 degrees smaller than the first angle, so its measure is x - 12.

The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. We can write this as an equation:

x + x + (x - 12) = 180

Combine like terms:

3x - 12 = 180

Add 12 to both sides:

3x = 192

Divide by 3:

x = 64

Now that we know the measure of the first angle, we can find the measures of the other two angles:

The second angle is also x, which is 64 degrees.

The third angle is x - 12, which is 64 - 12 = 52 degrees.

So, the measures of the angles are 64, 64, and 52 degrees.

1248,Jawbreakers come in packages of 8. Sarah ate 20 Jawbreakers. How many Jawbreakers does she have left?,"To find out how many Jawbreakers Sarah has left, we need to subtract the number of Jawbreakers she ate (20) from the total number of Jawbreakers in a package (8).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of Jawbreakers Sarah started with.
Since Jawbreakers come in packages of 8, we can assume she started with at least one package. 

Step 2: Determine the number of Jawbreakers she ate in full packages.
20 Jawbreakers / 8 Jawbreakers per package = 2.5 packages. Since she can't eat a fraction of a package, she ate 2 full packages (16 Jawbreakers) and some Jawbreakers from a third package.

Step 3: Calculate the number of Jawbreakers she ate from the third package.
Since she ate 20 Jawbreakers in total and 16 Jawbreakers from the first two packages, she ate 20 - 16 = 4 Jawbreakers from the third package.

Step 4: Calculate the number of Jawbreakers left in the third package.
Since the third package contains 8 Jawbreakers and she ate 4, she has 8 - 4 = 4 Jawbreakers left.

Step 5: Calculate the total number of Jawbreakers Sarah has left.
She has 4 Jawbreakers left from the third package.

1548,"Megan had five hundred sixteen pennies. She wanted to place the pennies into nine stacks, with the same amount in each stack. How many more pennies would she need so all the stacks would be equal?","To find out how many pennies Megan needs, we need to divide the total number of pennies (516) by the number of stacks (9).

516 ÷ 9 = 57.3333333333

Since we can't have a fraction of a penny, we need to round down to the nearest whole number to find out how many pennies each stack can have. 

However, we need to find out how many pennies Megan needs to make all the stacks equal. We know that each stack should have 57 pennies, but she only has 516 pennies, which is not enough to make 9 stacks of 57 pennies.

To find out how many pennies she needs, we multiply the number of stacks by the number of pennies each stack should have and then subtract the total number of pennies she has.

9 * 57 = 513

Now, subtract the total number of pennies she has from the total number of pennies she needs:

513 - 516 = -3

Since we can't have a negative number of pennies, this means that Megan actually has 3 more pennies than she needs to make all the stacks equal.

So, she would need to give away 3 pennies to make all the stacks equal.

In order to use the least number of barrels and have every barrel fully occupied, how many small barrels should be used?","To find the least number of barrels needed to store 95 tons of oil, we need to use a combination of large and small barrels.

1. First, let's calculate how many large barrels can be used. Since each large barrel can hold 6 tons of oil, we divide the total amount of oil (95 tons) by the capacity of a large barrel (6 tons).

   95 / 6 = 15.83 (round down to 15 since we can't use a fraction of a barrel)

   So, we can use 15 large barrels to store 15 * 6 = 90 tons of oil.

2. Now, we need to find out how much oil is left to be stored. 

   95 - 90 = 5 tons

   Since we can't use a fraction of a barrel, we need to use small barrels to store the remaining 5 tons of oil.

3. We know that each small barrel can hold 5 tons of oil. To store 5 tons of oil, we need 1 small barrel.

Therefore, the least number of small barrels needed to store the remaining oil is {1}."

342,"For the first main dish, they were asked to cook steak. If the third and second team cooked 240 plates of steak. And the first team cooked 75 plates less than what the second and third team made, how many steaks did they cook altogether?","To find the total number of steaks cooked, we need to calculate the number of steaks cooked by each team and then add them together.

Let's start by finding the number of steaks cooked by the second and third teams. We know they cooked 240 plates of steak together.

Since the first team cooked 75 plates less than the second and third teams combined, we can calculate the number of steaks cooked by the first team as follows:

Number of steaks cooked by the first team = Number of steaks cooked by the second and third teams - 75
= 240 - 75
= 165

Now, we have the number of steaks cooked by each team:

- First team: 165
- Second team: 240
- Third team: 240

To find the total number of steaks cooked, we add the number of steaks cooked by each team:

Total number of steaks cooked = 165 + 240 + 240
= 645
