Block B has one medium black square and one medium blue square. The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block. It is below the medium blue square. Block C has two medium yellow squares. Below medium yellow square number two there is medium yellow square number one. Which object is below a medium yellow square? the medium blue square that is in block A or the medium blue square which is in block B??
0) the medium blue square  that is in block A
1) the medium blue square  which is in block B
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Block C is above Block B, and Block B is above Block A.
2. Block C has two medium yellow squares, with medium yellow square number one below medium yellow square number two.
3. Since Block C is above Block B, the medium yellow squares in Block C are above Block B.
4. Block B has a medium blue square above a medium black square, and the medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
5. Since Block B is above Block A, the medium black square in Block B is above Block A.
6. Block A contains a medium black square, and below a medium blue square, there is the medium black square in Block A.

Now, considering the positions of the blocks and the squares within them:

- The medium yellow squares in Block C are above Block B.
- The medium blue square in Block B is above the medium black square in Block B and is below the medium yellow squares in Block C.
- The medium blue square in Block A is above the medium black square in Block A but is not directly below the medium yellow squares in Block C because Block B is in between Block C and Block A.

Therefore, the medium blue square that is directly below a medium yellow square is the one in Block B.

1577,"We have two blocks. We call them A and B. Block A is to the right of B. Block A contains a medium black circle and one small black circle. A medium black square is to the right of and below the small black circle. The small black circle is touching the top edge of this block. The medium black circle is touching the right edge of this block. It is to the right of the small black circle. Block B contains a big black triangle and a small yellow square. Above and to the right of the small yellow square there is the big black triangle. Which object is to the right of a black triangle? the medium black square or the small yellow square??
0) the medium black square 
1) the small yellow square 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is to the right of a black triangle, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The big black triangle is located in Block B.
2. In Block B, the big black triangle is above and to the right of the small yellow square. This means the small yellow square is to the left and below the big black triangle, not to its right.
3. Since Block A is to the right of Block B, all objects in Block A are to the right of all objects in Block B, including the big black triangle.
4. The medium black square is located in Block A.

Given these points, the medium black square in Block A is to the right of the big black triangle in Block B. The small yellow square is not to the right of the big black triangle but rather to its left and below.

Therefore, the correct answer is: {0}"
3104,"We have three blocks. Lets call them A, B and C. Block C is to the left of A and block A is below B. Block A has one medium yellow square. Block B contains two medium yellow squares.

0) medium blue square  number one
1) medium blue square  number two
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Block C is below B.
2. Block A is to the left of C, but its position relative to B is not directly stated. However, since C is below B, and A is to the left of C, A's vertical position relative to B is not directly relevant to the question about what is below the black shape in B.
3. Block B has one medium black square and one medium blue square, with the medium black square below the medium blue square.
4. The question asks what is below the black shape in block B.

Given the arrangement in block B, we know the black square is below the blue square within B. However, the question seems to be asking about the relationship of the black square in B to the squares in block C, given the phrasing.

Since block C is below block B, and we know the arrangement within C (medium blue square number three is above medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two, with medium blue square number one below medium blue square number two), we need to determine the relationship of the black square in B to the squares in C.

However, the critical piece of information is that the black square in B is above the topmost element of C, given B is above C. The specific arrangement within C (regarding blue squares one, two, and three) does not directly impact what is immediately below the black square in B, as the question seems to imply a direct vertical relationship between the black square in B and the elements of C.

Given the arrangement described, the black square in B is directly above the topmost element of C, which is described as medium blue square number three. However, the options provided do not include medium blue square number three as an answer, but rather ask about medium blue square number one or two.

Since medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two, and both are below medium blue square number three (which is directly below the black square in B by the block arrangement), neither medium blue square number one nor number two is directly below the black square in B. However, the question's framing and the provided options suggest looking for a relationship that isn't directly described by the given block arrangement.

Given the constraints and aiming to align with the question's apparent intent, but strictly interpreting the options provided:

- Medium blue square number one and two are both below the black square in the sense that they are in block C, which is below block B, but neither is directly below the black square in a way that the question's options seem to imply.

However, considering the question's framing might be aiming towards understanding the relative positioning in a more abstract or indirect sense, or there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the question's intent:

Considering the direct options provided and aiming for the closest logical match based on the given block arrangement and question framing:

Finally, we have block C which is above block A. It contains one medium blue square. What is to the right of the black thing? a blue thing or a medium yellow square??
0) blue thing
1) medium yellow square 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine what is to the right of the black thing (medium black square), let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The medium black square is in block A.
2. Block B is to the right of block A.
3. Block B contains three medium yellow squares.

From the above points, it is clear that the medium yellow squares in block B are to the right of the medium black square in block A.

Now, let's consider the other option, the blue thing (medium blue square):

1. The medium blue square is in block C.
2. Block C is above block A.

Since block C is above block A, not to the right, the medium blue square is not to the right of the medium black square.

Therefore, the correct answer is that a medium yellow square is to the right of the black thing.

From points 2 and 3, we can conclude that in Block A, the order from top to bottom is:
- Medium yellow square number two
- Medium blue square
- Medium yellow square number one

Now, let's look at the question: Which object is above a medium blue square? medium yellow square number two or the medium yellow square which is touching the bottom edge of a block?

Given the arrangement in Block A, medium yellow square number two is above the medium blue square. On the other hand, the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of the block (medium yellow square number one) is below the medium blue square.

Therefore, the object above a medium blue square is medium yellow square number two.

3. The small yellow square is below the small blue triangle and to the right of the medium blue circle.
4. There is no mention of a medium yellow triangle in block C.

Given this information, we can conclude that the small yellow square is below the small blue triangle, and the small blue triangle is above the medium blue circle. However, the question asks what is below the medium blue circle, not above it. Since the small yellow square is to the right of and presumably below or level with the medium blue circle, and the small blue triangle is above the medium blue circle, we can conclude that the small blue triangle is not below the medium blue circle.

However, we also need to consider the blocks A and B. Block A contains a medium yellow triangle, but it is not in block C, where the medium blue circle is located. Block B does not have a medium yellow triangle.

3. Block B contains two medium yellow squares, with medium yellow square number one below medium yellow square number two.

Given the arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block A is above medium black square number two, and there is no medium yellow square to its left within Block A. However, considering the blocks' arrangement, Block A (which contains the medium yellow square) is to the left of Block B, which contains medium yellow square number one and number two.

Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the left of medium yellow square number one (and number two) in Block B.

1. Block A has two medium yellow squares. The arrangement within Block A does not include any blue shapes, so neither of the yellow squares in Block A is below a blue shape based on the information about Block A alone.

2. Block B contains a medium yellow square, a medium blue square, and one medium black square. The arrangement in Block B is such that the medium blue square is below the medium black square, and the medium yellow square is below both the medium black square and the medium blue square.

2. Block B, to the right of block A, contains two medium blue squares and one medium yellow square.
3. Block C, to the left of block A, contains one medium black square and one medium yellow square.

Now, let's examine the options:

- Medium blue square number two is in block B, and it is below the medium yellow square. This means the medium yellow square is above medium blue square number two. Therefore, medium blue square number two is to the right of the medium yellow square in block C (if considering the overall arrangement) but directly below the medium yellow square in its own block.
  
- The medium blue square in block A has block C to its left, which contains a medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium blue square in block A is to the right of the medium yellow square in block C.

- Medium black square number one is below the medium yellow square and medium black square number two.

Block C has a medium blue square and is below block B.

Given this information, we are trying to determine which object is above a medium blue square: medium black square number two or medium black square number one.

In block A, the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square. 

In block B and C, since block C is below block B and block C contains the medium blue square, any square in block B could potentially be above the medium blue square in block C. However, we know the specific arrangement in block B: medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and the medium yellow square. Therefore, medium black square number one cannot be above the medium blue square in block C because it is the lowest square in block B.

However, medium black square number two and the medium yellow square in block B could be above the medium blue square in block C. But we are comparing medium black square number two and medium black square number one. Since medium black square number two is above medium black square number one in block B, and block B is above block C, medium black square number two is the one that could be above the medium blue square in block C.

5. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.
6. The medium yellow square is below the medium black square.

From points 3 and 6, we know that both a medium blue square (number one) and the medium yellow square are below the medium black square. 

From point 4, we also know that medium blue square number two is below the medium black square and the medium yellow square. However, given the relationship between the yellow square and the black square (point 6), and that blue square number two is below both, it means blue square number two must actually be below the yellow square which is itself below the black square. This means blue square number two cannot be directly below the black square; it's below another object (the yellow square) that is below the black square.

Given the constraints, the only medium blue square that could be directly below the black square is medium blue square number one.

Since the question asks what is below the black object, comparing the options given:

- It cannot be the medium blue square in block A because the question's context about positions is all within block B.
- It cannot be medium blue square number two because, while it is below the black square in a broader sense, it is more accurately described as being below the yellow square, which is itself below the black square.

- In Block B, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square, not to its right.
- Since Block C is to the right of Block A, and Block A contains a medium yellow square, Block C (which contains the medium blue square) is to the right of a medium yellow square (the one in Block A).

Therefore, the object that is to the right of a medium yellow square is the medium blue square.

1. Block A contains the medium yellow square.
2. Block B is below Block A and contains a medium black square.
3. Block C is also below Block A but its position relative to Block B is not explicitly stated in a way that suggests they are on the same level. However, Block C's contents and the overall description imply a vertical arrangement for the blocks, with Block C likely being below or on the same level as Block B given the shared relationship to Block A.

Given the arrangement:
- Directly below the yellow shape (Block A) is Block B with a medium black square.
- Block C, also below Block A, contains two medium black squares, but its exact positioning relative to Block B isn't specified in a way that directly compares their vertical alignment.

However, considering the question's focus on what is directly below the yellow shape and the provided descriptions, the most direct and explicitly stated relationship is that Block B is below Block A.

Given this information, we are asked to determine which object is below a medium blue square: medium black square number one or the medium black square that is in block C.

- For block A and B, since block B is above block A and contains the medium blue square, and given the arrangement in block A, none of the medium black squares in block A are directly below the medium blue square in block B based on the block arrangement.

- For block C, the medium yellow square is below both the medium black square and the medium blue square. However, it is also stated that the medium blue square is below the medium black square. This means the medium black square in block C is above the medium blue square, not below it.

1. Block A is above block C and to the right of block B.
2. Block B contains one medium black square.
3. Since block A is to the right of block B, and block B contains a medium black square, block A (which includes medium blue square number one) is to the right of a medium square (the medium black square in block B).
4. Block C contains a medium blue square, and block A is above block C. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state the horizontal relationship between block C and block B. But since block A is above block C and to the right of block B, we can infer that block C is likely below block B or at the same horizontal level as block B but the problem doesn't give us information about block C being to the right of block B. However block A is above block C so block C can't be above block B. Block C could be below block B or at the same level as block B and to the left or to the right of block B. If block C is to the right of block B then the medium blue square in block C would be to the right of the medium black square in block B. If block C is to the left of or below block B then the medium blue square in block C would not be to the right of the medium black square in block B.
5. Given the information provided, we can confirm that medium blue square number one (in block A) is to the right of a medium square (the medium black square in block B). However, without more specific information about the position of block C relative to block B, we cannot definitively conclude the position of the medium blue square in block C relative to a medium square (the medium black square in block B) based on the information given.

However since we know that block A is to the right of block B and above block C it is possible for block C to be to the right of block B and below block A.

Given this arrangement, the medium black square in block A has block C to its right, which means the medium black square in block A is to the left of block C. Therefore, the medium black square in block A is to the left of the medium blue squares in block C, but it is the medium black square in block A that has block C (and thus medium squares) to its right.

The medium black square in block C is above the medium blue squares, meaning it is above and not to the right of the medium blue squares in block C.

However, considering the question asks which object is to the right of a medium square, we must also consider the medium black square in block B. Since block C is to the right of both blocks A and B, the medium black square in block B also has block C (and its medium squares) to its right.

Therefore, both the medium black square in block A and the medium black square in block B have medium squares (those in block C) to their right, but the question specifically asks about the medium black squares in blocks A and C.

Now, let's look at Block B. Although Block B contains a small yellow circle, the medium blue circle is not in Block B. However, since Block B is above Block A, we can consider the relative positions of the shapes. The small yellow circle in Block B is not directly related to the medium blue circle in Block A.

However, considering the overall arrangement of the blocks, the small yellow circle in Block B is indeed above the medium blue circle in Block A, because Block B is above Block A.

3. Block C is above Block A and contains two medium yellow squares and a medium blue square. The arrangement in Block C doesn't affect what's to the right of Block A directly.

Given the arrangement in Block B, there is a medium yellow square above one of the medium blue squares. However, one of the medium blue squares is touching the bottom edge of Block B because it's described as being below the other medium blue square and the medium yellow square.

Therefore, to the right of the black object (medium black square in Block A), there is a block (Block B) that contains both a medium yellow square and a medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block B.

1. Block A is to the left of Block B.
2. Block A contains a small blue circle and a big black circle.
3. Block B contains a medium blue square, a small yellow triangle, and a big yellow triangle.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, everything in Block A is to the left of everything in Block B. Therefore, the small blue circle (which is in Block A) is to the left of the big yellow triangle (which is in Block B).

The small yellow triangle is in the same block as the big yellow triangle (Block B) and is described as being near to it, along with the medium blue square. However, the question asks what is to the left of the big yellow triangle, not what is near to it within the same block.

Block A is to the left of Block B, and Block C is below Block B. 

- The medium yellow square in Block A is to the left of both medium yellow squares in Block B because Block A is to the left of Block B.
- The medium yellow square in Block C does not have any medium yellow squares to its right within its own block. However, considering the overall arrangement, Block C is below Block B, not to the left or right of any block containing a medium yellow square. But since Block A is to the left of Block B and Block C is below Block B, Block A is to the left of Block C's vertical line. Therefore, Block A's medium yellow square is to the left of Block C's medium yellow square.

Given the question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, the correct answer involves identifying which medium yellow square is to the left of another medium yellow square. Since Block A's medium yellow square is to the left of Block B's and also effectively to the left of Block C's medium yellow square when considering the overall layout, the medium yellow square in Block A meets the criteria.

However, the question's phrasing seems to ask which of the medium yellow squares (the one in Block C or the one in Block A) is to the left of another medium yellow square. The medium yellow square in Block A is to the left of the ones in Block B, fulfilling the condition directly. The medium yellow square in Block C does not have another medium yellow square to its right within its block but is to the right of Block A's medium yellow square when considering the overall layout. Therefore, the correct interpretation based on the given layout and question seems to focus on the direct comparison between Block A and Block B for the ""to the left"" condition.

Thus, the most fitting answer based on the direct comparison and the layout provided is:

2. The big blue square in Block C is to the right of the big black circle.
3. We are asked to compare the positions of the small yellow square (in Block B) and the medium blue square (in Block B) relative to a black thing.

Since the big black circle is in Block C, and Block B is to the right of Block C, we can conclude that Block B as a whole is to the right of the big black circle.

Now, let's examine the options:

0) The small yellow square which is touching the right edge of a block: This square is in Block B, which is to the right of Block C containing the big black circle. Therefore, it is indeed to the right of a black thing.

1) The medium blue square: This square is also in Block B, which is to the right of Block C containing the big black circle. Therefore, it is also to the right of a black thing.

3. Block B contains one medium yellow square.
4. Block C has three medium black squares and one medium yellow square.

- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two, which is below medium black square number three.
- The medium yellow square in Block C is below medium black square number two.

Since the medium yellow square is below medium black square number two, and considering the vertical arrangement does not affect left or right positioning, we look at the horizontal arrangement. The question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square within Block C. Given the blocks' arrangement and focusing on Block C's internal arrangement:

- Medium black square number one and medium black square number two are both above the medium yellow square in Block C, but given the description, it's about vertical positioning within Block C, not left or right. However, considering the overall structure and the question's phrasing, it seems to be asking about the relative left position in the context of Block C's internal arrangement and its relation to Block B's yellow square.

However, the actual question seems to be asking about the left position relative to a medium yellow square, which could be interpreted in two contexts: within Block C or considering the blocks' arrangement. Since Block B is to the right of Block C and contains a medium yellow square, any square in Block C would be to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B. But within Block C, the description doesn't directly imply left or right positioning between the black squares and the yellow square.

Given the ambiguity and focusing strictly on the information that Block C's arrangement doesn't specify left or right for its internal squares but considering the overall blocks' arrangement:

Both medium black square number one and medium black square number two are in Block C, which is to the left of Block B, which contains a medium yellow square. Therefore, both are to the left of a medium yellow square when considering the arrangement of blocks.

However, we are asked which object is below a medium yellow square: the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block or medium yellow square number two.

Since medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B and is below medium yellow square number two, it cannot be below another medium yellow square. 

On the other hand, medium yellow square number two has medium yellow square number one below it.

Since Block A does not contain a medium blue square, the medium yellow square in Block A cannot be to the right of a medium blue square within its own block. However, considering the overall arrangement, Block A is to the left of Block C, which contains a medium blue square. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block A is indeed to the right of no medium blue square within its block, but Block A itself is to the left of a block with a blue square.

Block B contains two medium blue squares and one medium yellow square. The medium yellow square is below the second medium blue square and above the first medium blue square.

Block C contains a medium blue square and a medium black square, with the medium blue square below the medium black square.

2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Block A is to the left of Block B.
2. Block A contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square. The arrangement is such that medium blue square number one is at the bottom, medium blue square number two is above it, and the medium black square is below medium blue square number two but above medium blue square number one.
3. Block B contains two medium black squares, with medium black square number one below medium black square number two.

Given the arrangement, we want to find out which object is to the right of a medium blue square.

- Since Block A is to the left of Block B, any square in Block B will be to the right of any square in Block A.
- Medium black square number one is in Block B, so it is to the right of the medium blue squares in Block A.
- The medium black square in Block A is not to the right of the medium blue squares in its own block; it is actually below one of them and above the other.

Therefore, the object that is definitely to the right of a medium blue square is medium black square number one in Block B.

1. Block A contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square. The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of this block and is below the medium black square. This means the medium black square in block A is above a medium yellow square.

2. Block B contains only one medium black square. There's no information about a medium yellow square in this block, so we cannot conclude that the medium black square in block B is above a medium yellow square based on the information about block B alone.

3. However, considering the arrangement of the blocks (C is above A and below B), and knowing that block C also has a medium yellow square at its bottom edge, this means block B is above block C's medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium black square in block B is indeed above a medium yellow square, but this yellow square is in block C, not in block B itself.

Given this analysis, both the medium black square in block A and the medium black square in block B are above a medium yellow square, albeit the yellow squares are in different blocks.

Block A has a small blue triangle and a medium yellow triangle, but neither of these is directly related to the question about what is above the big yellow circle in block C.

Block B contains a big yellow triangle, a medium yellow circle, and a medium black square. The big yellow triangle is to the left of the medium yellow circle and the medium black square. Since block C is below blocks A and B, the elements in block B that are directly above block C are relevant to the question.

Given that block C has a big yellow circle and considering the arrangement of block B, both the big yellow triangle and the medium black square could potentially be above the big yellow circle in block C, depending on the exact positioning of block B in relation to block C. However, since the question does not provide precise alignment details, but given the layout, it's reasonable to infer that both elements could be considered above the big yellow circle in block C due to their presence in block B.

3) none of them","To determine which object is to the left of a medium blue square, let's analyze the positions of the blocks and the squares within them.

Block A has a medium yellow square and a medium blue square, with the yellow square below the blue square. Block B is to the right of Block A and has one medium blue square. Block C is below Block B and has a medium black square and a medium blue square, with the black square below the blue square.

Given the arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the left of the medium blue square in Block A (within the same block, considering the vertical arrangement but focusing on the horizontal aspect within the block, the yellow square is directly below and therefore in line with the blue square, making it 'to the left' in a broad sense when comparing their positions relative to each other in a vertical alignment).

For Block C, the medium black square is below the medium blue square, which means it is also to the left of the medium blue square in a similar vertical alignment comparison.

However, when considering the question's intent, it seems to be asking about the horizontal arrangement between blocks rather than within them. In this case, Block A's medium blue square is to the left of Block B's medium blue square because Block A is to the left of Block B. Similarly, Block C's medium blue square does not have a medium blue square to its right within the context of the blocks described; instead, it has Block B's medium blue square above it, not to its right or left in the direct sense of block positioning.

Considering the question's phrasing, the focus seems to be on which medium blue square (Block A's or Block C's) has an object to its left. The medium yellow square is to the left (or more accurately, directly below, but within the same vertical line) of the medium blue square in Block A. The medium black square in Block C is below (and thus in a vertical line with, but not to the left in the horizontal sense) the medium blue square in Block C.

However, interpreting the question strictly in terms of horizontal positioning between blocks and considering objects within blocks:

- The medium yellow square in Block A is to the left of the medium blue square in Block B (when considering inter-block positioning), but within Block A, it's about the vertical positioning.
- The medium black square in Block C does not have a direct horizontal relationship with a medium blue square to its right within the block description provided; it's below the medium blue square in Block C.

Given the complexity and the need to clarify the question's intent:

- If we consider the question as asking which object is to the left of a medium blue square within the same block or in the overall arrangement considering vertical alignments, both the medium yellow square in Block A and the medium black square in Block C could be considered as being to the left (in a vertical sense within their blocks) of a medium blue square.

However, the question seems to be asking specifically about the medium blue squares in Block A and Block C and their relationship to objects to their left. Given the descriptions, both Block A and Block C have configurations where an object is below (and thus could be considered in a vertical line with, but the question's intent seems to focus on horizontal comparisons between blocks) the medium blue square.

Given the descriptions and focusing strictly on the question's wording about which object (medium blue square) is to the left of a medium blue square, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the explanation process regarding the question's intent.

Considering the blocks' arrangement and focusing on the question's apparent intent about horizontal positioning between blocks and the presence of medium blue squares:

- Block A is to the left of Block B, making its medium blue square to the left of Block B's medium blue square.
- Block C's arrangement is below Block B, not directly to the left or right in the horizontal sense between blocks.

Given this, the correct answer to the question as phrased seems to be about the positioning between blocks and the presence of objects to the left of medium blue squares within those blocks. However, the detailed explanation aimed to clarify the positions but may have introduced confusion regarding the question's intent.

The concise answer, focusing on the question's apparent intent and clarifying the earlier explanation, should be based on the understanding of block positions and the objects within them. However, the detailed breakdown aimed to provide clarity but seems to have overcomplicated the interpretation.

3. Block B has one medium yellow square.
4. Block C has one medium blue square and one medium yellow square. The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block C and is below the medium blue square.

Given the question, ""Which object is to the left of a medium yellow square? the medium blue square or the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block?"", let's analyze the positions:

- In Block C, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square, meaning it is not to the left but above.
- However, considering the overall arrangement of blocks (C to the left of A, and A to the left of B), the medium blue square in Block C is indeed to the left of the medium yellow square in Block A and Block B.
- The medium black square touching the bottom edge of a block (Block A) is below the medium yellow square in the same block, not to the left.

But considering the blocks' arrangement, the medium black square in Block A cannot be to the left of the medium yellow square in Block C, but it is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B. However, the question seems to be asking about the general position relative to any medium yellow square without specifying the block. Given the arrangement, the medium blue square is to the left of the medium yellow squares in Blocks A and B, and the medium black square is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B but not the one in Block C.

4. In Block A, medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, and the medium black square is below medium yellow square number one. This configuration does not affect the relative left-right positions of objects between Block A and Block B.

Given the information, the medium yellow square in Block B is to the left of a medium yellow square (specifically, both medium yellow squares in Block A). Medium yellow square number one in Block A is below another yellow square but is not to the left of any medium yellow square within its own block or in relation to Block B.

However, considering the question's phrasing, it asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square. Since medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, it is to the left of no yellow square within its block but is itself a yellow square. The question seems to be asking about the relative position to any medium yellow square, not specifically within the same block. Given Block A's internal configuration does not place medium yellow square number one to the left of another yellow square, but considering the overall arrangement including Block B, the question's wording might cause confusion.

- The medium yellow triangle is below and near to the small blue circle.
- The medium black circle is touching the right edge of Block B, below and to the right of the small blue circle.
- There's also a mention that above and to the left of the circle which is below the small blue circle, there is the medium yellow triangle.

- The medium black circle is touching the right edge of Block B, which means it is to the right of most objects in Block B but still within Block B.
- The small yellow triangle in Block B does not have a detailed description of its position relative to the other objects in Block B, but since Block B is to the left of Block A, and Block A contains a small yellow triangle, the question seems to be focusing on the arrangement within Block B or the relative positions considering both blocks.

Given the information and focusing on the question, which asks what is to the left of a small yellow triangle, we can deduce the following:

- The medium yellow triangle's position is described in relation to the small blue circle but not directly in relation to the small yellow triangle in Block B. However, considering the layout, it's plausible that the medium yellow triangle could be to the left of the small yellow triangle within Block B, especially if we consider the small yellow triangle could be positioned in a way that the medium yellow triangle is to its left.
  
- The medium black circle is described as touching the right edge of Block B and is below and to the right of the small blue circle, which does not directly place it to the left of the small yellow triangle. Instead, it suggests the medium black circle is more to the right within Block B.

Considering the ambiguity in the exact positions of the triangles and circles within Block B and the specific phrasing of the question, the most accurate answer based on the given information seems to be that the medium yellow triangle is more likely to be to the left of a small yellow triangle, given the constraints and descriptions provided.

Which object is to the left of a blue thing? medium yellow square number two or the medium yellow square that is in block A??
0) medium yellow square  number two
1) the medium yellow square  that is in block A
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Block A is to the right of Block B.
2. Block A contains a medium blue square and a medium yellow square, with the yellow square below the blue square.
3. Block B contains three medium yellow squares, but the description is a bit confusing. It says medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number three, and then below medium yellow square number three, there is medium yellow square number two. This seems to be a contradictory statement, but what we can infer is that Block B contains multiple yellow squares and no blue squares.

Now, let's address the question: Which object is to the left of a blue thing? Since the only blue square is in Block A, anything in Block B will be to the left of the blue square in Block A.

Given the options:
- medium yellow square number two is in Block B, which is to the left of Block A, so it is to the left of the blue square.
- the medium yellow square that is in block A is below the blue square in Block A but is not to the left of it.

Therefore, the answer is {0} medium yellow square number two."

This shape is touching the bottom edge of this block. The medium black square is below the medium blue square. Which object is above a medium blue square? the medium blue square that is in block C or the medium blue square that is in block B??
0) the medium blue square  that is in block C
1) the medium blue square  that is in block B
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is above a medium blue square, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Block C contains a medium yellow square, one medium black square, and one medium blue square. The medium yellow square is below the medium black square and the medium blue square. This shape is touching the bottom edge of this block. The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

From this information, we can conclude that in block C, the medium blue square is above the medium black square and the medium yellow square. However, the question asks which object is above a medium blue square. In block C, the medium blue square is not below any other object within the block, but it is part of the question, is the medium blue square in block C above another blue square? No it isn't but that was not the question. The question was is there an object above the blue square in block C? No there isn't.

2. Now, let's consider block B, which contains a medium blue square. The question is whether there is an object above the medium blue square in block B. Given the arrangement of the blocks (block C is to the right of B and block A is below C), block C is above or at the same height as block B. Block C contains an object (the medium yellow, black and blue squares) that could potentially be above the medium blue square in block B.

However, considering the arrangement of the blocks and the information given, block C is to the right of block B. This means block C and block B are at the same height. Block A is below block C. 

Given this, block C is not above block B but to the right. However block C does contain an object a medium blue square. Is this blue square in block C above the blue square in block B? No it isn't.

However, it is stated that ""Block A is below C"". It is also stated that ""Block C is to the right of B"". Block A contains a medium blue square. Is block A below block B? Yes it is.

So the medium blue square in block B is above the medium blue square in block A.

Considering the given options:

0) the medium blue square that is in block C: There is no object above the medium blue square within block C, but that was not the question. However there is also no information that the blue square in block C is above another blue square.

1) the medium blue square that is in block B: The medium blue square in block B is above the medium blue square in block A.

2) both of them: Only the medium blue square in block B is confirmed to be above another medium blue square (in block A).

3) none of them: This is incorrect since the medium blue square in block B is indeed above the medium blue square in block A.

3. Block C is to the left of block B.
4. Block B is above block A.
5. Block A contains the big yellow circle and the small blue square.

Given the positions, we can infer that both the big yellow circle and the small blue square in block A are below block B and to the right of block C, where the small black circle is located. Since block C is to the left of block B and block B is above block A, it means that both objects in block A (the big yellow circle and the small blue square) are relatively far from the small black circle in block C, especially when considering the vertical and horizontal positioning of the blocks.

The question asks what is below the object that is touching the right edge of a block. The object touching the right edge is the big black triangle. According to the arrangement, below the big black triangle is the big blue triangle, but since the question specifically asks about the medium blue circle or the medium black triangle, we need to consider their positions relative to the big black triangle. The medium black triangle is below the big black triangle, and the medium blue circle is above the medium black triangle but below the big black triangle is not explicitly stated for the medium blue circle's direct relation to the big black triangle. However, given the constraints, the medium blue circle must be above or at the same level as the big black triangle to be above the medium black triangle.

- Block C: A medium yellow square is above a medium blue square. Similar to block A, there's no medium blue square above the medium yellow square in block C, so the medium yellow square in block C is not below a medium blue square either.

However, we need to consider the relationship between blocks. Block C is above block B, and block B contains a medium blue square.

- Since block B is to the left of block C, the medium yellow squares in block C are to the right of block B. Given that one of these medium yellow squares is touching the bottom edge of block C, it is at the same vertical level as the medium blue square in block B.

Therefore, the object that is to the right of a medium blue square is indeed the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (in block C, to the right of block B).

   - Medium yellow square number one is below the medium blue square.
   - Medium yellow square number two is below the medium blue square, and medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

Given the arrangement in block C, we can deduce the order from top to bottom as follows:

- Medium yellow square number one

Since medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of the block and is below medium yellow square number two, and both are below the medium blue square, neither of them is above the medium blue square.

However, the question asks which object is above ""a"" medium blue square, not specifically the one in block C. Considering block A and its position relative to block C, block A is below block C. This means that everything in block C is above block A. Since block A contains a medium blue square, everything in block C, including both medium yellow squares, is above ""a"" medium blue square (the one in block A).

Block B:

Given the positions, we can conclude that both medium yellow square number two in Block A and the medium yellow square in Block B are positioned in relation to a medium blue square in such a way that they are below it. However, the question asks which one is to the left of a medium blue square.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and within Block A, medium yellow square number two is positioned in relation to a medium blue square (though the specific left-right relationship within the block is not explicitly stated, the block itself is to the left of Block B), we can infer that at least medium yellow square number two is to the left of a medium blue square in the overall arrangement.

1) the small black circle 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is below a medium black circle, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The medium black circle is in block A.
2. The small black circle is in block A as well, to the right of and near the medium black circle. This means the small black circle is not below the medium black circle; it's beside it.
3. Block B is below block A, but the specific arrangement of shapes within block B doesn't directly affect the vertical relationship to the medium black circle in block A, except to note that block B and all its contents are below block A.
4. The big yellow triangle is touching the right edge of block B, which places it below block A, since block B is below block A.

Given this information, the object that is below the medium black circle is the big yellow triangle (as part of block B), not the small black circle. Therefore, the correct answer is the yellow object that is touching the right edge of a block.

Given the arrangement of the blocks (A to the left of B, and B to the left of C), the object to the left of the small blue circle in block C would be in block B, since block B is directly to the left of block C.

In block B, the object touching the right edge is the medium blue square. Therefore, the medium blue square is the object in block B that is directly to the left of the small blue circle in block C. However, the question asks about a small black circle or a small black triangle.

Considering the arrangement within block B, the small black circle is to the left of the medium blue square. Therefore, the small black circle is also to the left of the small blue circle in block C, but not directly adjacent. The small black triangle is in block A, which is to the left of block B, making it also to the left of the small blue circle in block C, but further away compared to the small black circle.

Block B has two medium yellow squares, a big blue triangle, and a big blue square. Medium yellow square number two is above the big blue triangle. The big blue square is above and to the right of the big blue triangle, and medium yellow square number one is above and to the right of the big blue triangle as well.

Block C's description doesn't directly relate to the question about which object is above a yellow square between the triangle touching the bottom edge of a block or the big blue square.

Given the descriptions, the big blue square in Block B is above a yellow square (medium yellow square number two is not the square it is above but it is above the big blue triangle and the big blue triangle has medium yellow square number two above it), and the triangle touching the bottom edge of a block (the big blue triangle in Block B) is below a yellow square (medium yellow square number two). However, in Block A, there is a triangle above a yellow square.

Therefore, considering the specific question about the triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block (which is in Block B and is the big blue triangle) and the big blue square, the answer is the big blue square is indeed above a yellow square but not the triangle that touches the bottom of block B.

1. The small blue circle is in block A, and it is below the big yellow circle. This means the big yellow circle is above the small blue circle. However, the question asks about objects above a blue circle, not specifically the small blue circle. So, we need to consider all blue circles.

2. The small blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of block A. Since the small blue circle is also in block A and is not described as touching the bottom edge, we can infer that the small blue circle is above the small blue triangle within block A.

3. Block C contains a medium blue circle, but it is below block B and block A. Therefore, any object in block A or block B would be above this medium blue circle.

Given these positions, the small blue triangle is below the small blue circle in block A but is above the medium blue circle in block C because block A is above block C. The small blue circle is also above the medium blue circle in block C for the same reason.

Therefore, both the small blue circle and the small blue triangle are above a blue circle (specifically, the medium blue circle in block C).

Given the question, ""Which object is below a medium blue circle? the medium blue square or the big shape which is touching the right edge of a block?"", let's analyze:

- The medium blue square is directly below the medium blue circle in Block A.
- The big black square (the big shape touching the right edge of a block) is in Block B, which is below Block A, but it's not specified to be directly below the medium blue circle within Block B. However, considering the arrangement of blocks, Block B's contents, including the big black square, are below Block A's medium blue circle in the overall arrangement.

3. Block B is below block C and has two medium yellow squares. Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B, and medium yellow square number two is above it.
4. Since block B is below block C, and block C has a medium black square, medium yellow square number two in block B cannot be directly below a medium black square in its own block.

- Block C contains the big yellow circle and the small blue circle (to its left), with the big blue triangle below.
- Block B contains the medium black circle.
- Block A contains the medium yellow triangle.

Given the question asks what is to the left of the medium yellow triangle, we know Block A is to the right of Block B, and Block C is to the left of Block A. Therefore, Block C (with its big yellow circle touching the right edge) and Block B (which has to be between C and A, given the constraints) are both to the left of Block A.

However, considering block B's position relative to block A, the medium blue square in block A is to the right of the medium black squares in block B, but it is to the left of no medium black square within its own block (A). Yet, given the arrangement in block C (which doesn't affect block A's position relative to block B's black squares), we must focus on the specific question.

Since the medium blue square in block C is directly above the medium black square in block C, it is not to the left of a medium black square.

Nonetheless, this interpretation seems to slightly deviate from the direct question of which blue square is immediately to the left of a black square within the context of their respective blocks.

Given the blocks' descriptions and focusing strictly on the objects' immediate relationships within their blocks or the question's direct implications:

- The medium blue square in block A is not to the left of a medium black square within its block or considering its immediate neighbor (block B), based on the given descriptions.
- The medium blue square in block C is above, not to the left of, the medium black square in its block.

However, strictly answering the question as it pertains to the immediate left of a medium black square and considering typical expectations for such a question:

The medium blue square in block C is above its block's black square, not to the left. The question seems to be about direct, immediate relationships between squares within blocks or their explicit positioning relative to each other across blocks, which might lead to confusion.

Given the immediate relationships described and focusing on the clarity of block C's description (where the blue square is directly above the black square), neither blue square is explicitly described as being immediately to the left of a black square within the same block context. Yet, considering broader interpretations might lead to confusion, the direct answer to the question as phrased seems to hinge on immediate spatial relationships as described.

Therefore, considering the immediate spatial relationships as directly described for each block without inferring broader block arrangements beyond the question's direct implications:

1. Block A has one small black triangle. However, we are not given any information about objects being above this triangle within block A itself. Instead, we know block B is above block A, but we don't have information about the specific positioning of objects in block B relative to the small black triangle in block A.

2. Block C has a small black triangle that is to the right of and above the small blue square. This means the small blue square in block C is below the small black triangle, not above it.

3. The question specifically asks which small blue square is above a small black triangle. Given the information, neither the description of block B nor block C places a small blue square above a small black triangle. In block B, we don't have enough information to determine its small blue square's position relative to block A's small black triangle, but we do know the small blue square is below other objects within block B itself. In block C, the small blue square is explicitly described as being below the small black triangle.

Therefore, based on the given descriptions, neither of the small blue squares in blocks B or C is described as being above a small black triangle.

3) none of them","To determine which object is to the left of a medium shape, we need to analyze the positions of the objects in the blocks.

Block B contains a medium yellow circle and is to the right of block A. Block A contains a small blue triangle. Since block B is to the right of block A, the small blue triangle in block A is to the left of block B, which contains the medium yellow circle.

Block C contains a small blue triangle, but it is above block B. There is no medium shape to the right of the small blue triangle in block C, within the same block. However, considering the overall arrangement, block C is above block B. The problem doesn't explicitly state the horizontal alignment of block C with respect to blocks A and B, but it does say block B is below block C. Given this information, we can infer that block C is likely above both blocks A and B. However, without knowing the exact horizontal alignment of block C, we cannot definitively say the small blue triangle in block C is to the left of the medium yellow circle in block B.

However, since we do know block A's small blue triangle is to the left of block B's medium yellow circle, we can say with certainty that at least one small blue triangle (the one in block A) is to the left of a medium shape.

Given the ambiguity of block C's position, we cannot confirm if the small blue triangle in block C is also to the left of the medium yellow circle in block B. However, based on the information provided, we can confirm the small blue triangle in block A is to the left of the medium yellow circle.

Therefore, the most accurate answer we can give based on the information provided is that at least one small blue triangle (the one in block A) is to the left of a medium shape.

3. Considering the arrangement of blocks (C above B above A), the medium blue square in block B is above the medium yellow square in block A. Also, block C has a medium blue square above a medium yellow square, but since block C is above block B, this does not affect the medium yellow square in block B directly in terms of the question's criteria.

From the information provided, the medium yellow square is below and to the left of the medium blue square, and it is also to the left of the big black triangle. However, the question asks what is to the left of the thing touching the right edge of a block (the big black triangle), specifically comparing a small yellow thing and a big blue triangle.

Since the big black triangle is below and to the right of the big blue triangle, the big blue triangle is to the left (and above) the big black triangle. There is no mention of a small yellow thing being directly to the left of the big black triangle in block C's description. The small yellow triangle is on block B, which is to the left of block A, and subsequently to the left of block C, but it is not directly related to the objects within block C.

Now, let's consider Block B. It has one medium yellow square, but there's no information about any medium black square in Block B. However, we know that Blocks C and A are above Block B.

3. Block B contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square. The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block B and is below the medium black square.

4. Block C contains a medium black square.

Now, let's analyze the question: ""What is to the left of the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block?""

From the given information, we know that the medium yellow square in Block B is touching the bottom edge of Block B. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, the thing to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B (which is touching the bottom edge of Block B) would be Block A.

However, the question is asking about the thing that is to the left of the thing touching the bottom edge of ""a block"", not specifically Block B. This means we also need to consider Block A, as it also has a square touching its bottom edge (the medium yellow square).

The medium yellow square in Block A is touching the bottom edge of Block A, and Block C is to the left of Block A. Therefore, the thing to the left of the medium yellow square in Block A (which is touching the bottom edge of Block A) would be Block C, which contains a medium black square.

So, to answer the question: the thing to the left of the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block is indeed a medium black square, but it is the one in Block C.

However, we must also consider the fact that the question is phrased to ask about ""a block"", not a specific block. This means that the thing to the left of the thing touching the bottom edge of a block could also refer to the medium black square in Block B, if we consider the block to be Block B and the thing touching its bottom edge to be the medium yellow square in Block B. But in this case, the thing to the left would be in Block A, not a medium black square.

But if we consider Block A and the thing touching its bottom edge (the medium yellow square), then to the left of that would indeed be a medium black square in Block C.

However, the question asks which one is to the left, it does not ask which block the touching item is in. Block B has an item touching the bottom edge of it (the medium yellow square) and to the left of that item is the medium yellow and blue square in block A and then the black square in block C.

Therefore the answer to the question is the medium black square in block C.

1. **Block A**: Contains a medium yellow square. There's no information about its position within the block, but since it's the only square mentioned for block A, its position relative to the edges of the block is not specified. However, given the question, we're interested in what's above the shape touching the bottom edge of a block, so if this yellow square is at the bottom, there's nothing above it within block A itself.

2. **Block B**: This block is above block A and contains one medium yellow square and one medium black square. The medium black square is above the medium yellow square. The question doesn't directly pertain to the arrangement within block B, but it's clear that the yellow square in block B is below the black square.

3. **Block C**: This block is above block B and contains two medium blue squares, one medium yellow square, and one medium black square. The description indicates that one medium blue square (let's call it blue square #1) is touching the bottom edge of this block. Above blue square #1 is the medium yellow square and the medium black square, with blue square #2 below them but above blue square #1. However, this description seems to have a contradiction regarding the positions of the squares. A clearer interpretation based on the question would be: blue square #1 is at the bottom, the yellow square and black square are above it (though their exact relationship to each other isn't crucial for the question), and blue square #2's position is above the black square but below isn't possible if blue #1 is at the bottom and has the yellow and black squares above it.

Given the corrected understanding of block C's arrangement: blue square #1 is at the bottom, and there is a medium yellow square above it within the same block (block C).

The question asks what is above the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block: a medium yellow square in block C or a medium yellow square in block A?

- For block A, there's no information that directly indicates the yellow square is not at the bottom, but there's also no indication of what's above it within the block if it were at the bottom. However, the question implies looking for a direct vertical relationship within the same block.
- For block C, it's clear that a medium yellow square is above the blue square that touches the bottom edge of the block.

Therefore, the answer is that a medium yellow square in block C is above the shape (blue square #1) that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

1. Block A has two medium blue squares, with medium blue square number one touching the bottom edge and below medium blue square number two. This information tells us about the vertical arrangement within block A but does not directly answer the question.

2. Block B, which is to the left of block A, contains one medium blue square and a medium black square. The medium black square is above the medium blue square in block B. This means that within block B, the medium black square is to the left of a medium blue square because block B itself is to the left of block A, and within block B, the medium black square is positioned above the medium blue square, still making it to the left of a medium blue square when considering the blocks' arrangement.

3. Block C has two medium black squares and is below block A. Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block C and is below medium black square number two. This information tells us about the vertical arrangement within block C but does not directly answer the question about which object is to the left of a medium blue square.

Given the information, the medium black square in block B is to the left of a medium blue square because it is within block B, which is to the left of block A, and it is positioned in a way that it is above (and thus to the left when considering the blocks' arrangement) the medium blue square in block B.

However, medium black square number two in block C is not described as being to the left of any medium blue square based on the blocks' arrangement. Block C is below block A, not to the left, so its squares' positions relative to the medium blue squares in block A are below, not to the left.

Therefore, the correct answer is that only the medium black square in block B is to the left of a medium blue square.

1. Block A is to the left of Block B.
2. Block B contains the medium blue circle.
3. In Block B, to the right of and below the medium yellow square, there is the medium blue circle. This means the medium yellow square in Block B is to the left of the medium blue circle.
4. The question asks what is to the left of the blue shape in relation to Block A's elements (big yellow circle or small yellow square), but given the arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block B is directly to the left of the blue circle.

However, considering the blocks' arrangement (A to the left of B) and focusing on the elements within Block A that could be to the left of the blue circle in Block B:

- The big yellow circle in Block A could potentially be to the left of the blue circle because Block A is to the left of Block B.
- The small yellow square's position in Block A is described relative to other shapes in Block A, not directly in relation to Block B's elements. However, since Block A is to the left of Block B, elements in Block A, including the small yellow square, are generally to the left of elements in Block B.

Given the arrangement and the question's focus on what from Block A is to the left of the blue shape in Block B:

Both the big yellow circle and the small yellow square from Block A are to the left of the blue circle in Block B because Block A is positioned to the left of Block B.

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. Block A contains a medium blue square.
3. Block B contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square, with the black square below the yellow square.
4. Block C contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square, with the yellow square touching the bottom edge of the block and below the black square.

Now, let's analyze the question: ""What is to the left of the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block?""

From the description, we know that the object touching the bottom edge of a block is the medium yellow square in block C.

To the left of block C is block B, and to the left of block B is block A.

So, to the left of the medium yellow square in block C (which is touching the bottom edge of block C) is block B, which contains a medium black square (among other things).

However, if we consider the entire setup, we also know that block A (with the blue shape) is to the left of block B.

Therefore, both a medium black square (in block B) and a blue shape (in block A) are to the left of the object (medium yellow square in block C) that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

1. Block A has one medium black square. This information is not directly relevant to the question but helps us visualize the setup.

2. Block B has one medium yellow square. The question asks if this square has an object below it. From the information given, there's no indication that anything is directly below the medium yellow square in block B within the same block. However, block C is to the right of block B and has its own arrangement.

3. Block C has two medium yellow squares and a medium black square. The arrangement is such that medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one, and the medium black square is below medium yellow square number one, touching the bottom edge of block C.

Given the question, ""Which object is below a medium yellow square? the medium yellow square that is in block B or medium yellow square number one?"", let's analyze:

- For the medium yellow square in block B, there's no object directly below it within the same block. However, considering the overall arrangement and focusing strictly on the question, the presence of block C and its contents doesn't directly imply an object is below the yellow square in B in a way that affects the question's scope.

- For medium yellow square number one in block C, there is indeed an object below it: the medium black square.

The question does not ask for an object directly below in the same block for B but rather which of these two squares has an object below it. Based on the given information and focusing on the specific query:

4. The medium blue triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle.
5. The small black triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle.

Since the small blue triangle is in block A and block C is to the left of block A, we need to find out which object in block C is to the left of the small blue triangle.

Considering the positions of the objects in block C, the medium yellow triangle is the leftmost object below the big blue square. The small black triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle, but it is still in block C, which is to the left of block A.

The medium black square is in block B, which is below block A, not to the left of it.

3. Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number three.
4. Block B contains one medium blue square and a medium black square. Below the medium black square, there is the medium blue square.

From the information about Block A, we can deduce the order of the yellow squares from top to bottom is: 3, 2, 1.

For Block B, the order from top to bottom is: black square, blue square.

Since Block A is below Block B, the blue square (which is at the bottom of Block B) will be above the topmost yellow square of Block A (which is medium yellow square number three).

Therefore, below the blue object (medium blue square) is medium yellow square number three, and then comes medium yellow square number two. However, medium yellow square number one is the one touching the bottom edge of Block A.

So, below the blue object is not directly a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block (which is medium yellow square number one), but it is above medium yellow square number two (with number three in between, but that was not asked).

4. In block B, there is a medium blue square and a medium yellow square, with the medium blue square below the medium yellow square.

Given that medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block A and is below medium black square number two and the medium yellow square, we can infer that above the shape touching the bottom edge (medium black square number one) is another black square and a yellow square within the same block (block A).

However, the question seems to be asking about what is above the shape touching the bottom edge of ""a block,"" which could imply looking at the arrangement across both blocks. Since block B is above block A and contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square, with the blue square below the yellow square, it means that directly above the top edge of block A (and therefore above the medium yellow square in block A) would be the bottom of block B, which contains the medium blue square below the medium yellow square.

But to directly answer the question regarding what is above the shape touching the bottom edge of a block (medium black square number one in block A), within the same block (A), it is the medium yellow square (and another black square).

- The medium yellow square number one in block A is below medium yellow square number two, but there's no direct information about its position relative to other blocks' squares.
- The medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of block C is below the other medium yellow square in block C.

Considering the question ""Which object is to the right of a medium square?"", we know:

- Block B is to the left of block A, so block A is to the right of block B.
- The medium black square is in block B, so anything in block A would be to the right of it.
- Both medium yellow squares in block A are to the right of the medium black square in block B.

However, the question specifically asks about being to the right of a medium square, not necessarily the medium black square. Since block C has medium yellow squares and block B (with a medium black square) is above block C and to the left of block A, we can infer that:

- The medium yellow squares in block A are to the right of the medium black square in block B.
- The positioning of medium yellow squares within their respective blocks (A and C) does not directly answer the question without considering the blocks' positions.

- Medium yellow square number one in block A is indeed to the right of a medium square (considering the medium squares in block B or even the arrangement with block C, although the direct comparison is with the medium black square in block B).
- The medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of block C (which is also a medium yellow square number one in its block) is not described in relation to being to the right or left of another medium square directly, but given block C's position below block B and block B being to the left of block A, it does not fit the ""to the right"" description in the context provided.

2. Block B is below block A and contains one medium black square and a medium yellow square. The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block, and this shape is below the medium yellow square. This means the medium black square is below the medium yellow square in block B.
3. Block C is also below block A (the positioning relative to block B is not specified, but that's irrelevant for this question since we're comparing within each block) and contains one medium yellow square and a medium blue square. The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

- In block B, the medium black square is below the medium yellow square.
- In block C, the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square, not below another medium yellow square. However, the question asks which medium yellow square is below another medium yellow square. Since block C's description does not place the medium yellow square under another medium yellow square but rather under a medium blue square, it does not fit the criteria specified in the question directly. However, the question itself is slightly ambiguous because it does not specify if we are comparing the positions of yellow squares across blocks or within their own descriptions. Given the descriptions provided, the most direct interpretation is to look at the arrangement within each block as described.

However, re-evaluating for clarity: The actual question is which medium yellow square (block B's or block C's) is below another medium yellow square. Block B's yellow square is above a black square, and block C's yellow square is below a blue square but the question's phrasing implies looking for a yellow square under another yellow square. Since neither block B nor block C's description places a medium yellow square directly under another medium yellow square within their own descriptions but rather compares their positions to other colored squares, the correct interpretation under strict reading would be ""none of them"" because neither is directly under another medium yellow square based on the given descriptions.

But, considering the arrangement might imply looking across blocks or a misunderstanding in the explanation given the constraints of the question: If we were to consider the arrangement where block B and block C are both below block A and thus their yellow squares could potentially be ""below"" the yellow square in block A, this would still not directly answer the question as phrased because we're comparing within blocks based on the descriptions given.

3. Block C is to the right of Block B and contains the big blue triangle.

Given this arrangement, the big blue triangle in Block C has Block B to its left. Specifically, since the big black square is to the right of the big black circle within Block B, the big black square is the closest object to Block C, but the question asks about circles.

472,"We have two blocks, A and B. Two medium blue squares are in block A. This block also contains one medium black square. Below medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two there is the medium black square. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two. To the right of block A there is block B which has two medium black squares. Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two. Which object is to the left of a medium black square? the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block or medium black square number two??
0) the medium black square  that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
1) medium black square  number two
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Block A contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square. The medium black square is below both medium blue squares, and medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.

2. Block B contains two medium black squares, with medium black square number one below medium black square number two.

Given the arrangement in Block A, the medium black square is at the bottom, meaning it is touching the bottom edge of Block A. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, this medium black square (touching the bottom edge of Block A) is to the left of both medium black squares in Block B, including medium black square number two in Block B.

However, within Block B itself, medium black square number one is below medium black square number two, meaning medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block B. Therefore, medium black square number two in Block B is to the left of (or more accurately, above) the medium black square touching the bottom edge of Block B, but not to the left of a medium black square in the context of the blocks' arrangement.

Considering the question's phrasing, which asks which object is to the left of a medium black square, the medium black square in Block A is indeed to the left of a medium black square (those in Block B), specifically including the scenario of being to the left of medium black square number two in Block B.

Therefore, the answer is {2} since both the medium black square touching the bottom edge of a block (specifically Block A) and the context provided for medium black square number two (though it's more about its position in Block B rather than being to the left of another medium black square in the inter-block context) can be considered as being to the left of a medium black square in the broader context of the question's phrasing and the blocks' arrangement."
1992,"There are three blocks. Lets call them A, B and C. Block A is to the left of B. Block B is below C. Block A has one medium blue square. Block B has one medium blue square and one medium yellow square. This block also contains one medium black square. It is below the medium yellow square. The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block. It is below the medium yellow square and the medium black square. And block C contains a medium yellow square.

0) the medium yellow square  which is in block B
1) the medium yellow square  that is in block C
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Block A is to the left of Block B.
2. Block B contains a medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
3. The medium yellow square in Block B is above the medium blue square (and the medium black square).
4. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and Block B has a medium blue square touching its bottom edge, Block A is to the left of a shape (the medium blue square in Block B) that is touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B).
   
However, the question specifically asks about the medium yellow squares in relation to being to the left of a shape touching the bottom edge of a block.

Given the information:
- The medium yellow square in Block B is above the medium blue square that touches the bottom edge of Block B, so it is not directly to the left or right of a shape touching the bottom edge of its own block but is above such a shape.
- Block A, which contains a medium blue square, is to the left of Block B. Block A's medium blue square does touch the bottom edge of Block A, but the question is about which medium yellow square is to the left of a shape touching the bottom edge of a block.
- Block C contains a medium yellow square, but its position relative to the bottom edge of Block C is not specified. However, Block B is below Block C, which means Block C is above Block B. The question does not provide information about Block C having a shape that touches its bottom edge that is relevant to the position of the medium yellow square in Block C relative to Block B or A.

However, since Block A is to the left of Block B, and Block B has a shape (the medium blue square) touching its bottom edge, and considering the medium yellow squares:
- The medium yellow square in Block B is directly above a shape (the medium blue square) touching the bottom edge of Block B, but Block B is not to the left of itself; it contains the arrangement.
- The medium yellow square in Block C does not have a specified relationship to a shape touching the bottom edge of Block C in the context provided.

Given the question's phrasing, the correct interpretation hinges on understanding which medium yellow square is to the left of a shape that touches the bottom edge of a block. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and Block B contains a shape touching its bottom edge, but the question specifically asks about the medium yellow squares:

The medium yellow square in Block C (Block C is above Block B, but the question does not specify its relationship to a shape touching the bottom edge of Block C) does not have a clear relationship established in the question to a shape touching the bottom edge of a block based on the given information. However, considering the layout and focusing strictly on the question's criteria:

The medium yellow square in Block B is not to the left of a shape touching the bottom edge of Block B; it is above such a shape within the same block.

Given the constraints and focusing on the question's specific wording about being to the left of a shape touching the bottom edge of a block, neither medium yellow square is described as being directly to the left of a shape that touches the bottom edge of a block within the information provided. The question's phrasing and the provided layout do not directly support the conclusion that either medium yellow square meets the specified condition based on the given relationships.

Therefore, the answer is {3}."

1. Block A has a medium blue square above a medium black square.
2. Block B has two medium blue squares (number one and number two) with a medium black square below both of them, but specifically below medium blue square number one is the black square and below medium blue square number two is also the black square but also below number two is number one.
3. Since medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two, the medium black square is below both of them.
4. Now, considering the arrangement, the medium blue square in block A is to the left of block B and above the medium black square in block A.
5. Medium blue square number one in block B is above the medium black square in block B but also below medium blue square number two.
6. Given the arrangement, the medium blue square in block A is directly above the medium black square in block A, but to the right of the medium black square in block A is medium blue square number two in block B.
7. The medium black square in block B has medium blue square number one directly above it.
8. Therefore, to the right of a medium black square, we have the medium blue square in block A not being to the right of any black square in block A but medium blue square number one is to the right of the black square in block A and directly above the black square in block B.

Considering the question, ""Which object is to the right of a medium black square? medium blue square number one or the medium blue square that is in block A??"" The answer would be medium blue square number one since it is to the right of the black square in block A and directly above the black square in block B.

0) the medium black square 
1) the big blue circle 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is to the right of a small black circle, let's analyze the given information step by step.

Block A contains a small black square, a big blue circle, and a medium black square. Block B contains two small black circles, a big yellow triangle, a small yellow square, a small black triangle, and a medium blue circle.

The key information for solving this question is related to Block B, as it contains the small black circles. We know that the medium blue circle is above the second small black circle. However, we do not have direct information about what is to the right of the small black circles in Block B.

Since Block A is to the right of Block B, we can infer that objects in Block A could potentially be to the right of objects in Block B. The big blue circle in Block A is described as being to the left of the medium yellow square, but more importantly, it is in Block A, which is to the right of Block B.

However, we do not have explicit information that directly links the position of the small black circles in Block B to the objects in Block A in a way that would definitively say what is to their right. But, given the layout and the fact that Block A is to the right of Block B, it's reasonable to consider that objects in Block A could be to the right of objects in Block B.

The medium black square is described in relation to other objects within Block A, not directly in relation to the small black circles in Block B. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively say that the medium black square is directly to the right of a small black circle.

However, considering the blocks' arrangement and the given details, the big blue circle in Block A is more likely to be relevant when considering what is to the right of Block B, which contains the small black circles.

Given the ambiguity and focusing strictly on the information provided, the most accurate answer we can deduce is based on the layout of the blocks rather than the specific objects' positions relative to each other across the blocks.

Therefore, considering the arrangement and the direct information provided, the answer is less about the specific object and more about the implication of the blocks' layout. However, without explicit information directly linking the objects across the blocks, the question's phrasing suggests looking for a direct relationship that isn't clearly provided.

Given the direct and indirect information, the best logical deduction we can make is that the question's setup implies looking for an object in Block A, given Block A is to the right of Block B. However, the specific object-to-object relationship across blocks isn't clearly defined, leading to a conclusion based on the layout rather than specific positions.

2. Block B is to the right of Block A and also contains two medium black squares. The arrangement within Block B includes a medium blue square above medium black square number two. This implies that the medium blue square is to the right of the medium black squares in Block A.

3. Block C, containing a medium yellow square, is below Block A. There's no direct relation mentioned between Block C (or the medium yellow square) and the right side of any medium black square.

4. Block C has a medium blue square and a big yellow circle that touches the bottom edge of the block. 

Given the arrangement, the small yellow triangle on Block A could be above either Block B or Block C (or partially above both, but the problem doesn't provide enough detail to determine the exact positioning). However, since Block C has both a medium shape (the medium blue square) and a circle touching the bottom edge of the block (the big yellow circle), and considering Block A's position above both B and C, the small yellow triangle could potentially be above either the medium blue square or the big yellow circle on Block C, depending on its exact position.

Therefore, considering the given information and the possible positions of the small yellow triangle relative to the blocks below, the answer would be that it could be above either a medium shape or a circle touching the bottom edge of a block.

6. There is a medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of one of the blocks (not specified which, but we can infer it's related to the positioning of the squares).
7. Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and a medium blue square.
8. Below the medium blue square and medium black square number two is the medium yellow square.

However, we are asked which object is above a medium blue square: the medium black square that is in block B or medium black square number one. 

Since medium black square number two is below the medium blue square, and medium black square number one is below medium black square number two, neither of the medium black squares (number one or the one in block B) can be above the medium blue square based on the information given about their positions relative to the medium blue square.

But considering the blocks, Block C is above Block A, and Block A contains the medium blue square. Block C contains medium black squares number one and two.

3. Block A contains a medium black square and a medium blue square, with the medium blue square above the medium black square. Since Block A is to the left of Block C, the medium blue square in Block A is to the left of Block C, not to the right.
4. Block B contains a medium blue square, but its horizontal position relative to Block A and Block C is not directly specified. However, since Block B is above and we are considering horizontal positions (left and right), the position of Block B's medium blue square in relation to being ""to the right"" of a medium square in another block is not applicable based on the given vertical relationship.
5. Block C contains two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square, with the medium yellow square below both medium blue squares. This configuration does not directly impact the question of which medium blue square (from Block A or Block B) is to the right of a medium square, as the question pertains to the relative positions of the medium blue squares in Block A and Block B to any medium square.

Given the information, neither the medium blue square in Block A nor the medium blue square in Block B is described as being to the right of a medium square based on the provided spatial relationships.

2. Block B is to the right of block A and has two medium yellow squares.
3. Block C is above block B and contains a medium yellow square.

Given that block B is to the right of block A, any part of block B will be to the right of the black shape in block A. Specifically, since block B has two medium yellow squares and one of them (medium yellow square number one) is below the other (medium yellow square number two), and both are within block B, both are to the right of the black shape.

However, the question specifically asks about ""a medium yellow square that is in block C"" and ""a medium yellow square number one."" Since block C is above block B and not directly to the right of block A (but parts of it might overlap with the space to the right of block A because it's above block B), the medium yellow square in block C is indeed to the right of the black shape but above it in terms of vertical positioning.

Given the direct statement from point 5, despite the confusion, we can infer that medium yellow square number three is indeed below (or not above) the medium black square mentioned in its specific context. However, considering the overall arrangement and focusing on the question:

Given the confusing and somewhat contradictory setup, the most straightforward interpretation based on the direct statements would suggest that neither medium yellow square number two nor medium yellow square number three is described as being directly above a medium black square in a clear, non-contradictory manner.

Therefore, the medium black square in Block A is indeed to the left of a medium yellow square (both in Block C and Block B), but the medium black square in Block C is not to the left of the medium yellow square within Block C. However, the question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, not specifying within the same block. Since Block A is to the left of Block C, the medium black square in Block A is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block C. For Block B, Block A is above it and Block A's square is to the left of Block B's square. For Block C, its own black square is below its yellow square, but still Block A's square is to the left of Block C's yellow square.

However, Block C's black square is below its yellow square, but above and to the left of the blue square and above the Block B's yellow square is not possible, but Block C's black square is above and to the left of the blue square in Block C and below Block C's yellow square. Block B is below Block A, Block A is to the left of Block C, Block C has yellow square above its black square, its black square is above its blue square. Block A has a black square that is to the left of Block B's yellow square and to the left of Block C's yellow square. Block C's black square is below its yellow square, but above and to the left of its blue square.

1. **Block A**: It has two medium black squares, with medium black square number one below medium black square number two. A medium blue square is below medium black square number two. This setup directly places a medium blue square below medium black square number two.

2. **Block B**: Contains a medium blue square, but there's no information about its position relative to any medium black squares within this block.

3. **Block C**: It has two medium blue squares and one medium black square. Medium blue square number two is below the medium black square, and medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.

Given the information:
- In Block A, medium black square number two is above a medium blue square.
- In Block C, a medium black square is above medium blue square number two.

The question asks which medium black square is below a medium blue square. Based on the descriptions:
- There is no direct information that places a medium black square below a medium blue square in the descriptions given for any block. The descriptions place medium blue squares below medium black squares in blocks A and C but do not describe a scenario where a medium black square is below a medium blue square.

Therefore, based on the given information, neither medium black square number one nor medium black square number two is described as being below a medium blue square.

1. Block A has a medium black square.
2. Block B is below block A and has three medium blue squares.
3. Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B.
4. Medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number three and a medium black square.
5. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number three and the medium black square.
6. The medium black square (in block B) is below medium blue square number three.
7. Block C is to the right of block A and has a medium yellow square, which is irrelevant to this question.

From points 4, 5, and 6, we can deduce that in block B, there is a medium black square that is below medium blue square number three, and also, medium blue square number one is below both medium blue square number three and the medium black square. This means the medium black square in block B is indeed below a medium blue square (number three), but it's also the case that a medium blue square (number one) is below the medium black square, which doesn't directly answer the question but clarifies the arrangement.

However, the question asks which medium black square is below a medium blue square. Given the arrangement, the medium black square in block B is explicitly stated to be below medium blue square number three, which might seem to imply an incorrect interpretation at first glance. The correct interpretation is that for a black square to be ""below"" a blue square in this context means it's positioned underneath it in the vertical arrangement, not necessarily directly below it in a way that they share a common edge.

Given the description, the medium black square in block A is above block B, which contains all the medium blue squares. Therefore, the medium black square in block A cannot be below any medium blue square.

However, re-evaluating the statements for clarity: the medium black square in block B is described in relation to the blue squares within its block, not in relation to being below them in the sense of the overall stacking (block A on top of block B). The description indicates a specific arrangement within block B, but it does not imply the medium black square in block B is below a blue square in the stack sense; rather, it's part of the arrangement within block B.

Given this, and correcting the interpretation: The question essentially asks which black square is positioned below a blue square in the stacking sense. Since block A is on top of block B, and block B contains the blue squares, the medium black square in block A is indeed above the blue squares in block B, making it not below them. The description of the arrangement within block B was misleading in the context of answering the question directly.

Correcting for the misinterpretation and focusing on the question's requirement: Neither the black square in block A nor the one in block B is described as being below a blue square in the sense that block A is above block B, and within block B, the arrangement doesn't imply a black square being below a blue square in the stacking sense described by the blocks' arrangement.

Therefore, the correct answer, after clarifying the misunderstanding, is:

Block B is above Block C, and Block A is to the right of Block B. This means Block A is also to the right of Block C, given the vertical alignment of B and C.

Block A contains a medium black square, a medium yellow square below the black square, and a medium blue square below both. Block B contains a medium black square, and Block C also contains a medium black square.

Given the arrangement:
- The medium black square in Block A cannot be to the right of itself, but Block A is to the right of Block B and, by extension, Block C. Therefore, Block A (which contains a medium black square among other squares) is to the right of the medium black square in Block C.
- The medium black square in Block A is not to the right of any medium black square within its own block (since it's the only one), but it is part of Block A, which is to the right of the medium black square in Block B.

Considering the question asks which object (medium black square) is to the right of a medium black square, the answer focuses on the positioning relative to other blocks' medium black squares. The medium black square in Block A is to the right of the medium black square in Block B but not directly implied to be to the right of another within its block. However, Block A as a whole is to the right of Block C's medium black square.

2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. In block A, there are two medium black squares and one medium yellow square. The medium yellow square is below medium black square number two, and medium black square number one is at the bottom, below both medium black square number two and the medium yellow square.

2. In block B, there is a medium blue square at the bottom and a medium black square above it.

The question asks which object is to the left of a medium black square: the yellow thing or the medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

- The medium yellow square is below medium black square number two in block A, which means it is below and not to the left of medium black square number two. However, considering the arrangement, the medium yellow square is to the left of no medium black square within its own block (vertically arranged), but it is to the left of block B. Since the question specifically asks about being to the left of a medium black square and there's a medium black square in block B, the medium yellow square in block A is indeed to the left of the medium black square in block B.

- The medium blue square is at the bottom of block B and has a medium black square above it, not to its right or left within its own block. However, it is not to the left of any medium black square; instead, it is below one within its block and to the right of block A, which contains medium black squares.

Given this analysis, the object that is to the left of a medium black square is the yellow thing, as it is to the left of the medium black square in block B when considering the arrangement of the blocks.

3. The arrangement within block C is such that the big black square is to the left of the big yellow triangle and the small black circle, and the big yellow triangle is below the small black circle.

Given the arrangement, block C is to the right of block A, which in turn is to the right of block B. Since the big yellow square is in block B, we are looking for what is to the right of block B. Block A is directly to the right of block B and contains a small black circle. However, the question asks about the big yellow triangle and the big black square, both of which are in block C.

Considering block A's position between B and C, and given the internal arrangement of block C, both the big black square and the big yellow triangle are to the right of the big yellow square in block B, albeit not directly adjacent due to block A's presence.

2. Block B is below block A and contains a medium black square with a medium blue square below it.

Given the arrangement in Block A, neither medium yellow square number two nor medium yellow square number one is below a medium blue square; they are both above the medium blue square in Block A.

However, considering Block B, the question's phrasing might cause confusion, but it specifically asks about the relationship of the medium yellow squares to a medium blue square. Since Block B's arrangement (medium black square above a medium blue square) does not involve the medium yellow squares, the medium yellow squares' relationship to a medium blue square is determined by their arrangement within Block A. 

Therefore, neither medium yellow square number two nor medium yellow square number one is below a medium blue square in the context provided.

This statement directly tells us that the medium black circle is below the medium blue square.

2.

   - A medium black square at the bottom, which is below the medium blue square.
3. Block C has a medium blue square and is above block B but below block A.

Given the arrangement in block B, the medium black square is at the bottom. The medium blue square is above the medium black square, and medium yellow square number two is above the medium blue square. Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, but since the medium black square is at the bottom of block B, both medium yellow squares are above the medium black square in the overall arrangement considering all blocks.

However, the question specifically asks which object is below a medium black square, considering the medium black square in block A as well. Block C is below block A, and block B is below block C. The medium black square in block A is above block C, which contains a medium blue square, and block B, which contains the medium yellow squares among other shapes.

Therefore, considering the stack of blocks A, C, and B from top to bottom, and focusing on the medium black square in block A:
- Block C (with a medium blue square) is below the medium black square in block A.

Given the arrangement:
- Block B is below Block C.
- Block C has a medium yellow square.

This implies that the medium yellow square in Block C is above Block B. Since Block B has a medium black square (below the medium blue square), this medium black square in Block B is indeed below the medium yellow square in Block C.

3. For Block A, the arrangement is clear: the medium yellow square is below the medium black square, not the other way around.

2. Block B contains one medium yellow square.
3. Block C is above block B and to the left of block A. It has two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square.

Since block C is to the left of block A, and considering the internal arrangement of block C, the medium yellow square in block C is above the bottom blue square and below the top blue square. This means the medium yellow square in block C is to the left of the medium black square in block A.

The medium yellow square in block B is below block C and block A's positions relative to it are not explicitly described in terms of left or right, only that block C is above block B and to the left of block A. However, since block C is above block B, and block C is to the left of block A, it does not directly imply that block B is to the left or right of block A based on the given information. But considering typical spatial arrangements and the fact that block C's position relative to both A and B is described, it suggests a layout where block B could be below both A and C, potentially aligning with block A or being to the right, given the left positioning of C relative to A is emphasized.

Given the information, the medium yellow square in block C is definitely to the left of a medium square (the medium black square in block A). The position of the medium yellow square in block B is less clear in relation to being strictly to the left of a medium square based on the given descriptions.

However, the question asks which object is to the left of a medium square, and based on the information provided, we can confirm that at least the medium yellow square in block C meets this criterion.

Therefore, without making assumptions beyond the provided information, the most accurate answer we can give based on the details is that at least the medium yellow square in block C is to the left of a medium square.

- The medium yellow square in Block B has Block A above it, which contains medium yellow squares.

However, the question specifically asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square: the medium yellow square that is in block C or the medium yellow square that is in block B. 

Given the arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block C has the medium black square above it. However, there is no medium yellow square to the right of the medium yellow square in Block C within Block C itself. But considering the overall arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block C does not have any object specified to its right within its block that is also a medium yellow square. The question seems to be asking about the relative positions of the medium yellow squares in the different blocks rather than within the same block.

However, considering the blocks' arrangement, Block C (which contains a medium yellow square) is to the left of Block A (which contains medium yellow squares) and also to the left of Block B (which contains a medium yellow square). Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A and Block B.

But the question specifically asks which medium yellow square (the one in Block C or the one in Block B) is to the left of a medium yellow square. Since Block C is to the left of Block A and Block B, and Block A is above Block B, the medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of the medium yellow squares in both Block A and Block B. However, the medium yellow square in Block B does not have any medium yellow square to its left within its own block but does have medium yellow squares above it in Block A and to the right of the medium yellow square in Block C.

Given the specific phrasing of the question, it seems to be asking which of these medium yellow squares (the one in Block C or the one in Block B) is to the left of another medium yellow square. The medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A and Block B, but the question's phrasing makes it seem like it's asking about the immediate relative position of these specific squares to another medium yellow square.

However, considering the overall arrangement and the question's phrasing, the correct interpretation seems to be that the question is asking which of these medium yellow squares is to the left of another medium yellow square in the overall arrangement. Given this, the medium yellow square in Block C is indeed to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A and Block B.

Therefore, considering the overall arrangement, the correct answer should reflect that the medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of other medium yellow squares.

1. Block A contains a big blue circle, a big black square, and a big yellow triangle. The big blue circle is above and to the left of the big black square, which is below and to the left of the big yellow triangle. The big black square touches the bottom edge of block A.

2. Block B contains a medium blue square and a big yellow circle. The big yellow circle touches the right edge of block B and is near the medium blue square.

The question asks which object is above a medium shape: the big black square (which touches the bottom edge of a block) or the yellow thing (which touches the right edge of a block)?

Since the big black square touches the bottom edge of block A, it cannot be above any shape in block B, including the medium blue square, because block B is below block A.

The big yellow circle in block B touches the right edge of block B and is near the medium blue square. Given its description as ""near"" the medium blue square and the fact that it's a big shape, it's plausible that it could be above the medium blue square, but the text does not explicitly state their vertical relationship. However, given the choices and the information provided, we can infer that the most likely candidate to be above a medium shape is the yellow thing (the big yellow circle), as the big black square is at the bottom of its block and cannot be above a shape in the block below.

2. Medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number four and medium blue square number three.
3. Medium blue square number three is below medium blue square number four.

From these points, we can establish a vertical order for Block A from top to bottom as follows:
- Medium blue square number four (top)
- Medium blue square number three
- Medium blue square number two
- Medium blue square number one (bottom)

Given that Block A is below Block B, and Block B has one medium black square, the question asks what is below the black shape.

Since Block A is below Block B, and the topmost square of Block A is medium blue square number four, it is directly below the black square of Block B. Medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number four within Block A, so it is not directly below the black square of Block B.

2. Block A has a medium blue circle touching its bottom edge, and this circle is to the right of a medium blue triangle.
3. Block C has a medium yellow triangle below a small blue circle and a big black circle.

Given the arrangement in block A, the medium blue triangle is to the left of the medium blue circle, which touches the bottom edge of block A.

In block C, the medium yellow triangle is below the small blue circle and the big black circle, meaning it is not directly to the left of an object touching the bottom edge of block C. However, the problem statement does not explicitly state that the small blue circle or the big black circle touches the bottom edge of block C; it says the medium yellow triangle is below them. But considering the arrangement, for the medium yellow triangle to be below them and considering typical block arrangements, it's plausible that either the small blue circle or the big black circle could touch the bottom edge of an imaginary horizontal line within block C but not explicitly stated as the bottom edge of the block. However, the description does not provide a clear indication that the medium yellow triangle is directly to the left of an object touching the bottom edge of its block based on the given details.

2. Block A has a medium black square.
3. Block B contains a big yellow circle, a medium blue square, and a small blue triangle, along with a medium blue circle touching its right edge.

Given the positions of the blocks, the big blue square in block C has block B to its right. Within block B, the objects are positioned as follows:
- The big yellow circle is near to, to the left of, and below the medium blue circle.
- The medium blue square is below and to the right of the small blue triangle.

Since block B is to the right of block C (which contains the big blue square), and within block B, the small blue triangle is positioned such that it could be considered to the right of the big blue square in block C, we need to compare this with the position of the medium black square in block A.

Block A is above block C, and since the blocks' horizontal positions are described relative to each other (with block C being to the left of block B), the medium black square in block A cannot be directly compared in a straightforward left-right relationship to the big blue square without considering their vertical positioning and the overall layout. However, given the layout, the medium black square in block A is not described as being in a direct left-right relationship with the big blue square in block C or any objects in block B.

Therefore, based on the given information, the object that is most clearly described as being to the right of the big blue square is the small blue triangle in block B, due to block B's position to the right of block C.

2. The big yellow triangle is below a big blue square and the small blue circle.
3. The big blue square is near to and to the left of the small yellow square.
4. Block B has a medium yellow square, but since the question is focused on objects in relation to the yellow squares and Block A contains both a small and a big yellow shape (with the big one being a triangle, not a square, but still relevant for understanding the layout), we'll focus on Block A for the yellow square in question.

Given the layout, the big blue square is to the left of the small yellow square, and the big yellow triangle is below the big blue square and the small blue circle. However, the question specifically asks about what is below a yellow square. 

Since the big yellow triangle is below the big blue square and not directly mentioned to be below the small yellow square, but considering the layout, the object that could be below a yellow square (specifically the small yellow square in Block A, as the layout details are given for Block A) is not explicitly stated among the given options (small yellow square or the circle) to be directly below the small yellow square based on the provided information. However, considering typical spatial arrangements and the fact that we're trying to deduce based on given positions, there's no direct information placing the circle or the small yellow square below a yellow square based on the details given.

Given the ambiguity and focusing strictly on the information provided without making assumptions beyond it, the most accurate answer based on the direct information would be that neither the small yellow square nor the circle is explicitly stated to be below a yellow square, although the question's phrasing and the provided details might suggest a need for a spatial inference that isn't directly supported by the information as given.

3. Block C contains a medium yellow square, a medium black square, and a medium blue square.

1. Block A contains a medium black square. Its position relative to the other blocks is below block C, but we don't have information about its direct relationship with block B's squares.

2. Block B contains one medium black square and one medium yellow square. The medium black square is at the bottom, and the medium yellow square is above it.

3. Block C is to the right of block B and above block A. It contains two medium yellow squares (number one and number two) and a medium black square. The medium black square is below both yellow squares.

Given the question, ""Which object is above a medium black square? medium yellow square number one or the medium yellow square that is in block B?"", let's analyze:

- The medium yellow square in block B is directly above a medium black square within the same block.

- Medium yellow square number one in block C is above the medium black square in block C.

Therefore, both the medium yellow square in block B and medium yellow square number one in block C are above a medium black square.

3. Block B contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square, with the medium black square above the medium yellow square.
4. Block C contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square, with the medium blue square above the medium yellow square.

Given the arrangement, we can see that in Block B, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square, which means the medium black square is to the right of nothing in its own block but in the overall arrangement of blocks, it is not to the right of a medium yellow square in another block. However, considering the blocks' arrangement, Block C is to the right of Block B, and within Block C, the medium blue square is above (and thus not directly to the right of) the medium yellow square in its own block. However, considering the overall arrangement of blocks and their contents, both the medium black square and the medium blue square are in blocks that are either directly above or could be considered to the right of a medium yellow square when considering the entire setup.

However, the question specifically asks which object is to the right of a medium yellow square. Since Block A is to the right of Block B and contains a medium yellow square, and Block C is to the right of Block B and contains both a medium yellow square and a medium blue square, the medium blue square in Block C is indeed to the right of a medium yellow square in Block B. The medium black square, however, is directly above a medium yellow square within its own block (B) and is not to the right of a medium yellow square in the overall block arrangement concerning blocks A, B, and C.

Therefore, the object that is definitively to the right of a medium yellow square is the blue thing.

3. Block C, which is below Block A, contains two medium yellow squares and a small blue triangle.

The question asks what is below the big thing (the big blue square in Block B). Since Block A is below Block B, and Block C is below Block A, both Block A and Block C are below Block B. However, the question specifically asks about the medium blue square and the medium yellow square.

Block A, which is directly below Block B, contains a medium blue square. Block C, which is below Block A, contains medium yellow squares.

3. Block B contains two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square. A medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block.

4. Below the medium yellow square, there is medium blue square number two. However, it's also stated that below the medium yellow square, medium blue square number one is located. This seems contradictory at first glance, but given the constraints, it suggests a specific arrangement where the yellow square is positioned in relation to both blue squares in a way that both can be considered below it, but in the context of a stack or vertical arrangement, one must be directly below the yellow square.

5. Since Block C has one medium yellow square and is below Block B, and considering the arrangement described, the question seems to focus on the arrangement within Block B.

Given the description, both medium blue squares are mentioned as being below the medium yellow square in some capacity. However, the phrasing suggests a misunderstanding or misinterpretation might occur due to the description's complexity. Considering a logical stacking where a square can be above another, the description implies that the yellow square is positioned such that it's not directly clear which blue square is above it without assuming additional context not provided (like a side-by-side arrangement with one blue square stacked on the other).

However, the question specifically asks which object is above a medium yellow square, and based on the given descriptions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting ""below"" as implying a direct vertical stack. Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the question, the correct interpretation hinges on understanding the layout described.

Given the complexity and potential for misunderstanding in the description, and focusing on the logical deduction from the statements provided, the answer should align with the logical arrangement where ""below"" does not necessarily imply a direct vertical stack but rather a positional relationship that could accommodate both squares being in a position to be considered in relation to the yellow square.

However, upon careful reconsideration and focusing strictly on the logical implications of the statements provided, the correct interpretation should focus on the direct relationships described. The question's framing and the descriptions provided lead to a conclusion based on the logical arrangement and relationships outlined.

Therefore, considering the logical deductions and focusing on the clarity of the arrangement described, the most accurate answer, given the complexity and the direct implications of the statements, should reflect the understanding of the positional relationships outlined.

3. Block C is above Block B and contains a medium black square.
4. Block A is above Block C.

Given this arrangement, we can determine the vertical order of the blocks and their contents from top to bottom: Block A (medium black square), Block C (medium black square), Block B (medium black square, then medium yellow square number two, then medium yellow square number one).

Now, let's address the question: Which object is below a medium black square? The medium black square that is in Block A or the medium black square which is in Block B?

- The medium black square in Block A has Block C's medium black square below it.
- The medium black square in Block B has medium yellow square number two below it.

Therefore, the medium black square in Block A has another medium black square (from Block C) below it, and the medium black square in Block B has a medium yellow square below it. However, the question specifically asks about a medium black square being below another medium black square. Since only the medium black square in Block A has another medium black square (Block C's) below it, but considering the question's phrasing about being below a medium black square, we must recognize that Block C's medium black square is indeed below Block A's, fulfilling the condition for Block A's medium black square.

However, upon closer inspection, the question's wording and the provided options suggest a focus on whether a medium black square is below another medium black square directly in its own block or in the stack. The medium black square in Block B does have a yellow square below it, not another black square within its block, but in the stack, Block B's arrangement doesn't have a black square below another black square within itself. The question seems to ask which black square has something below it, focusing on the blocks A and B directly.

Given the options and reevaluating the question's intent:
- The medium black square in Block A does not have another medium black square directly below it within its block but does in the stack (Block C's).
- The medium black square in Block B does not have another medium black square below it; it has a yellow square.

Considering the direct implications and focusing on the blocks themselves:
- Block A's black square has Block C's below it in the stack.
- Block B's arrangement does not have a black square below its own black square.

However, the correct interpretation based on the question's phrasing and the provided options seems to hinge on recognizing that within the stack, Block A's medium black square indeed has another medium black square below it (Block C's), which was the initial correct observation. The confusion arose from overanalyzing the blocks' internal arrangements rather than the stack's overall order.

From the information provided, it's clear that the medium yellow circle is directly to the right of the big yellow circle. However, the question asks about a blue object or a black shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

Since Block B is above Block A and contains a big blue triangle, the blue object (big blue triangle) cannot be to the right of the big yellow circle in the same block (Block A) but could potentially be above it.

The small black triangle is indeed touching the bottom edge of Block A but is below the medium yellow circle, which is to the right of the big yellow circle. Therefore, it is not directly to the right of the big yellow circle but is in the same vertical line as the medium yellow circle.

1. Block B is above Block C, and Block C is above Block A. So, the order from top to bottom is B, C, A.

2. The yellow object (medium yellow square) is in Block B and is touching the bottom edge of this block. This means it is the lowest object in Block B.

3. Since Block C is below Block B, and Block C contains one medium blue square, this blue square is below the yellow object.

4. Block A is below Block C, and it contains two medium black squares, with medium black square number one below medium black square number two.

Given this order, the medium blue square in Block C is directly below the yellow object, not either of the black squares. However, if we're looking at the overall stack and considering what black square is below the yellow object in the entire arrangement (not necessarily directly below), we can continue the logic:

- The yellow object is in Block B.
- Below Block B is Block C with a blue square.
- Below Block C is Block A with the black squares.

So, both black squares are below the yellow object in the overall arrangement, but neither is directly below it. The question seems to ask for what is below in a general sense, not necessarily directly below.

6. The medium blue square is below medium yellow square number one, which is below medium yellow square number two.

From the information given, we know the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block C is below the two medium yellow squares in Block C. Since Block A is below Block C and contains a medium blue square, it's reasonable to infer that the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block C is actually part of Block A.

Given that Block A is below Block C and Block C is to the right of Block B, Block A and Block B's positions relative to each other are not directly stated, but we can infer their relationship based on the information about Block C. However, the question specifically asks about what is below the thing touching the bottom edge of a block, which we've established is a medium blue square that is part of Block A.

Since Block A is below Block C and the question pertains to what is below the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block C (which is part of Block A), we are essentially looking for what is below Block A. The provided information does not explicitly state the relative vertical positions of Block A and Block B, only their positions relative to Block C.

However, given the information and focusing on the question about what is below the thing touching the bottom edge of a block (the medium blue square in Block A), none of the options directly answer the question based on the given spatial relationships, as we cannot definitively determine from the information provided what is below Block A (the medium blue square) in relation to Block B (medium black square) and Block C (medium yellow squares).

But, considering the question's phrasing and the given options, it seems we are to consider the immediate context of Block C and the blocks' contents as described. The medium blue square is below the yellow squares within Block C's context, and since Block A is below Block C, if we consider the stacking within Block C and its relation to Block A, the question might be guiding us to think about the blocks' contents rather than their overall positions.

However, this interpretation seems to lead to confusion based on the original explanation. The correct approach should focus on the fact that the question asks what is below the thing touching the bottom edge of a block, which we've identified as a medium blue square. Since this medium blue square is part of Block A and is described in relation to Block C's contents, the actual question seems to be about the spatial relationship outside the blocks' individual contents, which isn't directly answerable with the given options based on the initial explanation.

Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the information about what is below the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block C (and considering Block A's position), the question's framing seems flawed for a direct answer based on the provided spatial relationships.

3. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, Block A (which contains the medium blue square) is to the left of a medium yellow square (the one in Block B).
4. Additionally, Block C contains two medium yellow squares, but Block A is not to the left of Block C; it's to the left of Block B.
5. However, considering the arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block B does not touch the bottom edge of Block B (this detail is not provided, but we know the arrangement of Block C and can infer Block B has a single yellow square with no specified position). The medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of a block is in Block C, which is not directly related to Block A's position.
6. Therefore, the object to the left of a medium yellow square is indeed the blue thing (medium blue square in Block A), as it is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B.

1. The medium black circle is touching the left edge of Block A and is above and to the left of the big yellow circle.
2. The big yellow circle is touching the bottom edge of Block A, which means it is directly above Block B.
3. The small yellow circle is to the right of the big yellow circle and below and near to the medium yellow triangle.
4. Since the big yellow circle is touching the bottom edge of Block A and the small yellow square is in Block B (below Block A), the big yellow circle is directly above the small yellow square.

However, the question asks about the medium yellow circle and the triangle in relation to the small yellow square. Given the arrangement:

- The medium yellow triangle is above the small yellow circle, which is near the bottom edge of Block A. This implies the triangle is above the bottom edge of Block A, thus potentially above the square in Block B.
- The medium yellow circle's position is not as clearly defined in relation to the bottom edge of Block A, but it is mentioned as part of the contents of Block A without specific relation to the bottom edge or the shapes near it.

Given the information, both the medium yellow circle and the triangle are in Block A, which is above Block B, but the specific positioning details suggest the triangle is more directly above the small yellow square due to its proximity to the small yellow circle and the bottom edge of Block A. However, without explicit information stating the medium yellow circle is not above the square, and considering the nature of the question, we must infer based on the provided arrangement.

Since both shapes are in Block A and the question does not provide a clear disqualification for either, but the description places the triangle more definitively near the bottom edge of Block A (thus above the square), the most accurate answer based on the given information would consider both shapes' potential positioning relative to the square.

Block A has two medium black squares, with the first one touching the bottom edge of the block and the second one above it. Block C is to the right of block A and has two medium blue squares in the same arrangement (one touching the bottom edge and the other above it).

Block B is below block C and has a single medium black square. Since block C is above block B, both medium blue squares in block C are above the medium black square in block B.

However, considering block A and its position relative to block C, we can see that the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block C is at the same vertical level as the top medium black square in block A (medium black square number two). This means the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block C is below the top medium black square in block A, but above the bottom medium black square in block A.

Medium blue square number two is above the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block C, which puts it above the top medium black square in block A as well. However, it is still above the medium black square in block B.

Given the arrangement, the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block C is indeed below a medium black square (the top one in block A), but not below the one in its own column (block B). Medium blue square number two is not below any medium black square in its own column but is below the top medium black square in block A's column.

However, the question asks which object is below a medium black square without specifying the column. Therefore, considering all medium black squares:

The medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block C is below a medium black square (the second one in block A), making option 1 correct in the context of the question.

4. The big yellow circle is near to the small black triangle.

From point 3, we know the small black triangle is below the medium yellow circle. Additionally, point 2 tells us the small black square is above both the small black triangle and the medium yellow circle, so the small black square cannot be below the medium yellow circle.

2. Block B contains a medium blue square, one medium yellow square, and a medium black square. The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block and is below the medium yellow square and the medium black square. Also, below the medium black square is the medium yellow square. This means the medium black square is above the medium yellow square in Block B.

3. Block C contains a medium yellow square, but there's no information about any object being above it within Block C itself.

Given the question asks which object is above a medium yellow square - the medium yellow square that is in block B or the medium yellow square that is in block C, we can deduce:

- In Block B, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square.
- There's no information about an object above the medium yellow square in Block C that is also a medium yellow square, but since Block A is to the right of Block C and Block B is above Block A, and given the medium blue square in Block A is above its medium yellow square, it does not directly relate to Block C's arrangement in the context of the question. However, considering the arrangement of blocks (B above A, A to the right of C), and focusing on the question's specific ask about medium yellow squares in B and C, we don't have a direct comparison to make since B's arrangement is clear (with a black square above a yellow square), but C's isn't described in relation to another yellow square.

However, the actual question is about which medium yellow square (Block B or Block C) is above another medium yellow square. The provided details do not support a direct comparison since we're asked to compare the positions of medium yellow squares in relation to each other across different blocks, not within the same block's stack. 

Given the misunderstanding in the explanation process, let's correct the approach based on the blocks' arrangement and the question's specific wording:

- Block B is above Block A, and Block A is to the right of Block C. The question is about which medium yellow square is above another, focusing on the ones in Block B and Block C. Since Block B is above Block A and Block A contains a medium yellow square, Block B's medium yellow square is indeed above Block A's medium yellow square. However, the question specifically compares the positions of the medium yellow squares in Block B and Block C in relation to being above another medium yellow square.

Given the corrected understanding of the question, the answer should be derived from the direct comparison of the positions of the medium yellow squares in relation to the question's criteria:

Since Block B is above Block A and Block A is to the right of Block C, and considering the specific ask about which medium yellow square (B or C) is above another medium yellow square, the correct interpretation should focus on the blocks' arrangement and the presence of medium yellow squares in a manner that aligns with the question's intent.

However, the explanation inadvertently bypassed directly answering the posed question by misinterpreting the comparison basis.

Correcting for the oversight and focusing on the question's requirement:

The medium yellow square in Block B is part of a stack where it is above another yellow square (considering the arrangement with the black square and the description provided), but the question's framing about which object is above a medium yellow square - the medium yellow square in Block B or the medium yellow square in Block C, requires clarification based on the blocks' arrangement and the specific ask.

Given the blocks' arrangement (B above A, A to the right of C), and focusing on the question's intent:

The correct answer, based on the direct interpretation of the question and the provided setup, should be focused on the comparison of the medium yellow squares' positions in Block B and Block C in relation to being above another medium yellow square.

- In block B, above the medium yellow square is a medium blue square.

Therefore, considering both blocks, the answer to what is above the thing touching the bottom edge of a block can be either a medium black square (in block A) or a blue thing (in block B), but since the question specifically asks about the options provided and does not mention a black square as an option, we focus on the provided choices. Given the choices, the answer that fits best considering both blocks is that in one block (B), it is indeed a ""blue thing"" that is above the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge.

However, the question asks for a choice that applies considering the provided options and the fact that in both blocks, a medium yellow square is at the bottom. The question seems to seek a singular choice that fits both descriptions given the constraints. Since the question specifically asks about what is above the thing touching the bottom edge and provides options that include ""medium yellow square"" and ""blue thing,"" and given that in both blocks the thing touching the bottom is a medium yellow square but only in one block is there something above it that matches the options (blue thing in block B), but realizing the question's framing might imply looking for a direct comparison:

Given the framing of the question seems to be slightly misunderstood in the explanation regarding the direct options provided, the correct interpretation should directly address the options given without overcomplicating:

- The thing touching the bottom edge of a block in both cases is a medium yellow square.
- The question asks what is above this, and since in one case it's a blue thing directly above the yellow square in block B, but considering the structure of the question and options provided, the direct answer to what is above the yellow square (the thing touching the bottom edge) in the context given should directly correspond to one of the options without misinterpretation.

Given the information about Block A, there's no direct comparison to be made with the medium yellow square in Block A, as Block A only contains one medium yellow square and no direct left-right comparison to the medium black squares is provided within Block A itself.

   - medium blue square 1 below medium blue square 2.
   - medium blue square 2 below medium black square.

From the information about Block C, we can deduce that the medium yellow square is below all the other squares, and medium blue square 2 is below the medium black square but above medium blue square 1 and the medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium black square in Block C is above a medium blue square (specifically, medium blue square 2).

For Block A, there is no information about a medium blue square being above the medium black square. The medium black square in Block A is below a medium yellow square, not a medium blue square.

Given the question, ""Which object is below a medium blue square? the medium black square that is in block A or the medium black square that is in block C?"", the answer is neither of the medium black squares is below a medium blue square based on the given descriptions. The medium black square in Block C is actually above a medium blue square, and there's no indication that the medium black square in Block A is in a position relative to a medium blue square that would satisfy the condition of being below it.

However, re-reading the question carefully, it asks which of the medium black squares is below a medium blue square. Since neither of the medium black squares is described as being below a medium blue square (the one in Block C is actually above one), but considering the phrasing of the question and the options provided, the most accurate interpretation based on the given descriptions is that none of the medium black squares, as described, are below a medium blue square.

4. Block B contains one medium black square.
5. Block C contains one medium yellow square and a medium black square, with the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of the block and below the medium black square.

We need to find out which object is to the left of a blue object.

Since Block C is to the left of Block A, and Block A contains a medium blue square, Block C is to the left of the blue object. Within Block C, the medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of the block. Therefore, this medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of the blue object in Block A.

Additionally, within Block A, the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square. However, the question asks which object is to the left of a blue object, not above it. So, the position of the medium yellow square in Block A relative to its blue square does not directly answer the question about being to the left.

Given the layout, the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (Block C) is indeed to the left of the blue object in Block A.

2. Block B has a medium blue square at the bottom, with a medium black square above it. Since the medium black square is above the medium blue square in the same block, it is not to the right of the medium blue square in Block B.

Block A is below Block C and contains a medium blue square. Since Block A is below Block C, the medium blue square in Block A cannot be to the left of any medium blue square in Block C. However, considering Block B and Block A's positions relative to each other is not directly stated, but we know Block A is below Block C and Block C is to the right of Block B. This implies Block A could be to the left of, below, or diagonally below-left of Block B. If Block A is diagonally below-left or directly below Block B, the medium blue square in Block A would not be to the left of the medium blue square in Block B. However, if Block A is to the left of Block B, then the medium blue square in Block A would indeed be to the left of the medium blue square in Block B.

Block B contains a medium blue square and is to the left of Block C. Since Block C contains medium blue squares and is to the right of Block B, the medium blue square in Block B is to the left of a medium blue square (those in Block C).

Given the information, we can conclude that the medium blue square in Block B is definitely to the left of a medium blue square (in Block C). The medium blue square in Block A could potentially be to the left of the medium blue square in Block B, depending on the exact positioning of Block A relative to Block B, but this is not definitively stated. However, the question does not require a definitive position of Block A relative to Block B to answer whether the medium blue square in Block A or Block B is to the left of a medium blue square; it asks which object is to the left of a medium blue square, and from the given information, we can confirm that at least the medium blue square in Block B is to the left of a medium blue square.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer is at least the medium blue square in Block B. However, given the ambiguity in the positioning of Block A relative to Block B and the phrasing of the question, the most accurate interpretation considering all possibilities would be that at least one of them is to the left of a medium blue square, but the question seems to be asking for a choice between them. Since we can confirm the medium blue square in Block B is to the left of a medium blue square, and the status of Block A's medium blue square is dependent on its exact positioning relative to Block B (which is not clearly stated), the safest choice based on the given information would be:

The arrangement in block B is such that medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and a medium blue square. However, the description clarifies that the medium blue square is above medium black square number two.

Given the arrangement, we want to find out which object is to the left of a medium black square.

- Medium blue square number two is in block A, which is to the left of block B. Since block B contains medium black squares, medium blue square number two is indeed to the left of a medium black square.
- The medium blue square in block B is described in relation to the medium black squares within the same block. However, considering the blocks' arrangement, anything in block A is to the left of anything in block B. Therefore, the medium blue square in block B is not to the left of a medium black square in the context of the blocks' arrangement but rather is positioned above or between them within the same block.

4. Below medium yellow square number three and the medium black square is medium yellow square number two.

From point 5, we know that medium yellow square number three is below the medium black square. 

However, point 4 seems to create a loop with point 5, but focusing on the question, we only need to determine which yellow square is above a medium black square based on the direct statements.

Given the direct statements about what is ""below"" a medium black square, we infer what is above by looking at the inverse relationships:

- Medium yellow square number one is explicitly stated to be below a medium black square, which means the black square is above it, not the other way around.
- Medium yellow square number three is also below a medium black square, which again means the black square is above it.

However, the question asks which object is above a medium black square, and based on the given statements, we can see that neither medium yellow square number one nor medium yellow square number two is explicitly stated to be above a medium black square in a direct relationship. 

But, analyzing the structure described, if medium yellow square number one is below a medium black square and medium yellow square number three, and considering the positioning logic provided, it seems there's an inconsistency or a need for further clarification in the problem statement regarding the exact spatial arrangement and what is directly above or below what.

1. Identify the objects touching the bottom edge of a block: 
   - Medium yellow square number one in block A.
   - Medium blue square number one in block B.

2. Determine which objects are to the right of these:
   - Since block B is to the left of block A, anything in block A will be to the right of something in block B.
   - Medium blue square number one in block B is touching the bottom edge of block B. All of block A is to the right of block B, so the medium blue square in block A is to the right of medium blue square number one in block B.

3. Analyze the options given:
   - Option 0: medium blue square number two. This is in block B, which is to the left of block A, so it cannot be to the right of something in block A. However, it is above medium blue square number one in block B, so it is to the right of nothing that touches the bottom edge of its own block, but it is above something that does. Yet, considering block A, medium blue square number two is not to the right of anything in block A. The medium yellow square number one touches the bottom of block A and medium blue square number two is not to the right of it.
   - Option 1: the medium blue square that is in block A. As determined earlier, this square is to the right of medium blue square number one in block B, which touches the bottom edge of block B.

4. Conclusion:
   - Given the information, the medium blue square in block A is indeed to the right of something (medium blue square number one in block B) that touches the bottom edge of a block (block B).

4. Below the medium yellow square and medium blue square number two, there is medium blue square number one.
5. Below medium blue square number two, there is the medium yellow square.
6. Below the blue shape which is below medium blue square number two is the medium black square.

From points 3 and 6, we can confirm the order in Block B from top to bottom as follows:
- Medium blue square number two
- Medium yellow square
- Medium blue square number one
- Medium black square

Given this order, medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two. However, the question asks which object is below a medium blue square: medium blue square number one or the medium blue square which is in block A.

Since the medium blue square in block A is not specified to be above or below any other blue square within its block (as it's the only one), and considering the arrangement in block B, the answer to the question is that medium blue square number one is below a medium blue square (number two in block B).

However, there is no information that the medium blue square in block A is below another medium blue square because block A only contains one medium blue square.

Therefore, the object that is below a medium blue square is medium blue square number one.

4. Block B has a medium yellow square and a medium black square, with the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of the block and below the medium black square.
5. Block C has only one medium black square.

Given the arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block A is above its medium black square. Since Block A is below Block C, the medium yellow square in Block A cannot be to the left of a medium black square in Block C, considering the vertical arrangement.

However, considering Block B, the medium yellow square is below the medium black square within the same block. But since Block C, which contains a medium black square, is to the right of Block B, the medium yellow square in Block B is indeed to the left of the medium black square in Block C.

Given the question's options, the correct answer involves identifying which medium yellow square is to the left of a medium black square. Since the medium yellow square in Block A is not to the left of any medium black square due to its position below Block C and its internal arrangement, it does not fit the criteria based on the given descriptions and arrangements.

Therefore, the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (which is in Block B) is to the left of a medium black square (considering the arrangement with Block C).

2. Block B is below block A and contains two medium blue circles and a small black triangle.

Given the arrangement, the big black triangle is directly below the big blue triangle within block A. 

Considering the blocks' arrangement, block B (which contains the small black triangle) is below block A, which means the small black triangle is also below the big blue triangle, albeit not directly within the same block.

Given the arrangement, since Block A is below Block C, anything in Block A could potentially be below the yellow square in Block C, depending on their specific positions within the blocks.

Now, looking at the arrangement within Block A:
- Medium black square number one is below a medium blue square and medium black square number two.
- The medium blue square is below medium black square number two.

This means medium black square number two is above both the medium blue square and medium black square number one in Block A.

Since Block A is below Block C, and considering the internal arrangement of Block A, medium black square number two cannot be directly below the yellow square because it is the topmost element in Block A's internal arrangement.

However, Block B is to the left of Block C, and its contents are not vertically aligned with Block C's contents based on the given information. Therefore, the medium black square in Block B cannot be directly below the yellow square in Block C either.

3. Block C contains a medium black square and is to the right of block A.

Given that block C is to the right of block A, and block A contains the medium yellow square, the medium black square in block C is to the right of the medium yellow square.

For medium black square number two in block B to be to the right of the medium yellow square, it would have to be in a block that is to the right of block A or somehow positioned to the right within its own block relative to block A.

The medium yellow square in Block B is to the left of the medium blue square and the medium black square within Block B but not to the left of any square in Block A since Block A is to the left of Block B.

However, the question asks which object is to the left of a medium square. Both medium yellow squares are above or to the left of a medium square within their respective blocks. The medium yellow square in Block A is above (and therefore can be considered to the left in a broad sense, but more accurately, it's ""above"") a medium black square, and the medium yellow square in Block B is above a medium blue square and indirectly to the left of a medium black square in its block.

Considering the question's phrasing, the most accurate interpretation is that both medium yellow squares are to the left (or more accurately, ""above"") of a medium square within their respective blocks. However, if we strictly interpret ""to the left"" in terms of horizontal positioning relative to another medium square, then the question's premise becomes somewhat ambiguous. Given the blocks' arrangement and focusing strictly on horizontal positioning, Block A's yellow square is to the left of all squares in Block B, including the medium squares.

4. Block C contains a medium blue square and a medium yellow square, with the medium blue square below the medium yellow square.

Given the arrangement, the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of Block A is above the medium blue square in Block B.

In Block C, the medium yellow square is above the medium blue square.

2. Block C is above block A and to the right of block B.
3. The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of block C, and the small blue circle is near to it.

Given the layout, since the big blue triangle is touching the right edge of block C and the small blue circle is near to it, the small blue circle must be to the left of the big blue triangle within block C.

Now, considering the blocks' positions relative to each other:
- Block C is above block A, so block A (containing the big yellow triangle) is below the small blue circle, not to its left or right.
- Block C is to the right of block B, which means block B (containing the small black square and the small black circle) is to the left of block C and, consequently, to the left of the small blue circle.

Therefore, the object to the left of the small blue circle is the black square (and the small black circle, but the question only asks about the black square and the big yellow triangle).

2. Block B contains one medium yellow square.
3. Block C is below block B and to the right of block A, and it has one medium blue square with a medium yellow square below it.

Since block C has a medium yellow square below the medium blue square, and block C is below block B (which also has a medium yellow square), we are only concerned with the medium yellow square in block C for the comparison with the black squares in block A.

Given that block C is to the right of block A, the vertical positioning of the squares in block A can be compared to the squares in block C. 

The medium blue square in block C is above the medium yellow square. Since block C is to the right of block A, the vertical positioning of block A's squares can be directly compared to block C's. Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one in block A. 

However, there is no direct vertical relationship between the black squares in block A and the yellow square in block C that would make one directly above the other. But considering the question's intent seems to be about the vertical positioning relative to the yellow square in block C and assuming a grid-like structure where blocks A and C share a common vertical reference, we can proceed under the assumption that the question seeks to understand the relative vertical positioning as if the blocks were aligned.

Given this, and focusing strictly on the vertical, neither of the black squares in block A is directly above the medium yellow square in block C in a shared vertical column, but if comparing their vertical positions, medium black square number two is at a higher vertical level than medium black square number one.

However, the question's phrasing about being ""above a medium yellow square"" could imply a direct vertical relationship that isn't present here, as the black squares and the yellow square in question are not in the same vertical column due to being in different blocks (A and C) that are only related by being in a grid-like arrangement with block C to the right of block A.

Given the ambiguity in interpreting the question's intent regarding direct vertical alignment versus relative vertical positioning across different blocks, the most accurate interpretation under strict vertical alignment without direct columnar relationship would be:

4. Block C, which is to the right of block B, contains four medium yellow squares.

Since block B is to the right of block A, and block B contains a medium black square, the immediate object to the right of the blue square is the black square in block B. Block C, which contains the medium yellow squares, is to the right of block B, not directly to the right of block A.

2. In block B, there's a medium yellow circle, a small black circle, and a big blue triangle. The big blue triangle is to the right of and below the medium yellow circle, which is to the right of the small black circle.

Given the question, ""What is to the right of the small object?"" the small object in question is the small black circle in block B, since it's the only object described as small.

According to the description of block B, the medium yellow circle is to the right of the small black circle, and the big blue triangle is to the right of and below the medium yellow circle. Therefore, the big blue triangle is indeed to the right of the small black circle, albeit indirectly.

However, the question also asks if this big blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of a block. According to the description, the big blue triangle is below the medium yellow circle but there's no explicit mention that it's touching the bottom edge of block B. Yet, given the layout, it's plausible to infer that it could be touching the bottom edge, but this is not explicitly stated for block B as it was for some shapes in block A.

Considering the medium black triangle, it is in block A and not directly related to the small black circle's position in block B.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given information is that the big blue triangle is to the right of the small object, but the question's phrasing about touching the bottom edge of a block introduces ambiguity.

1. Block A contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square, with the medium black square below the medium yellow square.
2. Block B is to the left of Block A and contains two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square.
3. In Block B, the medium yellow square is below both medium blue squares, and medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.

Given the arrangement in Block B, medium blue square number one is touching the medium yellow square, and since the medium yellow square is at the bottom of the arrangement of the three squares in Block B, we can infer that the medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block B. Therefore, medium blue square number one is above the medium yellow square and is not touching the bottom edge of Block B, but it is above something that is.

However, since Block A is to the right of Block B, and in Block A, the medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block A, we need to find out which object is to the right of something touching the bottom edge of a block. Given Block A's position to the right of Block B, and considering the objects within Block B, none of the blue squares in Block B are to the right of something touching the bottom edge of a block; they are to the left.

But considering the question's wording, which object is to the right of a thing which is touching the bottom edge of a block, we realize the question is asking about the relative position to something touching the bottom edge of a block, not necessarily within the same block. Since Block A is to the right of Block B, and in Block A, the medium black square touches the bottom edge, we look for objects in Block B that are to the right of something in their own block touching the bottom edge. However, the actual comparison should consider Block A's objects as the reference for ""touching the bottom edge of a block"" since Block A is to the right.

Given this, both medium blue squares in Block B are to the left of Block A, not to the right of something touching the bottom edge of Block A. However, considering the logic that should apply based on the question's phrasing and the blocks' layout, we are actually being asked to consider the internal arrangement of Block B in a manner that doesn't directly apply to the question as phrased.

Correcting the thought process: Since Block A is to the right of Block B, and we are looking for something in Block B that is to the right of something touching the bottom edge of a block (considering the logic now correctly), we realize the question is trying to trick us into overcomplicating. The medium yellow square in Block B is at the bottom of the blue squares' arrangement but is not the bottommost object mentioned in the overall description (that would be the black square in Block A and the implied bottom of each block). However, within Block B's context, medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one, and medium blue square number one is above the yellow square. Since the actual question refers to the relative position ""to the right of a thing which is touching the bottom edge of a block,"" and considering the arrangement within Block B and its position relative to Block A, the logic applied initially was overly complicated.

Given the corrected understanding that we are looking for an object to the right of something touching the bottom edge within the context provided, and realizing the confusion in the explanation, let's simplify: The question essentially asks which blue square is to the right of something touching the bottom edge of a block. Given Block B's internal arrangement and its position to the left of Block A, the logic should focus on the internal arrangement of Block B and the implication of the question.

However, the correct interpretation should be straightforward: considering the arrangement and the question's phrasing, we determine the answer based on the blocks' and squares' relative positions. The critical insight is recognizing which square is to the right of the other within Block B and how the question's phrasing applies to their arrangement.

Given the corrected logic and focusing on the question's requirement: medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one in Block B, and the question's phrasing about being to the right of something touching the bottom edge of a block applies to the internal arrangement of Block B in a manner that was initially misinterpreted.

The concise answer, focusing correctly on the question's requirement and the blocks' arrangement, is that medium blue square number two is to the right of medium blue square number one within Block B, but considering the actual question, we recognize the confusion in the explanation provided.

3. Block C, to the left of Block B, has two medium yellow squares, one above the other.

Given the arrangement, we need to determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square: the blue object or the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

- The blue object is below the yellow squares in Block B, so it is not directly to the right of any yellow square.
- However, considering Block C is to the left of Block B, and Block B has a yellow square touching the bottom edge of Block B (but above the blue square), the yellow square in Block B that touches the bottom edge of the arrangement of yellow squares (but not the block itself as there is a black square below it) is to the right of the yellow square in Block C that touches the bottom edge of Block C.

But looking at Block B alone, the blue square is below the two yellow squares but the black square is also below the yellow squares and it is touching the bottom edge of block B. The question asks which object is to the right of a medium yellow square: the blue object or the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block. 

Considering Block B, the blue square is to the right of the yellow square in Block A. Also, the yellow square touching the bottom edge of a block is in Block C and it is to the left of block B so it can't be to the right of the yellow square in block A.

So the answer to the question is that the blue object is to the right of a medium yellow square.

- The medium black square in block B is above the medium yellow square in block A.
- In block C, the medium blue square is above a medium yellow square, which is above a medium black square.

The question asks which object is below a medium black square. Based on the information:

- The medium yellow square in block A is below the medium black square in block B.
- In block C, the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square, and the medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

However, the question specifically asks about the medium blue square and the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block in relation to being below a medium black square.

Given the arrangement, the medium black square touching the bottom edge of a block (in block C) cannot be below another medium black square within the same block because it's at the bottom. However, considering the stacking of blocks, the medium black square in block C is indeed below the medium black square in block B.

The medium blue square in block C is not below a medium black square in its own block's context but is below the medium black square in block B when considering the overall stack of blocks.

Since the big blue square is in block C and not directly below block A (because block A is to the right of block C, not directly above it), the correct answer regarding the options provided is the big black circle, as it is in block B, which is directly below block A.

1. Block B has a medium blue circle and is to the right of block A.
2. Block C is to the left of block B and contains a small blue triangle, a medium black square, and a medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of the block.
3. The medium yellow square is below and to the left of the medium black square.
4. The small blue triangle is below the medium black square and a big yellow circle, with the big yellow circle to the right of the small blue triangle.

Given that block C is to the left of block B, which contains the medium blue circle, block C and all its contents are to the left of the medium blue circle. This includes the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of block C.

The big yellow circle is also in block C, which places it to the left of the medium blue circle in block B.

Therefore, both the big yellow circle and the medium yellow square (the thing touching the bottom edge of a block) are to the left of the medium blue circle.

1. Block A contains two medium yellow squares (number one and number two) and a medium blue square.
2. The medium blue square is below medium yellow square number two.
3. Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
4. This implies that medium yellow square number two is above the medium blue square.
5. Since medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, it is not directly above the medium blue square in Block A. However, considering Block B is irrelevant to the positioning within Block A, but it does contain a medium blue square. Block A's description, however, makes it clear that only one yellow square is directly above the blue square in Block A.
6. But since Block B only has a medium blue square and no yellow squares, Block A's medium yellow square number one could be indirectly above Block B's medium blue square if considering the blocks' stacking (A above B).

However, based on the information given about the positions within Block A itself and the question's focus on an object being ""above a medium blue square,"" we can deduce the answer focusing on the arrangement within Block A where the direct relationship is described.

Therefore, the object directly above a medium blue square within Block A's description is medium yellow square number two.

   - Medium black square number one is at the bottom.
   - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one and below the medium yellow square.

Given the arrangement, in Block B, the medium yellow square is above a medium black square (medium black square number two).

In Block A, the medium yellow square is above a medium black square as well.

The question asks which object is to the left of a medium black square. Since Block B is to the left of Block A, and in Block B, the medium yellow square is above a medium black square, it means the medium yellow square in Block B is to the left of a medium black square in Block A.

However, considering the blocks individually, the medium yellow square in Block A is above (and therefore to the left or right, depending on perspective, but not directly to the left in a horizontal sense) a medium black square within its own block. The question seems to be asking about the relative position between blocks, not within them.

Given the arrangement and the question's phrasing, the most accurate interpretation is that the medium yellow square in Block B is directly involved in the comparison between blocks. However, both yellow squares are above a black square in their respective blocks, but the question seems to focus on the inter-block relationship.

Therefore, considering the ambiguity and focusing on the inter-block comparison as suggested by the question, the answer that reflects the direct comparison asked is:

Which object is below a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block? the medium blue square that is in block C or the medium blue square that is in block A??
0) the medium blue square  that is in block C
1) the medium blue square  that is in block A
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the information given step by step:

1. In block A, there is a medium black square below a medium blue square. This means the medium black square is touching the bottom edge of block A or is at least below the blue square, but we are not told if it is touching the bottom edge of block A. However, we do know the medium blue square in block A is above a medium black square.

2. In block B, there is only a medium black square. There's no information about its position relative to the edges of the block, other than it being the only object in block B.

3. In block C, there is a medium black square touching the bottom edge of the block, and above it, there is a medium blue square.

Given the question, ""Which object is below a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block?"" we can directly apply the information from block C. The medium blue square in block C is above the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of block C. Therefore, the medium blue square in block C is not below but above an object touching the bottom edge of its block.

However, looking at block A, the description does not explicitly state that the medium black square is touching the bottom edge of block A, only that it is below the medium blue square. But since we are looking for an object that is below something touching the bottom edge of a block, and the only block where we are certain of an object touching the bottom edge is block C, we can see that the medium blue square in block A does not fit the given criteria based on the information provided about block A itself.

But considering the question's phrasing again and focusing on block A, if we were to strictly interpret ""below a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block,"" without the direct statement that the black square in block A is touching the bottom edge, we might initially think neither fits perfectly based on given details. However, the question essentially asks which blue square is above an object known to touch the bottom of its block. Given this, the actual direct answer from the information provided is related to block C, but in the context of the question asked (which object is below a thing touching the bottom edge), it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the explanation regarding the positions and the question's requirements.

Given the misunderstanding in the explanation process, let's correct the approach based on the question asked: ""Which object is below a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block?"" actually inverts the relationship asked about. The proper understanding should be that we are looking for an object that has something above it which is touching the bottom edge of a block, but that's a misinterpretation of the question's intent. The correct interpretation should focus on the direct relationship described.

Correcting the approach: Since the medium black square in block C is touching the bottom edge and the medium blue square is above it, this does not directly answer the question as initially misinterpreted. The question seeks which blue square is below an object touching the bottom edge of its block. However, upon reevaluation, it's clear the direct question aims to understand the relative positioning in a manner that was initially incorrectly assessed.

Reassessing the final interpretation: 
- The medium blue square in block A is above a medium black square, but we are not explicitly told the black square touches the bottom edge of block A.
- The medium blue square in block C is above a medium black square that is explicitly stated to touch the bottom edge of block C.

Given this, the correct answer to the question as it was initially presented and correctly understood should be that the medium blue square in block A does not have clear evidence of being above or below something touching the bottom edge based on the block A description alone. However, considering the direct question and the explicit details provided for block C, it seems there was an error in the logical approach to directly answer the question as per the details given for each block.

The correct logical approach should directly address the question without the confusion introduced in the explanation process. The question asks for an object below a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block, but the explanation inadvertently inverted the relationship or misunderstood the positioning as per the question's requirements.

Given the descriptions and correcting for the misunderstanding in the explanation:
- The question's phrasing and the descriptions provided do not align with the initial explanation's conclusion, indicating a need to reassess the direct question without the introduced confusion.

Directly addressing the corrected understanding of the question without the confusion:
- Since we are looking for an object ""below a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block,"" and considering the corrected understanding of the blocks' descriptions, the question's phrasing actually seeks a scenario not directly described in the initial explanation's conclusion.

Correct answer based on the reevaluation of the question and the provided descriptions:
Considering the provided details and the direct phrasing of the question, the answer should align with the scenario described in block A or the corrected understanding of the question's requirements.

Given the corrected approach and understanding of the question, the answer is not directly aligned with the initial explanation's logic, indicating a need to reassess the options provided in the context of the corrected understanding.

2. Block B is below C.
3. Block A contains two medium yellow squares, with medium yellow square number one below medium yellow square number two.
4. Block B contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square. Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block and is below the medium black square and medium blue square number two.
5. Block C contains one medium blue square.

Given the arrangement, the medium blue square in Block C is above Block A (which doesn't have any blue squares) and above Block B. In Block B, medium blue square number two is above the medium black square, and medium blue square number one is below the medium black square.

Therefore, the medium black square is below the medium blue square in Block B (specifically, medium blue square number two), and since the question asks which object is below a medium blue square, we can say that the medium black square is indeed below a medium blue square (number two). However, we are asked to choose between options related to medium blue squares, not the medium black square.

Given the options provided:
- The medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B) is below the medium black square and medium blue square number two, making it below another medium blue square (number two).
- Medium blue square number two has the medium black square and then medium blue square number one below it.

So, both the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of a block and medium blue square number two have objects below them, but the question is asking which of these medium blue squares is below another medium blue square. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two, fitting the criteria directly.

However, upon reevaluation for clarity and precision in answering the exact question asked, the correct interpretation should focus on which of these options directly answers the question about being below a medium blue square without mixing the criteria. The question essentially seeks which medium blue square is positioned below another medium blue square, not which has something below it.

Given the direct question, medium blue square number one is indeed below medium blue square number two, making it the correct choice based on the question's specific wording.

Block C has two medium black squares and a medium blue square. Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two, and the medium blue square is below medium black square number one, touching the bottom edge of the block.

2. In block B, we have a medium blue square and a medium yellow square. The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.

3. Since block B is to the right of block A, we need to find out which medium blue squares in block A have the medium yellow square or the medium blue square from block B to their right.

4. Considering the vertical arrangement of the medium blue squares in block A, both medium blue square number two and medium blue square number three can have the medium yellow square (and the medium blue square below it) from block B to their right, as the problem statement does not specify any horizontal alignment within the blocks. However, it is guaranteed that at least one of them has a medium blue square to the right (the one in block B), given the vertical arrangement in block B.

Block B: 
- Three medium black squares
- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three
- Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three
- Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of the block and is below medium black square number two

Now, let's answer the question: Which object is below a medium black square? 

For Block A, the medium yellow square is below the medium black square.

For Block B, since medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and also below medium black square number three, it means medium black square number two must be below medium black square number three. Therefore, medium black square number one is below a medium black square (number two), and it is touching the bottom edge of the block.

- Medium yellow square number two in Block C has medium blue square number two below it.
- The medium yellow square in Block A has no objects below it within its block, but since Block A is below Block C, it is below the medium yellow squares in Block C.

However, the question is asking which object is below a medium yellow square. Since medium yellow square number two has medium blue square number two below it, and the medium yellow square in Block A is below the medium yellow squares in Block C but does not have an object directly below it within its block, we can conclude that:

- Medium yellow square number two has an object (medium blue square number two) below it.
- The medium yellow square in Block A does not have an object directly below it but is itself below the medium yellow squares in Block C.

Since Block A contains a medium black square, this means the medium black square in Block A is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B.

1. Blocks A and C are to the right of B.
2. Block A contains one medium black square.
3. Block B has one medium black square.
4. Block C has two medium black squares and one medium yellow square, with medium black square number one below the medium yellow square and medium black square number two.

Given the arrangement, the medium black square in block A is to the right of the medium black square in block B.

For block C, medium black square number two is below the medium yellow square, and since the yellow square is not mentioned as being to the left or right of any black square within block C, we can infer that medium black square number one and the yellow square are above medium black square number two. However, the question is about what is to the right of a medium black square, not what is above or below.

Considering the blocks' arrangement (A and C to the right of B), the medium black square in block A is to the right of the medium black square in block B.

For medium black square number two in block C, since it's part of block C and block C is to the right of block B (which contains a medium black square), medium black square number two is also to the right of a medium black square (the one in block B).

Therefore, both the medium black square in block A and medium black square number two are to the right of a medium black square.

1. The medium blue triangle is in block A.
2. Above the medium blue circle, which is to the right of and below the medium blue triangle, is the big blue triangle. This means the big blue triangle is above the medium blue circle and the medium blue triangle in block A.
3. Block B is above block A and contains a big black square and a medium yellow triangle.
4. Since block B is above block A, the big black square in block B is above the medium blue triangle in block A.

However, within block A itself, the big blue triangle is directly above the medium blue circle and triangle. Considering the question asks what is above the medium blue triangle, the answer should focus on the immediate vertical relationship within block A, rather than comparing across different blocks.

Therefore, the answer should be based on the information that the big blue triangle is above the medium blue circle and triangle within block A. However, the question provided does not directly match this analysis as it asks for a comparison involving a blue circle or a big black square, neither of which directly answers the spatial relationship described within block A itself based on the given details.

2. Block B is above block A and contains a medium black square above a medium yellow square.
3. Block C is above block B and contains a medium blue square above a medium yellow square that touches the bottom edge of block C.

Now, let's analyze the question: Which object is above a medium yellow square? The black object or the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block?

- The medium black square in block B is above a medium yellow square.
- The medium blue square in block C is above a medium yellow square that touches the bottom edge of block C. However, the question asks about the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block being above another medium yellow square, not the blue square. Since the medium yellow square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C and is below the blue square, it is not above another medium yellow square in its own block. However, considering the blocks are stacked (C above B above A), the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of block C is indeed above the medium yellow squares in blocks A and B.

Given the specific phrasing of the question, the correct interpretation focuses on the relative positions within each block and the overall stack. The black object is directly above a medium yellow square within its block. The medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of block C is not directly above another medium yellow square within its block but is above the ones in blocks A and B when considering the stack.

However, the question seems to be asking about direct relationships within blocks rather than the overall stack for the specific comparison it makes. Therefore, based on the direct relationship described:

2. Block A contains medium black squares and a medium blue square. The arrangement within Block A is such that medium black square number one is below the medium blue square and medium black square number three. Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three, which is below the medium blue square. However, the specific vertical arrangement within Block A does not affect the horizontal arrangement of the blocks.

3. Block B contains a medium yellow square, and Block C contains a medium black square.

Given the arrangement of the blocks from left to right (A, B, C), any object in Block B or Block C would be to the right of any object in Block A. Since medium black square number two is in Block A, it cannot be to the right of any medium square in Block B or C. However, it is to the right of medium black square number one within its own block.

The medium black square in Block C is to the right of the medium yellow square in Block B, which is a medium square. Therefore, the medium black square in Block C is indeed to the right of a medium square.

Considering the question's options:

- Medium black square number two is not to the right of any medium square outside its block.
- The medium black square in Block C is to the right of the medium yellow square in Block B.

Thus, the correct answer is the medium black square that is in Block C.

   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and the medium blue square.

3. Block B has two medium yellow squares, with one below the other.
4. Block C has a medium yellow square above a medium black square.

Given the arrangement, since Block C is to the left of both Block B and Block A, the medium black square in Block C will have both Block B and Block A to its right.

- To the right of the black object in Block C, in Block A, there is a medium blue square above a medium yellow square.
- In Block B, to the right of the black object, there are two medium yellow squares, one above the other, with the lower one touching the bottom edge of Block B.

2. Block B contains a medium blue square. There's no information about its position relative to other squares, so we can't determine if anything is below it based on the information given.

3. Block C contains a medium blue square and a medium yellow square. The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square. This directly tells us that the medium blue square in block C is below a medium yellow square.

Given the question, ""Which object is below a medium square?"" we can see that:

- The medium yellow square in block A is below a medium black square, and it is touching the bottom edge of block A.
- The medium blue square in block C is below a medium yellow square.

Therefore, both the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block (the medium yellow square in block A) and the medium blue square that is below the medium yellow square in block C are below a medium square. However, the question asks about the medium yellow square in block C, not the medium blue square. Since the medium yellow square in block C is above a medium blue square, not below, we should focus on the information given about block A for the ""thing touching the bottom edge"" and realize the actual comparison is with the medium yellow square in block C which does not meet the criteria as described for block C's arrangement.

However, re-evaluating for accuracy in interpretation of the question asked: The thing touching the bottom edge (medium yellow square in block A) is indeed below a medium square (medium black square), and the question mistakenly led to a comparison with the wrong aspect of block C's arrangement. The correct aspect to compare is that the medium yellow square in block C is not below but above a medium square. The correct comparison to make, based on the question's phrasing, involves recognizing that the medium yellow square in block A (touching the bottom edge) is indeed below a medium square, but the medium yellow square in block C is not; it's above a medium square.

Correcting for the logical flow and accurate comparison to the question asked, the answer should reflect that only one of these, as per the corrected understanding, meets the condition described in the question accurately.

In block B, there is a medium black circle. The big yellow square is above the medium black circle and is touching the right edge of block B. Since block B is to the left of block A, the big yellow square in block B is to the left of block A. 

Considering block A, the big blue square is touching the bottom edge of block A and is below and to the right of the medium blue triangle. The small yellow circle is below the medium blue triangle.

However, the question asks which object is to the right of a medium circle. The only medium circle mentioned is the medium black circle in block B.

1. Block A contains one medium blue square.
2. Block B is above block A and has three medium blue squares. The arrangement of these squares within block B is such that:
   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B.
   - Medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number three.
   - Medium blue square number one is below both medium blue square number three and medium blue square number two.
3. Block C is below block A and contains a medium blue square.

Given the arrangement in block B, it seems there might be a contradiction in the description, as it's described that square one is below both square three and square two, but also that square one is touching the bottom edge of block B. However, focusing on the question asked:

- The medium blue square in block A has block C below it, which contains a medium blue square. So, the medium blue square in block A is above another medium blue square.
- Medium blue square number three in block B is described as being above medium blue square number two. Thus, medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number three.

Given this, both the medium blue square in block A and medium blue square number three have a medium blue square below them.

Block A:
- Medium yellow square 1 is touching the bottom edge of the block.
- Medium yellow square 2 is below medium yellow square 3.
- The medium blue square is below medium yellow square 3 and medium yellow square 2.
- Medium yellow square 1 is below the medium blue square and medium yellow square 2.

From this, we can deduce the order in Block A from top to bottom:
1. Medium yellow square 3
2. Medium yellow square 2
3. Medium blue square
4. Medium yellow square 1

Block B:
- The medium blue square is below the medium black square.

Now, let's analyze the question: ""Which object is below a medium yellow square? the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block or the black shape?""

- The medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of a block (Block A) has the medium blue square above it, but it itself is not below another medium yellow square in the context of being directly under one within its block. However, given its position, it's below the other yellow squares in its block but not directly under them in a way that would fulfill the usual interpretation of ""below"" in a direct stacking sense within its block context. It's more about the overall block arrangement.
- The black shape in Block B is above a medium blue square, and Block B is below Block A, which contains medium yellow squares. Thus, the black shape is indeed below the medium yellow squares if we consider the arrangement of blocks.

Given the arrangement of blocks and focusing strictly on the question, the black shape is indeed below the medium yellow squares when considering the overall stacking of blocks A and B.

In block B, the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

1. In block A, there is a small blue circle, a big black triangle, and a big black square. The big black square is above and to the left of a small black circle. However, the position of the square is not directly relevant to the question.

2. The small blue circle is to the left of the big black triangle and the small black circle. This directly answers the question regarding the blue circle's position relative to the small black circle.

3. The question asks which object is to the left of a small black circle: the triangle or the blue thing. Based on the information provided, the small blue circle is to the left of both the big black triangle and the small black circle.

4. Since the big black triangle is not to the left of the small black circle (but rather the blue circle is to the left of both), the correct answer regarding the options provided is the blue thing.

However, considering the arrangement and the presence of a small black circle in block B as well, which does not have a specified left object within its own block, but looking at the overall arrangement, the big black triangle in block A is indeed to the left of the small black circle in block B. 

Given the information and focusing on the specific small black circle mentioned in block A, the most accurate answer based on the options provided would be:

Block A has a medium yellow square and a medium blue square, with the yellow square below the blue square. Block B is to the right of Block A and has one medium blue square. Block C is below Block B and has a medium black square and a medium blue square, with the black square below the blue square.

Given the arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the left of the medium blue square in Block A (since it's below, but we can infer they are centered and thus the yellow square is both below and to the left and right of the blue square's edges but generally below) and more directly, to the left of the medium blue square in Block B (since Block A is to the left of Block B). However, the question specifically asks about the medium blue squares in Block A and Block C.

Since Block B is above Block C and Block A is to the left of Block B, it means Block A is also to the left of Block C. Therefore, Block A's medium blue square is to the left of Block C's medium blue square.

Considering the medium blue square in Block A, there isn't another blue square to its right within the same block to be directly to the left of. However, considering the blocks' arrangement, the medium blue square in Block A is to the left of the medium blue square in Block B (not in question) and by the positioning of the blocks, Block A (and thus its blue square) is to the left of Block C (and thus its blue square).

Therefore, the medium blue square in Block A is indeed to the left of another medium blue square (the one in Block C), making option 1 correct in the context of the question asked.

Given the arrangement within Block A, the question asks which of the medium black squares (number four or number three) is to the right of a medium square. Since both are part of Block A and are therefore to the right of the medium yellow square in Block B, and considering the internal arrangement of Block A doesn't change their position relative to Block B, the answer is that both medium black square number four and medium black square number three are to the right of a medium square (the medium yellow square in Block B).

5. Block C contains a medium black square and a medium blue square, with the medium blue square below the medium black square and also touching the bottom edge of block C.

Given this information, we can determine the positions of the medium black squares relative to the medium blue squares:

- In block C, the medium black square is directly above the medium blue square.
- Block B is above block C, but the medium blue square it is being compared to is in block C (since the question specifies ""a medium blue square"" without indicating which block, but the description best fits block C's configuration). The medium black square in block B is not directly above the medium blue square in block C; it is above the medium black square in block C, which in turn is above the medium blue square.

However, considering the question's phrasing, it asks which object is above a medium blue square, without specifying the block of the medium blue square explicitly for the comparison. This means we should consider if any medium black square is above any medium blue square based on the given configurations.

- The medium black square in block C is directly above a medium blue square within the same block.
- The medium black square in block B, while above block C, does not directly overlay a medium blue square in its own block (since its block contains a yellow and a black square), but its block (B) is positioned above block C, which contains a medium blue square. However, the direct vertical stacking described does not place the medium black square in block B immediately above a medium blue square; it's above a medium black square that is itself above a medium blue square.

Given the direct interpretation of the question, the correct answer focuses on which medium black square is immediately above a medium blue square. Therefore, the medium black square in block C is the one that meets this criterion directly based on the given descriptions.

The medium yellow square is at the bottom of Block C, with the medium black square above it, and the medium blue square above the medium black square.

Since Block B is to the left of Block C and contains a medium blue square, Block C's contents (including its medium blue square) are to the right of Block B's medium blue square.

2. Block B contains a medium blue square and a medium yellow square, with the medium blue square below the medium yellow square.

3. Block C is to the right of Block A and to the left of Block B, and it contains one medium yellow square.

Given this arrangement, we can conclude the following:

- The medium yellow square in Block C is to the right of the medium blue squares in Block A.
- The medium yellow square in Block B is above the medium blue square in Block B, which means the medium blue square in Block B is to the right of no medium blue square within its own block.

2. Block B has one medium yellow triangle and a medium yellow circle in it, with the triangle near the circle.
3. Block C is to the right of block B and to the left of block A, and it also has a medium yellow square, along with a small blue triangle and a big blue square.
4. The arrangement in block C is such that the small blue triangle is above and to the left of the big blue square, and the medium yellow square is below and to the right of the small blue triangle.

Given the arrangement of the blocks (C to the right of B and to the left of A), we can deduce that block B is to the left of block C. Since block C contains a medium yellow square, anything in block B can be considered to the left of a medium yellow square in a broader spatial context.

Considering the specific question about the medium yellow triangle and the medium yellow circle in block B, both of these objects are in block B, which is to the left of block C, and by extension, to the left of a medium yellow square in block C.

1. We are asked to find what is to the left of the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

2. From the description, we know that Block C has a medium black square touching its bottom edge, and this square is below a medium blue square.

3. Since Block C is to the right of Block B, the thing to the left of the medium black square (which is touching the bottom edge of Block C) would be Block B.

4. At the bottom of Block B is medium black square number one.

5. Block B is above Block A, which has a medium yellow square.

6. Therefore, to the left of the thing that is touching the bottom edge of Block C (a medium black square) is another medium black square (medium black square number one in Block B), not the medium yellow square in Block A.

7. However, considering the blocks' arrangement, the medium yellow square in Block A is also to the left of the medium black square in Block C but on a different level.

2. Block C is above Block A.
3. Block A has one medium blue square.
4. Block B contains two medium blue squares and a medium black square.
5. Block C contains one medium black square and one medium blue square.

Given the arrangement, we can deduce the following:

- Since Block C is above Block A and Block B is to the right of Block C, Block B is also above Block A (considering the positions relative to each other).
- In Block B, the medium black square is above the medium blue squares.
- In Block C, the medium black square is above the medium blue square.

Considering the question, ""Which object is to the left of a medium blue square? the medium black square which is in block C or the medium black square that is in block B?""

- The medium black square in Block C is above (and therefore to the left in a 2D sense, considering ""left"" as a position that can also imply ""above"" in this spatial arrangement) the medium blue square in Block C.
- The medium black square in Block B is above (and in a similar 2D spatial context, to the left of, if considering the vertical arrangement) the medium blue squares in Block B.

However, the question seems to be asking about a direct left-right relationship rather than an above-below relationship. Given the blocks' arrangement and focusing strictly on left-right positioning:

- The medium black square in Block C is directly above a medium blue square but is not to the left of any medium blue square in a strict horizontal sense within its block. However, considering the overall arrangement, Block C (and thus its medium black square) is to the left of Block B (which contains medium blue squares).
- The medium black square in Block B is above the medium blue squares but not to the left of them in a strict horizontal sense within its block.

Given the ambiguity in interpreting ""to the left"" in a 3D or 2D context without clear horizontal and vertical distinctions, the most accurate interpretation based on the given arrangement would consider the overall positioning of blocks and squares. Thus, the medium black square in Block C is indeed to the left of the medium blue squares in Block B when considering the arrangement of blocks, but neither is directly to the left of a medium blue square within their respective blocks in a strict horizontal sense.

However, focusing strictly on the question's wording and the most direct interpretation regarding block positioning:

Since ""the blue thing"" is clearly not below a black square, and ""the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" is a black square not below another black square but implies its block has layers, the question's framing seems flawed in directly answering based on provided options.

However, to follow the instruction for a concise answer and given the details do not perfectly match any option but knowing the yellow square (not listed) is indeed below a black square, and the options do not include ""a yellow square,"" the closest adherence to instruction, despite the confusion, is to select that none of the provided choices accurately represent the object below a medium black square based on the details given:

471,"We have two blocks, A and B. Two medium blue squares are in block A. This block also contains one medium black square. Below medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two there is the medium black square. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two. To the right of block A there is block B which has two medium black squares. Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two. Which object is below a medium blue square? medium black square number two or the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block??
0) medium black square  number two
1) the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Block A contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square.
2. The medium black square is below both medium blue squares.
3. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.
4. Block B contains two medium black squares, with medium black square number one below medium black square number two.

Given the arrangement in Block A, the medium black square is below both medium blue squares. Therefore, it is the object that is below a medium blue square. Additionally, since it's the last element in the vertical arrangement of Block A, it is also touching the bottom edge of Block A.

In Block B, medium black square number one is below medium black square number two, but there is no mention of a medium blue square in Block B. Therefore, medium black square number two in Block B does not meet the criteria of being below a medium blue square.

Considering the options:

0) medium black square number two - This is incorrect because medium black square number two in Block B is not below a medium blue square.

1) the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block - This is correct because the medium black square in Block A is both below the medium blue squares and touching the bottom edge of Block A.

2) both of them - This is incorrect because medium black square number two does not meet the criteria.

3) none of them - This is incorrect because there is indeed an object (the medium black square in Block A) that meets the criteria.

632,"We have three blocks. We call them A, B and C. Block C is below blocks B and A. Block A has two medium blue squares. A medium yellow square is also in this block. Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block. Below the medium yellow square there is medium blue square number two. Below the medium yellow square and medium blue square number two there is medium blue square number one. Block B contains two medium blue squares. It also has a medium black square. This object is below medium blue square number two. Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block. This shape is below the square which is below medium blue square number two. This shape is below medium blue square number two. Block C has one medium black square. Which object is below a medium blue square? the medium black square that is in block B or the medium black square that is in block C??
0) the medium black square  that is in block B
1) the medium black square  that is in block C
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is below a medium blue square, let's analyze the information provided for each block:

Block A: This block contains two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square. The arrangement within this block does not directly impact the question since the question focuses on the medium black squares in relation to medium blue squares in blocks B and C.

Block B: It contains two medium blue squares and a medium black square. The medium black square is specifically mentioned to be below medium blue square number two. This directly answers the question for Block B: the medium black square in block B is indeed below a medium blue square.

Block C: This block has one medium black square. The description does not specify any medium blue squares within this block; it only mentions that block C is below blocks B and A. Since there are no medium blue squares mentioned in block C, the medium black square in block C cannot be below a medium blue square within its own block.

However, considering the overall arrangement where block C is below blocks B and A, and knowing that both blocks B and A have medium blue squares, it means block C (and thus its medium black square) is indeed below the medium blue squares of blocks A and B, when considering the entire structure.

Therefore, both medium black squares, one in block B and one in block C, are below medium blue squares when considering the entire arrangement.
