2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. Block C has two medium yellow squares, with medium yellow square number two above medium yellow square number one. This means that medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.

2. Block B is above Block A. 

3. Block C is above Block B. This means that Block C is above Block A, because Block B is above Block A.

4. Since Block C is above Block A, and medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two in Block C, any object below a medium yellow square in Block C will be above Block A.

5. Now, we need to determine which of the two medium blue squares is below a medium yellow square. 

   a. The medium blue square in Block A is below the medium black square, and the medium black square is in Block A, which is below Block B. So, the medium blue square in Block A is not below a medium yellow square.

   b. The medium blue square in Block B is below the medium yellow square number two, because Block B is above Block A, and Block C is above Block B. Therefore, the medium blue square in Block B is below a medium yellow square.

Based on the analysis, the medium blue square which is in block B is below a medium yellow square.

3) none of them","To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Block A has one medium yellow square.
2. Block B contains two medium yellow squares. Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.
3. Block C contains one medium yellow square.

Now, let's consider the relationship between the blocks:

- Block C is to the left of A.
- Block A is below B.

Given that block A is below block B, we can infer that the blocks are stacked vertically. 

In block B, medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of the block. This means it is at the bottom of block B.

Since block A is below block B, the bottom of block B (where medium yellow square number one is located) is above the top of block A.

Considering the relative positions of the blocks, the black object in block B is below the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of block B (medium yellow square number one).

Therefore, the black object is below a medium yellow square.

Block A has a medium yellow square. 
Block B has one medium black square and one medium blue square. Below the medium blue square is the medium black square. 
Block C has three medium blue squares. Below medium blue square number three is medium blue square number one. Below medium blue square number three is medium blue square number two. A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of this block.

From the description of Block C, we can see that the medium blue squares are arranged in a specific order: 3, 2, 1, and then the medium yellow square at the bottom.

Now, looking at Block B, we have the medium black square below the medium blue square. Since the medium blue squares in Block C are arranged as 3, 2, 1, and then the yellow square, the medium blue square below the black shape in Block B would be the one that is directly above the black shape in Block B. 

The medium blue square directly above the black shape in Block B would be the medium blue square number 2, because the medium blue square number 1 is below the medium blue square number 2 in Block C.

Since block A is above block B, the yellow square in block A is above the black square in block B. The question asks what is below the yellow shape, not what is above it. Therefore, the correct answer is not related to what is above the yellow shape, but rather what is below it.

Considering the blocks' layout:

- Block A is above block B and block C.
- The black square in block B is not below the yellow square in block A.
- The black squares in block C are below block A, but the question asks what is below the yellow shape specifically.

Block A has three medium black squares. Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block, medium black square number two is below medium black square number three, and medium black square number one is below medium black square number three and medium black square number two. This implies that the order of the black squares from top to bottom is: number three, number two, number one.

Block B has one medium yellow square. Since block B is above block A, the yellow square is above the black squares.

Block C has one medium blue square and a medium black square. The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block, and the black square is below the blue square.

Now, let's consider the possibilities:

- A medium black square number three is below the yellow square if it is the top black square in block A, but we don't know if the yellow square is above the top black square.
- A medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block is below the yellow square if it is the bottom black square in block A or block C, but we don't know if the yellow square is above the bottom black square in block A or block C.

However, we do know that the yellow square is above the top black square in block A (medium black square number three) and that the blue square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C, which means the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C.

Therefore, the yellow square is above the top black square in block A and the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C.

Considering this information, we can conclude that the yellow square is above both the top black square in block A (medium black square number three) and the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C.

Since the yellow square is above the top black square in block A (medium black square number three) and the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C, the yellow square is above both of these black squares.

The question asks what is below the yellow shape, not what is above the yellow shape. 

However, the question does not ask what is below the yellow shape in block B, it asks what is below the yellow shape in general.

In general, the yellow shape is above the bottom black square in block A (medium black square number one) and the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C.

Considering this information, we can conclude that the yellow shape is above both the bottom black square in block A (medium black square number one) and the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C.

The bottom black square in block A (medium black square number one) is below the yellow shape, and the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C, which means the bottom black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C.

Since block B contains one medium yellow square, and this square is below medium black square number two, it means that the medium yellow square is below medium black square number three as well. This is because medium black square number three is above medium black square number two.

Now, the question states that the medium yellow square is below medium black square number three and medium black square number one. This implies that the medium yellow square is below medium black square number two as well, since medium black square number two is between medium black square number three and medium black square number one.

However, the description also states that below medium black square number two, which is below medium black square number three, is medium black square number one. This indicates that the medium yellow square cannot be below medium black square number one, as it would contradict the given order of the black squares.

Therefore, the description of the medium yellow square being below medium black square number three and medium black square number one is an error, and we should consider the correct order of the black squares: medium black square number three, medium black square number two, and medium black square number one.

1. We have block A with a medium black square on top, and a medium yellow square below it, touching the bottom edge of the block.
2. We have block B with a medium yellow square in it.
3. We have block C with three medium blue squares. The arrangement of the blue squares is as follows: 
   - Medium blue square number 1 is at the bottom of block C.
   - Medium blue square number 2 is below medium blue square number 3.
   - The medium shape (which is the medium black square in block A) is below medium blue square number 3.

Now, let's analyze the options:

- Option 0: The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block is in block A. 
- Option 1: The medium black square is in block A.

We need to determine which object is above the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (Option 0). This medium yellow square is in block A, and above it is the medium black square (Option 1).

1. Block A contains two medium yellow squares, with a big yellow circle to the left of each square.
2. Block B contains a big black square and a big black circle, with the black square to the right of the black circle.
3. Block C contains a big blue triangle, and it is to the right of block B.

Now, let's consider the relative positions of the blocks:

- Block A is to the left of block B.
- Block B is to the left of block C.

Given that block C contains the big blue triangle, we need to find what is to the left of the blue triangle. Since block B is to the left of block C, we should look at block B to determine what is to the left of the blue triangle.

Block B contains a big black square and a big black circle, with the black square to the right of the black circle. The big black circle is touching the bottom edge of block B, which means it is not at the left edge. Therefore, the big black circle is not to the left of the blue triangle.

However, the description of block A does not explicitly state that it is at the left edge of the entire arrangement. Since block B is to the right of block A, the big yellow circle is to the left of the big black square in block B, and thus to the left of the big blue triangle in block C.

4. Block B is to the right of block A and contains two medium black squares.
5. The two medium black squares in block B are stacked on top of each other, with the first medium black square above the second medium black square.

Now, let's consider the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of block A. Since the two medium blue squares are stacked on top of each other, and the medium black square is below them, it must be touching the bottom edge of block A.

Next, let's consider medium black square number two. Since it is in block B, which is to the right of block A, it is not in block A. Therefore, it cannot be touching the bottom edge of block A.

Based on this analysis, the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of block A is the correct answer.

3) none of them","To determine which object is to the right of a small black circle, let's analyze the information provided.

Block B contains two small black circles. Since there are two small black circles, we need to identify which one is being referred to. However, the question doesn't specify which small black circle it's referring to. We'll assume it's referring to the first small black circle mentioned.

In Block B, the first small black circle is above the small yellow square. To the left of and below the small yellow square, there is the small black triangle. Below the small yellow square, there is the big yellow triangle. This means the small black circle is above the small yellow square and the big yellow triangle is below it.

Now, let's analyze Block A. It has a small black square, a big blue circle, and a medium black square. The small black square is above and near to the medium black square.

Since the small black circle in Block B is above the small yellow square, and Block A has a small black square above the medium black square, we can we determine the position of the small black square in Block A relative to the small black circle in Block B? We can't, because the position of the small black square in Block A is relative to the medium black square, but we don't know the position of the small black circle in Block B relative to the medium black square.

However, we can determine the position of the big blue circle in Block A relative to the small black circle in Block B. The big blue circle is to the left of the medium yellow square. Since the big yellow triangle is touching the bottom edge of Block B, it's to the right of the small yellow square. This means the medium yellow square is above the small yellow square and to its right. Since the big blue circle is to the left of the medium yellow square, it's above the small yellow square and to its left.

Since the small black circle in Block B is above the small yellow square, the big blue circle in Block A is to the left of the small black circle in Block B.

Therefore, the big blue circle is to the left of the small black circle."

3. Block C contains one medium black square, but we don't have any information about the objects to the right of this medium black square in block C.

Now, let's compare the positions of the medium black squares in blocks A, B, and C. We know that block A is to the right of block B. Therefore, the medium black square in block A is to the right of the medium black square in block B.

However, we don't have any information about the position of block C relative to block B or block A. We only know that block B is above block C, but we don't know if block A is above or below block C.

Since we don't have enough information to compare the positions of the medium black squares in blocks A and C, we can't determine which one is to the right of the other.

2. Block B is below block A.
3. In block A, the small blue square is to the left of the medium yellow circle and the big blue circle.
4. The small blue triangle in block B is below block A, which means it is below the small blue square in block A.
5. Since the small blue triangle is below the small blue square, it is to the right of the small blue square.
6. The small blue square is to the left of the medium yellow circle and the big blue circle in block A.
7. Therefore, the small blue triangle in block B is to the left of the medium yellow circle and the big blue circle in block A.

Now, let's analyze the objects in block C:
- The small yellow circle is above the small black triangle.
- The small black triangle is touching the bottom edge of block C.
- The big black square is to the right of the small black triangle.

Since the small blue triangle in block B is to the left of the medium yellow circle and the big blue circle in block A, and the small yellow circle in block C is above the small black triangle, the small yellow circle in block C is not to the right of the small blue triangle.

Therefore, the object to the right of the small blue triangle is the medium object, which is the big blue circle in block A.

0) small yellow square 
1) big yellow square  which is touching the right edge of  a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them","Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Block A contains a medium black square.
2. Block B is to the right of block A and contains a small yellow circle and a big blue square.
3. Below and to the right of the big blue square, there is another small yellow circle.
4. Block C is to the right of block B and contains a small yellow square.
5. Below and to the left of a big yellow square, there is a small yellow square.
6. The big yellow square is touching the right edge of block C.

From point 5, we know that the small yellow square is below and to the left of the big yellow square, which is in block C. 
From point 6, we know that the big yellow square is touching the right edge of block C.

Now, let's look at the position of the small yellow circle in block B. It's not relevant to the question of what's to the right of the circle in block C.

The big yellow square in block C is touching the right edge of block C, so there is nothing to its right within block C.

However, the question is asking about what's to the right of the circle in block B. Since the big yellow square in block C is touching the right edge of block C, and block C is to the right of block B, it means that the big yellow square is also to the right of the circle in block B.

So, the answer is {1}."

3) none of them","To determine which object is to the right of a medium black square, we need to analyze the information given about the blocks.

Block A contains a medium yellow square, a medium black square, and a medium blue square. The medium yellow square is at the top, followed by the medium black square, and then the medium blue square at the bottom. 

Block B contains two medium black squares, with the second one at the bottom and the first one above it.

Block C contains one medium yellow square.

Since we are looking for the object to the right of a medium black square, we need to consider the position of the medium black square in each block.

In Block A, the medium black square is followed by the medium blue square, and then the medium yellow square is at the top. So, the medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of the medium black square.

In Block B, the medium black square is at the bottom, and there is no other square to its right.

In Block C, there is no medium black square.

Therefore, the object to the right of a medium black square is the medium yellow square in Block A.

From point 2, we can conclude that the medium blue square is below both medium black squares. 

Now, let's analyze the position of the medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of block A. Since it's touching the bottom edge, it must be below both medium black squares.

Considering the positions of medium blue square number two and the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block A, we can see that both are below the medium black squares. However, the question asks which object is to the left of a medium black square. 

Since the medium blue squares are below the medium black squares, we need to consider the horizontal position. The medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block A is to the left of the medium black squares, but medium blue square number two is not mentioned to be to the left of the medium black squares.

1. Block A has two medium yellow squares. 
   - The second yellow square is below the first yellow square.

2. Below the second yellow square is the first yellow square. 
   - This implies that the first yellow square is below the second yellow square, but since there are only two yellow squares, this means the first yellow square is below the second yellow square in a vertical arrangement.

3. Below the first yellow square is the medium blue square.

Since the yellow squares are arranged vertically with the second yellow square above the first yellow square, and the first yellow square is above the blue square, the medium blue square is below the first yellow square.

Now, let's look at Block B:

1. Block B contains two medium black squares. 
   - The first black square is below the second black square.

This means the second black square is above the first black square.

Now, considering the question: Which object is to the left of a medium yellow square? 

Since the second yellow square is above the first yellow square, and the blue square is below the first yellow square, we can conclude that the second yellow square is to the right of the first yellow square, and the blue square is to the right of the first yellow square.

Given that the first black square is below the second black square, the second black square is to the left of the first black square.

However, the question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, and since there are two yellow squares, we need to determine which one is being referred to. But the question doesn't specify which yellow square. 

However, since the second yellow square is above the first yellow square, we can conclude that the first yellow square is to the left of the second yellow square.

So, if we are considering the first yellow square, then the object to its left would be the blue square or the second yellow square if we were considering the second yellow square. 

But, if we are considering the second yellow square, then the object to its left would be the first yellow square. 

However, since the question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, and given the information that the first black square is below the second black square, we can conclude that the second black square is to the left of the first black square.

However, we have no information that would indicate that the second black square is to the left of a medium yellow square, or that the first black square is to the left of a medium yellow square.

Therefore, we can conclude that the second black square is to the left of the first black square, but we have no information that would indicate that the second black square is to the left of a medium yellow square.

So, the answer to the question is that there is no information that would indicate that either the first black square or the second black square is to the left of a medium yellow square.

- Block B has a medium black square above a medium blue square.
- Block C has a medium blue square below a medium black square and a medium yellow square.

3. In block A, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square. This means that the medium blue square is on the top of block A.

Now, let's consider the question: which object is to the left of the medium blue square?

- The medium blue square in block B is on the top left of block B, so any object to its left would be outside block B.
- The medium blue square in block A is on the top of block A, so any object to its left would be outside block A.

However, we are only considering objects within the blocks. Since the medium blue square in block B is on the top left of block B, the object to its left within block B is the medium black square, but we are looking for the medium yellow square that is in block B. The medium yellow square in block B is below the medium blue square and to the medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

1. Block A contains one medium black square.
2. Block A is to the right of Block B.
3. Block B has three medium blue squares, with the first one touching the bottom edge of the block.
4. The arrangement of the blue squares is: 1 (bottom), 2 (middle), 3 (top).
5. Since Block A is to the right of Block B, the medium black square in Block A is to the right of the blue squares in Block B.
6. Block C is above Block A and contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square, with the yellow square above the black square.
7. Since Block C is above Block A, the yellow square in Block C is above the medium black square in Block A.

Considering the positions of the yellow square and the medium blue square that touches the bottom edge of Block B, we can conclude that the yellow square is to the left of the medium black square.

   - The small blue triangle is above and to the left of the medium black triangle.

2. Block B is below block A and has a big yellow square.

From the information given, there is no direct indication of what is above the big yellow square in block B. However, we can infer that block B is below block A, and block A has a small blue triangle above a medium black triangle. This does not directly tell us what is above the big yellow square in block B.

2. Block A has two medium yellow squares: number one and number two. Medium yellow square number one is below a medium black square and medium yellow square number two. This means the order from bottom to top is: medium yellow square number two, medium black square, medium yellow square number one.

3. Block B contains a medium blue square. Since block B is to the right of block C, and block C contains a medium blue square, the medium blue square in block B is above the medium black square in block C.

4. The medium black square in block C is touching the bottom edge of this block, and it is below the medium blue square. This means the order from top to bottom is: medium blue square, medium black square.

Now, let's compare the positions of the objects to the left of a medium blue square.

- Medium yellow square number two is in block A, which is to the left of block C (and block B). Since the medium blue square in block B is above the medium black square in block C, and the medium black square is below medium yellow square number two, medium yellow square number two is to the left of a medium blue square.

- The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of block A is medium yellow square number one, which is below medium yellow square number two. Since medium yellow square number two is to the left of a medium blue square, and medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of block A is also to the left of a medium blue square.
