Block B has one medium black square and one medium blue square. The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block. It is below the medium blue square. Block C has two medium yellow squares. Below medium yellow square number two there is medium yellow square number one. Which object is below a medium yellow square? the medium blue square that is in block A or the medium blue square which is in block B??
0) the medium blue square  that is in block A
1) the medium blue square  which is in block B
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's analyze the information given:

- Block C has two medium yellow squares, with medium yellow square number one below medium yellow square number two.
- Block C is above Block B.
- Block B has one medium black square and one medium blue square, with the medium black square below the medium blue square.
- Block B is above Block A.
- Block A contains a medium black square below a medium blue square.

Given that Block C is above Block B and Block B is above Block A, the medium yellow squares in Block C are above the contents of both Block B and Block A.

Since the medium blue squares in both Block A and Block B are below the medium yellow squares in Block C (because Block C is above both Block A and Block B), both of the medium blue squares are below a medium yellow square.

0) the medium black square 
1) the small yellow square 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is to the right of the big black triangle, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. The big black triangle is in Block B, and it is above and to the right of the small yellow square. This means the small yellow square is to the left of the big black triangle, not to the right.

2. The medium black square is in Block A, which is to the right of Block B. Since Block A is to the right of Block B, and the big black triangle is in Block B, the medium black square is to the right of the big black triangle.

Considering the given information, the correct answer is the medium black square.

Below the medium black square and medium yellow square number two is medium yellow square number one. And block C contains one medium yellow square. Which object is below a medium yellow square? the black object or the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block??
0) the black object
1) the medium yellow square  that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. Block A has one medium yellow square.
2. Block B has two medium yellow squares and one medium black square. 
   - Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - Medium yellow square number two is above the medium black square.
   - The medium black square is below medium yellow square number two and above medium yellow square number one.
3. Block C contains one medium yellow square.

The question is which object is below a medium yellow square: the black object or the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block?

From the information given, the medium black square in Block B is below medium yellow square number two. 

The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium yellow square number one in Block B) is not below any other medium yellow square; it is touching the bottom edge.

Therefore, the black object is below a medium yellow square.

0) medium blue square  number one
1) medium blue square  number two
2) both of them
3) none of them","To find the answer, let's break down the information given about block B and block C.

Block B has one medium black square and one medium blue square. Below the medium blue square is the medium black square.

Block C has three medium blue squares. Below medium blue square number three is medium blue square number one. Below medium blue square number three is medium blue square number two. Medium blue square number one is below the medium blue square number two.

Since the medium black square is below the medium blue square in block B, we need to find which medium blue square in block C is directly above the medium black square. However, the description of block C doesn't directly relate to block B. 

But we can infer that since block A is to the left of block C, and block C is below block B, the medium blue squares in block C are below the squares in block B. Given that the medium black square is below the medium blue square in block B, and considering the arrangement of block C's squares, both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two are below the medium blue square in block B.

Therefore, since the medium black square is below the medium blue square in block B, both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two in block C are below the medium blue square in block B, which in turn is above the medium black square.

So, both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two are below the black shape in block B, but in the context of the question, the answer would be that both are below the medium blue square that is above the black shape.

1. Block A contains a medium black square.
2. Block B is to the right of block A and contains three medium yellow squares.
3. Block C is above block A and contains one medium blue square.

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, and Block A contains the black square, the medium yellow squares in Block B are to the right of the black square.

There is no indication that the blue square in Block C is to the right of the black square, as Block C is above Block A.

Therefore, to the right of the black thing is a medium yellow square.

2. Medium yellow square number one is below the medium blue square and medium yellow square number two. Since medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of block A and it's below a medium blue square, it's also above a medium blue square (in block B).

Considering both points, we can conclude that both medium yellow squares are above a medium blue square.

3. The medium yellow square is to the left of the small yellow square.

There is no information that directly links block C to blocks A and B. However, we can infer that the medium yellow triangle mentioned in the question is actually referring to the one in block A, which is not related to block C.

Given the information about block C, we can conclude that there is no medium yellow triangle below the medium blue circle in block C. The small blue triangle is above the medium blue circle, not below it.

- Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block A.
- Below the medium yellow square, there is medium black square number two.
- Below medium black square number two, there is medium black square number one.

From this, we can infer the order in block A (from top to bottom): medium yellow square, medium black square number two, medium black square number one.

- Block B contains two medium yellow squares, with medium yellow square number one below medium yellow square number two.

The question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square. Since block A is to the left of block B, and both blocks contain medium yellow squares, the object to the left of a medium yellow square would be the medium yellow square in block A for the medium yellow squares in block B, and the medium yellow square in block A is to the left of itself (in a sense, it is the leftmost yellow square, but the question likely intends to ask which block's yellow square is to the left of another yellow square).

However, the question seems to be asking which of the yellow squares is to the left of another yellow square (not which block is to the left of another block). In that case, the medium yellow square in block A is to the left of the medium yellow squares in block B, and medium yellow square number one is not to the left of another yellow square since it is above medium yellow square number two.

Therefore, the medium yellow square which is in block A is to the left of the medium yellow squares in block B.

- There is no blue shape mentioned in Block A.

Block B: 
- The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of the block.
- The medium yellow square is below the medium black square and the medium blue square.

Since the medium yellow square in Block B is below the medium blue square, this square is below a blue shape.

3. Block C, to the left of Block A, has one medium black square and one medium yellow square, with the medium black square at the bottom.

Now, let's analyze the question: Which object is to the right of a medium square?

- Medium blue square number two in Block B is below the medium yellow square, so it is to the right of the medium yellow square in Block C.
- The medium blue square in Block A is to the right of the medium black square and the medium yellow square in Block C.

Considering the question, both medium blue square number two and the medium blue square in Block A are to the right of a medium square (medium yellow square in Block B for the first one and medium black and yellow squares in Block C for the second one).

1. Block A contains a big blue circle and a small yellow square. They are near and touching each other.
2. Block B contains a big black square.
3. Block C is below Block A and contains two medium blue squares and a small blue square. The small blue square is to the left of both medium squares, and the medium squares are next to each other with the second one touching the right edge of Block C.

Since Block B is described as being below Block A in the initial description but later Block C is described as below Block A, it seems there's a bit of confusion in the arrangement. However, based on the description of Block C being below Block A, it seems the intended order from top to bottom is Block A, Block B, and then Block C. But to answer the question, we need to focus on what's below the big square, which is presumably the big black square in Block B.

Given that Block A is above Block B and contains both the big blue circle and the small yellow square, and considering the question asks what is below the big square (which is in Block B), the answer would involve both elements from Block A because they are both above Block B.

- medium black square number two (below the medium yellow square and above medium black square number one)
- medium black square number one (below medium black square number two)

Below Block B, there's Block C with a medium blue square. However, this medium blue square is not directly below any of the medium black squares in Block B.

   - Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.
   - The medium yellow square is below the medium black square.

Given these positions, the medium yellow square is below the medium black square. Then, medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square. Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two, but it is also directly below the medium black square.

So, both medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two are below the medium black square, but the medium blue square in Block A is not directly related to the medium black square in Block B.

4. Block B is to the right of Block A and contains a medium blue square.

Given the layout of Block A and the position of Block B relative to Block A, we can infer that the medium blue square in Block B is to the right of all objects in Block A.

Since the question asks which object is to the left of the medium blue square, and given that Block B (with the medium blue square) is to the right of Block A (which contains both the small black circle and the medium yellow circle), both the small black circle and the medium yellow circle are to the left of the medium blue square.

3. Medium blue square
4. Medium black square number one (touching the bottom edge)

Since the medium yellow square in Block B is above the medium blue square, which is above the medium black square number one (the one touching the bottom edge), the medium yellow square in Block B is indeed above an object that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

Now, let's consider Block A. The information given about Block A is that it has a medium yellow square and is to the left of Block B. There is no information given about any object in Block A touching the bottom edge of the block or any object being above such an object.

3. Block B contains a medium blue triangle, a small black square, and a big yellow triangle.
4. The medium blue triangle is to the left of the big black square, the big yellow triangle, and the small black square.

Since Block B is above Block A, any object in Block B is above the circle in Block A. The question asks about the small black square and the big yellow shape (triangle) that is touching the bottom edge of a block. 

Given that both the small black square and the big yellow triangle are in Block B and Block B is above Block A, both objects are above the circle.

Block A: 
- Medium black square 1 is below the medium yellow square and medium black square 2.
- Medium yellow square is below medium black square 2.

- Medium yellow square is below both the medium black square and the medium blue square.
- This implies that the order from top to bottom is: medium blue square, medium black square, medium yellow square.

Given the question, ""Which object is below a medium blue square? medium black square number one or the medium black square that is in block C?"" 

- Medium black square number one is in block A and is below the medium yellow square and another black square, not a blue square.

We need to find which medium black square is above a medium yellow square. 

- In Block B, the medium black square is below the medium yellow square, so it's not above a medium yellow square.
- In Block C, the medium black square is below the medium yellow square, so it's also not above a medium yellow square.

However, in Block C, the medium black square is above the medium blue square, and the medium yellow square is also above the medium blue square. This means the medium black square in Block C is at the same level as the medium yellow square, but not above it in the sense that it's directly on top of it.

1. In Block A, the small yellow triangle is to the left of the medium black triangle.
2. In Block A, the big blue circle is below the medium black triangle.
3. In Block B, there is a medium blue triangle.

Since the question asks which object is to the left of a medium blue triangle, we need to note that the medium blue triangle is in Block B, and the description of Block A doesn't mention a medium blue triangle but rather a medium black triangle.

However, the question seems to be asking based on the description of Block A, as Block B only contains a medium blue triangle without any objects to its left described within Block B itself. Considering the description of Block A and applying it to the question, we might interpret the question as asking about the arrangement in relation to a medium triangle (even though it's a black triangle in Block A, not blue).

Given this interpretation challenge, if we strictly follow the information provided and consider the arrangement in Block A (since Block B doesn't provide enough information for a direct comparison), the small yellow triangle is to the left of the medium black triangle. However, this is not a direct answer to the question about a medium blue triangle, as Block A does not contain a medium blue triangle.

Considering the information directly related to the medium blue triangle in Block B, there's no description of objects to its left within Block B. However, if we're comparing based on the arrangement in Block A and mistakenly applying it to the concept of a medium triangle:

- The small yellow triangle is to the left of the medium black triangle in Block A.
- The big blue circle is below the medium black triangle in Block A, not to its left.

Given the confusion in the question and the blocks' descriptions, a strict interpretation based on the provided details about Block B (which contains the medium blue triangle) doesn't offer a clear answer since Block B's description doesn't include objects to the left of the medium blue triangle.

   - Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three and medium black square number two.
   This indicates that the order from top to bottom is: medium black square number three, medium black square number two, and medium black square number one.
3. Block B has one medium yellow square.
4. Block C has one medium blue square and a medium black square.
   - The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - This shape is below the medium black square.

Since block A is below block B, and block B has the yellow square, the yellow square is above block A. Considering the arrangement of block A's black squares, the topmost square of block A (which is below the yellow square) is medium black square number three.

So, what is below the yellow shape? It is medium black square number three.

3. Block B contains a medium blue square, a small yellow triangle, and a big yellow triangle. The medium blue square is near to the small yellow triangle and the big yellow triangle.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and the small blue circle is in Block A, the small blue circle is to the left of everything in Block B, including the big yellow triangle.

However, within Block B, the small yellow triangle is near to the big yellow triangle. This implies that the small yellow triangle is also to the left of the big yellow triangle, but only within the context of Block B.

Therefore, considering both blocks, the correct answer is that both the small blue circle (from Block A) and the small yellow triangle (from Block B) are to the left of the big yellow triangle.

3. Block C also contains one medium yellow square, which is below medium black square number two and above medium black square number one.

Since the medium yellow square is in block C, and it's below medium black square number two and above medium black square number one, we can conclude that both medium black square number one and medium black square number two are to the left of the medium yellow square (because the yellow square is in the same block as the black squares).

However, the question asks which object is to the left of a medium square. The answer is not about the yellow square, but rather about which black square is to the left of a medium square. Since block B contains one medium yellow square, and block A contains one medium blue square, we can infer that block C is to the left of block B (which contains a medium yellow square) and block B is to the left of block A (which contains a medium blue square).

But in block C itself, we can't determine which black square is to the left of a medium square based on the information given, because we don't know the relative positions of the black squares to each other in the horizontal direction. However, since the question asks about which object is to the left of a medium square, and we know that block C is to the left of block B, which contains a medium yellow square, we can say that both medium black square number one and medium black square number two are to the left of a medium square (the medium yellow square in block B).

Since block C is below blocks A and B, and it has a big yellow circle, we are interested in what is directly above this big yellow circle. Given the arrangement in block B, both the big yellow triangle and the medium black square are above the big yellow circle in block C, as they are positioned to the left and in the middle of block B, respectively.

Therefore, the answer is {2} both of them."

Block A: 
- It contains one medium blue circle, one medium blue triangle, and one big yellow circle.
- The medium blue circle is to the right of and above a small yellow circle.
- It is above and to the right of the big yellow circle, which is near to and below the small yellow circle.

Block B: 
- It contains two big blue circles.
- Big blue circle number one is above and to the right of big blue circle number two.
- Big blue circle number two is touching the bottom edge of this block.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and the question asks which object is to the left of a big blue circle, we are looking for objects in Block A that are to the left of Block B (which contains the big blue circles).

Given the arrangement within Block A, both the medium blue circle and the medium blue triangle are in Block A, which is to the left of Block B, where the big blue circles are. However, the specific positions of the triangle and the medium blue circle relative to each other and the big yellow circle and small yellow circle are described, but not directly relative to the left-right positioning in Block A that would be relevant to being ""to the left"" of a big blue circle in Block B.

Since both the medium blue circle and the triangle are in Block A, and Block A is to the left of Block B, it implies that both objects are to the left of the big blue circles in Block B, given the block-level positioning.

- Block B is to the right of block A and above block C. Block B has one medium blue square.
- Block C has one medium black square and a medium blue square. The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, and Block B has a medium blue square, the medium blue square in Block A is to the left of the medium blue square in Block B.

Now, the question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square: the medium blue square or the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

- In Block A, the medium yellow square is above the medium black squares, but there is no mention of another yellow square to the right of these black squares. However, in Block A, the medium black square touching the bottom edge is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B (considering the overall arrangement of blocks from left to right).

Block B is to the left of Block A and contains:

1. Block B contains a medium yellow triangle, a medium black circle, a small yellow triangle, and a small blue circle.
2. The small blue circle is near the bottom, and the medium yellow triangle is above and to the left of the small blue circle.
3. The medium black circle is below and to the right of the small blue circle, touching the right edge of block B.

Considering the positions of the objects relative to the small blue circle:

- The medium yellow triangle is above and to the left of the small blue circle.
- The medium black circle is below and to the right of the small blue circle.

Given that the small yellow triangle is near the small blue circle (though the exact position is not specified), we can infer that the medium yellow triangle is more likely to be to the left of the small yellow triangle, as it is already described as being above and to the left of the small blue circle.

However, without an explicit description of the small yellow triangle's position relative to the medium yellow triangle and the medium black circle, we can only make an educated guess based on the provided information.

Based on the information given, the most likely answer is that the medium yellow triangle is to the left of a small yellow triangle.

0) small black circle 
1) big yellow triangle 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine what is to the right of the big black circle, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. Block A has a big black circle, and it's mentioned that ""To the right of the big black square is the big black circle."" This means the big black circle is to the right of the big black square within Block A.

2. Block B is to the right of Block A. This means that anything to the right of the big black circle would be in Block B or at least on the right edge of Block A.

3. In Block B, the objects are arranged differently, but none of the arrangements directly mention anything being directly to the right of the big black circle since that circle is in Block A.

4. However, given the description of Block B, we know it contains a small black circle and a big yellow triangle, among other objects.

5. Since the big black circle is in Block A, and Block B is to the right of Block A, we can infer that to the right of the big black circle (considering the blocks' arrangement) would be objects in Block B.

6. However, the question asks what is directly to the right of the big black circle, not what is in Block B. Given the arrangement, it's clear that the big black circle is on the right edge of Block A (since it's to the right of the big black square in Block A), and thus, it would be adjacent to Block B.

7. The description doesn't explicitly state that the small black circle or the big yellow triangle is directly adjacent to the big black circle. However, since the big yellow triangle and the small black circle are in Block B, and Block B is to the right of Block A, we can infer that both of these objects are to the right of the big black circle in the sense that they are in the block that is to the right of the block containing the big black circle.

Given the arrangement and the phrasing of the question, the most accurate interpretation would be that both objects are in the block to the right of the big black circle, but the question seems to ask for a direct adjacency which isn't clearly described.

However, based on the blocks' arrangement and assuming the question intends to ask about the block-level adjacency rather than direct object adjacency, the answer would lean towards both being in the block to the right of the big black circle.

3. Block C is to the left of Block B and contains a big black square and a small black circle. The big black square is far from and to the left of the small black circle.

Since the question is asking which object is far from the small black circle, let's consider the relative positions:

- The big yellow circle and the small blue square are in Block A, which is below Block B. Block B is to the right of Block C, where the small black circle is located. Therefore, both the big yellow circle and the small blue square are far from the small black circle, but in a different sense (vertically). However, considering the question's phrasing, it seems to be asking about the relative distance in a more general sense.

Given the information and the phrasing of the question, the most logical answer would be that both objects (the big yellow circle and the small blue square) are far from the small black circle in the sense that they are not close to it.

- Block C has two medium yellow squares, but they are stacked vertically, not horizontally, so neither of them is directly to the right of the medium blue square in block A. However, since block C is to the right of block A, and block C contains medium yellow square number two, we can say that medium yellow square number two is to the right of the medium blue square in block A.

2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is below a medium blue square, let's analyze the information provided for each block.

Block B has two medium yellow squares and two medium blue squares. The arrangement is as follows:
- Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.
- Below medium blue square number two, there is medium yellow square number two.
- Below medium blue square number two and medium yellow square number two is medium blue square number one.
- Below medium yellow square number two and medium blue square number two is medium yellow square number one.

From the information, it's clear that medium yellow square number two is below medium blue square number two. However, the description is a bit confusing, but it seems to be saying that medium yellow square number one is also below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one.

Block C has a medium blue square and a medium black square, with the medium black square below the medium blue square. However, the question is about which medium yellow square is below a medium blue square, so this information doesn't directly relate to the question.

Given the information, both medium yellow square number two and the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium yellow square number one) are below a medium blue square.

Since block A is to the right of block B, and block A has a big black square, the big black square is to the right of the small yellow triangle.

There is no information that the big yellow triangle is to the right of the small yellow triangle. The big yellow triangle is on block C, which is to the right of block A, but the question is specifically asking about the small yellow triangle on block B.

Therefore, the answer is that the big black square is to the right of the small shape.

Block A has a small black circle to the right of and near to a medium black circle.

Block B is below Block A and contains various blue shapes and a big yellow triangle.

Since Block B is below Block A, and the small black circle is part of Block A, the objects in Block B are below the objects in Block A. 

Given that the big yellow triangle is part of Block B and is touching the right edge of this block, it is below the objects in Block A, including the medium black circle.

However, the small black circle is part of Block A and is to the right of and near to the medium black circle. Therefore, it is not below the medium black circle; it is at the same level as the medium black circle.

4. Block C contains one medium black square.

The question asks which object is to the right of a medium black square, the one in Block C or the one in Block B.

- Block B's medium black square is below the medium yellow square and above the medium blue square. Therefore, the medium yellow square is to the right of nothing in this context (as we're comparing objects within blocks to the blocks' positions), but it is above the medium black square. However, considering the blocks' arrangement, Block B itself is to the right of Block A, and Block B contains a medium black square.

- Block C's medium black square is the only content in Block C, and Block C is to the right of Block A, similar to Block B.

However, the question is about which object (medium black square in Block B or in Block C) is to the right of a medium black square. Given that both Block B and Block C are to the right of Block A, which contains a medium black square, both Block B's and Block C's medium black squares are to the right of a medium black square (the one in Block A).

1. Block A contains one medium blue square.
2. Block B is above block A and contains a medium blue square.
3. Block C is to the right of block B, containing three medium blue squares and a medium yellow square.

The arrangement in block C is described as follows:
- Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two and the medium yellow square.
- Medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square and medium blue square number three.

This indicates that medium blue square number one is below a medium blue square (number two) and the medium yellow square. Medium blue square number two is also below a medium blue square (number three) and the medium yellow square.

However, the question asks which object is below a medium blue square: the medium blue square in block B or medium blue square number two. 

Since the medium blue square in block B is not described as being below any other medium blue square, and medium blue square number two is below a medium blue square (number three), the correct answer is medium blue square number two.

2. Block A contains two small blue triangles, and Block C contains a small blue triangle. 

3. Block B has a big black triangle, and Block A has a medium black square touching its bottom edge.

Since Block A is below Block B and Block C, and both of these blocks contain a small blue triangle (Block A has two, but one in Block C is relevant for this comparison), the objects in Block A are below the small blue triangle in Block C.

Considering the options:

- The big black triangle (in Block B) is above the objects in Block A but is not directly related to being below a small blue triangle in the context of the question.
- The square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (in Block A) is below the small blue triangle in Block C.

However, given the structure and the fact that we're comparing the positions relative to a small blue triangle, and considering the specific phrasing of the question, it seems we are looking for an object that is directly below a small blue triangle in a different block. 

Given this interpretation, the medium black square in Block A is indeed below the small blue triangle in Block C. However, the question might be interpreted in a way that considers both the big black triangle and the square as being below small blue triangles (considering Block A's own triangles for the square, and the triangle in Block C for the big black triangle in Block B), but based on the direct relationship described, the most straightforward answer would focus on the square being below the small blue triangle in Block C.

   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three and medium black square number two.
   - Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three.

   From this, we can infer the order of the squares in Block A from top to bottom:

   - Medium black square number two
   - Medium black square number one (bottom)

2. Block B contains one medium black square, and Block C contains a medium blue square.

Considering the question, we are asked which object is below a medium black square: the medium black square in Block B or medium black square number three.

- Medium black square number three is at the top of Block A, so it is not below any medium black square.
- The medium black square in Block B is below medium black square number one and medium black square number two (which are in Block A), because Block A is above Block C, and Block B is to the left of Block A but its vertical position is not specified.

Block B contains a medium yellow circle. There are no shapes to the left of this medium circle within block B.

Block C contains a big blue triangle and a small blue triangle, with the big blue triangle below the small blue triangle. There is no medium shape in block C.

Now, we need to consider the positions of the blocks. Block B is to the right of block A and below block C. This means that the medium yellow circle in block B is to the right of block A and the objects in it, including the small blue triangle.

However, we are looking for the object that is to the left of a medium shape. The small blue triangle in block C is above the big blue triangle and to the left of block B, which contains the medium yellow circle.

2. Block B is to the right of block A and contains one medium black square. However, there is no medium yellow square in block B, so the black square in block B is not to the right of a yellow square.

3. Block C is to the right of block B and contains one medium black square with a medium yellow square below it. This means the black square in block C is above the yellow square, not to the right.

However, since block B is to the right of block A, and block A contains a medium yellow square, the medium black square in block B is to the right of the medium yellow square in block A.

3. Block C is above block B and has one medium blue square above a medium yellow square.

The question asks which medium yellow square is below a medium blue square. Based on the information:

- The medium yellow square in block B is above the medium blue square in block B, not below it.
- The medium yellow square in block A does not have a medium blue square above it within the same block, but since block B (which has a blue square above a yellow square) is above block A, and block C (which also has a blue square) is above block B, it means the medium yellow square in block A is below the medium blue squares in blocks B and C.

Since Block B is above Block A, the elements in Block B are above the elements in Block A. However, the big black square in Block B is described in relation to the big yellow square, not directly in relation to the small black square in Block A.

The medium yellow triangle in Block B is not described in relation to the big yellow square or the big black square, but it is in Block B, which is above Block A.

Considering the information provided, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the big black square is directly above the small black square, as the big black square's position is described relative to the big yellow square, not the small black square.

However, since Block B is above Block A, and both the big black square and the medium yellow triangle are in Block B, it is reasonable to conclude that both the big black square and the medium yellow triangle are above the small black square, albeit not necessarily directly above it.

- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
- The medium blue square is below medium black square number two.

From this, we can conclude that the medium blue square in block A is below a medium black square (medium black square number two).

Block B:
- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
- The medium blue square is below medium black square number one and medium black square number two.

In this case, the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block B is also below a medium black square (both medium black square number one and medium black square number two).

2. Medium blue square number one is below the medium yellow square in block C.
3. Medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square and the medium black square in block C.
4. However, it is also mentioned that medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one. This means the correct order in block C is: 
   - Medium yellow square
   - Medium black square
   - Medium blue square number two
   - Medium blue square number one (touching the bottom edge of block C)

Now, let's analyze the question: ""What is above the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block?"" 
In block C, the shape touching the bottom edge is medium blue square number one. Above this shape is the rest of the block, which includes a medium yellow square.

However, the question asks about ""a medium yellow square which is in block C or a medium yellow square that is in block A."" 
In block A, the medium yellow square is not touching the bottom edge of the block (there's no information about it touching the bottom edge), but it's the only yellow square in that block.

Considering the question, the medium yellow square in block C is indeed above the shape (medium blue square number one) that is touching the bottom edge of block C.

However, the question also mentions block A, but there's no information about any shape touching the bottom edge of block A. So, we can't confirm the position of the medium yellow square in block A relative to a shape touching the bottom edge.

Therefore, the correct answer is the medium yellow square in block C.

- The medium black square in Block B is to the left of the two medium blue squares in Block A.
- Medium black square number two in Block C is below medium black square number one and is not to the left of any medium blue square. However, it is worth noting that Block B's medium black square is above its medium blue square and to the left of the medium blue squares in block A. Meanwhile, Block C's medium black squares are below the medium blue squares in Block A.

However, looking at the arrangement, the medium black square in Block B is to the left of the medium blue squares in Block A. Medium black square number two in Block C is below medium black square number one in Block C, but since Block C is below Block A, this square is actually to the left of the medium blue squares in Block A as well, given that Block B and Block C are to the left of Block A.

However, the question seems to be asking about the relationship between Block A and Block B, specifically what is to the left of the blue shape in relation to the shapes in Block A. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, the big yellow circle in Block A is to the left of the entire Block B, including the blue shape.

1. Block A contains two medium yellow squares with a big yellow circle to their left.
2. Block B is to the right of Block A and contains a big black circle and a big black square (the square is to the right of the circle).
3. Block C is to the right of Block B and contains a big blue triangle.

Now, let's consider what's to the left of the blue object (the big blue triangle in Block C):

- Block B is to the left of Block C.
- In Block B, we have a big black circle and a big black square, with the circle being to the left of the square.

However, the question asks what's to the left of the blue object, specifically whether it's a big yellow circle or a big black circle. Since the big yellow circle is in Block A, which is to the left of Block B, and Block B is to the left of Block C, the big yellow circle is not directly to the left of the blue object.

The big black circle in Block B is directly to the left of the blue object in Block C, considering the arrangement of blocks.

So, the answer is {1} a big black circle."

   This means the medium yellow square is above both medium blue squares in Block A.

2. Block B: 
   - Below the medium black square, there is the medium blue square.
   This means the medium black square is above the medium blue square in Block B.

Now, considering the question, ""Which object is below a medium blue square? the medium yellow square or the medium black square?""

From the analysis, we can see that neither the medium yellow square nor the medium black square is below a medium blue square. In fact, both are above medium blue squares in their respective blocks.

   The arrangement in block A can be visualized as:
   Medium blue square 2
   Medium blue square 1
   Medium black square

2. Block B has two medium black squares, with medium black square number one below medium black square number two.

   The arrangement in block B can be visualized as:
   Medium black square 2
   Medium black square 1

3. The question asks which object is to the left of a medium black square: the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block or medium black square number two.

   Since block A is to the left of block B, and both blocks have medium black squares, we need to check the positions of these squares.

   In block A, the medium black square is at the bottom edge. In block B, medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.

   However, since block A is to the left of block B, the medium black square in block A (which is touching the bottom edge of block A) is indeed to the left of medium black square number two in block B.

   Therefore, the correct answer is that both the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (in block A) and medium black square number two (in block B) have an object to their left, but in the context of the question, it's asking which one has an object to its left, and it's the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (in block A) that has an object to its left (medium blue squares), and the medium black square number two (in block B) has an object to its left (block A), but the question is asking which object is to the left of a medium black square.

Given the arrangement of Block B's contents: 
- The medium yellow square is above the medium black square.
- The medium blue square is below both the medium yellow square and the medium black square, touching the bottom edge.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B, and Block B has a medium blue square touching its bottom edge, the medium yellow square in Block B is to the left of a shape (the medium blue square) that is touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B).

We know that in block A, the medium black square is to the left of the medium yellow square, and the big blue circle is to the left of the medium yellow square. This means the big blue circle is to the left of the medium black square.

In block B, we have two small black circles. The medium blue circle is above small black circle number two, and to the left of the medium blue circle is the small black triangle.

Now, considering the arrangement of objects in block A and block B, the question asks which object is to the right of a small black circle. Since the small black circles are in block B and the medium black square and big blue circle are in block A, we can conclude that neither the medium black square nor the big blue circle is to the right of a small black circle.

However, we can see that in block B, the small black triangle is to the left of and below the small yellow square, and to the left of and below the small yellow square there is the small black triangle, but also the small black triangle is to the left of the medium blue circle. The big yellow triangle is below the small yellow square and to the left of the big yellow triangle is the small black triangle.

3. Block B has a medium black square.

4. Block C has two medium black squares and a medium yellow square touching its bottom edge.

5. Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and a medium blue square. This implies that medium black square number two is above the medium blue square.

6. The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square and medium black square number two.

- Medium black square number two is above the medium blue square (as per point 5).

- The medium black square in Block B is not described in relation to the medium blue square in terms of being above or below it directly in the same block or context. However, based on the block arrangement, the medium black square in Block B is above Block A (which contains the medium blue square), but this is in a different block and not in the direct context of the question's specific arrangement of squares within the blocks.

Therefore, based on the specific context of the question focusing on the arrangement of squares within blocks and their direct relationships, the medium black square that is directly above a medium blue square in the described arrangement is medium black square number two.

   - The small black circle is below the small black square.

3. Since block B is to the right of block A, and we're looking for what's to the left of the small black circle, we can ignore the arrangement within block B and focus on the rightmost objects in block A.

4. The medium black triangle is the rightmost object in block A. Therefore, it is to the left of the objects in block B, including the small black circle.

2. Block A has two medium blue squares, with square 1 below square 2.
3. Block B has one medium yellow square and a medium blue square below it.
4. Block C has a medium black square.

Given that Block C is above Block B and below Block A, and considering the arrangement within each block:

- The medium blue square in Block B is below the medium yellow square in the same block.
- Since Block C is above Block B, the medium black square in Block C is above the medium yellow square in Block B.
- Block A has two medium blue squares, but since Block C is below Block A, the medium black square in Block C is also below the medium blue squares in Block A.

Therefore, the medium black square in Block C is above the medium yellow square in Block B and below the medium blue squares in Block A. However, the question asks what is above the black shape. Given the arrangement, both a medium blue square (from Block A) and no medium yellow square (since the medium yellow square is below the black square) are above the black shape.

However, since the question seems to be asking for what is directly above or in relation to the black shape from the perspective of the blocks' arrangement, and considering the phrasing of the options, the most fitting answer seems to be focused on the direct relationship as described:

- Block C has one medium yellow square and one medium black square, with the medium yellow square below the medium black square.

We need to find what is above the object which is touching the bottom edge of a block. Since there are two blocks with objects touching their bottom edges (Block B and Block C), we'll examine each.

- In Block B, the object touching the bottom edge is medium yellow square number one. Above it are medium yellow square number two and the medium blue square.
- In Block C, the object touching the bottom edge is the medium yellow square. Above it is the medium black square.

Considering the question, ""What is above the object which is touching the bottom edge of a block? a medium black square or a medium blue square?""

2. Block B: The medium yellow square is at the bottom, below the medium black square and the medium blue square. This means the medium blue square in block B is above the medium yellow square.

From the given information, the medium blue square in block A is above the medium yellow square, but it is the medium blue square in block A that is below the medium yellow square in block A that does not exist.

5. Block C contains two medium blue squares, with medium blue square number one touching the bottom edge of Block C.

Since Block A is above Block C and Block B is below Block A, Block B is also below Block C. Given the arrangement of the blocks (A above C, B below A), the yellow object in Block A is above Block B and Block C.

Considering the contents of Block B and Block C, we know that Block B has medium black squares and Block C has medium blue squares. However, since Block B is below Block A, and Block C is below Block A as well, both a medium black square (from Block B) and a medium blue square (from Block C) are below the yellow object.

Therefore, the answer is that both a medium black square and a medium blue square (including one that is touching the bottom edge of a block) are below the yellow object.

3. Block C has two medium blue squares (C1 and C2, with C2 being below a medium black square, and C1 being below both C2 and the medium black square).

From the description, in Block A, the medium blue square is below medium black square number two (A2). 

In Block C, medium blue square number one (C1) is below both medium blue square number two (C2) and the medium black square. This means the medium black square in Block C is not below a medium blue square but rather above one (C1) and has another (C2) above it.

Therefore, Block C (or more specifically, the medium blue squares in Block C) is to the right of the medium blue square in Block A.

- Medium blue square number two is in Block C. Since medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two, medium blue square number one is to the right of and below medium blue square number two (in the sense that it's in the same block and below it, but we are looking for something to the right of it). However, medium blue square number two is also to the left of medium blue square number three (since it's below it).

Since medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, and the medium black square is below the blue shape (which is below medium yellow square number two), both medium yellow squares are above the medium black square in block B.

However, the question asks which object is below a medium black square. Since both medium yellow squares are above the medium black square in block B, but the question doesn't restrict itself to block B, we should also consider the medium black square in block A. 

There's no information about objects below the medium black square in block A, but we do know that block C (with a medium blue square) is above block B, and block A is above block C.

Considering the arrangement of blocks, the medium black square in block A is above block B (and indirectly above the medium yellow squares in block B). However, the question asks which object is below a medium black square, not which object is above.

Given the arrangement of blocks and objects, the medium yellow squares in block B are indeed below the medium black square in block A, but the question seems to focus on the relative positions within block B.

In block B, both medium yellow squares are above the medium black square. However, the question asks which object is below a medium black square.

From the description of block B, we can infer that the medium yellow squares in block B are to the left of the medium black square within block B itself. However, the question asks about the position relative to the medium black square in block A.

Since block B is to the left of block A, and block C is to the left of block A (and thus to the left of block B as well), the medium yellow square in block C is to the left of the medium black square in block A.

However, the question also asks about the medium yellow square number one in block B. Given the description, it seems that the medium black square in block B is below the second medium yellow square and the first medium yellow square, suggesting the first medium yellow square is to the left of the medium black square within block B, but not directly to the left of the medium black square in block A.

Considering the layout and the question's focus on what is to the left of the medium black square in block A, the medium yellow square in block C is directly to the left of block A and thus its medium black square.

Now, let's address the question: Which object is below a medium black square? The medium blue square that is in block B or the medium blue square which is in block C?

From the information given:
- The medium blue square in block B is not below a medium black square; it is the only square in its block.
- The medium blue square in block C is above the medium black square, not below it. However, the medium yellow square in block C is below the medium black square.

However, since the question specifically asks about the medium blue squares in blocks B and C, and their positions relative to a medium black square, the correct answer is that neither of the medium blue squares is below a medium black square. The medium blue square in block B is not below a black square because there is no black square in its block. The medium blue square in block C is above the black square, not below it.

3. The arrangement of the black squares in Block B is as follows:
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
   - Medium black square number three is below medium black square number two.
   - This means the order from top to bottom is: medium black square number two, medium black square number three, medium black square number one.
4. A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block B and is below all three black squares.

Since the yellow square is below all three black squares in Block B, and Block A (with the blue square) is above Block B, the blue square is above the yellow object. However, the question asks what is directly above the yellow object, which would be the bottom black square (medium black square number one).

3. The question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square: the medium blue square or the yellow shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block.

Since the medium blue square is above medium yellow square number two, and the medium yellow square number one is below the medium yellow square number two, the medium blue square is not to the left of a medium yellow square.

However, block B is to the left of block A. In block B, we have two medium black squares. But in block A, the yellow shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block is medium yellow square number one.

Since Block A only contains a medium yellow square, there's no other object to its right within the same block. However, considering the arrangement of blocks (A and C are to the right of B), we can look at the objects within each block relative to the medium yellow squares in the context of the entire arrangement.

- In Block B, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square, but since we're considering what's to the right of a medium yellow square, we look at the arrangement of blocks: Block B has a medium yellow square, and to its right (in the overall arrangement, not within the block itself) is Block A, which also has a medium yellow square, and then Block C. So, in Block B, the medium black square is not to the right of a medium yellow square in the context of the question.

- In Block C, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square. However, Block C is to the right of Block B, which contains a medium yellow square. Therefore, the medium blue square in Block C is to the right of a medium yellow square (in Block B).

So, the medium black square in block B has an object (medium yellow square number two) below it. Also, the medium black square in block A is above the medium black square in block C, which means the medium black square in block C is below the medium black square in block A.

Therefore, the correct answer is {2}."

However, considering the options provided, the question seems to be asking for a comparison between a blue object and a black shape touching the bottom edge of a block. Since there is no blue object to the right of the big yellow circle in Block A, but there is a blue object (the big blue triangle) in Block B above Block A, and the small black triangle is touching the bottom edge of Block A but not to the right of the big yellow circle, the correct answer would be based on the fact that neither a blue object nor a black shape touching the bottom edge of a block is to the right of the big yellow circle in the context of Block A.

The medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (block C) is not below a medium black square, as there is no medium black square mentioned above it.

However, the description does not explicitly state that block B's medium black square is not above block C's medium blue squares. But it does say block C is above block B, which means block B's medium black square is below block C's medium blue squares. Therefore, the medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of block C is above block B's medium black square, making it the one that is above, not below, a medium black square.

Given the arrangement of blocks A, B, and C, medium blue square number two is above the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of block C, and both are above block B's medium black square. However, neither of them is below a medium black square. Instead, they are above a medium black square. But the question asks which one is below a medium black square.

3. The big yellow circle is touching the right edge of this block and is to the right of medium blue triangle number two.
4. The small yellow circle is above medium blue triangle number one.

From the given information, we know that the small yellow circle is above a medium blue triangle (object), but we are looking for an object above a big blue object.

The small blue triangle is to the left of the big yellow circle, but we don't have any information about it being above a big blue object. However, the big blue triangle is below medium blue triangle number two and to the right of it, but we also don't have any information about the small blue triangle being above the big blue triangle.

However, we do know that the small yellow circle is above a medium blue triangle, not a big blue triangle. But there is also no information about the small yellow circle being above the big blue triangle. However, we do know that the big blue triangle is to the right of and below medium blue triangle number two. So the big blue triangle is below medium blue triangle number two and the small yellow circle is above medium blue triangle number one. Since medium blue triangle number one is above medium blue triangle number two, then the small yellow circle is above the big blue triangle.

So the object above a big blue object is the small yellow circle.

- Medium yellow square number one
- Medium yellow square number three
- Medium yellow square number two

Considering the original question, both medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two are below the medium black square, but medium yellow square number one is directly above the medium black square in the vertical order, and medium yellow square number two is below medium yellow square number three. However, given the arrangement, both are indeed below the medium black square, but in terms of being 'above a medium black square' in the context of the question, the correct answer would be the one that is directly above or has the medium black square above it in a different arrangement. However, given the arrangement, it seems more like the question is asking which one is directly below, but in a different sense, which one is above in a different configuration. 

However, since the question asks which object is above a medium black square, and both are below it, the correct answer in the context given would be {2) both of them} since they are both below the medium black square but it seems the question is asking which one would be above it if the configuration was different, but in the current configuration, both are below it."

1. Block A contains a medium blue square and a medium black square. The medium blue square is at the bottom, and the medium black square is above it. Block A does not contain a medium yellow square.

2. Block B contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square. The medium yellow square is above the medium black square. This means the medium black square in block B is below the medium yellow square, not to the left of it.

3. Block C contains one medium yellow square and is to the right of block A. This means block A is to the left of block C.

Since block A is to the left of block C, and block C contains a medium yellow square, we need to look at block A to see if it has a medium black square that is to the left of the medium yellow square in block C. Block A does contain a medium black square.

Therefore, the medium black square that is in block A is to the left of a medium yellow square.

- The medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium blue square number one in Block B) has the medium black square above it, but in the context of the question, it's asking what's below these squares. Since medium blue square number one is at the bottom of Block B, there's nothing below it within Block B, but Block B itself is below Block C. However, the question seems to focus on the arrangement within the blocks rather than the blocks' positions relative to each other.

- Medium blue square number two in Block B has the medium black square below it.

In Block B, the arrangement is:
Medium yellow square
Medium blue square

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, and the question asks which object is to the right of a medium blue square, we look at the objects in Block B. Both medium blue square number 2 and medium blue square number 3 (as well as number 1) have objects to their right, which are the squares in Block B. However, the question seems to be asking specifically about the relationship of the objects in Block B to the medium blue squares in Block A.

Given the arrangement, both medium blue square number 2 and medium blue square number 3 have the same objects to their right (the medium yellow square and the medium blue square in Block B). Therefore, the answer is that both of them have objects to their right.

0) the medium circle 
1) the small object
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Block B has one medium black circle and one medium black triangle. The medium black circle is above the medium black triangle. This means the medium black circle is directly above the medium black triangle within Block B.

2. Since the medium black circle is directly above the medium black triangle within Block B, the medium black circle is to the right of the medium black triangle in the sense that it's in the same block and above it, but in terms of left and right, it's in the same position as the triangle.

3. Block B is to the left of Block C. This means that Block C is to the right of Block B.

4. Block C contains one medium blue triangle and a small black square. The medium blue triangle is below the small black square. This means that the small black square is above the medium blue triangle within Block C.

Considering the question asks which object is to the right of a medium black triangle, we have to look at objects in other blocks as well since the medium black triangle is in Block B. Since Block C is to the right of Block B, both the small black square and the medium blue triangle in Block C are to the right of the medium black triangle in Block B.

However, the question asks to choose between the medium circle or the small object. Given that the medium black circle is in the same block as the medium black triangle and the small black square is in a block to the right, the correct answer is the small object.

3. Block C contains a medium blue square and is to the right of block B and to the left of block A.

The question asks what is above the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block. The shape touching the bottom edge of a block is the medium blue square in block B.

According to the description of block B, above the medium blue square (which is touching the bottom edge), we have both a medium black square and a medium yellow square. However, the question seems to be asking for a choice between a black shape and a medium blue square, which might be slightly misleading given the arrangement.

- Block B contains a big black square and a medium yellow triangle. The big black square is below the medium yellow triangle, which means the medium yellow triangle is above the big black square.

- Block C's arrangement doesn't affect the question directly since it's asking about Block A's contents.

Given the information, the medium blue circle is to the right of and below the medium blue triangle, and the big blue triangle is above the medium blue circle but to the right of the medium blue triangle. The big black square is in Block B and not directly above the medium blue triangle in Block A.

Therefore, the correct answer is that a blue circle is below the medium blue triangle, but in terms of the question, it asks what is above the medium blue triangle. The big blue triangle is above the medium blue circle but to the right of the medium blue triangle. However, there is no indication that the big black square is above the medium blue triangle.

Considering the options, since the big blue triangle is above the medium blue circle but to the right of the medium blue triangle, and there is no indication of the big black square being above the medium blue triangle, the most accurate answer based on the provided options is that none of the options (blue circle or big black square) directly answer what is above the medium blue triangle based on the question's phrasing.

1. Block A has a medium yellow square and a medium black square below it. 
2. Block B has two medium yellow squares. One is below a medium black square, and the other is below the medium black square as well (i.e., it's also below the first yellow square, but we know the first yellow square is below the black square).
3. Block C has one medium black square.

The question asks which object is below a medium black square. 

In Block A, the medium black square is below the medium yellow square, but we don't have any information that there's an object below the medium black square itself.

In Block B, we have a medium black square, and below it, we have a medium yellow square. Then, there's another medium yellow square below the first one. However, we don't have any information that there's an object below the medium black square itself.

In Block C, we only have a medium black square, but there's no information that any object is below this medium black square.

However, re-reading the prompt for Block B, we see that the first medium yellow square is below a medium black square and medium yellow square number two. Also, medium yellow square number two is below the medium black square. This tells us that medium yellow square number two is below the medium black square and also below the first medium yellow square. Since the first medium yellow square is below the medium black square, this means that the first medium yellow square is below the medium black square, and then medium yellow square number two is below the first medium yellow square, which is below the medium black square.

Now, in Block B, we have a medium yellow square below the medium black square, but the prompt also says that the shape is touching the bottom edge of this block, and it is below the medium yellow square.

1. Block A contains a medium black square, one medium blue square, and one medium yellow square.
2. The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.
3. The medium black square is below the square which is below the medium yellow square (i.e., below the medium blue square).
4. Block B has two medium black squares, with one touching the bottom edge of the block and the other above it.

Since the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square in Block A, and there's no indication of any other blue object or medium black square from Block B being directly above the yellow shape, the correct answer is that the blue object (medium blue square) is above the yellow shape in the sense that it is below it, but there is also a medium black square touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B) that is above the yellow shape.

However, the question asks what is above the yellow shape, so considering the options given, the correct answer would be that both of them are above the yellow shape in the sense that the blue object is below it but there is also a medium black square touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B) that is above the yellow shape.

3. The medium yellow triangle is far from the big blue square and to the right of the big black square.
4. The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of block A and is near the medium black circle.
5. The big blue square is touching the bottom edge of block A.

Now, let's find out what is below the small shape in block C. The small shape in block C is the small black square.

Since block C is above block A, we need to find the shape in block A that is below the position where block C would be.

Given that the big blue square is touching the bottom edge of block A, it is likely that the big blue square is below the small black square.

However, the medium black circle is to the right of the big black square and the big blue square, but its vertical position is not explicitly stated relative to the big blue square. 

Considering the big blue triangle is near the medium black circle and the big blue triangle is touching the right edge of block A, and the medium yellow triangle is also touching the right edge of block A and is far from the big blue square, we can infer that the medium black circle is likely above the big blue square or at the same level but to the right.

Therefore, the shape below the small black square in block C is the big blue square.

Considering block A, the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square, but there's no object to the left of the medium blue square within block A itself.

Now, looking at block C, there's a medium blue square with a medium black square below it. The question is asking which object is to the left of a medium blue square, and in block C, there's no object to the left of the medium blue square.

However, since block A has a medium blue square, and block A is to the left of block B, and block B has a medium blue square, we can say the medium blue square in block A is to the left of the medium blue square in block B. But the question is specifically asking about the medium blue square in block C or block A.

In this case, the medium blue square in block A is to the left of the medium blue square in block B, but there's no direct comparison with block C in terms of left or right. However, considering the blocks' positions, block A is to the left of block B, and block B is above block C, so the medium blue square in block A is to the left of the medium blue square in block B, but not directly comparable to block C.

Since there's no object to the left of the medium blue square within block C itself and no direct comparison with block A, but block A is to the left of block B, and the question is specifically asking about block C or block A, the medium blue square in block A is to the left of the medium blue square in block B, but considering the question, the correct answer would be the medium blue square in block A.

3. The medium yellow square in Block B is below the medium blue square, which is below the medium black square.
4. Block C contains one medium black square.

Now, let's analyze the question: ""Which object is to the right of a medium black square?""

- Block A's medium black square has Block C to its right. 
- Block B's medium black square does not have another medium black square to its right, but it is in the same column as Block A's medium black square. Since Block C is to the right of Block A, it is also to the right of Block B's medium black square.

Since Block C is below blocks B and A, the medium black square in Block C is below all the squares in blocks A and B, including the medium blue squares. 

However, the medium black square in Block B is also below a medium blue square (medium blue square 2).

Therefore, both medium black squares are below a medium blue square.

Block B contains a small blue square, one big black square and one small yellow circle. Below the small yellow circle and the big black square is the small blue square. Block C has one big blue square and one small blue square. A small black triangle is to the right of and above the small blue square.. Above the small black triangle is the big blue square. Which object is above a small black triangle? the small blue square that is in block C or the small blue square that is in block B??
0) the small blue square  that is in block C
1) the small blue square  that is in block B
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's break down the information given for each block:

1. Block A: It has one small black triangle.
2. Block B: It contains a small blue square, one big black square, and one small yellow circle. The small blue square is below the small yellow circle and the big black square.
3. Block C: It has one big blue square and one small blue square. A small black triangle is to the right of and above the small blue square. The big blue square is above the small black triangle.

From the description of Block C, we can infer that the small blue square in Block C is below the small black triangle, not above it.

Now, let's consider Block B. The description does not mention the small black triangle in relation to the small blue square in Block B. However, it does describe the positions of the small blue square relative to the big black square and the small yellow circle, but not to a small black triangle.

However, Block A has a small black triangle, and Block B is above Block A. This means the small blue square in Block B is above the small black triangle in Block A.

Considering the information given, the small blue square that is above a small black triangle is the one in Block B.

2480,"We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block A is to the left of C. Block C is to the right of B. Block A contains two medium blue squares. Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block. This shape is below medium blue square number two. Block B has two medium black squares. Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two. Block C contains a medium black square. Which object is to the left of a medium black square? the medium blue square which is touching the bottom edge of a block or medium blue square number two??
0) the medium blue square  which is touching the bottom edge of a block 
1) medium blue square  number two
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. Block A is to the left of Block C.
2. Block C is to the right of Block B.
3. From points 1 and 2, we can conclude that the order of the blocks from left to right is A, B, C.

Now, let's analyze the contents of the blocks:

- Block A contains two medium blue squares (one above the other).
- Block B contains two medium black squares (one above the other).
- Block C contains a medium black square.

Since Block A is to the left of Block B and Block B has medium black squares, both medium blue squares in Block A are to the left of the medium black squares in Block B.

Therefore, both the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block A and medium blue square number two are to the left of a medium black square.

250,"We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block B is above A. Block C is above B. Block A contains one big yellow circle. This block also has a medium black triangle. Above the medium black triangle is the big yellow circle. Block B has two small black triangles. To the left of a medium blue circle is small black triangle number one. To the left of the medium blue circle is small black triangle number two. Small black triangle number one is near to the small black triangle number two. Block C has two big blue triangles. There is also one medium black circle in this block. The medium black circle is to the right of big blue triangle number two. Big blue triangle number one is to the right of and below big blue triangle number two. Which object is above a small black triangle? the medium black circle or the medium black triangle??
0) the medium black circle 
1) the medium black triangle 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To determine which object is above a small black triangle, let's analyze the information provided:

- Block A has a medium black triangle, and above it is a big yellow circle. However, there are no small black triangles in Block A.
- Block B has two small black triangles, and to the left of a medium blue circle are these two small black triangles. There is no mention of any object directly above these small black triangles in Block B.
- Block C has two big blue triangles and a medium black circle. The medium black circle is to the right of big blue triangle number two, but there's no direct relation to small black triangles since they are in Block B.

However, we can see that Block C (which contains the medium black circle) is above Block B (which contains the small black triangles). Therefore, the medium black circle is indeed above the small black triangles, albeit in a different block.

Considering the provided options:
0) the medium black circle 
1) the medium black triangle 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Since the medium black circle is above the small black triangles (albeit indirectly by being in a block above the block containing the small black triangles), the correct answer is:

746,"There are three blocks. Lets call them A, B and C. Block A has one medium yellow square. Then, we have block B with one medium yellow triangle and a medium yellow circle in it. The medium yellow triangle is near to the medium yellow circle. Block C is to the right of block B and to the left of block A. It has a medium yellow square, one small blue triangle and one big blue square. Below and to the right of the small blue triangle which is above and to the left of the big blue square is the medium yellow square. Which object is to the left of a medium yellow square? the medium yellow triangle or the medium yellow circle??
0) the medium yellow triangle 
1) the medium yellow circle 
2) both of them
3) none of them","To solve this problem, let's analyze the information given:

- Block A has a medium yellow square.
- Block B has a medium yellow triangle and a medium yellow circle, with the triangle near the circle.
- Block C has a medium yellow square, a small blue triangle, and a big blue square, with the medium yellow square below and to the right of the small blue triangle and above and to the left of the big blue square.

Since the question asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, we must identify the block that contains both a medium yellow square and either a medium yellow triangle or a medium yellow circle. 

Block A only has a medium yellow square, so it does not provide the necessary information. Block C also has a medium yellow square but does not contain a medium yellow triangle or a medium yellow circle. 

Block B has a medium yellow triangle and a medium yellow circle, but it does not have a medium yellow square. However, it is mentioned that Block C is to the right of Block B and to the left of Block A. This implies that Block B is to the left of Block C. Since Block C has a medium yellow square, the medium yellow triangle and the medium yellow circle in Block B are to the left of the medium yellow square in Block C.

Therefore, both the medium yellow triangle and the medium yellow circle are to the left of a medium yellow square.
