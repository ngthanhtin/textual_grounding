2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, let's break down the positions of the blocks and squares step-by-step:

1. **Block C**:
   - It contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.

2. **Block B**:
   - It contains one medium black square and one medium blue square.
   - The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block B and is below the medium blue square.

3. **Block A**:
   - It contains a medium black square.
   - It is mentioned that below a medium blue square, there is a medium black square.

Now, let's consider the overlap and stacking order of the blocks:

- **Position of Blocks**: 
  - Block C is above Block B.
  - Block B is above Block A.

**Analysis**:
- Block C is at the highest position with its two yellow squares.
- Block B is below Block C, and it has the medium blue square above the medium black square.
- Block A is below Block B, and it contains the medium black square. It's stated that a medium black square is below a medium blue square.

All of these indicate the following relationships:
- The medium blue square in Block B is directly above the medium black square also in Block B.
- The medium black square in Block A is under some medium blue square from some other block. Since Block B is directly above Block A, it implies that the medium black square in Block A is below the medium blue square in Block B.

**Final Conclusion**:
- The medium yellow square from Block C does not directly influence either medium blue square in placement because Block C's squares are above Block B completely.
- The medium black square in Block B is below the medium blue square in the same block, and thus, Block B's blue square is relevant concerning the yellow square sequence.

Therefore, the object below a medium yellow square is a square in Block B, but not directly due to immediate contact with the yellow squares. However, the analysis requested is for the blue squares in relation to being below any yellow square at all, rather than direct contact.

Given the vertical arrangement and the fact all yellow squares are in Block C, which is above both Block B and Block A, we conclude:
- **Answer**: The medium blue square in Block B is indirectly below a yellow square due to overall block stacking.

The final answer is: {1}, indicating the medium blue square in Block B."
1577,"We have two blocks. We call them A and B. Block A is to the right of B. Block A contains a medium black circle and one small black circle. A medium black square is to the right of and below the small black circle. The small black circle is touching the top edge of this block. The medium black circle is touching the right edge of this block. It is to the right of the small black circle. Block B contains a big black triangle and a small yellow square. Above and to the right of the small yellow square there is the big black triangle. Which object is to the right of a black triangle? the medium black square or the small yellow square??
0) the medium black square 
1) the small yellow square 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the right of the black triangle, let's analyze the positions of each object within the blocks.

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium black circle (MBC) and a small black circle (SBC).
   - The SBC is located near the top edge of Block A, and a medium black square (MBS) is to the right of and below the SBC.
   - The MBC is to the right of the SBC and touches the right edge of Block A.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains a big black triangle (BBT) and a small yellow square (SYS).
   - The BBT is above and to the right of the SYS within Block B.

Since the problem specifies the positions within each block, we recognize that:
- In Block B, the BBT is above and to the right of the SYS, suggesting SYS is located relatively more to the left and below the BBT.
- Block A and Block B are distinct and placed such that A is to the right of B. Therefore, nothing within Block A directly correlates with positions of Block B for the left/right orientation purposes unless specified beyond their relative positions to each other.

The question asks which object is to the right of the BBT. Analyzing within Block B as these objects are placed distinct in separate blocks:
- It is stated that the BBT is above and to the right of the SYS. But since no specifications exist beyond the positioning within each block, it implies no object from Block A like the MBS is directly on the right of BBT.

Hence, focusing on the within Block B positioning and knowing the SYS is placed nearby:
- It is reasonable to conclude the SYS is to the left of and below the BBT but not to its right.

Therefore, the clarity gives that the straightforward relative position of being after the BBT within Block B fits SYS, unless specified cross-block rules were applied beyond placement location: we deem SYS being left notwithstanding above direction additional blocks may offer.

There is no immediate prospect that the MBS is involved, within the given context since no cross-block horizontal direct overlaps are defined in terms of having lengths overtaken per scenarios specified.

Thus the small yellow square essentially plays to be nearest feature horizontally responsive attribute regarding alphabet lettered positions:
  
1) small yellow square

","To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's break down the information and analyze the position of each object step by step:

1. **Block A**: Contains one medium yellow square.

2. **Block B**: Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium black square.

   - **Medium yellow square number one** in Block B is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - **Medium yellow square number two** is somewhere above medium yellow square number one.
   - The **medium black square** is below medium yellow square number two.
   - **Relative arrangement in Block B**:
     1. Medium yellow square number two (at the top)
     2. Medium black square (below yellow square number two)
     3. Medium yellow square number one (touches the bottom edge of the block)

3. **Block C**: Contains one medium yellow square.

Now, let's address the question: Which object is below a medium yellow square?

- In Block B:
  The medium yellow square number two is at the top, with the medium black square below it. Thus, the black object is below a medium yellow square.
  The medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of the block, and it is not below any yellow square, rather, it is itself below both the medium yellow square number two and the medium black square.

Therefore, based on this information, the object below a medium yellow square is the medium black square.

Thus, the correct answer is {0}, indicating that the black object is below a medium yellow square."

","To solve this problem, we will first analyze the positions of the blocks and the squares based on the given information.

1. **Block Layout:**
   - Block A is to the left of Block C.
   - Block C is below Block B.

2. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium yellow square.

3. **Block B:**
   - Contains one medium black square and one medium blue square.

   - A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
   - Below medium blue square number two and one is the medium yellow square.

5. **Relationship between the squares in Block C:**
   - Square three is at the top.
   - Lives below square three are square one and square two.
   - Further, below both medium blue square number two and number one, there is a medium yellow square.

Now, considering the specific placement of the black shape in Block B:
- Block B has a medium black square located below its medium blue square.

The question asks what is below the black shape, and the information indicates it is below the medium blue square in Block B, not Block C.

Since the query involves what is below the black shape specifically related to Block B, and there's no direct mention of the specific numeric medium blue square placement overlapping between blocks, the logical conclusion is that Block C does not influence what's below Block B's black shape, and thus related to the medium blue squares in Block C, none of them could directly be under Block B's black square.

Therefore, the answer to what is below the black shape must be:
- None of the medium blue squares in Block C because they pertain to Block C not Block B's alignment specifically.

In this layout:

- The **medium black square** is in Block A.
- To the right of the black square in Block A is Block B.
- Block B contains medium yellow squares.
- Therefore, directly to the right of the black thing (medium black square in Block A) is a medium yellow square from Block B. 

Block C is above Block A, so the blue square in Block C is not to the right of the black square. Thus, the correct answer is that a medium yellow square is to the right of the black thing.

- **Medium Blue Square B2** in Block B:
  - Since both are within Block B, Medium Blue Square B2 is vertically below the medium yellow square and is therefore not to the right of it as per the normal spatial orientation within a single block where 'right' would refer to the left-right direction, not top-bottom.

- **Medium Blue Square A** in Block A:
  - Block A is entirely to the left of Block B, meaning it is to the left of all the squares in Block B. 
  - Hence, the Medium Blue Square A in Block A is to the left of squares in Block B and not to the right of any medium square.

","To determine which medium black square is above a medium blue square, we need to analyze the given arrangement of blocks A, B, and C.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Block A**:
   - Consists of a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
   - The medium blue square is located below the medium yellow square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains three medium black squares and one medium yellow square.
   - The arrangement specifies:
     - Medium black square number three is above medium black square number one.
     - Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three.
   - A medium yellow square is mentioned in such a way that implies it is aligned with some of these black squares (however, exact positioning specific to the medium blue square is not clarified here).

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains a medium blue square that is situated directly below Block B.

### Position Analysis:

- **Medium black square number one**:
  - It is located at the bottom, under black square number three and potentially affecting its position relative to Block C directly below it.
  
- **Medium black square number two**:
  - Its relative position inside Block B makes it distinctly below black square number three, but unclear as to the exact placement regarding the medium blue square in Block C.

### Conclusion:
Considering the vertical arrangement, medium black square number one, which is beneath the others in a block (presumably Block B as the typical narrative suggests Block C to be below, containing the blue square), would likely be positioned directly above the medium blue square present in Block C, given the sequence of placement. Thus:

- **Above a medium blue square**: Likely to be medium black square number one, not number two, as per vertical continuity of stacking.

Therefore, the final correct answer reflecting this spatial deduction is:
- Medium black square number one is located directly above the medium blue square in Block C.

This means the appropriate option is:
- **1) Medium black square number one**

","To solve this problem, let's analyze the information given about the arrangement of squares in the two blocks.

Block A:
- It contains one medium blue square.

Block B:
- It contains two medium blue squares, one medium yellow square, and one medium black square.
- The medium blue squares are labeled as number one and number two.
- Medium blue square number one is below the medium black square.
- Medium blue square number two is below the medium black square and the medium yellow square.
- Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.
- The medium yellow square is below the medium black square.

Based on this information:
- The medium black square is at the top in Block B.
- The medium yellow square is directly below the medium black square.
- Medium blue square number two is directly below the medium black square and also below the medium yellow square, confirming that the medium yellow square is directly above medium blue square number two.
- Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.

Let's determine what is directly below the medium black square:
- Immediately below the medium black square is the medium yellow square.
- Medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square, not directly below the black square.

Since medium blue square number two is below both the yellow and black squares, the correct answer is:

1466,"There are two blocks, A and B. Block A has a big blue square and a medium yellow circle. There is also a big black circle touching the bottom edge of this block. This block also contains one small black circle. The big blue square is near to the big black circle. It is below the medium yellow circle. To the right of, below and far from the small black circle is the big black circle. Block B is to the right of block A. It has one medium blue square. Which object is to the left of a medium blue square? the small black circle or the medium yellow shape??
0) the small black circle 
1) the medium yellow shape
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the left of the medium blue square in Block B, we need to analyze the position of the shapes within Block A relative to Block B.

1. We know that Block B, which contains the medium blue square, is located to the right of Block A. Therefore, all objects within Block A are initially to the left of the medium blue square.

2. In Block A:
   - The big blue square is near the big black circle and below the medium yellow circle.
   - The medium yellow circle is above the big blue square, so it is also above and potentially to the left of or directly above the big black circle.
   - The small black circle is located somewhere above and to the left of the big black circle (as stated, it is far from the big black circle, thus positioning it away from the bottom of Block A).

3. Given these descriptions, we discern that within Block A, both the medium yellow circle and the small black circle are indeed positioned to the left of the big black circle.

4. Since Block B and its medium blue square are entirely to the right of Block A, all features described within Block A are fundamentally to the left of the medium blue square in Block B.

5. Thus, both the small black circle and the medium yellow shape in Block A are to the left of the medium blue square in Block B.

The answer is: {2} (both of them)."

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the arrangement of the blocks and squares:

1. **Blocks Arrangement**: 
   - Block C is to the right of Block B.
   - Block C is to the left of Block A.

   Therefore, the horizontal arrangement from left to right is: Block B, Block C, Block A.

2. **Contents of Each Block**:
   - Block A contains one medium yellow square.
   - Block B contains a medium blue square.
   - Block C contains three medium black squares.

3. **Positioning of the Black Squares in Block C**:
   - Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge.
   - Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three. It is also below medium black square number two.

   This means:
      - Medium black square number three is the topmost.
      - Medium black square number two is below the topmost (i.e., medium black square number three), and above the bottom (i.e., medium black square number one).
      - Medium black square number one is at the bottom, touching the bottom edge of Block C.

4. **Identifying Right of a Medium Square**:
   - We are asked to determine which object is to the right of either:
     - the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of Block C (i.e., medium black square number one)
     - or medium black square number two.

   Since all aforementioned squares are within Block C, to find what is directly to the right of them, we look to the content of the block immediately to the right of Block C, which is Block A.

   - Block A contains a medium yellow square; therefore, it is to the right of all three black squares in Block C.

Thus, the object to the right of both medium black square number one and medium black square number two is the medium yellow square in Block A.

Therefore, the answer to the question of which object is to the right of a medium square in Block C is:

","To solve this problem, let's break down the given scenario:

1. **Block A** contains a medium yellow square. There are no other descriptions of arrangements provided for Block A.

2. **Block B** contains the following:
   - Two medium black squares: Medium black square number one and medium black square number two.
   - A medium blue square.
   - A medium yellow square.

   The arrangement within Block B is as follows:
   - Medium black square number two is above the medium yellow square.
   - The medium yellow square is below medium black square number two.
   - The medium blue square is below medium black square number two and the medium yellow square.
   - Medium black square number one is on the bottom edge of Block B.
   - Medium black square number one is below both medium black square number two and the medium blue square.

Let's determine the position of the squares arranged within Block B:

- At the bottom edge is medium black square number one.
- Medium black square number two must be above it.
- The medium blue square is above medium black square number one but is below medium black square number two.
- The medium yellow square in Block B is positioned below medium black square number two and has no specific location relative to medium black square number one except that it should also be above, as there's no mention it touches the bottom edge.

Hence, the squares positioned from the very bottom towards the topmost in Block B, in general order, could look like this: 
1. Medium black square number one on the very bottom.
2. Medium blue square or medium yellow square above medium black square number one, somewhere relative between squares that are above the bottom edge.
3. Medium black square number two above both medium black square number one and the medium blue square.

Now, the query is about determining which of the medium yellow squares is above an object that touches the bottom edge:

- The medium black square number one is the square touching the bottom edge of Block B.
- Since the Block B contains both the medium blue square and the medium yellow square above the medium black square number one, the medium yellow square in Block B is above the object (medium black square number one) that is touching the bottom edge. 
- The medium yellow square in Block A has no such specific relative position or association described indicating it is above any object touching an edge.

Given these observations, the medium yellow square in Block B fits the description better than the one in Block A.

Therefore, the final answers would be:

- The medium yellow square in Block B is above an object (medium black square number one) that is touching the bottom edge. 
- Thus, the correct option is 0) the medium yellow square which is in block B.

","To solve this puzzle, we need to visualize the spatial arrangement of the blocks and the objects within them:

1. **Block A**: Contains one medium yellow square.
   - Since Block A has only this one square, there's no object to the right of it in Block A itself.

2. **Block B**: Contains one medium yellow square and one medium black square.
   - The medium yellow square in Block B is touching the bottom edge and is below the medium black square.
   - Since the descriptions do not indicate any object being to the right of the medium yellow square in Block B, nothing directly applies here.

3. **Block C**: Contains one medium yellow square and one medium blue square.
   - The medium yellow square in Block C is touching the bottom edge and is below the medium blue square.
   - Similar to Block B, there is no mention of anything being directly to the right of this yellow square.

Now let's integrate the spatial arrangement of the blocks:
- Block B is below Block A, meaning horizontally there is no interaction relevant to what's right of the yellow square.
- Block C is to the right of Block A. However, in Block C, even though the medium blue square is related to its yellow counterpart vertically, nothing explicitly states the blue square is to the right of any yellow square in reference.

Therefore, considering the constraints and positioning, none of the medium black square or the blue object is specifically to the right of a medium yellow square across this entire arrangement.

The correct answer is that there is no object explicitly to the right of a medium yellow square in the given setup.

2. Block B: Is directly below Block A, containing a medium black square.
3. Block C: Positioned below Block A (albeit this is not clearly specified whether directly under or beside), contains two medium black squares named as ""medium black square number one"" and ""medium black square number two"" and one medium blue square below them both.

When interpreting the positioning:
- Block B is stated to be directly below Block A.
- Block C is also below Block A, but details on its specific alignment (directly below or laterally shifted) are not provided.
- The mention that the medium blue square in Block C is at the bottom means Block C could be vertically aligned such that part might overlap into the area below Block A.

The question is specific about what is directly below the yellow shape in Block A.

- The medium black square in Block B is directly below block A, below the yellow square in Block A.
- The medium black square number two, being part of Block C, is not described as being directly below the yellow shape (it's below number one within its block and Block C is not confirmed to be directly aligned under Block A).

Thus, considering direct vertical alignment and sequence, the medium black square which is in Block B is below the medium yellow square in Block A.

2. Block B contains:
   - One medium blue triangle
   - One small black square
   - One big yellow triangle
3. The given positional relationship: To the left of a big black square, the big yellow triangle and the small black square is the medium blue triangle.

Now let's determine what is above the blue circle in Block A:

- The big yellow triangle is described as touching the bottom edge of Block B. Therefore, it must also be directly above Block A and, consequently, would be directly above the blue circle in Block A.
- The description does not specify that the small black square is directly above the blue circle. Its position is described in relation to the medium blue triangle and the big black square (which is mentioned in the context but not directly listed as part of Block B's contents).

","To solve this problem, let's analyze each block and the positions of the shapes within each block:

1. **Block A:**
   - Medium Black Square 1 (MBS1)
   - Medium Black Square 2 (MBS2)
   - Medium Yellow Square (MYS)

   Arrangement:
   - MYS is above MBS1 and MBS2.
   - MBS1 is below both MYS and MBS2.

2. **Block B:**
   - Medium Blue Square (MBSq)

   Arrangement:
   - Block B is above Block A, so MBSq is above all shapes in Block A.

3. **Block C:**
   - Medium Black Square (MBS)
   - Medium Blue Square (MBSqC)
   - Medium Yellow Square (MYSC)

   Arrangement:
   - MYSC is below both MBS and MBSqC.
   - MBSqC is immediately below MBS.

Now, to determine which medium black square is below a medium blue square, examine each case:

- **For Medium Black Square in Block C:** 
  - In Block C, the MBS is directly above MBSqC. Since the MBSqC is below the MBS, it means the medium black square in Block C is above the medium blue square in Block C.

- **For Medium Black Square Number One in Block A:**
  - In Block A, MBS1 is below MBS2 and MYS, but there is no medium blue square (MBSq) in the same block. The only medium blue square close to Block A is the one in Block B, which is above MBS1 in a completely different block. Thus, MBS1 is not directly below any medium blue square structurally within the same or immediately adjacent arrangements.

Therefore, neither medium black square number one nor the medium black square in Block C is directly below a medium blue square.

","To determine which object is above a medium yellow square, we need to closely examine the description of blocks and the position of each square within these blocks:

- **Block A:** Has one medium black square. There’s no mention of other squares in this block, so there are no spatial relationships concerning a medium yellow square here.

- **Block B:** Contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square. The description states, ""Below the medium yellow square is the medium black square."" Thus, in Block B, the medium yellow square is on top, and the medium black square is below it. Therefore, the medium black square in Block B is not above the medium yellow square.

- **Block C:** Contains a medium blue square, a medium black square, and a medium yellow square. The description states, ""Below the medium black square and the medium yellow square is the medium blue square,"" and ""The medium black square is below the medium yellow square."" This implies that in Block C, the medium yellow square is on top, the medium black square is below the medium yellow square, and both are above the medium blue square.

1. **Identify the positions of the blocks:**
   - Block A is above Block C.
   - Block A is to the right of Block B.

2. **Determine the layout within each block:**
   - **Block A** has:
     - Medium blue square number one.
     - Medium blue square number two (above medium blue square number one).
     - Medium yellow square (below medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two).
   - **Block B** has:
     - One medium black square.
   - **Block C** has:
     - One medium blue square.

3. **Determine the vertical and horizontal relationships:**
   - Block A is above Block C, suggesting that within a vertical alignment, Block A would be directly above Block C.
   - Block A is to the right of Block B, suggesting in a horizontal alignment, Block A is directly to the right of Block B.

4. **Clarify the Conditions:**
   - ""The medium blue square that is in block C"": This refers to the only medium blue square present in Block C.
   - ""Medium blue square number one"": This refers to one of the two medium blue squares present in Block A, specifically the one below the other medium blue square within Block A.

5. **Assess the relationship:**
   - Since Block A is directly to the right of Block B, all squares within Block A (including medium blue square number one) will also be to the right of the medium black square in Block B.
   - Since Block A is above Block C, the medium blue square in Block C is below all squares in Block A vertically but does not have a specified horizontal placement relative to squares in Block A. Thus, we cannot conclude the medium blue square in Block C is to the right of any medium squares unless specified otherwise.

Given all these considerations, medium blue square number one, being part of Block A, is definitively to the right of the squares located within Block B, based on the position descriptions.

Thus, the only square definitively to the right of another medium square (medium black square in Block B) is the medium blue square number one in Block A.

- **Block A** consists of:
  - A big yellow circle.
  - A small blue square touching the right edge.
  - A small black triangle.
  - A small black square touching the right edge.
  - A medium yellow circle touching the right edge.

The relationships provided are:
- The big yellow circle is below the medium yellow circle.
- The small blue square is near the medium yellow circle.
- Above the square, which is near to the medium yellow circle, is the small black square.
- The big yellow circle is to the left of the small blue square.
- The big yellow circle is above the small black triangle.

Let's visualize the layout:
- The medium yellow circle is on the right edge, presumably above the big yellow circle.
- The small blue square is near the medium yellow circle and on the right edge, indicating it is below the medium yellow circle.
- The small black square is above the small blue square, also on the right edge, thereby putting it above or in contact with the medium yellow circle.

We need to determine if the big yellow circle or the small black square is directly below the big yellow square in Block B.

Now, let's consider Block B:
- Block B is above Block A and contains a big yellow square.

The question is about what lies directly below the big yellow square in Block B.

Given that:
- The small black square is above the small blue square and seems to be positioned close to the medium yellow circle on the right edge of Block A.
-  The big yellow circle seems to be left of the position occupied by the arrangements of the squares and the medium yellow circle.

Given the spatial arrangement in Block A, the small black square is positioned more directly below Block B than the big yellow circle. This is because:
- The small black square, medium yellow circle, and small blue square form a vertical alignment along Block A's right edge.
- The big yellow circle is positioned to the left of this vertical alignment.

Considering these points, the appropriate choice for what is directly below the big yellow square in Block B seems to align more with the small black square rather than the big yellow circle.

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains one medium yellow square and one medium black square.
   - The medium black square is above the medium yellow square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains one medium black square.

3. **Block C**:

   - Medium blue square number one is below the medium blue square number two and the medium black square.
   - Medium blue square number two is directly below the medium black square.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the right of a medium black square.

- The medium black square in **Block A** is to the left of Block C, which means Block C, as a whole, is to the right of the medium black square in Block A.

- The medium black square in **Block C** has two medium blue squares below it, but nothing is mentioned about there being an object specifically to the right of it within Block C. Since Block C is on the right of both A and B, no other block can be further right relative to Block C.

Considering the spatial organization of the blocks, the logic leads us to conclude that Block C (which contains the medium blue squares and the medium black square) as a whole is to the right of the medium black square in Block A. However, within the internal layout of Block C, there is no explicit item to the right of its medium black square.

With this understanding, the object to the right of a medium black square is not another square, but rather the block arrangement. Thus, the medium black square in Block C doesn't have any objects or squares to its right that are explicitly defined in this context.

","Let's analyze the arrangement of shapes in the blocks and determine what's above the medium shape, which in this case is the medium blue circle in Block A.

1. In Block A, given:
   - A big blue triangle, a small black circle, and a medium blue circle.
   - The big blue triangle is below the small black circle.
   - The medium blue circle is below and to the right of the small black circle.
   - The big blue triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block.

   From the description, the vertical arrangement in Block A is:  
   - At the top, the small black circle.
   - Below it, the medium blue circle (but slightly to the right).
   - At the bottom, the big blue triangle.

2. In Block B:
   - A small black circle, a small yellow circle, and a big blue square.
   - The small black circle is below and to the left of the small yellow circle.
   - The big blue square is at the bottom with the small yellow circle above it.

This analysis shows that in Block A:
- The medium blue circle is positioned below the small black circle. Thus, the small black circle is directly above the medium blue circle.

In Block B:
- The arrangement does not affect Block A's medium blue circle, as Block B's components are separate.

Based on this, in Block A, above the medium blue circle, there is a small black circle, and there is no mention of a yellow object in that block.

Thus, the answer to what is above the medium shape, which is the medium blue circle, would be the small black circle.

So, the correct answer is option 0) small black circle.

1. **Structure of Blocks:**
   - Block A is positioned between Block C and Block B.
   - Block A's contents: one medium yellow square; below it, a medium blue square.
   - Block B's contents: one medium yellow square.
   - Block C's contents: two medium blue squares, where medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.

2. **Objective:** Identify what object is below a medium blue square, specifically comparing the medium blue square in Block A and medium blue square number two in Block C.

3. **Examine the medium blue square in Block A:**
   - Block A contains a medium yellow square on top and a medium blue square below it. However, there is no other object described as being below the medium blue square within Block A, so no object is directly below it within its block.

4. **Examine medium blue square number two in Block C:**
   - Block C's configuration starts with medium blue square number two on top followed by medium blue square number one below it. Here, medium blue square number one is directly below medium blue square number two.

Considering the analysis:

- **The medium blue square in block A** has no object below it within Block A.
- **Medium blue square number two in block C** has medium blue square number one below it within Block C.

Therefore, the answer is that medium blue square number two in Block C has an object (another medium blue square) below it.

The correct answer choice is:
1) medium blue square number two

  - The medium yellow square is above the medium black square.
  - The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block A.

- **Block B:**
  - Is located above Block A.

  - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
  - Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
  - The medium blue square is below medium yellow square number two but above medium yellow square number one.

   - The small yellow square is to the left of the medium yellow circle.

2. **Block B Description**:
   - Contains a big blue triangle, a medium blue circle, and a small black square.
   - The medium blue circle is above and to the right of the small black square.
   - The small black square is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
   - The big blue triangle is below and near the medium blue circle.

Now we need to analyze each block to check the relative positioning of the objects:

- **In Block A**: 
  - The objects are only specified in a left-right arrangement. 
  - There is no indication of vertical arrangement, so we cannot definitively say one is above the other vertically.

- **In Block B**:
  - We know the medium blue circle is above the small black square, since it is specified to be above it.

Next, we consider the task:

- We are asked which object is above a small square. We have two small squares in the blocks:
  - The small yellow square (in Block A)
  - The small black square (in Block B)

Evaluating the positions relative to these squares in each block:

- For the **small yellow square**:
  - In Block A, there is no mention of a vertical arrangement with the medium yellow circle so it’s unclear.

- For the **small black square**:
  - In Block B, the medium blue circle is explicitly stated to be above it.

The conclusion is clear for Block B: the medium blue circle is above the small black square. Therefore, the medium blue circle is above a small square.

1. **Block A**: It contains one big black square. There is no mention of any other objects in block A, and it is located at the lowest level.

2. **Block B**: It is positioned above block A. It contains a big yellow square, a big black circle, and a small yellow triangle. According to the description:
   - The big black circle is above the small yellow triangle.
   - The big yellow square is positioned to the right of and below the big black circle.

3. **Block C**: It is located below block B and contains one small yellow square.

Spatially organizing these observations, we consider the vertical alignment:
- **Block A** is at the bottom with the big black square.
- **Block B** is above Block A, with:
  - The big black circle positioned above the small yellow triangle.
  - The big yellow square positioned to the right and below the big black circle.

- **Block C** is below block B with the small yellow square.

Given that block B is above block C, and block A is below block B, it is clear that:
- The big black circle in block B is directly above block C, while the big black square is in block A, below block B and therefore below block C as well.

Thus, of the two discussed, only the big black circle is positioned above the small yellow square in block C.

Therefore, the object that is above the small yellow square is:

Now, let's determine the final positions:

- In Block A, the big yellow triangle is indeed above the big black triangle. Therefore, the configuration in Block A meets the criteria of having an object above a big black triangle.

- For Block B, there is no relevant big black triangle in the block.

- For Block C, although it contains a big black triangle, it is not relevant here for a direct object above it (there is no specific object directly mentioned above).

Considering that only the setup in Block A includes an object above a big black triangle, and the small yellow square in Block B is not relevant to the big black triangle, the answer is related to the positioning within Block A.

The ""big object which is touching the right edge of a block"" is not clearly defined in the given prompt based on the positions described, but we need the object directly above the black triangle, which is the big yellow triangle in Block A. Therefore:

1. **Block A** contains the medium black square. According to the information, Block B is to the right of Block A.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains two medium blue squares and one medium yellow square.
   - Medium blue square number one is below medium yellow square.

3. **Block C:**

- Determine which objects are to the right of Block A.
- Block B is directly to the right of Block A.
- The question asks whether either a ""medium yellow square"" or a ""medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" is to the right of the black object.

Now, analyze Block B with this in mind:
- Block B has the two medium blue squares with no indication that they are touching the bottom edge.
- The medium yellow square in Block B is not at the bottom since it is above the medium blue squares.

No object in Block B fits the criterion “touching the bottom edge of a block” based on the information.

Let’s consider if the configuration in Block B could potentially feature a yellow square (based on existing conditions which likely could be incorrect configurations as we identify no bottoms) to the right:
- The problem doesn't specify whether anything in Block C is to the right of Block A. Given typical cardinal alignment based on A and B's relational statement, Block C is rather above A.

Therefore, reasoning through the spatial configuration, **neither** a medium yellow square nor a medium blue square (arguably touching the bottom edge) would align directly right aligning to Block B's criteria. Thus, neither condition (0 or 1 as keyed specifically) is satisfied:

1. **Block A Configuration**: 
   - Block A has three medium black squares: 
     - Medium black square number one (MBS1) is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
     - Medium black square number two (MBS2) is below medium black square number three (MBS3).
     - Therefore, the order from top to bottom in Block A is MBS3, MBS2, MBS1.

2. **Block B Configuration**: 
   - Block B contains one medium yellow square. 
   - There is no explicit mention of any other square in Block B, so the medium yellow square is presumably the only one occupying it.

3. **Block C Configuration**: 
   - Block C has one medium blue square and one medium black square.
   - The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of Block C, while the medium black square is above the medium blue square.

4. **Relative Positioning of Blocks**:
   - Block A is below Block B.
   - Block A is to the left of Block C.

To find what is below the medium yellow square in Block B:
- Since Block A is below Block B, the medium black squares in Block A are the potential candidates for being below the medium yellow square.
- In Block A, the order from bottom to top is MBS1 (touching the bottom edge), MBS2, and MBS3.
- Therefore, below the medium yellow square in Block B, the first square encountered is MBS3 at the fourth position from the top.

By these steps, the correct square below the medium yellow square is the medium black square number three (MBS3) from Block A.

- There are two blocks, A and B.
- Block A, which is to the left of Block B, contains:
  - A small blue circle 
  - A big black circle
- Block B contains:
  - A medium blue square
  - A small yellow triangle
  - A big yellow triangle

We know that:
- The medium blue square is near both the small yellow triangle and the big yellow triangle in Block B.

To interpret ""near,"" we can assume it refers to proximity rather than a strict left-right positioning. However, we are specifically looking for what is to the left of the big yellow triangle.

Since both the small yellow triangle and the medium blue square are near the big yellow triangle, either could potentially be near the left side of the big yellow triangle.

Importantly, Block A (where the small blue circle resides) is entirely to the left of Block B, and given that the blocks are not overlapping, the small blue circle cannot be in consideration when looking solely within Block B. 

Given a typical arrangement:
- If the medium blue square is positioned centrally, it could reasonably be near both yellow triangles.
- The small yellow triangle is more likely to be directly to the left of the big yellow triangle if the square is either below or above these triangles.

Since the problem specifies elements within Block B and does not overlap Block A's contents with this specific question, only the small yellow triangle is relevant within Block B.

Therefore, the item to the left of the big yellow triangle in Block B is the small yellow triangle.

The answer is based on typical spatial arrangements unless additional specific details or constraints are provided. Thus, the small yellow triangle is directly to the left of the big yellow triangle.

","To solve the problem, let's analyze the position of each block and the medium yellow squares within them:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains 1 medium yellow square.
   - No block is mentioned to the left of Block A, which implies there is no object to the left of its medium yellow square.

2. **Block B:**
   - Located to the right of Block A.
   - Contains 2 medium yellow squares, but this does not affect the question directly as it asks about squares from Blocks A and C.

3. **Block C:**
   - Located below Block B.
   - Contains 1 medium yellow square and 1 medium black square.
   - The medium black square is below the medium yellow square in Block C, implying the arrangement is vertical.
   - Since Block C is below Block B and not mentioned to be to the left of anything else, the medium yellow square in Block C does not have any object explicitly stated to be to its left in this description.

Now, considering the given information and the arrangement:

- The medium yellow square in Block A cannot have an object to its left because Block A is the most leftward block in this description.
- The medium yellow square in Block C is positioned below Block B, and no object is mentioned to the left of it either due to its vertical positioning below Block B.

Since neither medium yellow square in Block C nor Block A has an object described as being to its left, the correct answer is:

3) none of them

Thus, the concise answer is {3}."
412,"We have three blocks. Lets call them A, B and C. Block A is above B and block B is to the right of C. Block A contains one big blue square and a small yellow triangle.

","Let's analyze the placement of the blocks and their contents step by step:

1. **Block C** contains:
   - One big blue square.
   - One big black circle.
   - One medium yellow square.

   Here, it's specified that the big blue square is to the right of the big black circle and the medium yellow square. There is no object mentioned to be to the right of the black circle in Block C.

2. **Block B** contains:
   - A small yellow square touching the right edge of Block B.
   - One small yellow triangle.
   - One medium blue square.

   The small yellow square is on the right edge, and it is mentioned that it is to the right of and above the small yellow triangle. The medium blue square is stated to be above the small yellow triangle, but there's no information suggesting any object to the right of the medium blue square in Block B.

3. **Block A** contains:
   - One big blue square.
   - A small yellow triangle.

   It's stated that above and to the right of the small yellow triangle, there is the big blue square. However, this does not influence the situation in Block C regarding something being to the right of the black circle.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the right of a black thing. Since the black thing (big black circle) is only present in Block C and neither the small yellow square nor the medium blue square are mentioned in Block C, neither of these objects is to the right of the black circle.

Therefore, the concise form of the answer is {3}."

","To determine which object is to the left of a medium square, we need to understand the spatial arrangement of the blocks and the squares contained within them.

1. **Block Arrangement**: We are given that Block B is to the right of Block C and to the left of Block A. Thus, the order from left to right is C, B, A.

2. **Contents of Block A**: Block A contains one medium blue square.

3. **Contents of Block B**: Block B contains one medium yellow square.

4. **Contents of Block C**: Block C contains three medium black squares and one medium yellow square. 
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two. 
   - Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three.
   - The medium yellow square is below medium black square number two, or in other words, it is below medium black square number three and somewhat in the same line as medium black square number one.
   
5. **Geometric Arrangement in Block C**:
   - The vertical order is such that from top to bottom we have: 
     - Top: Medium black square number three
     - Middle: Medium black square number two
     - Bottom: Medium black square number one
   - The medium yellow square is beside medium black square number one, and under medium black square number two and medium black square number three.

6. **Question Clarification**: We need to determine which object is to the left of a medium square. Since no specific medium square color was defined in the question, I'll assume we are referring strictly to Block C's arrangement of medium black squares.

In Block C:
- Medium black square number one is lowest.
- Medium black square number two is in the middle.
- Medium black square number three is the highest.

Reviewing this:
- To the left of ""medium black square number one,"" considering vertical only (as there's no mention of horizontal alignment in Block C regarding square one or two), there is no specific reference to any object explicitly. The question's context limits our consideration primarily vertically.
- To the left of ""medium black square number two,"" similarly, we have no additional objects explicitly stated, meaning vertically prior leads to considering what previous positions or objects justified rethinking.

Hence, considering strictly positions without additional elements demarcated beyond Block C, detailed horizontally (lacking specific arrangement clarity otherwise left contextually interpreted), either medium black square number one or number two shouldn't directly have defined items to their left.

The closest conclusive answer is: 
- **None of them.**

In conclusion: 
Neither medium black square number one nor medium black square number two has an object to the left of them within constraints described.

The answer is therefore:

","To solve this problem, let's analyze the descriptions of Block A and Block B step by step:

Block A:
- Contains a small yellow square, a big black triangle, and a small black circle.
- The configuration involves the small black circle being to the right of the big black triangle and a small yellow triangle, with the small yellow square touching the right edge of the block.
- The big black triangle is above the small black circle.

Block B:
- Contains a big yellow circle and a small blue circle.
- The big yellow circle touches the right edge of this block and is positioned below the small blue circle.

Now, let's summarize the vertical position relationships for each block:

For Block A:
- The big black triangle is positioned above the small black circle. 
- Therefore, the small black circle is positioned below the big black triangle.

For Block B:
- The big yellow circle is positioned below the small blue circle.

The question asks which object is below a small circle: the big yellow circle or the small black circle.

Comparison:
- Block A: The small black circle sits below the big black triangle, but not directly below any ""small circle"" because it's the small circle itself.
- Block B: The big yellow circle sits below the small blue circle.

Thus, based on the description, the big yellow circle is the object that is directly below a small circle (the small blue circle) in Block B. The small black circle in Block A does not sit below another small circle.

Final Decision:
- The big yellow circle is below a small circle.

","To determine which medium square has something to its right, let's break down the arrangement of the blocks and squares:

1. **Block A:** Contains a medium black square. No information about any square to its right or left within the block.

2. **Block B:** 
   - To the left of Block A.
   - Contains a medium black square below a medium yellow square. 
   - Since Block A is to the right of Block B, Block A's medium black square is to the right of Block B's medium yellow square.

3. **Block C:** 
   - To the left of Block B.
   - Contains a medium blue square below a medium yellow square. 

Considering the horizontal arrangement of the blocks: 

- Block C is on the far left.
- Block B is in the middle.
- Block A is on the far right.

Given that, any squares in Block B will have squares in Block A to their right but squares in Block C will have squares in Block B to their right. Therefore, the medium yellow square in Block B has the medium black square from Block A to its right. 

Now let's match this understanding with the question:

- Does the medium yellow square in Block B have another square to its right? Yes, the medium black square from Block A is to the right of Block B's medium yellow square.
- Does the medium yellow square in Block C have another square to its right? Yes, the medium black square from Block B is to the right of Block C's medium yellow square.

Both medium yellow squares have a square to their right: the one in Block B has Block A’s black square to its right and the one in Block C has Block B’s black square to its right.

Thus, the answer to the question of which medium yellow square in the blocks has a square to its right is:

Now, let's analyze which object is below a medium yellow square:

- In **block B**, medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B and is below medium yellow square number two. Therefore, medium yellow square number two has medium yellow square number one below it.

     - Below it and to the left is a medium yellow square.
     - Medium blue square number one is below both medium blue square number two and the medium yellow square.

   This gives the arrangement:
   - Medium blue square (number two) on top.
   - Medium yellow square directly below medium blue square number two.
   - Medium blue square (number one) below both.

  - To the right of medium blue square number one in block B: medium yellow square in block B.
  - To the right of medium blue square number two (this is vertical, there isn't anything specifically 'to the right' but spatially above).

- The medium yellow square in block A: 
  - There is nothing specifically to the right of this square since blocks A and C are horizontally adjacent to block B.

3. **Position Analysis:**
   - The medium blue square from Block A is positioned vertically within Block A and does not interact horizontally with Blocks B or C.
   - In Block B, the medium blue square is above the medium black square within Block B and again does not reach horizontally over to Block C.
   - Given the spatial arrangement (Block B to the left of Block C), the medium black square in Block C would be to the right of the whole of Block B.

","Let's analyze the arrangement in the two blocks meticulously. 

### Block A Description:
1. **Medium Blue Square Number One**: It touches the bottom edge of Block A.
2. **Medium Blue Square Number Two**: 
   - Positioned above Medium Blue Square Number One.
   - To its direct bottom is a Medium Black Square.
3. **Medium Black Square**: 
   - Positioned below Medium Blue Square Number Two.
   - Above Medium Blue Square Number One due to the description.

### Block B Description:
1. **Medium Black Square Number One**: Below Medium Black Square Number Two.
2. **Medium Black Square Number Two**: Above Medium Black Square Number One.

### Objective:

Identify which object is to the right of a medium blue square: either ""medium black square number one"" or ""the medium black square that is in block A.""

### Analysis:
- **Block A** has two medium blue squares and a medium black square:
  - The only medium black square in this block is directly below medium blue square number two.
- **Block B**: It only contains black squares. The arrangement in Block B doesn't affect Block A in terms of being directly to the right of a square in Block A due to the spatial definition between distinct blocks.

### Conclusion:
Considering the positions in Block A and the absence of any direct horizontal relations between Squares from different Blocks, no square from Block B can be directly right of a medium blue square in Block A. The medium black square number one, which is entirely in Block B, cannot be directly right of any blue square positioned in block A according to the spatial assumptions given, since Block A and Block B are distinct.

Block A's medium black square is positioned vertically below a medium blue square (specifically blue square number two), and not to the right. 

Therefore, neither ""Medium Black Square Number One"" (which is in Block B) nor ""the Medium Black Square that is in Block A"" is to the right of the medium blue squares in their described configurations.

The correct response is: {3}, meaning none of them."

","To determine which medium black square is above a medium yellow square, let's analyze the arrangement of blocks and squares in each block:

- **Block A:**
  - Contains one medium yellow square and one medium black square.
  - The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block A, so it is positioned at the bottom of the block.
  - The medium black square is above the medium yellow square within this block.

- **Block B:**
  - Contains one medium black square.
  - There is no medium yellow square in Block B, so the medium black square in this block cannot be above a medium yellow square.

- **Block C:**
  - Contains one medium yellow square and one medium black square.
  - The medium yellow square is positioned at the bottom edge of Block C.
  - The medium black square is above the medium yellow square in this block.

Now, we have identified the following:
- In Block A, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square.
- In Block C, the medium black square is also above the medium yellow square.
- In Block B, there is no medium yellow square, so the medium black square in Block B is not above any medium yellow square.

Among the options provided:
0) The medium black square that is in Block B - This is incorrect because there is no yellow square in Block B.
1) The medium black square which is in Block A - This is correct because it is positioned above the medium yellow square in Block A.
2) Both of them - This is incorrect since only the medium black square in Block A fits the criteria.
3) None of them - This is incorrect as the medium black square in Block A is above a yellow square.

Thus, the medium black square in Block A is the one that is above a medium yellow square.

","To determine what is above the big yellow circle in block C, we need to analyze the positioning of the shapes in blocks A and B sequentially:

1. Block A:
   - It contains a small blue triangle and a medium yellow triangle.
   - The small blue triangle is to the left of the medium yellow triangle.
   - The medium yellow triangle is touching the right edge of the block.

2. Block B:
   - It contains a medium yellow circle, a medium black square, and a big yellow triangle.
   - The big yellow triangle is to the left of both the medium yellow circle and the medium black square.
   - The medium black square is to the left of the medium yellow circle.

3. Block C:
   - It contains a big yellow circle.
   - Block C is located below blocks B and A.

Considering the arrangements in block B, we have:
- Big yellow triangle (leftmost) -> Medium black square -> Medium yellow circle (rightmost)

Since block C is below blocks B and A:
- The big yellow circle in block C is directly below the medium yellow circle in block B.
- Directly left (above the same horizontal plane) of the medium yellow circle is the medium black square.
- Further left is the big yellow triangle.

Hence, directly above the big yellow circle in block C is the medium black square (not the big yellow triangle), since the arrangement of block B is key.

Therefore, the answer to what is directly above the big yellow circle in block C is:

","To solve this problem, let's analyze the positions of all relevant shapes per blocks:

1. **Block A**:

    - According to the description, below the medium yellow square, there is a medium blue square number one.
    - Medium blue square number two is also below the medium yellow square.

    - Block A is to the left of Blocks B and C.

2. **Block B**: 
    - It has one medium blue square.

3. **Block C**: 
    - This block contains one medium black square.

We are tasked with determining which object is to the left of a black shape - the medium blue square in block B or medium blue square number two from block A.

Since Block A is entirely to the left of both Blocks B and C, all shapes within Block A (including medium blue square number two) are to the left of anything in Block C, which contains the medium black square.

Therefore, medium blue square number two in Block A is to the left of the medium black square in Block C.

The medium blue square in Block B cannot be to the left of the black shape because Blocks B and C are in the same line unless specified otherwise.

In conclusion, only the medium blue square number two from block A is to the left of the black shape.

","Let's decode the given information step by step.

Start with Block A:

- Block A is to the left of Block B.
- Block A contains:
  - One medium blue circle.
  - One medium blue triangle.
  - One big yellow circle.
- Also, the medium blue circle is:
  - To the right of and above a small yellow circle.
  - Above and to the right of the big yellow circle.
- The big yellow circle is near to and below the small yellow circle.

This sets up a spatial arrangement for Block A, but without specific X-Y coordinates, only relative positioning is determined. Importantly, since this content relates to Block A, it has no immediate bearing on Block B other than the directionality (relative placement of block A to block B).

Now let's observe Block B:

- Block B contains two big blue circles.
  - Big blue circle number one is above and to the right of big blue circle number two, which is touching the bottom edge of this block.

Given these, we are looking to assess which objects from Block A could be to the left of any big blue circle from Block B.

Clarifying spatial relationships between Block A and Block B:

- The entire Block A is situated spatially to the left of Block B, so it is plausible for elements from Block A to be left of elements in Block B.
  
But to make it clear what the question intends:
- Since both the medium blue circle and the medium blue triangle are within Block A, both those elements are technically to the left of any component in Block B, including the big blue circles, just by virtue of the positioning of Blocks A and B.

Based on all of this, both the medium blue circle and the triangle from Block A are to the left of the big blue circles in Block B.

","To determine which object is to the left of a medium blue square, we need to examine the arrangement of the blocks and the squares within them. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Blocks Arrangement**: 
   - Block B is to the right of Block A.
   - Block B is above Block C.
   - This implies the following spatial arrangement: 
     - Block A is on the left.
     - Block B is to the right of Block A.
     - Block C is below Block B.

2. **Squares in Blocks**:
   - **Block A**: Contains both a medium yellow square and a medium blue square. The yellow square is at the bottom and below the blue square.
   - **Block B**: Contains a single medium blue square.
   - **Block C**: Contains one medium blue square and one medium black square, with the blue square above the black square.

3. **Medium Blue Squares**:
   - There is a medium blue square in Block A.
   - There is a medium blue square in Block B (though its position doesn't directly affect this question).
   - There is a medium blue square in Block C.

4. **Finding which medium blue square has an object to its left**:
   - The medium blue square in Block A is positioned above the medium yellow square in the same block. Since there is nothing else around Block A, there is no object to the left of this blue square.
   - **Block C**: It is placed below Block B. The medium blue square in Block C is to the right of Block A because Block A is directly to the left of Block B and Block C is below Block B. The blue square in Block A qualifies as being to the left of the blue square in block C because of the block's spatial arrangement.

Analyzing the spatial pieces of information, we conclude that:
- The medium blue square in Block C has the medium blue square in Block A to its left.

Therefore, the answer is that the medium blue square in Block A (option 0) is to the left of the medium blue square in Block C.

Block B has one medium yellow square. And block C has one medium blue square. A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of this block. It is below the medium blue square. Which object is to the left of a medium yellow square? the medium blue square or the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block??
0) the medium blue square 
1) the medium black square  that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, let's analyze the blocks and their respective contents:

- **Block A**:
  - Contains two medium black squares and one medium yellow square.
  - The first medium black square (number one) is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
  - The second medium black square (number two) is above medium black square number one.
  - The medium yellow square is above medium black square number one and at the same level as medium black square number two.

- **Block B**:
  - It contains one medium yellow square.
  - The relationship of this yellow square to Block A and Block C is not needed as Block B is specifically described.

- **Block C**:
  - Contains one medium blue square and one medium yellow square.
  - The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
  - The medium blue square is above the medium yellow square.

Now, based on the spatial arrangement:

1. The medium yellow square in Block A has the medium black square number one directly below it. Since squares within the same block align vertically, there is nothing to the left in terms of the squares belonging to Block A.

2. The medium yellow square in Block B does not merge or directly connect with the squares from Block A or C.

3. The medium yellow square in Block C is below the medium blue square. Since Block C is to the left of Block A, there are no overlapping horizontal alignments between the squares in Block C and the medium yellow square in Block B or the medium yellow square in Block A.

Therefore, the medium yellow square in question, whether from Block A, B, or C, mainly requires a horizontal comparison with items within its block and checking the arrangement across blocks. For identifying what is to the left of the yellow square based on the given problem setup, the medium blue square in Block C is to the left of any medium yellow square placed in Block A and B. However, square placement within each block does not horizontally overlap by default based on the description (blocks are left of each other).

Considering all positions and setups, both medium blue in Block C and the medium black square touching the bottom in Block A are candidates but more specifically, according to spatial constrains only direct precedence can be ensured vertically.

Thus, according to the analysis, directly to the left of the medium yellow square based on problem logic and fabrication, medium blue does seem most directly possible in narrative placement.

1. Contains two medium yellow squares: Yellow 1 and Yellow 2.
2. Contains one medium black square.
3. Medium yellow square number two has medium yellow square number one below it.
4. Medium black square is below yellow square number two.

Placement summary for Block A:
- At the top: Yellow 2
- In the middle: Yellow 1
- At the bottom: Black square

**Block B:**
1. Contains one medium yellow square and one medium black square.
2. Medium yellow square is below the medium black square.

Placement summary for Block B:
- At the top: Black square
- Below it: Yellow square

From the above placement, Block B is to the left of Block A. Thus, for any object in Block A, any object from Block B would be considered ""to the left.""

We are asked which object is to the left of a medium yellow square:
1. Medium yellow square number one (from Block A): This square is in Block A. The entire Block B is to its left, which contains a yellow square.
2. The medium yellow square that is in Block B: Since nothing is to the left of this yellow square (as it’s the left-most feature in Block B), there is no object directly to its left within the context of blocks.

Conclusion:
- For medium yellow square number one, the medium yellow square from Block B can be considered to its left (since Block B is entirely left of Block A).
- Nothing is directly left of the yellow square in Block B.

Therefore, the answer is that the medium yellow square in block B is to the left of medium yellow square number one.

   - The big yellow circle is near the small black triangle, and the medium blue triangle is to the right of the small black triangle.
   - The big yellow circle is to the left of the medium blue triangle.

From this information, we analyze:
- The medium blue circle in Block A is positioned ""below and to the right"" of the medium yellow square. Therefore, it is indeed to the right of the medium yellow square within Block A.
- Block B's elements (specifically the small black triangle) are separate from Block A and thus do not directly interact spatially with the elements of Block A for the purposes of answering what is immediately to the right of the medium yellow square within Block A.

Conclusion:
- Since the medium blue circle is specified as being ""below and to the right"" of the medium yellow square within the same Block A, the medium blue circle is indeed to the right of the medium yellow square, satisfying the query for Block A alone.

1. **Block A** contains:
   - Big black circle
   - Small black triangle
   - Small black square
   - Small yellow triangle
   - Big black square

The relationships in Block A are:
- The big black circle is above the small black triangle.
- The small black triangle is below and to the right of the small black square.
- The small black square is below the big black square.
- The big black square is to the left of the big black circle.

2. **Block B** is to the right of Block A and contains:
   - Medium black triangle
   - Small black circle
   - Small blue triangle
   - Big black triangle

The relationships in Block B are:
- The medium black triangle is to the right of the small blue triangle.
- The medium black triangle is below the small black circle.
- The big black triangle is above the small blue triangle.
- The big yellow triangle is near to and below the big black triangle.
- The medium black triangle is touching the bottom edge of Block B.

Now, focusing on the relationship between blocks:
- Block B is to the right of Block A, so the contents of Block B will be to the right of any contents of Block A.
  
Considering the objects in Block B:
- The small black circle is a part of Block B.
- The big yellow triangle is also part of Block B.

Thus, the big black circle in Block A is to the leftmost side of Block B, meaning to the right of the big black circle, in the perspective of Block B's contents, there can be a small black circle or a big yellow triangle depending on how the blocks are oriented next to each other.

The question asks what is directly to the right of the big black circle considering the relationship and logical positioning. By the arrangement given, to the immediate right of the big black circle would be the beginning part of Block B.

Thus, with no absolute spatial coordinates provided within the blocks indicating where objects align, and given that Block B is considered to the right of Block A, the first object likely to align to the right of Block A's big black circle would be the small black circle because it appears at the top of Block B.

","To determine what object is above a medium black square, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. Their relative positions are:
   - Block C is below Block B.
   - Block B is below Block A.

2. Details about each block:
   - **Block A** contains:
     - A big black triangle that is above.
     - A big yellow square that is below the triangle.
   - **Block B** contains:
     - A big black square.
   - **Block C** contains:
     - A medium black square touching the right edge of Block C.
     - A medium blue square, which is above and to the left of the medium blue circle.
     - A medium blue circle touching the right edge of Block C, below the medium black square.

3. We need to identify what object is above the medium black square:
   - The medium black square is on Block C.
   - Above the medium blue circle is the medium black square, meaning:
     - Positionally in Block C, the medium black square is above the medium blue circle.

4. Considering vertical positions across blocks:
   - Blocks are stacked: Block A (top), Block B (middle), Block C (bottom).
   - Therefore, any item in Block A is physically above any item in Block C.

5. Determining the vertical relationship of items:
   - The big black triangle in Block A is above all items in Blocks B and C due to its higher block position.
   - The medium blue circle is below the medium black square on Block C as mentioned.

Thus, the big black triangle is above the medium black square due to being in a higher block overall and by given positional descriptions in the blocks themselves.

The final answer is {0}, the big black triangle."

","To solve the problem, we need to understand the spatial arrangement of the objects in Blocks A and B.

1. **Block A Arrangement:**
   - Block A contains two medium yellow squares and one medium black square.
   - The arrangement in Block A is as follows:
     - At the top is medium yellow square number two.
     - Below medium yellow square number two is the medium black square.
     - Below the medium black square is medium yellow square number one.

2. **Block B Arrangement:**
   - Block B contains two medium blue squares.
   - The arrangement in Block B is as follows:
     - Medium blue square number two is at the top.
     - Below medium blue square number two is medium blue square number one, which is touching the bottom edge of the block.

3. **Relative Positioning:**
   - Block B is to the left of Block A according to the problem statement.

Based on this arrangement, let's address the question: **""Which object is to the right of a medium blue square?""**

4. **To the Right of Medium Blue Squares:**
   - Since Block B is to the left of Block A, any object in Block A will be to the right of objects in Block B.
   - Therefore, any object in Block A (including the black square and both medium yellow squares) is to the right of both medium blue squares in Block B.

Given these considerations, the object specifically to the right of a medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block B (medium blue square number one) would be the black square in Block A (since the block is directly to the right).

However, since both Block A objects (the black square and medium yellow square number one) are to the right of the medium blue square touching the bottom edge, technically, both qualify.

Conclusively, there are objects to the right of the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B).

","To determine what is to the right of the medium black square in Block A, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Block A contains:
   - A medium black square (let's call it Square A).
   - A small yellow triangle, which is touching the right edge of the block and is also below and to the right of Square A.
   - A medium blue circle, which is to the right of Square A.

2. Block B is to the right of Block A and its configuration does not affect the elements within Block A for the purpose of this question.

The specific question is: what is directly to the right of the medium black square (Square A) within Block A?

- The small yellow triangle is below and to the right of the medium black square, but since it is touching the right edge of Block A, it cannot be directly to the right of the square—only below to some extent.
- The medium blue circle is explicitly stated to be to the right of the medium black square.

Since the medium blue circle is directly to the right of the medium black square within Block A, and the small yellow triangle is not directly to the right because it is also below it, the correct answer is:

2. Contents of Block A:
   - Block A contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
   - The medium yellow square is positioned below the medium blue square within Block A.

3. Contents of Block B:
   - Block B contains three medium yellow squares.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number three.
   - Medium yellow square number three has medium yellow square number two below it.

   Given this information, the order of the yellow squares in Block B, from top to bottom, could be:
   - Top: Medium yellow square number three
   - Middle: Medium yellow square number two
   - Bottom: Medium yellow square number one

4. Determine the object to the left of a blue thing:
   - In Block A, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square.

5. The options are:
   - Medium yellow square number two
   - The medium yellow square that is in Block A

Since Block A is to the right of Block B, the medium yellow square in Block A is not to the left of the blue square in Block A. Therefore, only the elements in Block B are to the left.

Hence, medium yellow square number two, which is within Block B, is to the left of the blue square found in Block A.

","To determine which object is above a medium blue square, we need to analyze the position of the medium blue squares in blocks B and C.

1. **Analyzing Block B:**
   - Block B contains a medium blue square. 
   - There are no additional described objects in block B that could be above this medium blue square.

2. **Analyzing Block C:**
   - Block C contains:
     - A medium yellow square.
     - A medium black square.
     - A medium blue square.
   - It is noted that the medium yellow square is below the medium black square and the medium blue square.
   - The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

   Therefore, the structure within Block C can be described from top to bottom as:
   - Medium blue square (topmost)
   - Medium black square (directly below the medium blue)
   - Medium yellow square (bottommost)
   
   This indicates that both the medium black square and medium yellow square are beneath the medium blue square in block C, and hence, there is nothing above the medium blue square in block C.

Based on these analyses:
- In Block B, there is nothing above the medium blue square.
- In Block C, there is nothing above the medium blue square.

Thus, the answer is that there is no object above a medium blue square in either Block C or Block B.

3. **Block C**: Contains one big black square and one small black circle. The big black square is far from and to the left of the small black circle. Block C is to the left of Block B.

Now, we have to determine which object is far from the small black circle: the big yellow circle or the small blue square?

To understand this:
- The big black square in Block C is far from the small black circle, establishing a general ""far"" proximity condition.
- The small black circle is in Block C. 
- Block A is to the right of Block C (since Block C is to the left of Block B, and Block B is above Block A).

Since Blocks A and C are separate and Block A is to the right of Block C, both the big yellow circle and the small blue square (both in Block A) are far from the small black circle in Block C. Therefore, both objects are far in terms of the context provided.

","To determine which medium yellow square is to the left of a medium black square, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium blue square, a medium black square, and a medium yellow square.
   - The arrangement from bottom to top within Block A is:
     - Medium blue square
     - Medium black square
     - Medium yellow square
   
   This means within Block A, the medium yellow square is directly above the medium black square but still within the same vertical alignment as the other squares in Block A. 

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - These black squares are stacked such that medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

3. **Block C:**
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

We must now identify which medium yellow square is to the left of a medium black square:

- **Block A’s medium yellow square** is within the same block and vertically positioned above a medium black square directly below it.

- **Block B** has no medium yellow square since it contains only medium black squares. 

- **Block C's medium yellow square** is the sole square standing alone in Block C.

Considering the spatial configuration:

- **Block A (medium yellow square)**: It is placed vertically above its medium black square but will be horizontally organized with other blocks in mind.
  
- **Block C (medium yellow square)**: It stands independently and is to the right of Block B (which contains medium black squares).

Based on the horizontal positioning of blocks:

- Since Block A is to the left of Block B, the medium yellow square in Block A is spatially to the left of the blocks and thus to the left of any medium black square contained within Block B.

- Block C’s medium yellow square cannot be to the left of any medium black square since it is already to the right of Block B.

Conclusively, the medium yellow square in Block A is the only one positioned to the left of the medium black square in Block B.

- Medium Yellow Square (MYS) is above MBS1.
- Medium Blue Square (MBS) is below the MYS.
- Medium Black Square 2 (MBS2) is below the MYS.

From this information, it is clear that the MYS in Block A has MBS1 below it and MBS2 below it. The Medium Blue Square is also below the MYS according to the description (since it's in relation with the Medium Yellow Square's position).

The objects in Block A do not indicate any item being above the MYS in Block A.

**In Block C:**
- Medium Black Square (MBS) is touching the bottom edge.
- Medium Yellow Square (MYS) is above the MBS.

Here, the MYS in Block C has only the MBS below it. Since there are no other objects listed in Block C, nothing is placed above the MYS within this block.

**Conclusion:**
Analyzing both blocks where Medium Yellow Squares are present:
- In Block A, no objects are listed as being above the Medium Yellow Square.
- In Block C, there is also no object above the Medium Yellow Square.

   - Directly below the big black triangle (which touches the right edge) is the big blue triangle. 
   - The medium black triangle is also mentioned below the big black triangle, but it is under the medium blue circle.

Therefore, below the big black triangle touching the right edge, the first immediate shape encountered is the big blue triangle. However, the question asks for objects below in context to the options provided.

Given the specified conditions mentioned earlier:
- The medium black triangle is below and touching the bottom edge and positioned to the left.

Thus, there might be spatial constraints in which these shapes are placed, and specifically below the big black triangle, the medium black triangle is positioned but to the left in arrangements. Based on above:
- The medium blue circle is above the medium black triangle.

Concluding the spatial arrangement and looking at provided answer options based on direct placement:
- There is no medium blue circle below the big black triangle (since it is above the medium black triangle).
- The medium black triangle overlaps spatial relationships and positioning over the big blue triangle within framework of described arrangement.

Therefore, considering only vertical layering directly below based on specified alignment to sides (right edge, bottom edge):
- The Medium black triangle supports presence vertically below from described mentions in contacts relative placements — observed interpretatively tangled in description to left and attempting accuracy on spatial grounds.

","To solve this question, let's break down the arrangement step by step:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a small black square, one medium black square, and one medium blue triangle.
   - The small black square is positioned near to, to the left of, and above the medium black square.
   - This arrangement means the small black square is above and to the left of the medium black square.
   - The medium black square is in Block A.
   - The small black square (which is above the medium black square) is to the right of the medium blue triangle.

2. **Relative Position of the Objects in Block A:**
   - Medium blue triangle → Small black square is to the right of the medium blue triangle. Therefore, either:
     - Medium blue triangle, with both black squares further right; or
     - Medium blue triangle at the far left, small black square directly to the right, and medium black square further right.
   - Thus, the order from left to right is most logically:
     - Medium blue triangle, small black square, medium black square.

3. **Block B:**
   - Contains a small yellow square and a big black square, and a small black circle is above these.
   - The small yellow square is to the right of the big black square.

4. **Relative Position of Objects in Block B:**
   - The order from left to right is:
     - Big black square, small yellow square.
   - A small black circle is above both the big black square and the small yellow square.

5. **Identifying What is To the Right of the Medium Blue Triangle:**
   - From Block A's arrangement, directly to the right of the medium triangle is the small black square.
   - Further to the right within Block A is the medium black square.

6. **Condition: What is to the Right of the Medium Triangle?**
   - Only the medium black square is located immediately to the right of the medium blue triangle.

No big thing is mentioned in Block A, hence the big thing option corresponds only to something in Block B. Since we are evaluating based on what is directly to the right of the medium blue triangle in Block A, based solely on the provided conditions without crossing into Block B:

Thus, the item right next to the medium triangle is the medium black square.

Therefore, the answer is: {1}"

   - Contains a big blue triangle, a big yellow square, and a small yellow square.
   - According to the description, the big blue triangle is above, to the right of, and far from the big yellow square.

2. **Block B Content:**
   - Contains a big blue circle, a small blue circle, and a small black circle.
   - The small blue circle is near the small black circle.
   - The big blue circle is touching the bottom edge and is near and to the right of the small black circle.

3. **Relative Positions:**
   - The big blue triangle is stated to be ""to the right of"" the big yellow square within Block A.
   - There’s no clear statement connecting any objects from Block B with the big yellow square from Block A.
   - The statement about the small blue circle being near the small black circle does not involve any interaction or direct placement relative to the big yellow square.

Given the information that the big blue triangle is explicitly said to be to the right of the big yellow square and there's no given position of the small blue circle in relation to the big yellow square, the logical conclusion is that only the big blue triangle is to the right of the big yellow square.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is below a circle, let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C. 
2. Block A contains a small black circle.
3. Block B, which is below A, contains a small black square and a medium black square.
   - The small black square is below the medium black square in Block B.
4. Block C, to the right of A, contains:
   - A medium blue square that touches the right edge of Block C.
   - A small yellow square, which is below the medium blue square in Block C.

Now, let's determine the relative positioning in regards to the circle in Block A:

- Since Block B is directly below Block A, and it contains the small black square and the medium black square, these squares are directly below the small black circle in Block A.
- Block C is to the right of Block A. Therefore, its contents (medium blue square and small yellow square) are not vertically aligned with Block A. They are positioned horizontally to the side, so they do not lie below the circle in Block A.

Thus, the object below the circle in Block A is in Block B. Specifically, given the vertical arrangement, the medium black square is positioned above the small black square in Block B.

Therefore, the only object directly below the circle in Block A is the medium black square.

   - The medium blue square in Block A is to the right of and below the medium yellow square.
   - Block B has a small blue square and a medium black circle.
   - The small blue square in Block B is to the right of and below the medium black circle.

2. **Position of the triangle in Block C:**
   - Block C contains a medium black triangle.

3. **Relative positions of Blocks A, B, and C:**
   - Block C is below Block B and to the left of Block A.

4. **Determine what is to the right of the medium black triangle in Block C:**
   - Since Block C is below Block B and to the left of Block A, Block C is likely positioned as follows:
     - Block A would be on the right. 
     - Block B would be above Block C.

5. **Check for any object to the right of the triangle:**
   - The only objects in Blocks A and B that could potentially be to the right of the triangle in Block C are in Block A, as Block A is to the right of Block C.

6. **Objects to the right in Block A:**
   - The possible candidate in Block A that a) could be horizontally aligned with Block C and b) might fit the description is the medium blue square, given that items reside in distinct but adjacent block spaces.

   - Block B is to the left of Block C.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square.

4. **Analysis:**

   - In Block A, the medium blue square is not relevant to the current question, as no medium yellow square is next to it.
   
   - In Block B, there is a medium blue square directly above its medium yellow square. Thus, the medium yellow square in Block B is directly below but technically not to the right of the medium blue square.

   - In Block C, there are no medium blue squares. However, we need to assess the relative positioning from Block B to Block C.

   - Looking horizontally:
     - Block B's medium blue square could be aligned with spaces to its right where Block C is located. In Block C, the higher medium yellow square (medium yellow square number two) is positioned most likely in line with the Block B column considering their potential alignment.
     - Thus, medium yellow square number two in Block C is positioned to the right of the medium blue square in Block B.

1. **Block A Configuration**:
   - It contains a medium blue square and a medium yellow square.
   - The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.
   - Thus, Block A's vertical stack from top to bottom is: medium yellow, medium blue.

2. **Block B Configuration**:
   - It has a medium yellow square and a medium black square.
   - The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.
   - Thus, Block B's vertical stack from top to bottom is: medium yellow, medium black.

3. **Block C Configuration**:
   - It contains a medium black square and a medium blue square.
   - The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of the block, and the medium blue square is above it.
   - Thus, Block C's vertical stack from top to bottom is: medium blue, medium black.

Now, we place these blocks in a row from left to right as described:
- Block A is on the left.
- Block B is immediately to the right of Block A.
- Block C is immediately to the right of Block B.

4. **Analyzing Positions Relative to Medium Yellow Squares**:
   - In Block A, the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square, hence does not qualify as ""to the left.""
   - In Block B, since the block is not wider than one square width, there is no square ""to the left"" horizontally of the medium yellow square within this block.
   - In Block C, there is no medium yellow square.

Therefore, there are no medium blue squares to the left of any medium yellow square in any configuration, whether within a block or across blocks.

Additionally, all contents of Block C (medium yellow squares number two and one) are also to the right of Block A's medium blue square.

- **Medium blue square in Block B**: In Block B, the medium yellow square is located below the medium blue square, not to the right. Block C is positioned entirely to the right of Block B, so both medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one in Block C are to the right of the medium blue square in Block B.

- Block B is below Block A.

Let's consider the possible positions of the medium blue squares:

- The medium blue square in Block A is above everything in Block B. As Block B is to the left of Block C, neither medium yellow square in Block C is to the right of this blue square.

- The medium blue square in Block B is to the right of Block A but below it due to its placement.

3. Consider Block A: 
   - Block A contains one medium yellow square.

Now, we need to determine which object, the medium yellow square in block A or the medium yellow square in block B, is to the right of a medium blue square:

- Since Block C is to the left of Block B, the medium blue square in Block C has both the medium yellow square in Block A and the medium yellow square in Block B to its right, as both these squares belong to blocks situated to its right (Block B and A respectively).
- The medium blue squares in Block B specifically:
  - The medium blue square number one (bottommost) and the medium blue square number two (middle) has the medium yellow square of Block B above them (therefore, the medium yellow square can be said to the right of these specific blue squares at least partially due to the layout in a 3D typographical sense with layer overlap).
  - The medium yellow square in Block A is to the right of all the squares in Block B by virtue of Block A being to the right of Block B.

Conclusively, considering all medium blue squares, both the medium yellow squares (in Block A and Block B) are technically to the right of at least one medium blue square, given blocks' horizontal arrangements.

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium blue square, which is somewhere inside the block.
   - It also contains a medium yellow square that touches the bottom edge of this block. Since it is touching the bottom edge, and it is below the medium blue square, it lies at the bottom of block A.

2. **Block B:**
   - Is located to the left of block A.
   - Contains one medium black square.

3. **Block C:**
   - Is located to the right of block A.
   - Contains two medium black squares, where medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

Now, determine what is to the left of the yellow shape (medium yellow square in Block A at the bottom edge):

- The medium yellow square in block A is positioned at the bottom of Block A. 
- Directly to the left of this square's position is block B, which has a medium black square within it. 
- Block C, with its two black squares, is to the right of Block A, and thus cannot be directly to the left of anything in block A.

","To determine which object is to the left of a medium black square, we'll analyze the configuration of blocks A, B, and C.

1. **Block A**:
   - Block A has a medium blue square and a medium black square.
   - The medium black square is below the medium blue square.
   - Since block A is positioned to the left of block B and to the right of block C, its relative horizontal position needs to be considered.

2. **Block B**:
   - Block B contains only one medium black square.
   - There is no blue square in block B.

3. **Block C**:
   - Block C has two medium black squares. Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
   - Below medium black square number two, there is another object (not yet identified), and below this unidentified object is a medium blue square touching the bottom edge of the block.
   - The statement suggests that this unidentified object is also a medium black square, meaning there are effectively three objects vertically stacked: two medium black squares above and one medium blue square below them.

Now, let's evaluate which medium blue square could potentially be to the left of a medium black square:

- **For Block A**: The medium black square is below the medium blue square. There is no indication that the medium blue square in block A is to the left of another square horizontally; instead, it is vertically above its specific medium black square.

- **For Block C**: The medium blue square is at the bottom, vertically below two medium black squares and another object. Again, there is no claim of horizontal alignment stating it is to the left of a black square. Both black squares are stacked vertically, while the blue square is below them.

Since there is no explicit horizontal left placement of either medium blue square with respect to any medium black square, and since both blue squares only relate vertically within their given blocks, the answer is that neither blue square is to the left of a medium black square based on provided information.

   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and is also below medium yellow square number one.

Now, let's interpret these points:

- Medium yellow square number two has medium black square number one directly below it.
- Medium black square number two is below both medium yellow squares number one and number two.
- Medium black square number one lies below medium black square number two.

From the structure given, the placement can be visualized as:

- Medium yellow square number one: 
  - Below it is medium black square number two, followed further below by medium black square number one.
  
- Medium yellow square number two: 
  - Below it is medium black square number two followed by medium black square number one.

So, according to the problem description, medium black square number two is positioned underneath both medium yellow squares.

Finally, evaluating the options:
- 0) The medium black square in block A is not mentioned to be under any yellow square.
- 1) Medium black square number two is directly below both medium yellow squares.

Thus, medium black square number two is definitely below the yellow squares.

Hence, the answer is:

","To solve this problem, we need to determine the position of the blocks and the squares based on the provided description.

Firstly, we understand the positions of Blocks A, B, and C:

- Blocks A and C are to the left of Block B.
- Block A has a medium black square.
- Block B has three medium yellow squares.
- Block C has one medium black square.

Next, let's break down the description of the medium yellow squares in Block B:

- Block B has three medium yellow squares, denoted as number one, number two, and number three.
- Below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number three, there is medium yellow square number one. This implies that medium yellow square number one is below both number two and number three.
- Below medium yellow square number three, there is medium yellow square number two. 

From this, we infer the following arrangement in Block B:

- Medium yellow square number three is the topmost.
- Below medium yellow square number three is medium yellow square number two.
- Below both medium yellow squares number two and number three is medium yellow square number one.

This gives a vertical stack such that top to bottom in Block B is:
1. Medium yellow square number three
2. Medium yellow square number two
3. Medium yellow square number one

Now, considering the arrangement of Blocks A, B, and C:

- Since Block A and Block C both contain a medium black square, and they are both to the left of Block B, the black squares in Blocks A and C are to the left of all medium yellow squares in Block B.

Finally, we need to determine which medium yellow square is to the right of a medium black square. All yellow squares in Block B are to the right of the medium black squares in Blocks A and C. Since medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two (in a vertical stack), both medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two are to the right of a medium black square from Blocks A and C.

Thus, the correct answer is both of them, or option 2.

   - Below the medium yellow square is medium blue square number two.
   - Below the medium yellow square, medium blue square number two, and medium blue square number one is the medium black square.
   - Because of this detailed layering description, we can deduce that the sequence from top to bottom in Block B is:

     - Further below: medium blue square number one
     - At the bottom: medium black square

3. **Block C**: Contains one medium yellow square and is below Block B.

Now, addressing the question: ""Which object is above a medium yellow square? medium blue square number one or medium blue square number two?""

Given the arrangement in Block B:
- The medium blue square number two is directly below the medium yellow square.
- The medium blue square number one is further below medium blue square number two.

Considering this setup, medium blue square number two is directly below the medium yellow square but is immediately above nothing except the medium black square (due to its position as stated in the problem).

Hence, medium blue square number two is the one directly below the medium yellow square and no object is positioned above a medium yellow square since they specifically mention the one from Block C is the lowermost item.

Therefore, medium blue square number two is the only one directly below and not above the medium yellow square.

- Contains two medium blue squares: B1 and B2.
- Y1 is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
- Y2 is below B2.
- B1 is below B2.
- Both B1 and Y2 are above Y1.

1. (No square)
2. Medium blue square B2
3. Medium blue square B1
4. Medium yellow square Y2
5. Medium yellow square Y1

**Block B:**
- A single medium black square.
- A medium yellow square is below this medium black square.

**Block C:**
- Has a medium black square and a medium yellow square.
- The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

- Block B is to the right of Block A.
- Block C is to the right of Block B.

**Question:**
Which object is to the left of a medium black square:
0) The medium yellow square in Block C or
1) Medium yellow square number two

The medium yellow square in Block C (in Block C) is above the medium black square (within the same block), not to the side of any black square across blocks.

For medium yellow square number two (Y2) in Block A:
- Block A is to the left of both Block B and Block C.
- Therefore Y2 is actually to the left of the black squares in both Block B and Block C.

Since we're checking what's to the immediate left of a medium black square, and considering the continuous row of blocks horizontally, medium yellow square number two in Block A (Y2) is to the left of the black squares in Blocks B and C.

","To solve this problem, let's break down the positions of each shape in the blocks and determine what is touching the right edge of a block and what is to its left.

1. **Block A** has a medium blue triangle and a big blue square.
   - The triangle is above and near to the square within Block A.

2. **Block B** has a big blue circle and a small blue circle.
   - The big blue circle is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - The small blue circle is near to, to the right of, and below the small circle.

3. **Block C** contains a small yellow square and a big yellow square.
   - The small yellow square is near to the big yellow square within Block C.

Next, identify what is touching the right edge of a block:
- The big blue circle is touching the right edge of Block B.

Now, determine which items are to the left of the big blue circle:
- Within Block B, there is also a small blue circle.
- The question does not specify if any part of Block A or C can be directly to the left of items in Block B, but the arrangement we have:
  - Block A is to the left of Block B, but does not directly say the medium blue triangle is to the left of the big blue circle within Block B context.
  - Block C is above Block B and does not directly affect the horizontal alignment with Block B's right edge.

Finally, we see that only Block B elements impact the positioning to the left of what touches the right edge.

Let's check the options:
- The medium blue triangle in Block A is unlikely to be horizontally aligned or to the left of the big blue circle due to its position in Block A relative to Block B.
- The big yellow square in Block C exists in Block C and won't directly impact or align horizontally with the right edge of Block B.

Conclusion: Considering ""to the left"" within Block B only:
- The **right choice** is that no identifiable medium blue triangle or big yellow square is directly adjacent to the left of the big blue circle in Block B. The answer is **none of them**, since neither the medium blue triangle (from Block A) nor the big yellow square (from Block C) will directly align horizontally in Block B context.

2. **Medium Yellow Square Number Two**: 
   - It's below both a medium blue square and a medium black square.

3. **Medium Black Square**:
   - It's above medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two.
   - Specifically, directly above the medium blue square.

4. **Medium Blue Square**:
   - It's below the medium black square.
   - Therefore, the sequence from top to bottom becomes: Medium Black Square → Medium Blue Square → Medium Yellow Square Number Two → Medium Yellow Square Number One.

### Block B:

1. **Medium Blue Square**:
   - It is above a medium yellow square.

2. **Medium Yellow Square**:
   - Below the medium blue square.

- The task is to find out which object is to the left of a medium blue square.
- In Block A, the medium blue square has medium yellow square number two directly beneath it, while medium yellow square number one and the medium black square are below it as well.
- In Block B, the medium blue square has the medium yellow square directly below it.

Given that Block A is to the left of Block B, all contents of Block A are to the left of Block B's contents. Hence:

- Medium yellow square number two (in Block A) is to the left of the medium blue square in Block B.
- The medium yellow square that is in Block B is below its medium blue square, within the same block.

     - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.

3. Block C:
   - Located below block A.
   - Contains a medium black square.

Now, we need to evaluate which object is below a medium black square.

- The object that is touching the bottom edge of a block:
  - The object touching the bottom edge of block A is medium yellow square number one.
  - Below block A is block C, which has a medium black square touching its bottom edge.

- The medium yellow square in block B:
  - This square is above both medium black square number one and number two.

In block C, a medium black square touches the bottom edge of block C, but it wasn't mentioned to be above any objects. Therefore, it can't be concluded to be above anything.

Thus, evaluating these details, we find that the object at the bottom of block A (medium yellow square number one) does not have any medium black square directly above it within block A or B.

   - The small yellow square is near the big black square.
   - A small blue circle is below the small yellow square (nearest object to the big black square) and to the right of the big black square.

To solve the problem, we need to identify what is directly above the triangle in Block A.

- Since Block A is below Block C, objects in Block C may be directly above those in Block A.
- Within Block C:
  - The small yellow square is near the big black square.
  - The small blue circle is beneath the small yellow square and to the right of the big black square.

Positionally:
- The big black square is entirely above the triangle in Block A (since Block C is above Block A).
- The small blue circle cannot be positioned above the triangle because it is below the yellow square within Block C.

Now, assess if the medium circle in Block B is above the triangle:
- Block B has no direct relation in terms of vertical position to Block A other than being described as to the left. There is no information that states the medium circle in Block B is positioned vertically above Block A's triangle.

","To solve this problem, we must determine the spatial arrangement of the squares within the blocks and use this information to work through the puzzle. Let's go through the relevant details step by step:

1. **Block B Analysis:**
   - Block B contains two medium yellow squares and two medium blue squares.
   - The first medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of this block. Let's denote it as Y1.
   - We have medium blue square number two (denote it as B2) and below it is medium yellow square number two (denote it as Y2).
   - Below the same medium blue square number two (B2) and medium yellow square number two (Y2) lies medium blue square number one (B1).
   - We also know that below Y2 and B2 is Y1 (the yellow square touching the bottom).
   
   If we put this together, the arrangement in Block B from top to bottom is:
   - On one ""column"" or layer: B2 (top), then B1 (below B2)
   - On another ""column"" or position: Y2 (top), then Y1 (bottom and touching the block's bottom edge)

2. **Identification of the object below medium blue square number two (B2):**
   - Below B2, there are two points: B1 and Y2.
   - No single yellow square is below B2, because both Y2 is immediately below B2, and the stacking of the blocks indicates both B1 and Y1 are affected.

3. **Question:**
   - Which object is below a medium blue square (specifically B2)?
     - The potential answers differentiate between yellow square object numbers and positions within blocks.

After establishing these spatial relationships, we conclude: both Y2 and Y1 can be understood to be positioned below B2, depending on their multi-layered block relationships. But assuming direct below-cross-consideration:
- Medium yellow square number two (Y2) is immediately below B2 in its column.
- The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge (Y1) is also in the similar relation position, vertically aligned.

Thus, logically, neither a single square in relation is exactly in an issue exclusively - since multiple ""touch"" simultaneously in a layout. So, we realize answer option:
{0} or {1} is closest with understanding but potential spatial placement conflicts.

Thus, we conclude an ambiguity in proper judgment alignment needs clarity - this does not hurt conclusion given all structures possible factually correct unless specified else.

   - Block A: Contains a big black square.
   - Block B: Contains a small yellow triangle.
   - Block C: Contains several shapes: one medium yellow square, one big yellow triangle, one big blue triangle, one medium blue square, and one big black triangle.

2. **Position of Blocks:**
   - Block A is to the right of Block B and to the left of Block C.
   - Ordering from left to right: Block B, Block A, Block C.

3. **Position of Shapes in Block C:**
   - The medium yellow square touches the bottom edge of Block C.
   - The big black triangle touches the right edge of Block C.
   - The big blue triangle is located such that the big black triangle is to its right and below.
   - The medium yellow square is below and to the left of the medium blue square and to the left of the big black triangle.

4. **Determining the Small Shape and Its Relative Position:**
   - The small shape mentioned is the small yellow triangle in Block B.
   - Since the small yellow triangle is the only small shape and it is in Block B, we need to analyze what lies to the right of Block B.

5. **Shapes to the Right of the Small Yellow Triangle (Block B):**
   - Block A (to the right of Block B) has a big black square.
   - Block C (to the right of Block A) has several shapes, but specifically, it has a big yellow triangle. 

6. **Conclusion:**
   - To the direct right of the small yellow triangle in Block B is Block A with its big black square.
   - Further right, beyond Block A, is Block C with its big yellow triangle.
   - Therefore, to the right of the small yellow triangle, both the big black square (in Block A) and the big yellow triangle (in Block C) are present.

Thus, the answer to what is to the right of the small shape (small yellow triangle) is both the big black square and the big yellow triangle.

3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is below the medium black circle, let's analyze the given descriptions of blocks A and B step by step.

**Block A:**
- Contains a small black circle and a medium black circle.
- The small black circle is to the right of and near the medium black circle.

**Block B:**
- Contains a big blue triangle, a big blue circle, a small blue circle, a big yellow triangle, and a medium blue circle.
- The big blue triangle touches the bottom edge of the block.
- The big yellow triangle touches the right edge of this block.
- The medium blue circle is above the big blue triangle.
- The small blue circle is near to and to the right of the medium blue circle and is to the left of the big yellow triangle.

Now, we need to understand the relative position of block A to block B since the problem explicitly says ""Below block A we have block B,"" meaning block B is directly below block A.

**Relative Vertical Position:**
- Since block B is directly below block A, any item in block A is directly vertically above the corresponding area in block B. Therefore, to determine what is directly below the medium black circle, we focus on the Y-axis: the vertical alignment of elements.

**Analysis:**
1. Since the small black circle is to the right of the medium black circle in block A, and it states that block B is below block A:
   - The given structure would carry the small black circle's vertical axis over part of block B's elements, not directly aligning with the original vertical position of the medium black circle since their relative positioning is already stated as apart (near but to the right).
   
2. Given that the big yellow triangle in block B is touching the right edge and that in block A, the location of the circles doesn’t specifically tie either to an edge, it's unlikely for the medium black circle in A to align directly over the big yellow triangle in B on an X-axis alignment due to their designations.

Therefore, checking only vertically based on the described arrangement, neither the yellow object touching the right edge of block B nor the small black circle in block A would be directly below the medium black circle in block A based on their given positions and descriptions.

The conclusion leads us to choose: 
- None of the stated options directly aligns vertically under the medium black circle from block A's arrangement to block B's positioning.

Final answer: `{3}`"
3570,"We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block A is to the left of blocks C and B. Block A has a medium black square. Block B has a medium blue square, a medium black square and one medium yellow square. The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

Which object is to the right of a medium black square? the medium black square that is in block C or the medium black square that is in block B??
0) the medium black square  that is in block C
1) the medium black square  that is in block B
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem, let's understand the positions of the blocks and the squares within each block:

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains one medium black square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains three medium squares: black, blue, and yellow.
   - The medium black square is positioned below the medium yellow square.
   - The medium blue square is at the bottom, below both the yellow and the black squares.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains one medium black square.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions of objects relative to the medium black squares in Block C and Block B:

- **For the medium black square in Block C**: 
  Since Block C contains only one square, the medium black square, there are no other squares or objects within this block that could be to the right of the medium black square in Block C.

- **For the medium black square in Block B**: 
  Within Block B, the medium black square is above the medium blue square and below the medium yellow square. Thus, within Block B, there is indeed something to the right of the medium black square, which is the yellow square.

Considering the entire setup where Block A is to the left of both Blocks C and B, and assuming that the entire assembly is horizontal from left to right, with A on the far left and B and C to its right, the relative horizontal positions are:

- Block A is to the left of both Blocks C and B.
- The problem does not mention any specific relative positions between B and C, so we cannot definitively say which of B or C is to the right of the other.

Now focusing just on the blocks:

- Block C’s medium black square has no other squares to the right within the block.
- Block B’s arrangement implies that within the block itself, there are squares (specifically the yellow square) that are above and can be conceptually considered ""to the right"" when unfolded in a vertical stack logic.

Thus, the answer is specifically regarding Block B having a complementary layout where internally there’s a hierarchical logic of arrangement since no specific adversarial layout has been provided.

Concluding, no external block is considered, and Block B is verified due to internal layout even in cases of different alignments providing its internal vertical re-interpretation, as logistical likelihood prevails.

Therefore, the correct answer is: {1}."
2470,"Two big black triangles are in a block. It also has one medium blue square. It is to the right of big black triangle number two. It is to the left of and below a medium blue circle.

The medium blue circle is touching the right edge of this block. What is to the left of the circle? a big black triangle or a medium blue square which is touching the bottom edge of a block??
0) big black triangle 
1) medium blue square  which is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this, let's piece together the placement details provided in the block:

1. We have two big black triangles, labeled as triangle 1 and triangle 2. The order suggests they are consecutive but does not specify exact positions yet.
2. There is one medium blue square, described as being to the right of big black triangle number two.
3. A medium blue circle is positioned to the right of the medium blue square and is touching the right edge of the block.
4. Additionally, this medium blue circle is specified to be above the big blue triangle.
5. Big black triangle number one is described to be to the left of and below this medium blue circle.

From these clues:

- The medium blue square is to the left of the medium blue circle due to the arrangement:
  - Given the circle touches the right edge, the square must be placed to its left as the circle cannot move further right.
- The square is below the circle vertically.
- The big black triangle can only be in these positions based on spatial arrangement:
  - The positioning must ensure that triangle 1 is below the medium blue circle and to the left. This places it in the same or adjacent vertical column as the square but not directly above the square.
  - Triangle 2 is left of the square since the square is defined as to the right of triangle 2.

The question asks what is directly to the left of the circle. Given:

- The arrangement positions both a medium blue square and a potential part of the big black triangle directly to the left of the circle.

Considering the only logical arrangement of objects and their specified positions, both the medium blue square and potentially the black triangles (depending on the exact position) are adjacent horizontally, but the more immediate and definitive fit is the medium blue square, as outlined to the right of triangle 2:

There is adequate information showing the medium blue square must be directly to the left (and at the bottom) near the edge of the block where the circle touches.

Thus, the answer must reflect the arrangement specific to this observation:

","To determine which medium yellow square is below a medium black square, let's analyze the details provided for each block and their arrangements:

1. **Block A:**
   - There are two medium yellow squares: number one and number two.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
   - Medium yellow square number one is described as touching the bottom edge of block A.
   - A medium blue square is above the medium yellow squares.
   - There is no mention of any black square within block A.

2. **Block B:**
   - Located above block A.
   - Contains two medium black squares: number one and number two.
   - Both medium black square number one and medium black square number two are below a medium yellow square present in block B.
   - Arrangement: Medium yellow square (in block B) > Medium black square number two > Medium black square number one.

3. **Block C:**
   - Located below block A.
   - Contains one medium black square.
   - No other specific details on the arrangement within block C or any association with yellow squares.

Based on the information about the blocks and the arrangement of squares:

- In Block A, the medium yellow square that touches the bottom edge (medium yellow square number one) cannot be below a black square since:
  - Block A does not contain any black squares.
  - Block C, which is below block A, contains a black square, but the yellow square in block A does not extend into Block C.

- In Block B, the medium yellow square is above both black squares. Therefore, the medium yellow square in block B is indeed above the black squares, making it effectively below none of them.

Hence, considering the placement in each block:

- The medium yellow square that is in block B is above the black squares in block B.
- The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of block A (and is also located above block C) does not sit below any medium black squares since it is in Block A, which has no black squares, and there is no indication that it extends into Block C.

Given these observations, the correct response is that neither of the medium yellow squares is located below a medium black square. Thus, the correct option is:

2. **Block B** is to the right of Block A and contains:
   - A big yellow circle
   - A medium blue square
   - A small black circle
   - A medium black circle

   - The big yellow circle is below the small black circle and the medium blue square.

3. **Block C** is to the right of Block B and contains:
   - A small blue circle

We are asked what is to the left of the small blue circle in Block C.

Since Block C only contains a small blue circle and is to the right of Block B, it cannot contain any elements from Blocks A or B.

- The small black triangle is located in Block A.
- The small black circle is located in Block B.

Therefore, neither the small black circle nor the small black triangle is in Block C. Nothing is included to the left of the small blue circle in Block C from Block A or Block B, implying that neither the small black circle nor the small black triangle is to the left of the small blue circle.

1. **Block A Configuration:**
   - There are two medium blue squares in Block A. Let's label them as MB1 and MB2 for medium blue square number one and number two, respectively.
   - MB1 is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - There is a medium yellow square (let's call it MY) above MB1.
   - MB2 is described as ""below a medium yellow square.""
   - MB1 is defined as being ""below the medium yellow square and medium blue square number two.""

   Therefore, the arrangement in Block A from top to bottom is:
   - MY
   - MB2
   - MB1

2. **Block B Configuration:**
   - Block B contains one medium blue square. Let's call it MBB.

3. **Block C Configuration:**
   - Block C is to the right of Block B and below Block A.
   - It contains one medium blue square, which we'll call MBC.

The question specifically asks: ""Which object is above a medium blue square? medium blue square number two or the medium blue square that is in block B?""

- **MB2 is above MB1** (as derived from the arrangement in Block A), so MB2 is above a medium blue square (namely MB1).
- **MBB is not above any other square**, as it is the only square in Block B.

Given this analysis, the answer is:

Medium blue square number two (MB2) is above another medium blue square (MB1), whereas the medium blue square in Block B is not above any medium blue square.

","To determine what is to the left of the yellow shape, we need to carefully analyze the arrangement of the blocks and the placement of the shapes within them.

1. **Understanding Block C**:
   - Block C contains two small blue circles and one small black circle.
   - The configuration mentions small blue circle number two has a small black circle to its left.
   - Below small blue circle number two is small blue circle number one.
   - Since the small black circle is above the blue shape which is below small blue circle number two, it confirms the black circle is above small blue circle number one.

   Therefore, in block C, the layout from left to right is: 
   - Small black circle, small blue circle number two, small blue circle number one (below number two).

2. **Understanding Block B**:
   - Block B contains a medium blue square.
   - Above the medium blue square, there is a medium blue circle.
   - A medium black circle is to the right of and above the medium blue square.

3. **Order of Blocks (Left to Right)**:
   - Block B is to the left of Block C and Block C is to the left of Block A.

Given the above order: Block B -> Block C -> Block A.
- Block B has a medium blue circle (above the medium blue square).
- Block C has small blue circles and a black circle.

4. **Determine What's to the Left of the Yellow Shape (Block A)**:
   - To the left of Block A is Block C, which contains no medium blue circles (only small ones).
   - Therefore, the medium blue circle from Block B is the medium blue shape before reaching Block A, as block B's medium blue circle precedes the sequence.

Considering all points, the correct answer is:

2. **Medium Blue Circle**: It is ""touching the bottom edge of this block"" and ""below, near to and to the right of the big black circle.""

3. **Small Black Circle**: The description directly states that it is ""above the big black circle.""

- The small black circle is ""above the big black circle.""
- The small yellow square is ""to the right of, near to, and above the big black circle"" and ""touching the right edge of this block.""
- The medium blue circle is positioned below and right of the big black circle and touches the bottom edge.

Consequently:
- Since the small yellow square is described as above the big black circle and the small black circle is above the big black circle, the small yellow square could potentially be above the small black circle as well, considering it is positioned to the right and above the big black circle.
- The medium blue circle, touching the bottom edge, is lower in position compared to the other objects.

Thus, the small yellow square is above the small black circle, due to its higher and more rightward placement on Block A.

Hence, the object that is above the small black circle is the small yellow square that touches the right edge of a block.

     - Medium black square 2 is above medium black square 1.
   - Contains a medium blue square:

3. **Block C:**
   - Below Block A.
   - Contains 1 medium yellow square.

The key is to find which of the specified squares (within blocks A, B, and C) are to the right of any medium black square:

- **Within Block A:**
  - Two medium black squares are present. Since both are aligned vertically, neither is left or right of the other.
  - The medium blue square is directly below medium black square 2, within the same vertical alignment as the medium black squares.
  
- **With Blocks Positioned:**
  - Block B's black square will be to the right of anything in Block A.
  - Block C is below Block A, but as Block A has its components vertically arranged, it wouldn't affect their left-right relationship.

From the setup:
- The medium blue square is part of Block A and is thus found below the medium black squares in Block A.
- Given block configuration does not allow the medium yellow square (in Block C) to be positioned to the right (horizontally) of any medium black square in either A or B. Block C is entirely below Block A.

- In Block A, we have a medium blue triangle. 

- Given the relationship in Block A, the small yellow square is positioned above the big black square.

However, the issue is about a medium blue shape and therefore the medium blue circle in Block B should also be considered:
- In Block B, we have a medium blue circle.

Since the medium blue circle is in Block B, and all objects in Block A are above all objects in Block B (as all of Block A is above Block B), thus:

- Both the small yellow square and the medium black triangle in Block A are indeed above the medium blue circle in Block B.

Now, we need to determine which object is above a yellow square from the options given:

- **Triangle touching the bottom edge of a block:** This is the big blue triangle in block B. We note that medium yellow square number two is above this big blue triangle, thus aligning with the condition of a triangle below a yellow square.

- **Big blue square:** In block B, it is above and to the right of the big blue triangle. It is not explicitly mentioned to be above a yellow square (except for the potential overlap with medium yellow square number one).

Given these observations:
- The big blue triangle is directly below medium yellow square number two in block B. Hence, it satisfies the condition of a triangle being below a yellow square.
- While the big blue square could incidentally be above a yellow square (medium yellow square number one), the information points more clearly towards the triangle's positioning as specifically fulfilling the condition without requiring extra assumptions not directly stated.

Therefore, with the details provided, the clear answer is that the triangle touching the bottom edge of block B is under a medium yellow square, making it above such a square.

","To determine which object is below a medium black square, we need to carefully analyze the description given:

1. **Block A Details:**
   - Contains two medium blue squares: 
     - Medium blue square number one (below medium blue square number two).
     - Medium blue square number two (above medium blue square number one).

2. **Block B Details:**
   - Is above Block A.
   - Contains three medium black squares:
     - Medium black square number one.
     - Medium black square number two.
     - Medium black square number three.
   
3. **Positioning Details:**
   - A medium blue square is mentioned as being below all three medium black squares (number one, two, and three).

**Analysis of Options:**

- **Option 0:** The medium blue square that is in Block B.
  - According to the question, this blue square is below all three medium black squares in Block B, as per the statement about a medium blue square being below all three black squares. This makes sense if this medium blue square is at the bottom of Block B because other blocks don't have black squares above them.

- **Option 1:** Medium blue square number two (in Block A).
  - Medium blue square number two is in Block A, which is below Block B. It is above medium blue square number one in Block A. Since Block A is entirely below Block B, none of the medium blue squares in Block A can be directly below the medium black squares in Block B based solely on their vertical stacking relationship starting from Block B on top.

Given that Block B is above Block A and the only way the description that a medium blue square is below all medium black squares can hold, a valid option is found in Block B's internal arrangement where a blue square might be designed to be below the black ones sequentially if structurally allowed.

Thus, the correct object that is below a medium black square is:

","Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Identify Squares in Each Block:**
   - **Block A:** Contains a medium yellow square.
   - **Block B:** Positioned above Block A and contains another medium yellow square.
   - **Block C:** To the left of Block B. Contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square.

2. **Positioning of Squares in Block C:**
   - The mediums are arranged as follows:
     - There is a medium black square.
     - Below the medium yellow square (likely from either Blocks A or B hence Block C is vertically aligned with either Blocks A or B), and the medium black square is medium blue square number two.
     - Below medium blue square number two and the medium black square is medium blue square number one.

3. **Determining the Blocks and Colors:**
   - Block C has one yellow square mentioned as ""below a medium yellow square,"" suggesting vertical alignment with a yellow square in either Blocks A or B.
   - Since Block C is written as containing one black and two blue squares, none of these squares are yellow.

4. **Identify Medium Yellow Squares:**
   - There is no medium yellow square directly inside Block C. However, Block C is just positioned to the left of a medium yellow square (either in Blocks A or B).
   - The task is to determine which block’s yellow square has an object directly to its left.

5. **Conclusion of Positioning:**
   - **Block B's yellow square:** Block C is to the left of Block B. Since Block C only contains blue and black squares, nothing yellow is inside Block C, and Block B is directly next to Block C, logically Block B's yellow is aligned with Block C.
   - **Block A's yellow square:** Block A is below Block B, meaning nothing aligns directly to its left compared to Block C's horizontal positioning to Block B.

Thus, **Block B's yellow square** has Block C just to the left and aligns horizontally (since Block C is described to the left of Block B). No object mentioned is directly to the left of Block A's yellow square considering horizontal alignment logic.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Block C is directly to the left of the **medium yellow square in Block B**.

   - Block B: Contains a small yellow square. There is also a medium blue circle to the right of and far from the small yellow square.
   - Block C: Contains a medium yellow circle.

2. **Relative Positioning:**
   - Block C is to the left of both Block A and Block B.
   - We are asked to determine which object is to the right of the medium yellow circle located in Block C.

3. **Objects in Blocks:**
   - In Block C: Medium Yellow Circle.
   - In Block B: Small Yellow Square.
   - In Block A: Big Black Triangle (the largest shape).

4. **Primary Question:**
   ""Which object is to the right of a medium yellow circle?""

   - Since Block C, which contains the medium yellow circle, is to the left of both Block A and Block B, every object in Block A or B is to the right of the medium yellow circle.
   - Both the big black triangle in Block A and the small yellow square in Block B are to the right of the medium yellow circle because both Blocks A and B are to the right of Block C.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Since both the big black triangle (Block A) and the small yellow square (Block B) are to the right of Block C (containing the medium yellow circle), the correct answer is that both objects are to the right of the medium yellow circle.

   - It doesn't mention any other square or object being positioned below this medium blue square in Block B based on the description. 
   - Therefore, nothing is below the medium blue square in Block B.

2. **Block C:**
   - Block C contains three medium blue squares (numbered 1, 2, and 3) and one medium yellow square.
   - Medium blue square number one is positioned below medium blue square number two and the medium yellow square. 
   - The medium yellow square is below medium blue square number three.
   - The hierarchy in block C can be summarized as:
     - Medium blue square 3 is at the top.
     - Below medium blue square 3 is the medium yellow square.
     - Below medium yellow square and medium blue square 3 is medium blue square 2.
     - Finally, below medium blue square 2 and the medium yellow square is medium blue square 1.

Considering these points, in Block C:
- There is no mention of any object being below the medium blue square in block B.
- Medium blue square number 1 in Block C is below medium blue square number 2.
  
Thus, medium blue square number 2 has medium blue square number 1 below it, fulfilling the condition of having another object below it.

2. **Block B:** Positioned above Block A, contains one medium blue square.
3. **Block C:** Positioned to the left of Block A, contains:
    - A medium black square touching the bottom edge of Block C.
    - A medium blue square directly above the medium black square in Block C.
    - A medium yellow square directly above the medium blue square in Block C.

Now, we need to determine which object is directly above a medium black square.

- In **Block A,** there is no square above the medium black square (because it only contains one square).
- In **Block C,** the arrangement is:
  - The medium black square is at the bottom.
  - Directly above the medium black square in Block C is the medium blue square.

- In **Block B,** the medium blue square is above Block A and is not positioned directly above a medium black square in Block B.

Therefore, analyzing the positions:
- The medium blue square in Block C is above the medium black square.
- The medium blue square in Block B is not above a medium black square.

   - A small black square
   - A small black triangle. The small black triangle is to the right of and below the small black square.

3. **Block C** is below Block B and contains:
   - A medium blue circle.

Now, we need to figure out if either the small blue circle or the small blue triangle is above any blue circle. The only other blue circle in this context is the medium blue circle in Block C.

- The small blue circle in Block A is positioned in the topmost block and directly above Block C, logically and spatially, even though it's primarily below the yellow circle. Thus, it is above the medium blue circle in Block C.

- The small blue triangle in Block A touches the bottom edge of Block A. Consequently, it is still within Block A and does not physically position itself above another blue circle since Block C is two levels below.

Based on this analysis:
- The small blue circle in Block A is above the medium blue circle in Block C.

     - **Medium yellow square number two**: Above medium yellow square number one, so it's not touching the bottom of the block.

3. **Block C**:
   - Located below Block A and above Block B.
   - Contains one medium black square.

Now, let's identify the key relationships:

- We know that Block C's black square is below a medium yellow square within Block C. 
- Block B's medium yellow number one is on the bottom of Block B, implying it is below all other shapes in Blocks A and C.
- Block B's medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one, so it is not the lowest in the context of all blocks.

Given this setup:

- In Block A, the medium black square does not have any square below it within Block A.
- In Block B, nothing is directly below Block B's squares in the context of the total configuration of objects.
- In Block C, the medium black square is explicitly stated to be below a medium yellow square within the same block.

Thus, Block C contains a configuration visually resembling:
- A medium yellow square (above)
- A medium black square (below)

The question asks: ""Which object is below a medium black square?"" 

Here are the options:
- **Medium yellow square number two** (Block B): This square cannot be below a medium black square because it is in a different block and it is stated to be above medium yellow square number one in Block B.
- **The medium yellow square that is in Block C**: This square is definitely above the medium black square as explicitly stated within Block C.

Therefore, neither medium yellow square number two nor Block C’s yellow square is positioned below a medium black square when considering all the blocks. The configuration implies none of them are below a medium black square across the entire layout.

   - Contains two medium blue squares (let's call them Blue C1 and Blue C2) where Blue C1 is below Blue C2.

Given the information above, the task is to determine which yellow square is above a medium blue square. 

- In Block A, Yellow A is above Blue A1, which confirms it is in fact above a medium blue square.
- In Block B, as there are no blue squares, Yellow B is not above any medium blue square.

Thus, only the medium yellow square in Block A is above a medium blue square. The answer is option 1.

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the arrangement of squares in both blocks A and B:

**Block A:**
- Contains a medium black square and a medium blue square.
- The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
- The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

Putting this together, we can visualize Block A as follows:
1. Top position: Medium blue square
2. Bottom position: Medium black square

**Block B:**
- Contains two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
- Medium black square number one (let's call it MB1) is below medium black square number two (MB2).
- The medium blue square is below MB2 but above MB1.

Hence, Block B can be arranged as follows:
1. Top position: Medium black square number two (MB2)
2. Middle position: Medium blue square
3. Bottom position: Medium black square number one (MB1)

Based on the arrangement:

- For Block A, to the right of the medium black square (bottom position) is nothing since there are no squares aligned horizontally with it in Block A.
- For Block B, to the right of medium black square number one (bottom position) is the medium blue square because the medium blue square is directly above medium black square number one.

Therefore, the medium blue square that is to the right of a medium black square is the one in Block B.

  - A big blue square, which is touching the right edge of Block A.
  - A big yellow circle, which is positioned above the big blue square.
  - A medium black circle, also above the big blue square and next to the big yellow circle.
  
- Block B is below Block C and to the left of Block A. Block B contains:
  - A medium blue triangle.

- Block C contains:
  - A medium blue square, which is below and touching a big yellow square.
  - The big yellow square is to the left of a small blue triangle.

Now, let's analyze the question: ""What is above the medium blue triangle?"" given the options.

The medium blue triangle is in Block B. Block B is below Block C, which means the contents of Block C can be ""above"" the medium blue triangle in Block B.

The big yellow square is present in Block C above the medium blue square, and therefore, it is above the medium blue triangle in Block B.

The big blue square which touches the right edge is in Block A. Block B is to the left of Block A, hence the big blue square is not directly above the medium blue triangle in Block B.

Thus, the big yellow square in Block C is above the medium blue triangle in Block B.

Based on the options:
0) big blue square which is touching the right edge of a block

   - Block A is below Block B.

2. **Contents of Each Block:**
   - **Block A:** Contains one medium yellow square.
   - **Block B:** Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium black square.
     - Medium yellow square number one (MYS1) is at the bottom edge of this block.
     - Medium yellow square number two (MYS2) is positioned somewhere above MYS1.
     - The medium black square is below MYS2, suggesting MYS2 is above the black square.
   - **Block C:** Contains one medium yellow square.

3. **Task Analysis:**
   - We need to determine which object is to the left of a medium yellow square between the medium yellow square in block C and MYS2.

   **Considerations:**
   - The medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of Block A (since Block C is to the left of A), which indirectly makes it to the left of both medium yellow squares in Block B through the vertical relationship (Block A being below Block B).
   - There is no information that places another object specifically to the left of MYS2 within Block B.

Since Block C, containing the medium yellow square, is directly positioned to the left of Block A and ultimately Block B, the medium yellow square in Block C is consequently to the left of MYS2 by virtue of the block arrangement.

So, the object accurately positioned to the left of MYS2 is the medium yellow square in Block C.

   - Block C is to the left of Block A.

2. Considering the geometric relationships:
   - Block C has a big yellow circle that is touching its right edge.
   - Block A has a medium yellow triangle.
   - Block B has a medium black circle.

3. The description further clarifies:
   - To the left of the big yellow circle in Block C, there's a small blue circle.
   - Below and to the left of the big yellow circle is a medium black circle, indicating this could be on Block B since B has a medium black circle.
   - Furthermore, the big blue triangle is mentioned to be below the circle to the left of the big yellow circle, which implies the big blue triangle is under Block C.

4. Additionally, it mentions that right to the black circle that is right of the small blue circle is the big blue triangle:
   - The medium black circle in Block B sits left to the big blue triangle indicating spatial organization, aligning with clues between Blocks B and C.
   - The medium black circle is to the right of the small blue circle, suggesting its orientation around Block C's contents.

5. We determine what object is to the left of the medium yellow triangle:
   - The medium yellow triangle is within Block A.
   - A potential candidate could be the left neighbor block, which is Block C as per positioning.
   - The big yellow circle in Block C is indeed touching the right edge and acts as the immediate left object to A's medium yellow triangle.

Hence, combining these deductions confirms that the big yellow circle touching the right edge of Block C is to the left of the medium yellow triangle in Block A.

   - The second medium black square is above the first medium black square.
3. Block C is to the right of Block A and contains:
   - A medium blue square.
   - A medium black square below the medium blue square.

Now, we need to identify which object is to the left of a medium black square.

- In Block A, there is only a medium blue square, which doesn't have any medium black square in the same block to be to its right.
- In Block C, the medium blue square is above the medium black square, so the blue square is not to the left of the black square either.

- Block B contains one medium black square, with no additional detail on its orientation within its block other than it being in Block B.
- Block C contains a medium blue square, which is irrelevant to our specific question about black squares.
- Importantly, Block A is above Block C, indicating Block C (and thus its contents) is below anything within Block A.

- Medium black square number three is not below any specified object within the context of the squares alone in Block A.
- The medium black square in Block B is not specified to be below anything related to the black squares in Block A. However, B's general orientation is not described as being below any other blocks in the direction of the medium black squares context.

Analysis:
- The small black triangle is in block A.
- Block C has the big blue square, which is above the small black triangle, indicating that the arrangement could place block C above block A.
- Block B's small blue square cannot be above the small black triangle in block A because block B is above block A, and the small blue square is specifically mentioned to be below other shapes in block B.

Given this information:
- The big blue square must be in block C because we are told it is above the small black triangle (which is in block A).
- Since block C contains the big blue square, it logically follows that block C must also contain the small blue square above the small black triangle in block A.

4. The problem asks which object is to the left of the black object (medium black square) that is in block A. 

Since block C, which contains the medium blue squares, is to the farthest left among the three blocks, any object within block C is naturally to the left of any object in block A, including the medium black square contained in block A.

- Therefore, ""the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block,"" which is medium blue square number one in block C, is to the left of the medium black square (in block A).

5. Medium blue square number two is also in block C, thus it too is to the left of the medium black square in block A.

So, both medium blue square number one (the object touching the bottom edge of block C) and medium blue square number two are to the left of the medium black square in block A. Thus, option 2) both of them is correct.

- Since Block B is to the right of Block A, and we're asked to consider what's to the left of Block B's bottom-touched square (the medium yellow square in Block B), we look at Block A.
  
- In Block A, there is a medium yellow square that is positioned at the same vertical level as the medium yellow square in Block B (both at the bottom).
  
- Block C, which is to the left of Block A, contains a medium black square.

Given these, between Block C and Block B's bottom touching yellow square, Block C contains a medium black square. Therefore, the medium black square in Block C is to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B.

","To answer the question, let's analyze the positions of the blocks and squares:

- Block A contains a medium yellow square (denoted as Yellow A) and a medium black square (denoted as Black A). The Black A is touching the bottom edge of Block A and is below Yellow A.

- Block B contains one medium black square (denoted as Black B).

- Block C is above Block B and to the right of Block A. It contains a medium blue square (denoted as Blue C) and below Blue C is a medium yellow square (denoted as Yellow C).

The question asks what is directly below the blue shape (Blue C) in Block C. According to the description of Block C, directly below Blue C is Yellow C.

Since Yellow C is the square directly below the blue shape, Yellow A (from Block A) does not play a role in what is directly beneath Blue C.

Therefore, the answer is that the medium yellow square below the blue shape is the one in Block C.

1. **Block A**:
    - Contains one small blue triangle.

2. **Block B**:
    - Directly below Block A.
    - Contains one medium black square.

3. **Block C**:
    - To the left of Block A.
    - Contains a big blue square, a small black triangle, a medium blue triangle, and a medium yellow triangle.
    - The big blue square is below the medium blue and medium yellow triangles and touches the right edge of Block C.
    - The medium yellow triangle is to the left of the medium blue triangle.
    - The small black triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle.

Now, let's analyze the layout:

- In Block C, from left to right, you have:
  - Medium yellow triangle
  - Medium blue triangle
  - Small black triangle

- Below these triangles in Block C is the big blue square touching the right edge of the block.

Given this arrangement, we need to determine what is to the left of the small blue triangle in Block A.

Since Block C is entirely to the left of Block A—including its big blue square, medium blue triangle, and every shape inside—it implies that there are no elements from Block C directly to the left of anything in Block A, such as its small blue triangle.

- **Within Block A** itself, the only shape discussed is the small blue triangle with no other shapes from other blocks interfering or being included.

For the options provided:
- 0) Medium black square: Is in Block B, below Block A, not to the left.
- 1) Medium blue triangle: Is in Block C, which is entirely to the left of Block A and its contents.

Thus:
- To the left of the small blue triangle in Block A is not an object from within Block A. However, the entire Block C, with its medium blue triangle, is situated to the left of Block A.

Based on this understanding: **Option 1**, which indicates the medium blue triangle (present in Block C), is to the left of the small blue triangle (in Block A), is the correct choice.

- Medium yellow square number one (Yellow A1) is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
- Medium yellow square number two (Yellow A2) is above Yellow A1.
- The medium black square is below Yellow A2 but above Yellow A1. 

### Block B:
- There are two medium yellow squares and one medium blue square.
- Medium yellow square number one (Yellow B1) is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
- Medium yellow square number two (Yellow B2) is above Yellow B1.
- The medium blue square is above Yellow B2 and directly below Yellow B1, even though B1 is mentioned to be below it, which would mean B2 is above B1, and the blue square is above B1, thus it's incorrect to treat it as below B2.

### Analysis:
- In Block A, the medium black square is positioned above Yellow A1 and below Yellow A2, so it is above Yellow A1.
- In Block B, the medium blue square is located above Yellow B1, but below Yellow B2. Therefore, it is above Yellow B1.

Both the medium black square in Block A and the medium blue square in Block B are each above a medium yellow square.

**Block A:**
- There are two medium black squares, labeled as MB1A (the first medium black square in Block A) and MB2A (the second medium black square in Block A).
- MB1A is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
- MB1A is below MB2A.
- There is a medium blue square (MBL1A) in Block A.
- MBL1A is below MB2A.
- Therefore, the sequence from bottom to top for Block A is:

  2. MB2A (above MB1A)
  3. MBL1A (above MB1A and below MB2A)

**Block B:**
- There are two medium black squares, labeled as MB1B (the first medium black square in Block B) and MB2B (the second medium black square in Block B).
- MB1B is below MB2B.
- There is a medium blue square (MBL1B) that is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
- MBL1B is below both MB1B and MB2B.
- Therefore, the sequence from bottom to top for Block B is:
  1. MBL1B (bottommost, touching the bottom edge)
  2. MB1B (above MBL1B)
  3. MB2B (above MB1B)

We are tasked with determining which blue square is below a medium black square:
- In Block A: MBL1A is below MB2A, so MBL1A is below a medium black square.
- In Block B: MBL1B is below both MB1B and MB2B, so it is also below a medium black square.

Thus, both the medium blue square in Block A and the medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of Block B are below at least one medium black square.

- Directly above medium blue square number one, as described, is nothing according to the problem (it states below other squares).
- Above medium blue square number one, further is the medium yellow square and medium black square in Block C.

Next, for what is above the medium blue square touching the bottom edge in reference to Blocks A and C:
- Above medium blue square number one (of Block C), there is the medium yellow square and medium black square in Block C.
- There is only one medium yellow square in Block C and it is above medium blue square number one.
- Since Block A's medium yellow square does not mention any positioning in relation to Block C, and it is below Block C due to block placement, it cannot be above medium blue square number one in Block C.

","To solve this problem, we need to determine what is to the left of the object touching the bottom edge in one of the given blocks.

Let's break down the given information:

1. **Block A**: Contains a medium blue square.
2. **Block B**: Contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square.
   - The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.
3. **Block C**: Contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square.
   - The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge, and it is below the medium black square.

We need to identify the object that is touching the bottom edge of a block and look for what is to the immediate left of that object:

- In **Block A**, there is no indication of any object touching the bottom edge uniquely, as we only have a medium blue square mentioned.

- In **Block B**, the medium black square is below the medium yellow square, implying it is at the bottom. However, there is no specific indication that the black square touches the bottom edge exclusively, as it's verbally positioned lower.

- In **Block C**, it is explicitly mentioned that the medium yellow square touches the bottom edge. We focus on block C as this is the clearly specified case.

Considering the position described for **Block C**:
- The medium yellow square is at the bottom.
- The medium black square is above the medium yellow square.
- We have no direct information on the left-to-right positioning of the yellow and black squares within the block.

Based on typical assumptions of default layouts (e.g., if not otherwise specified), items in a single-column setup are stacked vertically aligned or centered.

However, as the problem explicitly asks what is to the left of an object touching the bottom and after careful layout verification:

- Since the description of horizontal positioning is absent, the position left-of or right-of each might be the same square. No detail indicates alternating positions for the black and yellow squares.
- Without explicit horizontal information, we can likely infer no objects are strictly left or right in the same plane in Block C. None of the above elements meet the criteria to the left of each other within the problem specification stipulated.

Thus, the choice that aligns with Blocks A, B, and C's description and nothing strictly located to the center-left of any object:

","To solve this, let's break down the description provided:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains one medium black square.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

3. **Block C:**
   - Contains two medium yellow squares. 
   - Below medium yellow square number two, there is a medium black square.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
   - It is specified that the medium black square is touching the bottom edge of block C.

Now, for the question: Which object is below a medium yellow square?

We have:
- Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two in Block C. This means there is no object below medium yellow square number one (it is itself below medium yellow square number two).
- Below medium yellow square number two in Block C, there is a medium black square.

Next, consider the yellow square in Block B:
- The description doesn't specify any object directly below the medium yellow square in Block B. Based on typical spatial arrangement implied by the description, there's no mention of an object being below it.

With this breakdown, we can deduce:
- The medium black square is below medium yellow square number two in Block C.

Thus, based on the descriptions and spatial relations, neither medium yellow square in block B nor medium yellow square number one in Block C has anything underneath it according to the provided information. 

Hence, both options 0) the medium yellow square in block B, and 1) medium yellow square number one have nothing below them.

So, the answer to which object is below a medium yellow square is: 
{3} (none of them)."
1127,"We have three blocks. Lets call them A, B and C. Block A has one small blue triangle. Below block A is block B which contains one medium black square. Finally, we have block C. It is to the left of block A. It has one big blue square and a small black triangle. Below a medium blue triangle and a medium yellow triangle there is the big blue square. It is touching the right edge of this block. The medium blue triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle. The small black triangle is to the right of the medium yellow triangle. Which object is to the left of a small blue triangle? the medium black square or the small black triangle??
0) the medium black square 
1) the small black triangle 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the left of the small blue triangle in block A, let's examine the positions of the blocks and the attributes of the objects within each block:

1. Block A contains a small blue triangle.
2. Block B (below Block A) contains a medium black square.
3. Block C is to the left of Block A. It contains a big blue square, a small black triangle, a medium blue triangle, and a medium yellow triangle.

Let's map out these details:

- Block C's layout starts with the medium yellow triangle (far left). The medium blue triangle is directly to the right of the medium yellow triangle. The small black triangle is directly to the right of the medium yellow triangle as well, meaning the small black triangle is two steps to the right of the yellow triangle. Finally, the big blue square is below these three shapes and touching the right edge of Block C.
  
Understanding these orientations, the small black triangle in Block C can't be positioned to the left of the small blue triangle in Block A because Block C is to the left of the entire block that contains the small blue triangle.

In contrast, the medium black square is situated in a separate block (Block B) directly below Block A. Since blocks A and B are stacked vertically with no horizontal overlapping, the medium black square and small black triangle are not directly in line horizontally with the small blue triangle in Block A.

Therefore, neither the medium black square in Block B nor the small black triangle in Block C is horizontally aligned as being left of the small blue triangle in Block A.

Based on this logical deduction, the correct answer in concise form is:
{3}"

","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the configuration of the blocks and their respective squares.

1. **Block A Structure:**
   - It contains three medium yellow squares labeled: 
     - Medium yellow square number one (touches the bottom edge of Block A).
     - Medium yellow square number two (located below medium yellow square number three).
     - Medium yellow square number three (located above medium yellow square number two).

   From this configuration, medium yellow square number one is at the bottom of Block A and is therefore touching the bottom edge of Block A.

2. **Block B Structure:**
   - It contains one medium blue square and one medium black square.
   - According to the description, the medium blue square is positioned below the medium black square.

   Therefore, the medium blue square is at the bottom of the configuration within Block B.

3. **Analyzing the Question:**
   We need to determine what is immediately below the blue object (medium blue square in Block B). According to Block B's arrangement, there is nothing below the medium blue square within Block B itself, so essentially, it is at the bottom edge of Block B.

4. **Answer Options:**
   - 0) thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block: This is correct for medium blue square in Block B.
   - 1) medium yellow square number two: This is in Block A and hence not related to what is below the medium blue square in Block B.
   - 2) both of them: Incorrect, since medium yellow square number two is not related to Block B.
   - 3) none of them: Incorrect, since the blue object is touching the edge of Block B.

The correct answer is that the medium blue square is a thing that is touching the bottom edge of Block B.

","Let's analyze the positions of the squares and circles in each block step by step.

1. **Block B:** 
   - Block B is to the left of Block A.
   - Block B contains a small yellow square, a big black square, and a medium black square.
   - The big black square is to the left of the medium black square.
   - The small yellow square is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - The medium black square is also touching the right edge of Block B.
   - The small yellow square is above both the big black square and the medium black square.
   
   From this description, we can infer that within Block B:
   - The arrangement (from left to right) on the bottom level is: [Big Black Square, Medium Black Square]
   - The small yellow square is above these squares, aligned with the right edge.

2. **Block C:**
   - Block C is to the right of Block B.
   - Block C contains a big blue circle, a small blue circle, and a medium black circle.
   - The big blue circle is touching the right edge of Block C.
   - The small blue circle is to the right of the medium black circle.
   - The big blue circle is to the right of and above the small blue circle.

   From this information within Block C:
   - The arrangement of circles (from left to right on the bottom level) starts with the medium black circle, then the small blue circle. The big blue circle is above and to the right of the small blue circle, directly at the right edge.

3. **Position Relation Between Blocks B and C:**
   - Since Block C is to the right of Block B and the small yellow square in Block B is on the right edge, to check what is directly to the right of the small yellow square, we will look at the configuration of Block C.
   - Block C starts with the medium black circle on the leftmost side.

**Conclusion:**
- Directly to the right of the small yellow square at the right edge of Block B is the medium black circle at the left edge of Block C.

1. The problem statement describes the positions of blocks A, B, and C relative to one another:
   - Block B is to the left of Block A.
   - Block C is to the left of Block B.

2. Now, we interpret the blocks' arrangements: Block C is to the far left, followed by Block B, and then Block A on the right-most side.

   \[ \text{Block C (leftmost)} < \text{Block B} < \text{Block A (rightmost)} \]

3. Each block contains specific shapes:
   - Block A contains a medium blue square.
   - Block B contains two medium yellow squares. The medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, which also has a medium black square directly underneath it.
   - Block C contains one medium yellow square.

4. We need to determine what is to the left of the medium blue square in Block A: medium yellow square number two or the medium yellow square that is in Block C.

Since:
- Block B, which contains medium yellow square number two, is located directly to the left of Block A.
- Block C, containing the medium yellow square, is located to the left of Block B. Thus, it is also to the left of Block A.

Both medium yellow square number two (in Block B) and the medium yellow square in Block C are to the left of the medium blue square in Block A.

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the position of the shapes within both blocks A and B based on the given description.

1. **Block A Details:**
   - It contains two medium black squares and one medium yellow square.
   - Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block A.
   - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one and below a medium yellow square.

   From this, we can deduce the vertical arrangement in block A as follows:
   
   - At the bottom (touching the bottom edge) is medium black square number one.
   - Above the first medium black square is medium black square number two.
   - Above the second medium black square is the medium yellow square.

2. **Block B Details:**
   - Block B contains one medium blue square and one medium yellow square.
   - Below the medium yellow square there is the medium blue square.

   The vertical arrangement in block B is:

   - At the top is the medium yellow square.
   - Below the medium yellow square is the medium blue square.

3. **Position Relative to One Another:**

   - Block B is above block A.
   - The task is to determine what is directly above the shape touching the bottom edge of a block, which is the first medium black square in block A.

4. **What is Directly Above the First Medium Black Square:**
   - Directly above the medium black square number one (touching the bottom edge of block A) is medium black square number two, since it is the next shape described to be above.
   - Above medium black square number two is the medium yellow square in block A (as arranged within block A).

5. **Block B Analysis:**
   - The description does not require us to specifically analyze what is directly above from another block as the part tasked involves directly above within the block itself.
   - If the task extended between blocks, since block A's topmost square is the yellow one and block B rests above it, we check what is directly on top of the topmost square in block A (medium yellow square), but we know our direct question concerns what is directly on top of the bottom-most square in block A.

From the steps, it's clear that:

- Directly above the medium black square number one (touching the bottom of block A) is the second medium black square and then the medium yellow square.

Thus, the answer to ""What is above the shape which is touching the bottom edge of a block?"" (meaning specifically block A, as contextualized) is a medium yellow square.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the right of a medium square, we need to analyze the spatial arrangements of the blocks and squares described:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium blue square.
   - Medium yellow square number one (let's call it A1) is below medium yellow square number two (A2).
   - The medium blue square is below A2 and is touching the bottom edge of Block A.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains one medium black square.

3. **Block C:**
   - Contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Medium yellow square number one (C1) is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
   - Medium yellow square number two (C2) is above C1.

Considering the arrangement and relationships in the above blocks:

- In Block A, the medium blue square touches its bottom edge, and A1 is below A2, indicating a vertical arrangement. This suggests a linear sequence going from top (A2) to middle (A1) to bottom (blue square). Nothing in Block A's description immediately indicates which of these yellow squares is to the right of any specific objects without more spatial orientation context.

- In Block C, C1 is at the bottom, just above the edge, while C2 is above C1. This implies a vertical configuration of medium squares.

To solve the problem, we consider overall spatial placement: 
- Block B is above Block C and to the left of Block A.
- Since Block B does not contain yellow squares and is distinctly separated by positioning, it doesn’t influence right-side placement of Block C’s or Block A’s yellow squares.

Therefore, within their respective blocks (A and C), their placements and orientations are primarily vertical, with no explicit or intrinsic right-side placement of one object to another stated:

- If we test the options:
  - Both options (0 and 1) describe yellow squares that are simply placed vertically.
  - There is no specific ""right of"" relational detail when only vertical layouts are described.

Conclusion: Given the problem constraints and the spatial layout described, neither medium yellow square number one, nor the yellow square touching a block edge is definitively right of each other or any block. Thus the correct answer is that neither is to the right as described.

Finally, considering the lack of right-side spatial relations in our analysis:

- **3) none of them** is the clearest answer.

This solution follows from understanding purely the relative arrangements as vertically oriented within the blocks given, and that all necessary relations were already stated without a horizontal or actionable ""right-side"" context in play.

","To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the arrangement of the blocks and the positions of the squares within each block. Let's break it down block by block:

- **Block A**: This block contains one medium yellow square.

- **Block B**: 
  - Block B is positioned below Block A.
  - It contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square.
  - The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block B, and this square is below the medium yellow square within Block B. 

- **Block C**:
  - Block C is positioned below Block B.
  - It contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
  - The medium blue square is above the medium yellow square within Block C.

Now, let's determine which object is below a medium yellow square:

1. **For the medium yellow square in Block B**:
   - Below this medium yellow square in Block B, there is a medium black square (as stated in the problem that the black square is touching the bottom edge of the block).

2. **For the medium yellow square in Block C**:
   - Above the medium yellow square is the medium blue square, meaning below this medium yellow square, there is no other square within Block C described in the problem.

From the above analysis:

- The object directly below a medium yellow square that is in Block B is the medium black square.
- There is no object described as being below the medium yellow square in Block C; hence, it has no object below it according to the problem's description.

Given these considerations, the object below a medium yellow square is the medium black square situated below the medium yellow square in Block B.

- In Block A:
  - Medium yellow square is on top, having no squares below it that are not also blue.
  - Medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one, so blue square number one is below a medium blue square (medium blue square number two).

- In Block B:
  - Medium blue square is below the medium black square.

The question asks which object is below a medium blue square. Given that:
- Medium yellow square in Block A is not below any blue square.
- Medium black square in Block B is above the blue square.

   - The medium black square is below medium blue square number one and medium blue square number two.
   - Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.
   
   Given these descriptions:
   - Medium blue square number two is at the top.
   - Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.
   - The medium black square is at the bottom of block A, below both blue squares.
   
2. **Block B Description:**
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

   Given these descriptions:
   - Medium black square number two is at the top.
   - Medium black square number one is at the bottom of block B.

3. **Identifying Targets:**
   - ""The medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block"":
     - In block A, the medium black square (only one in A) is touching the bottom edge of block A.
     - In block B, medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B.
   
   - ""Medium black square number two"":
     - This square resides in block B, specifically, it's the top square in block B.
   
4. **Determining the Left Object:**
   - Compare the placement of ""the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" and ""medium black square number two"":
     - ""The medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" in block A is to the left of block B.
     - ""Medium black square number two"" in block B is not touching the bottom edge, but it's the top square.
     - Since ""the medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" in block A occupies the bottom and is to the left of block B, it is indeed to the left of any medium black squares in block B, including medium black square number two.

Therefore, the object to the left of a medium black square like medium black square number two would indeed be the ""medium black square that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" from block A.

The answer is option 0.

","To solve this problem, we need to visualize the positions of the blocks and the squares within them based on the given conditions:

1. **Block A** is to the left of Block B. 
2. **Block B** is below Block C.
3. Block A contains: 
   - One medium blue square.
4. Block B contains:
   - One medium yellow square.
   - One medium black square below the medium yellow square.
   - One medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block B, below both the medium yellow square and the medium black square.
5. Block C contains:
   - One medium yellow square.

Considering these descriptions:

- In Block B, the medium yellow square is higher up, above both the medium black square and the medium blue square. The medium blue square of Block B touches the bottom edge of Block B.
  
- In Block C, there's only one medium yellow square, but no information about it touching the bottom edge of Block C is provided. It's simply part of Block C.

The question asks which object is to the left of a shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block:
- Since Block B's medium blue square touches the bottom edge of Block B, in relation to the position of the blocks, Block A is to the left of Block B.
- Block A contains a medium blue square. This square is touching the bottom edge of Block A and Block A is to the left of Block B, which contains the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block B.
- Regarding Block C, none of the shapes are specifically noted as touching the bottom edge, so it does not fulfill the criteria specified in the problem.

Thus, the object to the left of the shape (medium blue square) that is touching the bottom edge of the block is within Block A, and is not affected by the medium yellow square in Block B or Block C.

In conclusion, neither the medium yellow square in Block B nor the medium yellow square in Block C is directly related to a shape touching the bottom edge of a block when considering block positioning and square touching status.

Therefore, the solution is:
- 3) none of them

","To solve this problem, let's break down the given configurations of blocks A and B.

**Block A:**
- Contains one medium black square and one medium blue square.
- The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

**Block B:**
- Contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square.
- Medium black square is below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one.
- Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.

- Block A:
  ```
  Medium Blue (A)
  Medium Black (A)
  ```

- Block B:
  ```
  Medium Blue #2
  Medium Blue #1
  Medium Black
  ```

Given the configuration:
- Block A with the black square underneath the blue square.
- Block B has two blue squares stacked with the black square beneath them both.

**Relation between blocks:**
- Block A is to the left of Block B.

Observation:
- The medium black square from block A is to the left of the position where block B starts.
- The medium black square in Block B is below medium blue square #1 and #2 in Block B.
- There is no horizontal overlap; instead, there's a vertical stacking within each block.

**Question:**
- Which object is to the right of a medium black square: medium blue square number one or the medium blue square that is in block A?

Since the medium black square in Block A is the only black square to the left of the medium blue square in Block A, and since Block B is located entirely to the right of Block A, the blue square in Block A is directly above its corresponding black square and not to the right of any black square. Further, the layout specified doesn't allow for any medium blue square from Block A to be physically to the right of Block B’s black square within the described configuration.

Therefore, both medium blue square number one and the medium blue square from Block A are not positioned to the right of any medium black square.

The correct choice based on configurational analysis is:

To the left of block A is block B. It has two small black circles. A big yellow triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block. This block also has a small yellow square.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given positions of the objects within blocks A and B.

Let's summarize the positioning for block A:
- Small black square: Above and near to the medium black square.
- Medium black square: Below the small black square and above, to the left of, and near the medium yellow square.
- Medium yellow square: To the right of both the small and medium black square.
- Big blue circle: To the left of, and potentially near, the medium yellow square.

Therefore, in block A, the arrangement is such that the big blue circle and the medium black square can both be to the left of the medium yellow square, while the small black square is above the other two black squares.

Now, let's examine block B:
- Small black circles (2): Positioned such that the second is below the medium blue circle.
- Big yellow triangle: Touching the bottom edge of the block, below the small yellow square.
- Medium blue circle: Above the second small black circle.
- Small yellow square: Above the big yellow triangle.
- Small black triangle: To the left of the medium blue circle and below the small yellow square.

According to the problem, the medium blue circle is above the second small black circle. Meanwhile, the small black triangle lies to the left of the medium blue circle and the small black circle number two is somewhere that is unspecified in relation to it.

Now, we need to determine which object from block A (the medium black square or the big blue circle) is potentially to the right of one of the small black circles in block B.

- Given the setup, the big blue circle in block A is to the left of the medium yellow square.
- The medium yellow square in block A is to the right of the medium black square.

Considering the spatial allocation within blocks A and B, and assuming the medium yellow square is to the rightmost in block A and there is no additional given information on the exact position of small black circles within block B, since the problem doesn't directly state that block A is also overlapping with any part of block B.

Thus, based on provided positions and arrangement logic, neither the medium black square nor the big blue circle from block A directly lie to the right of a small black circle in block B if we adhere strictly to the block separation.

Conclusion: While working within the given block arrangements and not assuming overlap beyond the stated aspect (block A to the right of block B), the correct answer should be that none of them are directly to the right of a small black circle from block B.

","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the spatial arrangement of the squares in both blocks.

**Block A:**
- Contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
- The medium yellow square in Block A is touching the bottom edge of the block, implying it is the lowest object in Block A.
- The medium blue square is above the medium yellow square in Block A.

**Block B:**
- Contains two medium yellow squares (number one and number two) and a medium blue square.
- Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two, implying medium yellow square number two is the highest object in Block B.
- The medium blue square in Block B is below both medium yellow squares number one and number two.

Now, we need to determine which objects are above a medium blue square:

- In Block A, the medium yellow square cannot be above the medium blue square because it is explicitly described as being below it.
- In Block B, medium yellow square number one is directly above the medium blue square.

Conclusively:
- The medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of a block (from Block A) is not above its respective medium blue square.
- Medium yellow square number one (from Block B) is above its respective medium blue square.

Thus, the correct answer is that medium yellow square number one is above a medium blue square.

","To solve this problem, we need to understand the spatial arrangement described:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - Arrangement: Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one (since number one is below number two).

2. **Block B**:
   - Located to the right of Block A.
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - Arrangement: Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one, with the medium black square number one touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - There is a medium blue square positioned above the entire vertical stack of the two medium black squares.

   1. **Position of Blocks in Block B**:
      - The medium blue square is at the top.
      - Below the medium blue square is medium black square number two.
      - Below medium black square number two is medium black square number one.
   
3. **Block C**:
   - Located below Block A.
   - Contains a medium yellow square.

Given this configuration, we need to find what object is to the right of a medium black square. Since:

- **Block A** is arranged vertically, and horizontal neighbors are on the right in Block B.
- **Block B** is on the right of Block A, and contains right neighbors to Block A's medium black squares.

Block B:
- The medium blue square is specifically positioned above the two black squares, hence it does not lie directly to the right in the same horizontal plane as any black square.

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, any given medium black square in Block A will have parts of Block B to the right. However, the ""objects"" discussed here (medium blue square and medium yellow square) must directly align horizontally.

In summary, the blocks in Block B contain black squares with a medium blue square above. Meanwhile, Block C's yellow square lies below Block A, and holds no horizontal alignment with the black squares.

Thus, regarding the medium blue square (positioned at the top of block B), and the medium yellow square (positioned in block C, which is completely below Block A): 

- Direct horizontal alignment places the entire section of Block B, with its black squares and medium blue topper, as forming columnar arrangements distinct from Block C's exclusive vertical positioning below Block A. 
- Hence neither the blue square specifically nor the yellow square lie directly horizontally to the right adjacent to a medium black square when considering edge adjacency criteria.

Therefore, the choice is:

- **3) None of them** is to the right horizontally in direct adjacency alignment.

Hence, the concise answer is:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains a small yellow triangle.
   - Positioned above both Blocks B and C.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains only one shape: a small black square.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains the following shapes:
     - A big yellow triangle.
     - A big yellow circle that is touching the bottom edge of the block.
     - A small black circle.
     - A medium blue square.
   - The medium blue square is above the big yellow triangle.
   - The big yellow circle is to the right of and below the medium blue square, indicating it is at the bottom of Block C.
   - The big yellow circle is below the small black circle, implying the small black circle is somewhere above the big yellow circle.
   - The big yellow triangle is to the left of and near to the small black circle.

Since Block A is above both Blocks B and C, anything directly below the small yellow triangle in Block A could be in either Block B or Block C.

- **Below Block A**: 
   - **Block B**: Contains only a small black square.
   - **Block C**: Contains:
     - Big yellow triangle (not touching the bottom edge).

     - Big yellow circle (touching the bottom edge). 
     - Medium blue square.

The options provided are:
- 0) A medium shape (which is the medium blue square).
- 1) A circle that is touching the bottom edge of a block (which is the big yellow circle).

In Block C, the medium blue square is not at the bottom edge of the block but above other shapes. The big yellow circle, however, is touching the bottom edge of Block C.

Thus, directly below the path of the small yellow triangle from Block A, we find, in Block C, a circle (big yellow circle) is touching the bottom edge of a block.

2. Block A is below B. This implies that Block B is above A.
3. Block A contains a medium blue square.
4. Block B has a medium black square.
5. Block C has two medium black squares.
6. Block C also has one medium yellow square touching the bottom edge.

Now, let's focus on the positions of the squares:

- The medium blue square is in Block A.
- Block B's medium black square is separate and is the only square in Block B.
- In Block C, medium black square number one is mentioned to be below medium black square number two and a medium blue square. This suggests that the medium blue square is above medium black square number one in Block C, aligning with our understanding that there is a link between medium blue square (in Block A) and the ones in Block C, given the reference to positions.
- Medium black square number two, according to the description, is also below the medium blue square.

Now, the question is which object is above a medium blue square: the medium black square in Block B or medium black square number one?

From the description:
- Medium black square number two is specifically below the medium blue square, which suggests that in the context given, the medium blue square is above at least one of the black squares in Block C.
- The medium black square in Block B has no relation mentioned to the medium blue square regarding above/below position. 

Therefore:
- Medium black square in Block B is simply an isolated object in its block.
- Medium black square number one, even without being explicitly mentioned in relation to the blue square other than being below another block, cannot violate the ongoing relation that blocks A and C and their contained squares hold a spatial context implying some vertical structure.

Given the structured layering of blocks A, B, and C, and the logic that if Block C involves squares related to the blue square in laying arrangement and the particulars of direct 'above,' it's positional context and clueing made about these squares in Block C thereby hints to unique verticality. That hints to some relation as per the described earlier arrangement, yet as per the position literally direct 'above'/touching statements resolve as not distinct perhaps for B in the later provided logic statements but the chain of cause and effect gives a different arrangement in decoded intention and wording in step alignments:

- There is no clear 'above' relationship given for the block B's involvement ruling it out since there is no placement argument within containing related blue with relevant positioning (not using the starting irrelevant separately).

3. Block B is to the right of Block A. It contains two medium yellow squares (numbered as one and two) and one medium blue square.
4. Block C is above Block B and has one medium yellow square in it.

The question asks what is to the right of the black shape (medium black square in Block A):

- Within Block B, we have two medium yellow squares.
- The arrangement within Block B is such that medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one, and both are above the medium blue square.

From our understanding:

- Block B (containing medium yellow square number one) is directly to the right of Block A.
- Block C is above Block B and not horizontally aligned with Block A, suggesting that Block C's components are above Block A, not to the right.

Therefore, medium yellow square number one in Block B is directly to the right of the medium black square in Block A, while the medium yellow square in Block C is above and not directly to the right.

1. Block A has one medium black square.
2. Block B is above Block A and has three medium yellow squares: numbers 1, 2, and 3.

- Medium yellow square number one is below a medium black square and medium yellow square number three.
- Below medium yellow square number three and the medium black square is medium yellow square number two.
- Below the medium black square is medium yellow square number three.

Let’s determine the positions based on these statements:

- The medium black square belongs to Block A. Since Block B (with the medium yellow squares) is above Block A, the medium yellow squares must be above or at the same vertical level as the medium black square.
- Statement 2 (below both medium yellow square number three and the medium black square is medium yellow square number two) implies medium yellow square number two is below the black square.
- Statement 3 tells us that medium yellow square number three is directly beneath the medium black square.

Analyzing these statements, medium yellow square number two is said to be below both the medium black square and another medium yellow square, so it must be at the lowest level among these squares.

Since medium yellow square number three is directly below the medium black square, it cannot be above it. 

Therefore, neither medium yellow square number three nor medium yellow square number two can be above the medium black square. 

After checking all the statements and positions, medium yellow square number one doesn't seem to be below the medium black square directly, so no medium yellow square is strictly above the medium black square.

- In Block B: The medium black square is above the medium blue square within the same block.
  
- In Block A: The medium black square is alone, so it is not below or above any item within its own block in a relevant comparison. Block A is above Block C entirely, and Block C's medium blue square is relevant as it is mentioned. Since the entire block is above Block C, it can be said the medium black square in Block A is above the medium blue square in Block C.

- Also within Block C: The medium blue square is above the medium yellow square at the bottom.

Thus, both the medium black squares from Block B (within its own block) and from Block A (relative to the medium blue square of Block C because Block A is entirely above Block C) are above medium blue squares.

Therefore, the correct answer is {2} indicating both of the medium black squares are above a medium blue square."

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, we first need to analyze the descriptions of the blocks and squares.

1. **Block Arrangement:**
   - Block C is to the left of Block A, which implies the objects in Block C are to the left of objects in Block A.
   - Block A is below Block B (does not affect the left-right positioning of C and A).

2. **Details of Blocks:**
   - **Block A:** 
     - Contains two medium yellow squares.
     - Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.

   - **Block B:** 
     - Contains two medium black squares.
     - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.
     - Medium yellow square number two (from Block A) is below medium black square number two (from Block B).

   - **Block C:** 
     - Contains one medium black square.

3. **Position Relation:**
   - **Medium Black Square (Block C):** 
     - Since Block C is to the left of Block A, the medium black square in Block C is to the left of both medium yellow squares in Block A.

   - **Medium Black Square Number Two (Block B):**
     - According to the relationship provided, medium yellow square number two from Block A is directly below medium black square number two in Block B.
     - Thus, they are aligned vertically, meaning medium black square number two is neither to the left nor to the right but directly above the medium yellow square number two.

From the above analysis:

- The medium black square in Block C is to the left of both medium yellow squares in Block A.
- Medium black square number two (Block B) is aligned above a medium yellow square, so it's not to the left.

Conclusively, the object to the left of a medium yellow square is the medium black square that is located in Block C.

The correct choice is:
0) The medium black square that is in block C.

","To solve this problem, let's analyze the arrangement of the squares in the blocks step by step.

1. **Blocks and their contents:**

   - **Block A**: Contains a medium black square.
   - **Block B**: Contains a medium yellow square.
   - **Block C**: Contains three squares - a medium blue square (at the bottom), a medium black square (below the medium yellow square), and a medium yellow square (at the top).

2. **Relative positions:**

   - **Block B** is below **Block A**.
   - **Block A** is to the left of **Block C**.

3. **Square arrangements in Block C:**

   - The medium blue square is at the bottom.
   - The medium black square is above the blue square.
   - The medium yellow square is above the medium black square.

4. **Question analysis:**

   We need to determine which medium black square is to the left of a medium yellow square. 

   - **Block A's black square** is not adjacent to or inside Block C, thus not directly to the left of the yellow square in Block B or Block C.
   - **Block C's black square** is directly below the yellow square within the same block, which doesn't make it to the left of the yellow square since it's below it.

5. **Conclusion:**

   Since neither the black square in Block A nor the one in Block C is positioned to the left of a medium yellow square based on the descriptions, the answer is that none of the black squares are to the left of the yellow square.

Therefore, the correct answer is {3} - none of them."
3254,"We have two blocks, A and B. There are one medium black triangle, one medium blue circle and one big black circle in block A.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we'll visualize and organize the positions of the objects within the blocks based on the descriptions provided:

**Block A:**
1. **Big Black Circle**:
   - It is in block A and is a large circle.
   - The medium blue circle and small yellow triangle are below it.

2. **Medium Blue Circle**:
   - It is below the big black circle.

3. **Small Yellow Triangle**:
   - It is below the big black circle.
   - To the left of the small yellow triangle is the big black circle.

4. **Medium Black Triangle**:
   - It is to the right of the small yellow triangle, big black circle, and medium blue circle.
   - Since it is to the right of these elements, we can assume it is on the rightmost side compared to these objects.

**Block B:**
1. **Small Black Square**:
   - Located in Block B (to the right of Block A).
   - Above the small black circle.

2. **Small Black Circle**:
   - Located in Block B.
   - Below the small black square.

Now, let's determine the position of objects relative to the small black circle in Block B:

- Since the small black square is directly above the small black circle in Block B, there is nothing else directly above or left within Block B.
- Block B is positioned to the right of Block A.
- Within Block A and Block B, the big black circle is with the set of elements linked with the medium blue circle and the small yellow triangle. We already know the medium black triangle is to the right in Block A.

Based on the arrangement of objects and blocks:
- The medium black triangle is only to the right within block A and can't influence block B.
- The big black circle in Block A is not directly next to the small black circle since Block B is isolated from Block A.

Thus, neither the medium black triangle nor the big black circle can be directly or literally to the left of the small black circle.

1. **Blocks Arrangement**: 
   - Block C is below Block A.
   - Block C is above Block B.

2. **Block A**:

   - The first medium blue square is below the second medium blue square.

3. **Block B**:
   - Contains one medium yellow square.
   - A medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of Block B, and it is below the medium yellow square.

4. **Block C**:
   - Contains a medium black square.

Given the above arrangement, we need to identify what is above the medium black square in block C.

- Since Block C is positioned between Block A and Block B, anything in Block A will be above the black square, and anything in Block B will be below the black square.

- In Block A, we have two medium blue squares. Since Block C is below Block A, those blue squares are above the black square.

- In Block B, there is a medium yellow square, but since Block C is above Block B, this means the yellow square is below or level with the black square, not above it.

With this reasoning:
- The blue squares in Block A are located above the black square in Block C.
- The yellow square in Block B is located below the black square in Block C.

Thus, above the medium black square in Block C, there are medium blue squares (specifically those in Block A), not the medium yellow square.

- Below it is the medium yellow square.

**Block B:**

   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
   - Medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one.

Given this layout, we need to determine what is directly below the medium yellow square in Block A. 

- Since Block A is above Block B, Block B directly receives any objects dropped from Block A. However, no objects from Block A directly fall into Block C as it is mentioned that Block B is below Block A and Block A is simultaneously above Block C. Thus, Block C is below both Blocks A and B.

Thus, any object directly below the medium yellow square from Block A would land on Block B if there is no horizontal displacement.
Analyzing the arrangement of the medium black squares:
- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two within Block B.

Arrangement in space:
- Block B is above Block C.
- Block A is to the right of Block B.

Now, to answer the question:
- We need to identify which object is to the right of a medium black square.

Considering the spatial arrangement:
- Block B and Block C are vertically aligned since B is above C.
- Block A is horizontally aligned to the right of Block B.

Given the above observations:
- The medium black square in Block C is not to the left of any block because Block C is to the left side, and nothing is further right of Block C except Block A.
- The medium black square in Block A isn't directly 'right of’ another medium black square externally, since all of Block A is directly to the right of Block B, not aligned with Block C.

Based on the placement:
- The medium black square in Block A is to the right of the squares in Block C as a whole since blocks B and C are vertically aligned and Block A is completely to the right of them.

Therefore, the configuration that fits the scenario where one medium black square is to the right of another medium black square corresponds to the medium black square in Block A being to the right of the medium black square in Block C.

3. **Block C:** Contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square. The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block C, and the medium black square is above it.

Next, we need to determine which object is to the right of a medium black square.

First, consider the arrangement of the blocks:

- Block C is to the right of Block B.
- Block B is to the left of Block A.
  
This gives the arrangement from left to right: Block B, Block A, Block C.

Now examine the position of each relevant medium black square:

- In Block B, the medium black square is at the bottom and has the medium yellow square directly above it.
- In Block C, the medium black square is above, with the medium yellow square directly below it, touching the bottom edge.

Now evaluate the positions to the right:

- The medium yellow square within Block B (above the black square) is left of Block C's medium yellow square, which is touching the bottom edge. Hence, it isn't to the right of any medium black square.

- The medium yellow square in Block C (touching the bottom edge) is within the same block and directly below the medium black square and is therefore not to the right of any medium black square.

Since Block C is specified to be right of Block B but the yellow square in Block C is directly below its medium black square, no described logic asserts the medium yellow squares being to the right of their corresponding block's black squares.

2. **Medium Yellow Square #2 (Yellow 2)** is below:
   - Medium Black Square #1 (Black 1)
   - Medium Black Square #2 (Black 2)
   - So, Yellow 2 is below both Black 1 and Black 2.

3. Below Medium Yellow Square #2 (Yellow 2), there is Medium Yellow Square #1 (Yellow 1).
   - Thus, Yellow 1 is below Yellow 2, and since Yellow 2 is below both Black 1 and Black 2, Black 2 is above Yellow 1 as well.

4. Yellow 1 is touching the bottom edge of Block A. It is below Medium Black Square #2 (Black 2).
   - So, Black 2 is confirmed to be above Yellow 1.

By the above reasoning, both the Medium Black Square #1 (Black 1) and Medium Black Square #2 (Black 2) are above at least one of the medium yellow squares: Black 1 is above both Yellow 1 and Yellow 2, and Black 2 is above Yellow 1.

     - Middle: the medium yellow square
     - Bottom: the medium blue square

2. **Arrangement in Block B**:
   - Block B is to the left of Block A.
   - Block B contains only one medium blue square.

3. **Arrangement in Block C**:
   - Block C is to the right of Block A.
   - Block C contains three medium blue squares.
   - Below medium blue square number two and medium blue square number three is medium blue square number one.
   - Below medium blue square number three is medium blue square number two.
   - This implies the arrangement from top to bottom is:
     - Top: medium blue square number three
     - Middle: medium blue square number two
     - Bottom: medium blue square number one
   
Now, addressing the question:

- ""Which object is to the right of a medium blue square?”:
  - ""The thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" refers to the medium blue square in Block A.
  - ""Medium blue square number two"" is in Block C.

Considering block arrangement (B to the left, A in the middle, C to the right):
- The object to the right of the medium blue square in Block A (touching the bottom edge) is Block C, specifically medium blue square number one.
- Medium blue square number two in Block C has no object to its immediate right as it is already the rightmost block, barring larger surrounding structures not described in the scenario.

Thus, there is an object to the right of the medium blue square at the bottom of Block A, which would be Block C’s medium blue square(s). However, the available selection does not make this distinction explicitly since it asks if there’s an object to the right of each. Since in the context described:
- The bottom medium blue square of Block A has a square to its right in Block C.
- Medium blue square number two in Block C theoretically has no right neighbor, due to its position on the stack and the lack of description of objects to the far right.

Thus ""the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block"" has an object to its right, but ""medium blue square number two"" does not.

Therefore, the correct choice is:
{0}"

- **Block A**: Contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square. The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square. This means in Block A, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square.

- **Block B**: Contains a medium yellow square. There is no blue square to consider in this block.

- **Block C**: Contains a medium blue square and a medium black square. The medium blue square is below the medium black square in this block. This means in Block C, the medium blue square is indeed below the medium black square.

Now we assess the placement of the medium blue squares:

- The medium blue square in **Block A** is above the medium yellow square, not below it.
- The medium blue square in **Block C** is below the medium black square, satisfying the condition of being below a medium square.

Therefore, the medium blue square that is below a medium square is the one that is in Block C.

2. Block B: Is below block A and contains one small blue square.
3. Block C: Is to the left of block A and contains two medium yellow triangles, with the medium yellow triangle number one above medium yellow triangle number two, and both are above a big blue square.

Given this information, block C is to the left of block A. Therefore, anything in block C is to the left of anything in block A, including the small blue triangle located in block A.

In block C, there are two medium yellow triangles. This means the medium yellow triangles are to the left of the small blue triangle in block A.

Now let's look at the options provided:
0) medium yellow triangle 
1) small blue square 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Since the small blue square is in block B, which is described as being below block A (and not to the left), it cannot be to the left of the small blue triangle. Therefore, the correct choice is that a medium yellow triangle is to the left of the small blue triangle.

   - Since no other items are mentioned in Block A, we focus only on the medium blue square in Block A.

2. Block B:
   - Contains a big black triangle, which is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - A medium blue circle and a medium black square.
   - A big black circle below and near to the medium black square.
   - The big black triangle is to the right of both the medium blue circle and the medium black square.

Now, let's place the items in Block B:

- The medium blue circle and the medium black square are somewhere to the left of the big black triangle since the triangle is on the right edge of Block B.
- We need to determine the relative position of the medium blue circle and the medium black square.

Since the problem asks which object is to the right of the medium blue square in Block A, and Block A is to the left of Block B, any objects in Block B would be considered to the right of the medium blue square in Block A.

With the medium blue circle and medium black square both residing in Block B, and Block A being to the left of Block B, both the medium blue circle and the medium black square are to the right of the medium blue square in Block A.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains one medium yellow square and one medium blue square.

- Block A is above Block B.

- Block A has one medium black square.

- Block B has two medium yellow squares and also a medium blue square touching the bottom edge.

1. A medium blue square is below a medium black square and medium yellow square number one.
2. Medium yellow square number one is below the medium black square and medium yellow square number two.
3. Below medium yellow square number two is the medium black square.

From clue 2:
- The order from top to bottom as per the statement is: Medium black square -> Medium yellow square number one -> Medium yellow square number two

From clue 1:
- The order from top to bottom is: Medium black square -> Medium yellow square number one -> Medium blue square

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this, let's analyze the layout of the objects within blocks A and B.

- **Block A:**
  - Contains two medium black squares and one medium yellow square.
  - Medium black square 1 is touching the bottom edge of block A.
  - The medium yellow square is below medium black square 2.
  - Medium black square 1 is below medium black square 2 and the medium yellow square.

From this, we infer that:
- Medium black square 2 is above medium black square 1.
- The medium yellow square is between medium black square 1 and medium black square 2.

- **Block B:**
  - Contains one medium black square and one medium blue square.
  - The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of block B.
  - The medium blue square is positioned below the medium black square in block B.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of a medium black square.

- For medium black square 2 (Block A):
  - To its left is nothing stated explicitly.
  
- For medium black square 1 (Block A):
  - To its left is potentially nothing stated, but it’s touching the edge so possibly nothing.
  
- For the medium black square in Block B:
  - To its left might be the edge of the entire setup, potentially there’s nothing.

Given this analysis, the only explicit relationship between the objects given in the description refers to ""below"" and ""above"" positions, not ""left"" or ""right"" specifically.

We look at the overall spatial relationships:
- Block B is to the right of Block A, thus objects from block A (including the medium yellow square) could be to the left of Block B's black square, but only if specified.
- The medium blue square in Block B is below the block B's black square and unlikely to be to the left unless explicitly moved left in the spatial setting.

Conclusively, based on the given position descriptions, we cannot definitively say what is explicitly to the left of block B's black square (if based solely on below and above); thus, there is no explicit statement placing either a yellow object or the medium blue square to the left of a medium black square.

2. **Block A**: Contains a small black circle. Block A is between Block B and Block C.

3. **Block C**: Contains one big black square, a big yellow triangle, and a small black circle. Given the specific arrangement:
   - The big black square is to the left of both the big yellow triangle and the small black circle.
   - The big yellow triangle is located below the small black circle.

According to the question, we need to determine the positioning of the objects with respect to a ""big yellow square,"" which is located in Block B.

- **To the right of Block B** is Block A first, which contains a small black circle. 
- Moving further to the right, we reach Block C, which contains the objects: a big black square, a big yellow triangle, and a small black circle.
- Within Block C, the arrangement is such that the big black square is to the left of the big yellow triangle and the small black circle.
  
Since we are concerned with the relative positioning of objects in relation to the big yellow square (found in Block B), we find:

- The first object directly to its right, across Block A and within Block C, is the big black square.
- The big yellow triangle is situated further to the right inside Block C.

   - In Block B: The structure described does not directly involve black squares.
   - In Block C: The medium black square is directly above the medium yellow square, with the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge of Block C.

   - A medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block B, which is below the medium black square

4. The question asks which object is below a medium blue square.

Since Block B is below Block A, the medium blue square in Block B is not involved in the arrangement of Block A itself. We are only concerned with the arrangement within Block A for this question, as Block B does not contain medium yellow square number one or two.

- Within Block A, the medium blue square is at the bottom of the arrangement. Both medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two are positioned above the medium blue square, so neither of them is below a medium blue square in Block A.

- The blue square is below Y2.
- Therefore, order from top to bottom in Block B is: Y2, Y1, Blue, Black.
- Y1 is actually above the blue square, which is above the black square; hence, Y1 is also effectively above the black square, not directly below it.
- Y2 is positioned directly above Y1, and Y1 is above the black square, as established; thus, neither Y1 nor Y2 is directly below the black square.

3. The small yellow triangle is to the right of and below the medium black circle and to the right of the big yellow circle.

Next, we need to determine which objects in Block B are directly to the right of the big blue triangle in Block A.

Since Block B is entirely to the right of Block A, all items in Block B are generally to the right of the big blue triangle. The options we are interested in are:

- The small blue square.

3) none of them

Analyzing the options:
- The medium black square in block B is below the medium blue square, not under a yellow square, so this does not qualify.
- The medium black square in block A is above the medium yellow square within block A, so it is not below a yellow square.
- Therefore, neither of the medium black squares is below a medium yellow square.

Thus, the correct answer is option 3: none of them.

","To solve this problem, we'll need to analyze the position and orientation of the blocks and their squares.

1. **Block A**: Contains one medium black square. No other information is needed about this block as it doesn't have any yellow squares.

2. **Block B**: Contains one medium yellow square. We know that block C is above block B, and that this block is positioned to the left of block A.

3. **Block C**: Contains two medium blue squares and one medium yellow square. Let's break down the positions:
   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of block C and is below a medium yellow square and medium blue square number two.
   - Medium yellow square is directly above medium blue square number one.
   - Medium blue square number two is above the medium blue square number one and to the side of the medium yellow square.

Since block C is to the left of block A and is above block B, we'll focus on the directions. If medium square positions within blocks C and B are not specified further regarding left or right, one must assume that the given descriptive positions pertain to space within blocks, not comparative positions between blocks.

Since block C and block B are unspecified in spatial relation left/right of each other and are positioned in a stacked manner (with C on top of B), the concept of ""to the left"" seems to target what's relative in contained block spaces. 

Within block C's description, which is specific, medium blue square number two and the medium yellow square could be positions in relation to one another. However, block B’s medium yellow square’s surrounding items are unknown. Thus not enough to clarify any item as being specific to its left.

Based on given information, generally by lack of specifics notably between blocks B and C or orientation of individual block spaces, neither medium yellow square by presented structure is explicitly to the left of any object that can be confidently identified as further left specific in mirrored/mirror arrangements.

Therefore, the logical conclusion given these constraints:
- *None of them* are definitively to the left by placement constraints and giving. However logical based on C having computational data which might set possibilities computable by no specificity.

The concise form of the correct answer based on detailed analysis is:

1. We have Block A and Block B. Block A is below Block B.

2. In Block A, there is a medium black triangle.

3. In Block B, there are three objects:
   - A big yellow circle.
   - A small black triangle.
   - A big blue circle touching the bottom edge of Block B.

4. The big yellow circle is described as below and to the left of the small black triangle.

5. There is a big blue square which is to the right of, near to, and above the big blue circle.

Now, we need to determine which object is to the left of a small shape (the small black triangle):

- The description states the big yellow circle is below and to the left of the small black triangle in Block B. Therefore, the big yellow circle is to the left of the small black triangle.

- The medium black triangle in Block A is not relevant to the small black triangle in Block B since it doesn't share any spatial relation indicating it is to the left of the small black triangle.

Given these observations, only the big yellow circle is to the left of the small black triangle.

1. **Block A:**
   - There are two medium yellow squares. Let's label the top one as ""medium yellow square number two"" and the bottom one as ""medium yellow square number one.""
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
   - There is a medium black square below medium yellow square number two. Additionally, it is said that this black square touches the bottom edge of the block and is below the yellow object that is below medium yellow square number two. This indicates that the medium black square is below medium yellow square number one.

2. **Block B:**
   - It contains a medium black square. No medium yellow square in block B, and no relation to anything below it within Block B is considered in this context.

3. **Block C:**
   - Block C contains a medium yellow square. There’s no mention of anything being directly below this square, nor is there any indication of another object within block C that is below this square.

By analyzing these steps individually:

- In **Block A**, the medium black square is below medium yellow square number one.
- In **Block C**, the description does not provide a detail of any object being below the medium yellow square in this block.

Therefore, based only on the information given, the conclusion is that:

- Medium yellow square number one (in Block A) has an object below it (the medium black square).
- The medium yellow square in Block C does not have any object below it.

Thus, the object below a medium yellow square is in Block A, making the correct answer:

   - Contains: a small yellow square, a medium blue circle, and a small black circle.
   - The small yellow square: 
     - Is to the right of, near to, and above a big black circle.

**Determining What Objects Are Above a Big Thing:**

- The ""big thing"" referred to in the question seems to be the ""big black circle"" in the context given for Block A since no other ""big"" object is mentioned.
- Within Block A:
  - The small yellow square is located above the big black circle.
  - The small black circle is also above the big black circle.
- Block B is entirely above Block A, meaning it is also above all contents in Block A, including the big black circle.
  - Within Block B, the medium yellow circle and the small yellow circle are both above the ""big thing"" (the big black circle) due to Block B being above Block A.

**Conclusion:**
Both the small yellow circle in Block B and the small yellow square in Block A are above the big black circle, the ""big thing"" in question.

Therefore, the answer to which object is above a big thing would be:

","To answer this question, let's break down the given information about the arrangement of blocks and squares:

1. **Block A:**
   - Block A is above Block B.
   - Block A contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Below the second medium yellow square is the first medium yellow square.

2. **Block B:**
   - Block B has one medium yellow square.

3. **Block C:**
   - Block C is to the left of Block A.
   - Block C contains one medium blue square and one medium black square.
   - The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
   - Below the medium black square, there is a medium yellow square.
   - The medium yellow square and medium black square are above the medium blue square in Block C.

Now, we assess the relative positions:

- Since Block C is to the left of Block A, the squares in Block C (including the medium yellow square in Block C) are to the left of any squares in Block A.
- Block B is directly below Block A, so in a typical scenario, Block B and Block C would be side by side, unless mentioned otherwise. Because it is not specified, it's safe to assume Block B is not to the left of Block C.

Considering the arrangement based only on the left positioning:
- The medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of the squares from both Block A and Block B because Block C is positioned on the leftmost side compared to Block A and Block B.

Thus, both relative position and the details given suggest that the medium yellow square in Block C is indeed the one on the left.

Therefore, the square to the left of any medium yellow square in this context is the square within Block C. As it is the only one explicitly positioned to the left, the answer is:

","To solve this problem, we'll analyze the given relationships and placements step by step:

1. There are two small black squares in the block.

2. Near to and to the left of a medium blue triangle, there is a big blue circle. This suggests a spatial relationship where the medium blue triangle is to the right of the big blue circle.

3. Below, far from, and to the left of small black square number two is a medium blue circle. Therefore, the medium blue circle is positioned lower than and far to the left of the second small black square.

4. Near to a big yellow triangle is the medium blue triangle. This indicates that the medium blue triangle is close to the big yellow triangle.

5. The medium blue circle is touching the left edge of this block. This tells us the medium blue circle is at the extreme left of the block.

Now, to determine which object (the medium blue triangle or the medium blue circle that is touching the left edge of a block) is to the left of a small black square:

- The medium blue circle touching the left edge of the block is positioned far to the left and is explicitly described as touching the left edge.
  
Since the medium blue circle is at the extreme left and both small black squares are within the block (though their exact positions aren’t specified), the medium blue circle is more likely to be to the left of any of the small black squares.

Therefore, the medium blue circle touching the left edge of the block is to the left of a small black square.

","To solve this problem, we need to visualize the arrangement of blocks and their squares.

1. **Block A**: It contains a medium black square. This is our reference block.

2. **Block B**: This block is to the left of Block A. It contains:
   - Two medium yellow squares, numbered as medium yellow square number one (1) and medium yellow square number two (2).
   - A medium black square located below both medium yellow squares.

3. **Block C**: This block is also to the left of Block A and is to the left of Block B. It contains one medium yellow square.

Now, let's consider the locations of these blocks and squares in order.

Since Block B is left of Block A and contains a medium black square below its two yellow squares (medium yellow squares number one and two), this means both of these medium yellow squares are above the medium black square within Block B.

Block C is to the left of Block A and also to the left of Block B, and it contains one medium yellow square.

With this setup:

- In Block B: The medium black square is directly beneath the two yellow squares. In terms of lateral position, on a straight horizontal line from left to right, the medium yellow squares are positioned directly above (vertically not laterally to the left of) the medium black square. However, all of Block B's contents (including all its yellow squares) are technically left of Block A's contents. But they're placed vertically above the black square in Block B.

- In Block C: The single medium yellow square technically shares the same horizontal space alongside blocks A and B, but all contents of Block C (including its medium yellow square) are horizontally left of Block A's single black square.

Ultimately, the relative directions suggest:
- Medium yellow square 1 in Block B is above its own black square within Block B.
- Medium yellow square in Block C is positioned horizontally (laterally) to the left of anything from Block A, including the medium black square in Block A.

So, within the given configuration: The medium yellow square that is part of Block C is the one directly left of Block A’s medium black square when considering horizontal alignment across blocks.

The correct answer to the question posed is that the medium yellow square in Block C is to the left of the medium black square in Block A.

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. Block A is to the left of Block C, and Block C is to the right of Block B. Thus, the order from left to right is: Block A, Block B, Block C.
3. Block A has two medium blue squares:
   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - Medium blue square number two is located above medium blue square number one.
4. Block B contains two medium black squares:
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
5. Block C contains one medium black square.

Now, let’s consider the relative positions of the squares:
- Since Block A is positioned to the left of Block B, any squares in Block A will be to the left of the squares in Block B.
- Block B's medium black square number one is below medium black square number two. These squares do not affect horizontal positioning predictions when compared to block A and C.

Next, compare the blue squares in Block A to the black squares:
- The medium blue square number one is at the bottom edge of Block A. This square is part of Block A, which is to the left of both Block B and Block C. Therefore, it is to the left of the medium black squares in both Blocks B and C.
- Medium blue square number two is above the first blue square but still in Block A. Therefore, it too remains to the left of all medium black squares in both Blocks B and C.

Thus, both the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block A and medium blue square number two are to the left of any medium black square present in Blocks B and C.

- The big black square is below the big yellow triangle.
- The big black square is touching the bottom edge of block A.

- Contains a medium blue square and a big yellow circle.
- The big yellow circle is touching the right edge of block B.
- The medium blue square and the big yellow circle are near each other.

Now, we are asked which object is above a medium shape:
- The medium shape referred to is the medium blue square in block B.
- The big black square in block A cannot be above the medium blue square in block B as they are in different blocks, and the big black square is at the bottom of block A.
- The big yellow circle, which is in block B and touching the right edge, is in the same block as the medium blue square. Since it is touching the right edge and described as near the medium blue square, it doesn’t mention that it is above it. 

Therefore, the big black square, which is at the bottom edge of block A, cannot be above the medium blue square in block B because they are in different blocks. The description doesn't explicitly state that the big yellow circle is above the medium blue square, just that it's near.

","To determine what is below the black shape in Block B, let's revisit the description of Block A's structure in detail:

- Block A has four medium blue squares.
  - Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number four and medium blue square number two.
  - Medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number four and medium blue square number three.
  - Medium blue square number three is below medium blue square number four.
  
From these clues, the structure of Block A can be inferred in layers:

- Medium blue square number 4 is at the top.
- Medium blue square number 3 is directly below medium blue square number 4.
- Medium blue square number 2 is below both medium blue square number 3 and number 4.
- Medium blue square number 1 is below medium blue square number 2.

Now, summarizing:
1. Number 4 is at the top.
2. Number 3 is below number 4.
3. Number 2 is below numbers 3 and 4.
4. Number 1 is at the bottom below numbers 2 and 4.

Block B contains a single medium black square. The question asks what is directly below this black square.

- Since the position of Block B does not depend on the relative positions of Block A’s squares, we need to determine the base layer structure of Block A to check what is below.

Given Block A's stack order:
- Medium blue square 1 is at the base, followed by square number 2, square number 3, and square number 4 at the top.

Hence:
Since Block B sits independent and parallel to the top of Block A, and not below any of Block A's structures directly, there is nothing explicitly specified as below the black shape in a series of parallel layers at initial evaluation.

- **Block B**:

- **Block C**:
  - Contains a medium yellow triangle, a small blue circle, and a big black circle.
  - The medium yellow triangle is below the small blue circle and big black circle.

Based on the descriptions, we can deduce:

- In Block A, since the medium blue circle is touching the bottom edge of the block, the medium blue triangle must be located to its left and above, since the circle touches the bottom edge. Therefore, the medium blue triangle is to the left of the medium blue circle.

- In Block C, the medium yellow triangle is at the bottom because it is below the small blue circle and big black circle. Therefore, nothing is to the left of it touching the block's bottom edge, as the medium yellow triangle itself might be touching the bottom edge.

Now, let's evaluate our options:
- The medium blue triangle in Block A is to the left of the medium blue circle, which is touching the bottom edge.
- The medium yellow triangle doesn't have anything touching the bottom edge of Block C to its right since it is at the bottom-most position.

Thus, the question of which object is to the left of an object that is touching the bottom edge of a block, pertains only to the medium blue triangle in Block A.

- Block C is to the left of Block B, which means anything in Block B is inherently to the right of any object in Block C.
- The question asks what is to the right of the big blue square in Block C. Since Block B is entirely to the right of Block C:
  - The small blue triangle inside Block B is definitely to the right of the big blue square.
  - The medium black square in Block A is not in Block B, and Block A and C are in the same line, making the medium black square potentially not to the right of the big blue square.

Since Block B, including all its components, is entirely to the right of Block C (given the horizontal positioning), the small blue triangle inside Block B is to the right of the big blue square in Block C, whereas the medium black square in Block A is not.

","To determine which object is below a yellow square, let's first parse the given information:

- Block A consists of:
  - One small blue triangle
  - One small yellow square
  - One small blue circle
  - One big yellow triangle
- The big yellow triangle is below a big blue square and a small blue circle.
- The big blue square is near and to the left of the small yellow square.

- Block B consists of:
  - One medium yellow square.

With this information, let's look at the positions of the objects in Block A:

1. The big yellow triangle is below both the big blue square and the small blue circle.
2. The small blue circle is above the big yellow triangle.
3. The big blue square is near and to the left of the small yellow square.

Given that the big yellow triangle is not mentioned in relation to the small yellow square, it does not implicate any further objects below it.

Now, observe the following:
- The statement about the layout primarily gives a configuration about objects above or near each other but does not give a statement or an implication (as there stand none) about the small yellow square having an object directly below it.
- Similarly, no explicit information indicates the small blue circle is directly below another object or that any object is directly below the small yellow square in Block A.

Considering Block B:
- It contains one single object: a medium yellow square.
- As no other objects are mentioned in Block B, the medium yellow square in Block B does not contribute any context for having items below other objects. 

Upon reviewing, neither the small yellow square nor the small blue circle is specified to be directly below any object. Thus, given the stated arrangement and associations, none of the objects mentioned are below a yellow square based on available data.

So, analyzing all the provided relationships, the final result is:
- Neither is explicitly below a yellow square.

Thus the answer is:
{3} – none of them."

","To determine which object is above a medium black square, we need to analyze the given positions of the squares within the blocks.

1. **Block A:** 
   - Contains one medium black square.

2. **Block B:** 
   - Contains a medium blue square.

3. **Block C:** 
   - Contains two medium yellow squares, one medium black square, and one medium blue square.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below the medium black square.
   - Medium yellow square number two is below both the medium black square and the medium blue square. It is also mentioned that medium yellow square number one is below the medium blue square, which implies that it is below the medium black square.
   - The shape touching the bottom edge of the block is below medium yellow square number two.

By the given description:
- Medium yellow square number one is below the medium blue square and also below the medium black square. 
- Medium yellow square number two is below both the medium black square and the medium blue square. 
- The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block is mentioned to be below medium yellow square number two. 

Therefore, between the two options:
- Medium yellow square number two is above the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of the block.
- Thus, medium yellow square number two is the one directly interacting with the medium black square.

From this information, medium yellow square number two is above the medium black square, as the medium yellow square that touches the bottom edge is further below. Therefore, the medium yellow square touching the bottom edge cannot be above the medium black square.

The correct answer is medium yellow square number two: 
- **Medium yellow square number two is above the medium black square.**

","To determine which object is above a medium black square, let's analyze the information provided about the three blocks A, B, and C, focusing specifically on the spatial relationships involving medium black squares.

In Block B:
- We have two medium black squares and two medium blue squares. 
- Arrangement of squares:
  - Medium blue square number two is above medium black square number one.
  - Medium black square number two is below medium blue square number two.
  - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two, suggesting a vertical stack.
  
From this, we can deduce:
- Medium blue square number two is above medium black square number two.
- Medium blue square number one is not mentioned in the vertical arrangement directly with the black squares, so we assume it's not directly above any black square unless later indicated.

In Block C:
- There is one medium black square and one medium yellow square.
- The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
- The medium yellow square is above the medium black square.

Now, evaluating the choices:

0) The shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block:  
   - In Block C, the medium black square is touching the bottom edge, and it is below the medium yellow square. Thus, the medium yellow square is above it.

1) Medium black square number two:
   - In Block B, medium blue square number two is directly above medium black square number two.

Conclusion:
- The choice that has an object above it is both the medium black square in Block C (with the yellow square above it) and medium black square number two in Block B (with medium blue square number two above it).

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains two medium blue squares and one medium yellow square.
   - Medium blue square number one is below both medium yellow square and medium blue square number two.
   - Medium yellow square is below medium blue square number two.

   So, in Block A:
   - The arrangement from top to bottom can be:
     - Top: Medium blue square number two
     - Middle: Medium yellow square
     - Bottom: Medium blue square number one

2. **Block B**: 
   - Contains a medium blue square.

3. **Block C**: 
   - Contains a medium blue square.

Considering the spatial relations given between the blocks:
- Block B is above Block C.
- Block C is below Block A.

Now, address the question: Which object is above a medium blue square? We need to examine:

- **Medium blue square number two (in Block A)**: 
  - The medium blue square number two is positioned at the top of its sequence within Block A.
  - Thus, no object is directly above it within Block A.

- **The medium blue square in Block B**:
  - Since Block B is above Block C, the medium blue square in Block B is above the medium blue square in Block C.
  - Therefore, it is correct to say it is above a medium blue square (the one in Block C).

Given these observations, the object that is above another medium blue square is the medium blue square in Block B. Thus, the correct answer is:

- The small black triangles are in Block B.
- The medium black triangle is in Block A, which is below Block B.
- The medium black circle is in Block C, which is above Block B.

Therefore, the medium black circle in Block C is above the small black triangles in Block B. There is no indication that anything in Block A is directly above the small black triangles in Block B. Specifically, the medium black triangle, which is in Block A, is below Block B, and hence cannot be above a small black triangle.

   In Block B:
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
   - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number three and below medium black square number one.
   - Below medium black square number three, there is medium black square number two.

3. A medium yellow square touches the bottom edge of Block B.

Given this arrangement of the squares:
- Medium black square number one is above medium black square number two.
- Medium black square number two is above medium black square number three.
- The problem statement is self-contradictory when it says ""below medium black square number three there is medium black square number two,"" but it seems to establish that square number two is also beneath square number three.

Since the medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of block B, we infer that it is below the medium black squares altogether. Therefore, it seems that medium black square number three is directly above the medium yellow square. By the problem's own consistent information, the blue square (in Block A) is not directly above the yellow square, it is likely separated by the arrangement of the black squares in Block B.

","Let's go through the problem step-by-step to determine which object is to the left of a medium yellow square.

1. **Understand the layout of Block A:**
   - There are two medium yellow squares in Block A.
   - Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - Medium yellow square number two is positioned below a medium blue square.
   - It also says that below medium yellow square number two and the medium blue square is medium yellow square number one.

   This implies the following configuration in Block A:
   - The medium blue square is above medium yellow square number two.
   - Medium yellow square number one is at the bottom, below both medium yellow square number two and the medium blue square.

2. **Understand the layout of Block B:**
   - Block B is to the left of Block A.
   - There are two medium black squares in Block B.
   - Below medium black square number two is medium black square number one.

3. **Identify relative positions:**
   - Since Block B is entirely to the left of Block A, all the medium black squares in Block B are to the left of all objects within Block A.
   - Medium black square number one is directly below medium black square number two in Block B.

4. **Determine the object to the left of a medium yellow square:**
   - We have established that the entirety of Block B is to the left of Block A, which means everything in Block B is to the left of the medium yellow squares in Block A.
   - Block B contains only medium black squares, not a medium blue square.
   - Therefore, no medium blue square can be to the left of a medium yellow square in Block A.
   - The yellow shape touching the bottom edge (medium yellow square number one) in Block A cannot be to the left of a medium yellow square, because it's positioned at the bottom inside the same block.

Thus, according to the described orientation, neither the medium blue square nor the yellow shape that is touching the bottom edge of Block A is to the left of any medium yellow square because that direction is occupied by Block B's medium black squares.

Therefore, the correct answer to what is to the left of a medium yellow square is:

     - 1 medium yellow square.
     - 1 medium black square.
   - Arrangement detail: 
     - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B.
     - Below this medium yellow square, which is located below medium blue square number two and the medium black square, there is medium blue square number one. 
     - This tells us that: 
       - Blue square 1 is on the bottom.
       - Above it, there is the yellow square.
       - Above the yellow square, there are blue square 2 and the black square.

     - 1 medium black square.
   - Arrangement detail:

Let's determine which objects are above the medium yellow squares:

- **Block B's Yellow Square**:
  - Above this yellow square are medium blue square number two and the medium black square.

- **Block C's Yellow Square**:
  - The medium black square is above this yellow square.

   - A small blue square is to the left of both the medium yellow circle and the big blue circle.
   - The big blue circle is near the medium yellow circle.

   - The small yellow circle is above the small black triangle, and the small black triangle touches the bottom edge of block C.
   - The big black square is to the right of the small black triangle and below and to the right of the small yellow circle.

**Question:**
- We need to determine which object is to the right of the small blue triangle: the small yellow circle or the medium object.

Since the blocks are organized such that block C is to the right of block B, any items in block C could potentially be to the right of any items in block B.

The small yellow circle is in block C, and the medium object we are identifying also seems to imply something larger in size, aligning it with being one of the listed circles. However, both the medium yellow circle in block A and the items to its right in block C are beside block B.

Given the layout and alignment:
- The medium yellow circle from block A is not spatially positioned in relation to the small blue triangle in block B.
- The small yellow circle indeed is in block C, which is just to the right of block B containing the small blue triangle.

Therefore, the small yellow circle from block C is to the right of the small blue triangle in block B.

The medium object (by interpretation being omitted in description to block C) in terms of positioning does not influence this analysis.

Thus, effectively, the correct answer is option 0 (the small yellow circle).

3. **Block C** is above Block A and contains:
   - A medium black square which is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
   - A medium blue square which is above the medium black square in Block C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative positions of these objects, focusing specifically on what is to the left of a medium black square:

- **Medium black square in Block A:**
  - Since Block B (which contains the blue square that is below yellow number one) is to the left of Block A, the blue square in Block B is to the left of the black square in Block A.

- **Medium black square in Block C:**
  - The blue square in Block C is above the black square, not to the left of it.
  - Block B (containing the blue square below yellow number one) is not directly related to Block C based on the given positions since the problem specifies the relative placements only for Block A.

Conclusion:
- The medium blue square in Block B (mentioned as the one below medium yellow square number one) is to the left of the medium black square in Block A.
- The medium blue square in Block C is not to the left of the medium black square in Block C or Block A as it is placed above the black square.

3. **Block C**: Contains one small blue triangle and one small yellow circle.
   - Relative Position: Block A is to the left of Block C. The small blue triangle in Block C is to the right of and below the small yellow circle.
   - This means the small yellow circle is higher in position than the small blue triangle in Block C.

Now, let's determine which object is directly above the big yellow triangle in Block A:
- Since Block B is above Block A, the big yellow triangle in Block A would be directly below any objects in Block B.
- Objects in Block B include a medium blue square, a medium black circle, and a big black square.

We need to determine whether a medium black circle or a small yellow circle is above the big yellow triangle:
- The medium black circle is in Block B. Block B is exactly above Block A.
- The small yellow circle is in Block C, which is to the right of Block A.

Since Block B is directly above Block A, and Block C is further to the right of Block A, it follows that the small yellow circle in Block C cannot be directly above the big yellow triangle in Block A.

2. **Block B** contains:
   - One medium black square that is located at the bottom of Block B.
   - One medium yellow square located above the medium black square.

3. **Block C** contains:
   - Two medium yellow squares, numbered and positioned as follows:
     - Medium yellow square number two is on top.
     - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
   - One medium black square, which is below both medium yellow squares.

Next, address the question: Which object is above a medium black square?

- In **Block B**, the medium yellow square is above the medium black square. Therefore, this square qualifies.
- In **Block C**, medium yellow square number one is above the medium black square. Therefore, this square also qualifies.

Thus, both the medium yellow square in Block B and medium yellow square number one in Block C are above a medium black square. 

Therefore, the answer is {2} because both of them are above a medium black square."
286,"There are three blocks, A, B and C. Blocks A and C are to the right of B. Block A contains a medium yellow square. Block B contains a medium yellow square.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square, let's break down the situation block by block:

- **Block A**: Contains only a medium yellow square.

- **Block B**: Contains a medium black square and a medium yellow square, with the medium yellow square positioned below the medium black square. Since both squares are in block B and no positional information regarding left or right is provided, they are simply aligned in the vertical direction (one on top of the other).

- **Block C**: Contains a medium blue square and a medium yellow square, with the medium yellow square positioned below the medium blue square. Similarly, these squares are vertically aligned in the block.

Since blocks A and C are to the right of block B, but the arrangement of yellow squares within each block (A or B) doesn't provide a scenario where anything is explicitly ""to the right"" within a block, the only relevant comparison is between blocks:

- **Block A's yellow square**: Since block A is to the right of block B, there is no block or object positioned to the right within block A itself; hence, nothing new is to the right of the medium yellow square in block A.
  
- **Block B's yellow square**: The medium black square is above the medium yellow square, not to the right.

- **Block C's yellow square**: The blue square is above the yellow square, not to the right.

Therefore, based on the spatial arrangement across blocks, neither the medium black square nor the blue square is positioned to the right of any medium yellow square. The comparative arrangement among the blocks does not place any object horizontally to the right of the medium yellow squares, simply in different blocks, with no explicit horizontal positioning within a block. 

Thus, the answer is that neither object is to the right of a medium yellow square:

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the spatial arrangement of the blocks and squares. We are given the following information:

1. Block C is to the left of Block A.
2. Block A is below Block B.
3. Block A has two medium yellow squares: square number one and square number two.
   - Square number two is above square number one.
4. Block B contains two medium black squares: square number one and square number two.
   - Square number two is above square number one.
   - There is also a medium yellow square in Block B.
5. Block C contains one medium black square.

Now, we need to place these squares based on the information provided and answer the question regarding the position of specific yellow squares relative to the black squares in Block B.

- Start by arranging Block B:
  - We have one medium yellow square in Block B.
  - Below the medium yellow square in Block B is medium black square number two.
  - Below medium black square number two is medium black square number one.

- Block A has medium yellow square number two above medium yellow square number one.

The question asks which object is below a medium black square: the medium yellow square in Block B or medium yellow square number two?

From the placement:
- The medium yellow square in Block B is directly above medium black square number two, meaning there is no medium black square directly above it.
- Medium yellow square number two in Block A is not in Block B, so it isn't directly below any medium black square from Block B.

Therefore, neither the medium yellow square in Block B nor medium yellow square number two is directly below a medium black square.

The answer is:

     - Medium Blue Square 1 (at the bottom)
     - Medium Black Square (above Medium Blue Square 1)
     - Medium Blue Square 2 (above Medium Black Square)

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains three squares:
     - Medium Yellow Square 1 (at the bottom)
     - Medium Yellow Square 2 (above Medium Yellow Square 1)
     - Medium Yellow Square 3 (above Medium Yellow Square 2)

3. **Block C:**
   - Contains one square:
     - Medium Blue Square

Now, we need to figure out which object (medium yellow square number three or medium yellow square number two) is to the right of a medium blue square.

- Block ordering from left to right: C, B, A
  - So, in Block C, the Medium Blue Square is to the left of Block B.
  - Since Block B (three yellow squares) is to the right of Block C’s blue square, all the squares in Block B are to the right of the medium blue square in Block C.

Thus, both Medium Yellow Square 3 and Medium Yellow Square 2 are to the right of the Medium Blue Square in Block C.

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium blue triangle and a medium blue square.
   - The medium blue triangle is touching the right edge and is below the medium blue square. 

2. **Block B:**
   - Located above Block A.
   - Contains a big blue square.

3. **Block C:**
   - Located below Block A.
   - Contains two medium yellow squares and a small blue triangle.
   - Medium yellow square number one is above and to the left of medium yellow square number two.
   - The small blue triangle is above and to the left of medium yellow square number two.

Based on this layout:

- The big blue square is in Block B.
- Below the big blue square in Block B, there is Block A.
- Block A contains a medium blue square.

Since Block C is below Block A, right below the medium blue square in Block A, there is likely Block C which has the yellow squares.

Therefore, the medium yellow squares in Block C are essentially below both the big blue square of Block B (indirectly via Block A) and the medium blue square in Block A.

Consequently, below the big blue square, we find the medium yellow square in Block C.

Thus, the correct answer is a medium yellow square because Block B (big blue square) is above Block A, and Block A (medium blue square) is above Block C (medium yellow square).

","To solve this problem, we need to visualize the arrangement of the squares in Block B, as the question pertains to the objects within this specific block.

1. **Understanding the structure of Block B:**
   - Block B contains: two medium blue squares, one medium yellow square, and a medium black square.
   - The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
   - The medium yellow square has medium blue square number two directly beneath it.
   - The text mentions ""Below the medium yellow square, medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one is the medium black square.""

2. **Arranging the squares based on the clues:**
   - Start with the medium black square. It touches the bottom edge, meaning it's at the bottom of Block B.
   - Immediately above the medium black square are medium blue square number two and medium blue square number one. This suggests they are possibly next to each other horizontally but definitely above the black square.
   - Above medium blue square number two is the medium yellow square.

3. **Square Arrangement in Block B:**
   - From bottom to top:
     - Bottom layer: Medium Black Square
     - Middle layer: Medium Blue Square Number One and Medium Blue Square Number Two
     - Top layer: Medium Yellow Square (directly above Medium Blue Square Number Two)

4. **Determining which square is above the medium yellow square:**
   - The medium yellow square has medium blue square number two directly below it.
   - Therefore, medium blue square number two is below the medium yellow square.
   - Medium blue square number one does not have a clear relationship with the yellow square in terms of being above the yellow square (it isn’t mentioned to be above the yellow square). It is beneath, with the number two, closer to the black square.
   - Given this arrangement: Neither medium blue square number two nor medium blue square number one is above medium yellow square.

5. **Final analysis:**
   - Based on the arrangement and the constraints provided, neither medium blue square is positioned above the medium yellow square.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","Let's analyze the setup based on the described configuration:

- **Block A**: Contains one medium blue square.
  
- **Block B**: Positioned above Block A and contains two medium blue squares:
  - Medium blue square number one.
  - Medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number one.

- **Block C**: Positioned to the right of Block A and contains:
  - One medium blue square.
  - One medium black square.
  - One medium yellow square.
  - The medium blue square is below the medium black square and medium yellow square.
  - The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

Now, let's consider the positions:

1. **Block B's Medium Blue Squares**:
   - These squares are above Block A, and hence there's no description of something positioned to their ""right."" Being in Block B means horizontally, they align directly above Block A without reference to Block C.

2. **Block C**:
   - The medium blue square in Block C is positioned below both the medium black square and the medium yellow square. According to the configuration, this medium blue square is indeed directly part of Block C that lies to the right of Block A.

Given this breakdown:

- The medium blue square in Block C has other elements (e.g., other squares in block C) positioned above it but being part of Block C makes this square at a position right to Block A's medium blue square.

Now we compare Block B's blue squares to those in Block A:
- Since Block B is above Block A, neither Block B's squares are positioned to the right of Block A's square in a horizontal sense. Their positioning is more about vertical stacking (Block B being directly over Block A).

In conclusion, the prompt specifies something to the right:
- The medium blue square located in Block C is indeed to the right of Block A’s medium blue square, confirming the interpretation.

Finally, both the medium blue square that is in block C and the blue squares from Block B primarily have vertical relational context and no explicit horizontal alignment comparative states exist reflecting a ""right"" placement as determined by prompt constraints. Thus, the rightmost relevant attribute associated is the medium blue square in Block C fulfilling such an orientation logic based on lateral criteria:

Now, let's figure out which object is below a medium black square:

- In **Block A**, since there are no other objects besides the medium black square mentioned, no object is below the medium black square.

- In **Block B**, medium yellow square number two is directly below the medium black square present in this block. Additionally, medium yellow square number one is below both the medium black square and medium yellow square number two.

5. **Analysis**:
    - Block A's bottom element is the small black triangle, as it is on the bottom edge of Block A.
    - We know the medium yellow circle is to the right of the big yellow circle, occupying the space within Block A.
    - The big blue triangle is in Block B, which is entirely above Block A, so the blue triangle is not to the right of elements in Block A.
    - Therefore, in Block A, to the right of the big yellow circle is not a blue object, since the blue triangle is exclusively in Block B and above everything in Block A. 

In conclusion, based on where elements are located:
- To the right of the big yellow circle in Block A, the only described relevant element is within Block A itself, not within Block B. The small black triangle is on the bottom edge, not directly to the immediate right according to the layout in Block A.

Thus, the correct choice given the layout is:

3. In Block B, there is a medium yellow square and a medium blue square: 
   - The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
   - The yellow square is below the medium blue square.

4. In Block C, there is one medium blue square.

We are asked to find out what is below the yellow object. The yellow object is in Block B and touches the bottom edge of Block B. Since Block C is directly below Block B, the contents of Block C, namely the medium blue square, would be directly under the yellow object.

Block A, which contains the medium black squares, is below Block C. Thus, all of the contents of Block A (including the medium black squares) are logically below Block B and therefore also below the yellow object.

- The big yellow triangle is below the medium yellow circle.
- The medium black square is directly below the medium yellow circle.
- The big yellow triangle is left of the medium black square, which is also under the medium yellow circle.

Now the question is about which object is to the left of a black thing and the medium circle which is touching the right edge of a block, or the big yellow triangle.

From Block B:
- The medium yellow circle (touching the right edge) is above the black square.
- The big yellow triangle is to the left of the black square and to the left of the medium yellow circle (since it is also below it).

Both the big yellow triangle and the medium yellow circle can be left of the black square, but the focus is on the relationship to the black thing.

Given:
- The medium blue square that touches the bottom edge of Block C is below the two medium yellow squares in Block C.

Therefore, below the medium blue square that is touching the bottom edge of Block C, there is Block A which contains a medium blue square. However, the question asks specifically what is below the ""thing"" (medium blue square) touching the bottom edge of Block C, not what Block A contains.

- Block C itself has nothing below the medium blue square because this medium blue square is the bottom-most square in Block C and it is stated to be touching the bottom edge.

- Since Block C is on top and directly above Block A, and Block C's bottom edge medium blue square has nothing in Block C below it, the correct answer pertaining to what is below this is literally Block A.

However, the question implies what square type is directly below if we think vertically in terms of the entire structure; it would be the medium black square in Block B, considering Block A is below Block C and given relative positioning of C to B. Yet by the strict description of ""touching the bottom edge of the block,"" it would align with 3) none of them given above is occupied beyond Block A directly described contents.

","To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the spatial relationship described:

1. **Block A**: Contains a big black square and a small black square. Mention that the big black square is below the small black square.

2. **Block B**: Contains a big black square, a medium blue circle, and a big blue circle. The spatial arrangement within Block B is described as follows:
   - The big black square is to the left of, near to, and above the medium blue circle.
   - The medium blue circle is near to the big blue circle.

Next, we need to identify what is to the left of the big blue circle:
- The medium blue circle is near the big blue circle, indicating proximity.
- The big black square in Block B is mentioned as being to the left of the medium blue circle and by extension, to the left of the big blue circle as well.

Crucially, the problem states that ""Block A is to the left of B,"" but this relation doesn't affect the internal arrangement in Block B concerning proximity to the big blue circle. Therefore, the big black square within Block B is unequivocally to the left of the big blue circle, whereas the small black square from Block A does not come into play because it's in a separate block.

Thus, for the arrangement described, the big black square in Block B is positioned to the left of the big blue circle within Block B.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is to the left of a medium yellow square, we need to consider the arrangement of the blocks and squares as described:

1. **Block A**: Contains two medium black squares and one medium blue square. The structure has:
   - A medium blue square with a medium black square below it (black square number two).
   - Another medium black square (black square number one) at the bottom of the block.

2. **Block B**: Contains one medium yellow square.

3. **Block C**: Contains two medium yellow squares, with one square (medium yellow square number one) touching the bottom edge of the block, and another (medium yellow square number two) above it.

Based on the description:
- Block A is to the left of Block B.
- Block B is below Block C.

- **Which medium yellow square are we considering?**
   - One medium yellow square is in Block B.
   - Block C has two medium yellow squares, and the one touching the bottom edge of Block C was described explicitly.

- **Identifying the objects:**
   - Medium yellow square number one (touching the bottom of Block C) does not have Block A directly to its left because Block B is between A and C vertically. However, Block B is below Block C, so the relative left position of Block A doesn't affect the placement of squares in Block C.
   - The medium yellow square in Block B could directly have Block A to its left.

Thus, only the medium yellow square in Block B has the potential of having the blue square or black squares from Block A to its left, but it doesn't mean they are directly left of it, because Block B is situated overall below Block C.

Therefore, considering the most direct relationship and the problem's description, Block A being overall to the left of Block B would mean:

- Block A's contents (including the blue thing) are to the left of Block B's medium yellow square.

Hence, the **blue thing** in Block A is technically to the left of Block B's medium yellow square.

Moreover, whether a square in Block C is affected by Block A's position is inconclusive given the below statement, as Block B is directly in line vertically.

Therefore,

- The medium yellow square that is definitively impacted and to the lower quadrant is Block B, where the blue thing impacts, and for Block C, it only matters vertical height-wise rather than horizontally given the placement.

Thus, ultimately considering the description of Blocks and placement, the answer regarding the initial question refers to Block B's medium yellow square being the direct one that is assessed, given Block A's reputation *overall left-position*.

Considering given data and deducing relative positions, the cleaner choice would be the direct object within Block A next to sub-structure.

- The small yellow circle in Block B is below and to the right of the big blue square.
- Block C contains the small yellow square and the big yellow square (touching Block C's right edge).

To find what is to the right of the small yellow circle within the sequence of blocks:

- Since the small yellow circle is closer to the right side of Block B, we move to Block C.
- In Block C, the big yellow square is positioned touching its right edge, which implies that it is the furthermost shape to the right within Blocks B and C.

","To determine which object is to the right of a medium black square, we first need to visualize the arrangement of the blocks and squares.

Let's start with the description of each block:

- **Block A**: Contains three medium squares: a medium blue, a medium black, and a medium yellow square. Arranged vertically, with the medium blue square at the bottom, the medium black square above it, and the medium yellow square at the top. Therefore, in Block A:
  - Top: Medium Yellow Square
  - Middle: Medium Black Square
  - Bottom: Medium Blue Square

- **Block B**: Contains two medium black squares, arranged vertically:
  - Top: Medium Black Square (square number one)
  - Bottom: Medium Black Square (square number two)

- **Block C**: Contains one medium yellow square.

Next, we analyze the spatial layout:

1. Block A is left of Block B, and Block C is to the right of Block B.
2. We are to identify which medium yellow square is to the right of a medium black square.

    - The medium yellow square in **Block A** is not to the right of any medium black square because it is within the same block and positioned vertically above a medium black square.

    - In **Block B**, there are two medium black squares, but there are no yellow squares in this block.

    - The medium yellow square in **Block C** is to the right of the medium black squares of Block B because Block C is entirely positioned to the right of Block B.

Considering these observations, the medium yellow square in Block C is the one that fits the spatial description of being to the right of a medium black square.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationship between the shapes on Block A and Block B, and particularly what is located above the small yellow square on Block B.

Let's break down the given information:

- Block A has:
  - A medium black circle at the left edge.
  - A big yellow circle at the bottom edge.
  - The medium black circle is above and to the left of the big yellow circle.
  - A medium yellow triangle.
  - A medium yellow circle
  - A small yellow circle to the right of the big yellow circle.
  - Below and near the medium yellow triangle is the small yellow circle.

- Block B has a small yellow square.

Now, we place these elements according to the problem's description:

1. **Placement of the Black Circle and Big Yellow Circle**:
   - The medium black circle is touching the left edge.
   - The big yellow circle is touching the bottom edge.
   - Since the black circle is above and to the left of the big yellow circle, and the big yellow circle is at the bottom, the big yellow circle must be near the bottom left corner of Block A.

2. **Placement of the Medium Yellow Circle and Triangle**:
   - There is a medium yellow circle mentioned somewhere on the block, not specifically placed in relation to other objects, except that it is not below the small yellow circle.
   - The medium yellow triangle is above the small yellow circle (since the problem states ""below and near to the medium yellow triangle there is the small yellow circle"").

3. **Placement of the Small Yellow Circle**:
   - It's to the right of the big yellow circle and below the medium yellow triangle.

Now, let's determine what might be directly above the small yellow square on Block B:

- The position of Block A relative to Block B isn’t specified precisely, but because the question is concerned with what's ""above the square"", we assume Block A is directly above Block B. 

- Considering the criteria involving the placement on Block A, the medium yellow circle appears to not be interacting with other shapes and isn't placed above or below anything specific except it's on Block A. Given there is no ""medium yellow circle"" near the bottom where Block B would be directly beneath (if A overlaps B entirely at some points, knowing the medium yellow is not the very bottom most object elevates its position), the medium yellow triangle is above the small yellow circle (which is most likely considered in direct relation above Block B).

Finally, from Block A's likely layout, the medium yellow triangle would be above, assuming the medium yellow circle isn't especially placed lower than where the triangle may come up as a possibility due to its size and positioning below (small circle under the triangle).

This reasoning specialization (considering A's relative unspecified positioning, its elements' placement, and the problem framing — emphasizing ""above"" rather than ""partway over""), would suggest the medium yellow triangle's presence above Block B's square.

Therefore, what is directly above the small yellow square on Block B is likely the **medium yellow triangle**.

Thus, the appropriate choice is:

- In Block A, medium black square number two is above medium black square number one, and since medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block A, there can be no square below.
  
- In Block B, there is only one medium black square, and there's no information about any square below it.

- Block C is above Block B and to the right of Block A. Thus, none of the medium blue squares in Block C are below any black square in Block A or Block B.

   - A big yellow circle.
   - A medium blue circle.
   - A small black triangle that touches the bottom edge of this block.

2. It is stated that below and to the left of a medium yellow circle, there is a small black triangle. However, we notice there is no explicit mention of both a medium yellow circle itself. Instead, we have a medium blue circle and a big yellow circle. Suppose the ""medium yellow circle"" is a typographical error, and the intention is to refer only to the big yellow circle (""B"") or something similar.

3. The small black square touches the right edge of the block, positioning it as further right compared to the other elements in the list.

4. The big yellow circle is near to the small black triangle, suggesting proximity between these two elements.

5. The small black square is above:
   - The small black triangle.
   - The implicitly referenced ""medium yellow circle"" (potential interpretative error).

6. The question asks what is below the ""medium yellow circle"" (assuming it's a misinterpretation and referring to the big yellow circle or intended layer):
   - We know the triangle (""T"") touches the bottom edge and is described as below and to the left of the implicitly referenced circle.
   - The black square (""S"") is placed along the right edge, so logically below this erroneously labeled ""medium yellow circle"" could not be interpreted as literally below unless side placement is a factor in contextual arrangement.

After rationalizing both the positioning and probable intent of terms used, it seems the problem description attempts to consolidate the hierarchy related to explicitly knowing whether the black square functions as the lowest position or below required item along layer bereft of hierarchical offset parallel to presented elements or above.

   - A small yellow circle.

2. **Relevant information:**
   - The small blue triangle is to the left of the big yellow circle. Since there is no indication that the small blue triangle is above or below any particular object, we can't assume its vertical position relative to the blue shapes.
   - The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - The big yellow circle is also touching the right edge.
   - The small yellow circle is above medium blue triangle number one.
   - To the right of and below medium blue triangle number two is the big blue triangle. This implies that medium blue triangle number two is above the big blue triangle.
   - To the right of medium blue triangle number two is the big yellow circle.

3. **Positioning of small yellow circle:**
   - The small yellow circle is specifically stated to be above medium blue triangle number one. Since medium blue triangle number two is above the big blue triangle, it's reasonable to conclude that medium blue triangle number one is also positioned above the big blue triangle.
   - Therefore, the small yellow circle is above the medium blue triangle number one, which in turn is positioned above the big blue triangle.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the positions described, the small yellow circle is directly stated to be above medium blue triangle number one, which is above the big blue triangle.

   - Medium blue square number one touches the bottom edge of Block C.
   - The medium blue square number one is below the yellow object, which in turn is below medium blue square number two.

Now let's look into the question:

- **Block A's black square** is coupled with the information that Block B is below Block A. 
  - This implies the yellow square in Block B could indeed be below the black square in Block A.

- For **Block C**, the relative positions provided don't affect anything above Block C (since Block C is mentioned to the left of A by positioning, not necessarily above or below). The positioning of objects in Block C only matters within C itself. The details in Block C's description manage the arrangement of squares there but don't indicate any influence from Block A.
  
Thus, the medium yellow square in Block C isn't directly associated with being below Block A's square.

In conclusion, only the yellow square in Block B is below the black object in Block A. The square in Block C is irrelevant to the positioning with respect to Block A.

The correct answer is that the medium yellow square in Block B is below the black object. 

Therefore, it is option 0. The final answer is: 

{0}"

1. **Block A**: 
    - Two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
    - Medium black square number one is at the bottom of block A, below both medium black square number two and the medium blue square.
    - Medium blue square is immediately below medium black square number two.

2. **Block B**:
    - Contains a medium blue square and a medium black square.
    - The medium blue square is below the medium black square.

**Question**: Which medium blue square is below a medium black square?
 
- In **Block A**, the medium blue square is below the medium black square number two. Hence, the medium blue square in Block A is indeed below a medium black square.

- In **Block B**, the medium blue square is also below the medium black square.

Both medium blue squares (one in each block) are below a medium black square.

Therefore, the answer is option 2: both of them.

A big yellow triangle is touching the right edge of this block. This block also has a medium blue circle. The big blue triangle is below the medium blue circle. It is to the left of the big yellow triangle. Near to and to the right of the medium blue circle is the small blue circle. This shape is to the left of the big yellow triangle.

0) the small black circle 
1) the big yellow triangle  that is touching the right edge of  a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the positions of each object within the two blocks.

1. **Block A** contains:
   - One small black circle.
   - One medium black circle.
   - The small black circle is to the right of and near the medium black circle.

2. **Block B** contains:
   - A big blue triangle touching the bottom edge.
   - A big blue circle.
   - A small blue circle.
   - A medium blue circle.
   - The big blue triangle is below the medium blue circle.
   - The big yellow triangle is touching the right edge.

   Further descriptions for Block B:
   - The medium blue circle is above the big blue triangle.
   - The small blue circle is near to and to the right of the medium blue circle.
   - This entire description confirms that all described blue circles and triangles are in Block B.
   - It also specifies that the big yellow triangle is to the right edge of Block B and to the right of the medium and small blue circles.

Next, the problem asks which object is below the medium black circle in Block A.

- Since Block B is directly below Block A:
  - The positioning of Block B’s contents below Block A are crucial. The whole of Block B, including the big yellow triangle, is present below Block A due to its placement ""below"" Block A.

Assessment based on description:
- The medium black circle in Block A is towards the left (since the small black circle is to the right of it).
- Given Block B is directly below Block A in its entirety, the big yellow triangle, being on the right edge of Block B, wouldn't align with the medium black circle in Block A. Thus, it should not be directly below it.
  
Therefore, the object below the medium black circle is the big yellow triangle that is part of Block B, as Block B is defined as 'below' Block A, and it occupies that lower space, even though it is to the right edge in its configuration.

Conclusively, the big yellow triangle is positioned below, but not directly aligned. The small black circle remains within Block A, never below Block A. Thus, only the big yellow triangle is nominally ""below"" by spatial arrangement.

- Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.
- Below a medium black square is medium blue square number two.
- Below the medium black square (which is above medium blue square number two) and medium blue square number two there is medium blue square number one.

Arranging them from bottom to top, the order in Block A is:
1. Medium blue square number one (touching the bottom edge).
2. Medium blue square number two.
3. Medium black square (above medium blue square number two).

**Block B:**
- Contains only one medium black square. 
(There are no other squares in this block mentioned, so no need to consider further)

**Block C:**
- Contains one medium blue square.
- A medium yellow square below the medium blue square, touching the bottom edge of this block.

In Block C, the arrangement is:
1. Medium yellow square (touching the bottom edge).
2. Medium blue square (above the medium yellow square).

Now, to answer the question of which object is below a medium black square:
- In Block A, medium blue square number two is located directly below the medium black square.
- The medium blue square number one (in Block A) is not directly below the medium black square, as medium blue square number two is between them.
- In Block C, the medium blue square is not below a medium black square, as Block C has no black square above it.

Therefore, the medium blue square number one, which is touching the bottom edge of Block A, is not under a medium black square. The only medium blue square that is below a medium black square is medium blue square number two in Block A.

Now, let's determine what is to the right:

- The medium blue square in block A is to the left of block B (since block B is next to block A) and block C (since block C is to the right of blocks A and B). Therefore, both the medium yellow square in block B and the medium yellow square in block C are to the right of the medium blue square in block A.

- The medium blue square in block C:
  - The medium blue square in block C is below the medium black and medium yellow squares in the same block C. Within block C, the positions are vertically described:
    - The yellow square is on top, the black square is below the yellow, and the blue square is the lowest.
  - The medium yellow square in block C is above the medium blue square, not to the right.

","To solve this problem, we will break down the placement of each block and square step by step and analyze their positions.

1. **Block C** 
   - Block C has two medium yellow squares.
   - The description states: ""Below medium yellow square number two is medium yellow square number one."" This implies a vertical arrangement where medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two. 
   - Therefore, Block C's arrangement in descending order is:
     - Top: Medium Yellow Square 2
     - Bottom: Medium Yellow Square 1

2. **Block A** 
   - Block A has one medium yellow square. It is not specified which square in Block C aligns with Block A's square, but Block A only contains one medium yellow square.

3. **Block B**
   - Block B has two medium black squares.
   - The description gives a more complex positional relation: ""Below medium black square number two and a medium yellow square is medium black square number one.""
   - Which suggests:
     - Top: Medium Black Square 2
     - Middle: Medium Yellow Square (from Block A)
     - Bottom: Medium Black Square 1

Now, to answer the question: ""Which object is to the left of a medium yellow square? Medium black square number two or medium black square number one?""

- We analyze the placement of medium black squares in relation to Block C's squares:
  - In Block B's top to bottom arrangement, Medium Black Square 2 (Top) is directly above a Medium Yellow Square (Middle from Block A). However, since Block C is entirely to the right of both blocks A and B, the term ""to the left of"" implies horizontal positioning in either Block A or B.
  
  - Medium Black Square 1 (Bottom) is again directly underneath a Medium Yellow Square.

Hence, relative to Block B: 
- Medium Black Square 2 is precisely over the horizontal line of the Medium Yellow Square.
- Medium Black Square 1 is below, but still in-line horizontally, compared to Block C, which is at the extreme right.

Ultimately, neither a medium black square is to the left of the medium yellow square in a horizontal scan because both are aligned below and above on a vertical column.

- The medium black square is directly below medium blue square number two.
- Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two but above the medium yellow square.
- The medium yellow square is at the lowest position among these objects.

- In **Block A**, the order from top to bottom is: medium yellow square, medium blue square.

The medium blue square in Block A is below its medium yellow square. In the vertical stack of Block A, the blue square does not interact with items outside of Block A.

Since Block C is entirely to the left of Block A (as Block C is to the left of Block A), all items within Block C are to the left of any item within Block A.

Ask which yellow square is to the left of a blue object:
1. The medium yellow square in Block A cannot be to the left of a blue object, as it is vertically aligned with its blue square counterpart within the same block.

- Block A contains two medium blue squares.
- Let’s denote medium blue square number one as A1 and medium blue square number two as A2.
- According to the description, A1 is below A2.

Thus, the configuration for Block A is:
```
A
---

**Step 2: Block B**

- Block B is to the right of Block A and contains two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
- The medium black squares are denoted as B1 (medium black square number one) and B2 (medium black square number two).
- The blue square in Block B is denoted as B3.

The description states:
- B1 is below B3 (the medium blue square in Block B).
- B2 is below B1.

Thus, the configuration for Block B is:
```
B
---
| B3 |  (medium blue)
| B1 |  (medium black)
| B2 |  (medium black)
```

**Step 3: Determine the position relative to medium black squares**

We need to determine which square is to the left of a medium black square:
- B1 and B2 are the medium black squares in question.
- The medium blue square (B3) in Block B is directly above B1 and B2, so it is not to the left.
- A2 (medium blue square number two) from Block A is in Block A, which is to the left of Block B.

As Block A is entirely to the left of Block B, A2 is the square that is to the left of a medium black square from Block B (specifically, both B1 and B2).

4. **Hierarchy of Arrangement in Block B:**
   - The big blue square is stacked over the medium black square and the small blue square, indicating it may be physically above them in the vertical space within Block B.

5. **Relative Positioning:**
   - Block A is to the left of Block B.

Considering the lateral (left-right) spatial arrangement:
- The small blue triangle on Block A is the leftmost item (Block A being to the left of Block B).
- The blocks have no further information suggesting overlap horizontally.
- Hence, Block B's components are collectively to the right of the small blue triangle in terms of horizontal positioning across blocks.

6. **Options Analysis:**
   - 0) Medium black square that is touching the right edge of Block B (part of Block B, so right of Block A's triangle)
   - 1) Big blue square (part of Block B, also right of Block A's triangle)
   - 2) Both of them (both are in Block B and hence to the right)

   - Since medium yellow square number one is below the medium black square and it cannot be exactly vertically under it (because square three is there), place medium yellow square number one elsewhere in the structure, prioritizing its arrangement with, or below, square number three. 
   - Medium yellow square number two is below both the black square and medium yellow square number three. It might be elsewhere in a further lower layer or in a way that does not go exactly vertically below the black square.

4. **Conclusion**: Given this setup where each number arrangement fills the conditions using unique placements horizontally and vertically,
   - Medium yellow square number one lies in a position vertically away from direct below the medium black square and meets its relative called conditions to square number three.
   - Medium yellow square number two is not directly under the medium black square but is under other configurations as stated and does not have direct vertical relation for the medium black square.

Thus, the question of which object is directly above a medium black square is best answered by medium yellow square number one, upon understanding that arrangement logically concludes placements. No other square sits directly and unilaterally above within this setup.

The final conclusion is:
\[ \text{Medium yellow square number two is not directly above the medium black square, while medium yellow square number one is described as having a placement engaging logically compatible with being under the top layer configuration of the black square over three. This analysis leads to the correct option being medium yellow square number one.} \]

   - The big black square is below the small black square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains: one big black square, one medium blue circle, and one big blue circle.
   - The big black square is to the left of, near to, and above the medium blue circle.
   - The medium blue circle is near to the big blue circle.

Now, let's address the question: ""What is below the small shape?""

- We establish that the small shape is the small black square in Block A.

In Block A:
- The small black square is above the big black square. Therefore, the big black square is directly under the small black square in Block A.

There is no mention of the medium blue circle being in Block A, and since Block A is separate from Block B, the medium blue circle cannot be directly below the small black square in Block A. Therefore, the positioning of the medium blue circle in Block B is irrelevant to what's right below the small black square in Block A.

Conclusively, the shape directly below the small black square in Block A is the big black square.

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains a medium black circle and a big black square.
   - It is suggested that the medium black circle is to the right of the big black square.
   - There is also a medium yellow triangle to the right of the big black square.
   - Therefore, the placement in Block A might be: big black square, medium black circle, then medium yellow triangle.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains a medium yellow circle, a big blue square, a small yellow triangle, and a small yellow square.
   - The placement is: the medium yellow circle is near to the big blue square, which is further placed near to and to the right of the small yellow triangle. The small yellow triangle is above and near to the small yellow square.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains a medium blue circle and a big yellow triangle.
   - The medium blue circle is to the left of, near to, and below the big yellow triangle.

Given this spatial setup:
- Block B is to the left of Block A, and Block A is to the left of Block C.
- The medium blue circle is in Block C.

We need to determine what is to the left of the medium blue circle in Block C. Since Block B and Block A are to the left of Block C, contents from Block A are closer to Block C than those from Block B. Thus, the leftmost elements from A impact C.

From Block A:
- The order within Block A is big black square, medium black circle, medium yellow triangle.
- Since the medium blue circle is in Block C and Block A is adjacent to Block C, the elements near the division between the blocks will influence what is to the left of the medium blue circle.

Focusing on the immediate objects, the medium yellow triangle from Block A is likely to be the closest to Block C, and therefore closer to the medium blue circle in Block C.

Thus, it seems plausible that the medium yellow triangle is the immediate object experienced as being to the left of the medium blue circle in Block C. Therefore, the medium black circle is not described as being positioned close enough by the given setup and order of objects.

Considering all of this detailed problem breakdown, the medium yellow triangle (originating from Block A) can be considered to be to the left of the medium blue circle in Block C.

In Block B:
- We have a small blue circle.
- A medium black circle.
- A small blue square.

According to the description, the positioning is as follows:
- The medium black circle is to the right of the small blue square.
- The small blue circle is to the left of and above the medium black circle.

This implies the small blue circle could be directly to the left of the medium black circle but also positioned higher. The placement seems to follow a left-to-right pattern starting with the small blue square.

The sequence according to the provided constraints can be:
- Small blue square (leftmost).
- Medium black circle (to the right of the small blue square).
- Small blue circle is positioned left of the medium black circle and above it.

Therefore, when considering what is directly to the right of the small blue circle, the definition provides that small blue circle is to the left of the medium black circle. It doesn't mention it being above the small blue square, so the only logical possibility directly to its right is the medium black circle.

","To determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square, let's analyze the description step by step:

1. **Block A's Configuration:**
   - Block A is to the right of Block B.
   - Block A consists of two medium black squares, designated as:
     - Medium black square number one
     - Medium black square number two
   - Square number one is below square number two.

2. **Block B's Configuration:**
   - Block B consists of two medium yellow squares, designated as:
     - Medium yellow square number one
     - Medium yellow square number two
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
   - A medium black square touches the bottom edge of Block B.

3. **Relationships between squares:**
   - The medium black square that's touching the bottom edge of Block B is said to be below both medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one.
   - Block B as a whole is to the left of Block A.

Given this information:

- We know that any squares in Block A are to the right of all squares in Block B because Block A itself is to the right of Block B.
- Therefore, both medium black square number one and medium black square number two are to the right of any square in Block B, including both medium yellow squares.

Thus, since all of Block A's squares are to the right of Block B's squares, including both of its yellow squares, we conclude that:

- Medium black square number two is indeed to the right of any medium yellow square because it is part of Block A.
- The medium black square that touches the bottom edge of Block B is positioned below medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two. Given that Block B is entirely to the left, this square is not to the right of the yellow squares.

Therefore, the correct answer is that medium black square number two, which belongs to Block A, is to the right of a medium yellow square in Block B. The medium black square touching the bottom edge of Block B is not because it is below and part of Block B structures.

   - Contains a medium black square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains a medium black square.
   - Contains a medium blue square below the medium black square.
   - Contains a medium yellow square below the medium blue square, meaning it is two levels below the medium black square.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains a medium black square.

- **Block B** is to the right of **Block A**.
- **Block A** is below **Block C**.

This means the spatial positions are as follows:
```
   C
   A B
```
Analyzing the options for objects to the right of a medium black square:
- The medium black square in **Block C** has Block A directly below it, but nothing is directly to its right. So, there is no object to the right of the medium black square in Block C.
- The medium black square in **Block B** does not have any object to its right within Block B, as described. There is nothing specific mentioned to be to its right externally either.

Thus:
- For the medium black square in Block C: **nothing is directly to its right**.

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium blue square.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below both medium yellow square number two and the medium blue square.
   - Medium blue square is below medium yellow square number two.
   - The arrangement implies that the medium blue square is above medium yellow square number one but still within Block A, and no squares are mentioned as touching the bottom edge of Block A.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium blue squares.
   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
   - Medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one. 

Now, we focus on Block B to determine the arrangement:
- Medium blue square number one in Block B is directly touching the bottom edge of Block B.
- Medium blue square number two is above medium blue square number one, hence also in Block B and located above, not touching the bottom edge.

Now consider the question: Which object is to the right of a thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block?

- The only square that is touching the bottom edge of a block in the provided description is the medium blue square number one in Block B.
- To the right of Block B is Block A. Within Block A, there is no indication of any square directly interacting with medium blue square number one from Block B.

Since Block B is on the left and Block A on the right, from the perspective of Block B, it could appear that the entire Block A is ""right"" of Block B. However, the exact arrangement within Blocks implies no square in Block A is said to be directly right of medium blue square number one in Block B.

Therefore:
- Medium blue square number two in Block B is not to the right as it’s above medium blue square number one in Block B.

3. **Analyzing the positions**:
   - Medium blue square number two is above the medium yellow square.
   - Medium yellow square is above medium blue square number one.

By listing the layers vertically in Block B:
- Top: Medium blue square number two
- Middle: Medium yellow square
- Next: Medium blue square number one
- Bottom: Medium black square

Given this description, the big black triangle is at the bottom and the big blue triangle is somewhere above it within Block A. Therefore, the big black triangle is directly below the big blue triangle in Block A.

2. **Block B Configuration**:
    - Below Block A.
    - Contains two medium blue circles and a small black triangle.
    - Medium blue circle number one is to the left of and near to medium blue circle number two. 
    - The small black triangle is below and to the left of medium blue circle number one.

Block B contains no big blue triangles, only medium blue circles and a small black triangle.

3. **Question Evaluation**:
    - Which object is below a big blue triangle?
    - Options: The big object touching the bottom edge of a block (big black triangle) or the small black triangle.

From the analysis:
- The big black triangle in Block A is below the big blue triangle since it is touching the bottom edge of Block A and is below the big blue triangle.
- The small black triangle is in Block B, which is separate and below Block A, but there is no indication it is directly below a big blue triangle within Block B.

Hence, only the big black triangle, which is in Block A, is below the big blue triangle. Therefore, the correct answer is:

","To determine what is below the medium yellow square in Block C, let's evaluate the positions of the blocks and the squares they contain.

1. **Block Configuration:**
   - Block A is below Block C.
   - Block C is to the right of Block B.

2. **Block Contents:**
   - **Block A** contains:
     - Medium black square number one (bottom of Block A).
     - Medium blue square (above medium black square number one).
     - Medium black square number two (above the medium blue square).
   - **Block B** contains:
     - One medium black square.
   - **Block C** contains:
     - One medium yellow square.

3. **Relative Positions:**
   - The medium yellow square is within Block C.
   - Block A, which contains medium black square number two, is below Block C.
   - Block C is to the right of Block B, where the single medium black square of Block B is located.
   - Since Block C is to the right of Block B, the medium black square in Block B cannot be directly below anything in Block C.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The yellow square in Block C is situated directly over Block A, since Block A is below Block C.
   - Specifically, within Block A, the medium yellow square aligns vertically with Block A.
   - Given Block A's contents, medium black square number two is positioned highest in Block A, followed by the medium blue square, and then medium black square number one.

Thus, the thing directly below the medium yellow square in Block C, based on the vertical configuration, would be medium black square number two in Block A.

1. Block A has a medium yellow square.
2. Block B is to the left of Block A and has four squares: two medium blue and two medium yellow.
3. The two medium blue squares and two medium yellow squares in Block B are arranged such that:

   - Below medium yellow square number two, medium blue square number two, and medium yellow square number one, there is medium blue square number one.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium blue square number two and medium yellow square number two.

4. Block C is below Block B and contains a medium blue square.

Let's determine which medium yellow square has something below it:

- In Block A, we have one medium yellow square. The problem statement does not specify anything about Block A having something below its medium yellow square.

- For Block B:
  - The description states that medium yellow square number one is below medium blue square number two and medium yellow square number two. Furthermore, below medium yellow square number one, there is a medium blue square (number one as mentioned). Therefore, medium yellow square number one in Block B has medium blue square number one directly below it.

Now, determine which object is below a medium yellow square:
- The medium yellow square in Block A does not have information indicating something is below it.
- Medium yellow square number one in Block B has medium blue square number one directly below it.

Thus, medium yellow square number one in Block B has an object below it, whereas the medium yellow square in Block A does not have a specified arrangement indicating something below it.

The medium yellow square with something below it is **medium yellow square number one in Block B**.

1. **Block A**: Contains one medium yellow square.  
2. **Block B**: 
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of block B.
   - Medium black square number two is below the medium yellow square in block A.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two and the medium yellow square (indicating number one is at the bottom of block B, and number two is above it within block B).
   
From this, we deduce that the vertical order in block B (from top to bottom) is:
- Medium black square number two (somewhere in the middle of block B since it has to be below the yellow square in block A).
- Medium black square number one (at the bottom edge of block B).

3. **Block C**: Contains a medium black square, and it is to the right of block A, meaning its black square is aligned horizontally with the yellow square in block A.

Now, let's determine which object is to the right of the medium yellow square:
- The medium black square in block C is directly to the right of the yellow square since the problem specifies that block C is to the right of block A.
- Medium black square number two is directly below the yellow square in block A, meaning it is not to its right.

Therefore, the object to the right of the medium yellow square is the medium black square in block C.

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains one medium blue square.
   - A medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - Conclusion: Since the medium yellow square is directly below the medium blue square in Block A, the medium yellow square is not related to any black squares in Block B beneath Block A.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - The configuration is:
     - Medium black square number two is situated above medium black square number one.
   - It doesn't specify any yellow square in connection with Block B.

3. **Block C:**
   - Placed above both Block B and Block A.
   - Contains one medium yellow square which is positioned above both Block B and Block A.

Given this information, let's analyze the possible configurations:

- The medium yellow square from Block C is at a higher position compared to all squares in both Block A and Block B, so it does not directly touch any black squares in Block B.
  
- The yellow square in Block A is below the medium blue square of Block A and is not relevant to any medium black squares since Block B is at a different stack/block.

Therefore, the conclusion is that neither medium black square number one nor medium black square number two is situated below any medium yellow squares from the specified descriptions.

","To solve this problem, let's analyze the placement of squares in each block step by step:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains two medium blue squares and one medium yellow square.
   - The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - This yellow square is placed below the medium blue square number two.
   - The first blue square is positioned below the second blue square.
   - Therefore, in **Block A**, the order from top to bottom is:
     - Blue square number two
     - Blue square number one
     - Yellow square

2. **Block B**:
   - Positioned below Block A.
   - Contains one medium yellow square.
   - The problem doesn't state anything is above or below this yellow square in Block B, just that it exists in the block.

3. **Block C**:
   - Positioned above Block A.
   - Contains one medium blue square, one medium black square, and one medium yellow square.
   - The medium blue square touches the bottom edge of Block C.
   - The order in Block C from top to bottom is:
     - Yellow square
     - Black square
     - Blue square

Now, we need to determine which medium yellow square, if any, is above a medium blue square:

- The medium yellow square in **Block B**:
  - Since Block B is completely below Block A, this yellow square is below all of Block A's squares. According to our layout in Block A, this puts Block B's yellow square below the medium blue squares in Block A.
  - Therefore, in terms of entire composition (A above B), the yellow square in Block B is not above any blue square.

- The medium yellow square in **Block C**:
  - Within Block C, the medium yellow square is at the top, above both the black square and the blue square.
  - Therefore, this yellow square is above a medium blue square within its own block.

Concluding from our analysis, the medium yellow square in Block C is the only one positioned above a medium blue square, while the yellow square in Block B is not.

","To solve the problem, let's carefully analyze the layout of the blocks:

1. **Block A**: 
   - Contains: A medium black triangle.

2. **Block B** (positioned above Block A):
   - Contains: A big blue square, a big yellow circle, and a big blue circle.
   - Arrangement: 
     - The big blue circle is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
     - The big blue square is to the right of the big blue circle and the big yellow circle.

3. **Block C** (positioned below Block A):
   - Contains: A big black square, a medium yellow square, and a small black triangle.
   - Arrangement: 
     - The big black square is to the left of the medium yellow square and the small black triangle.

Next, we need to determine what is directly above the big black square in Block C:

- Since Block B is directly above Block A, and Block A is directly above Block C, the content in Block B that aligns vertically over elements in Block C needs to be assessed.
- The big black square in Block C is located to the leftmost position within its block.
  
Given that, let's analyze Block B again:
- The big blue circle is touching the bottom edge of its block (Block B) and is more likely aligned vertically over the left-side area.
- From the descriptions, there is no indication that the big yellow circle is located in a left-side position compared to the big blue circle or the big blue square.
  
Thus, it is most logical that the **big blue circle**, touching the bottom edge of Block B, aligns vertically above the **big black square** in Block C because they are both placed on the left side of their respective blocks.

Considering these points, the correct answer is that the big blue circle touching the bottom edge of a block is above the big black square.

Analyzing block B:
- Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge. 
- The only squares positioned below or around blue square number one would potentially be medium blue square number two, the medium yellow square, and the medium black square. However, since blue square number two is above blue square number one, and the yellow and black squares are aligned under blue square two, it is highly likely that the medium yellow square in block B is positioned near enough (likely below) the shapes touching the bottom edge of block B (given its description and proximity).

Thus, the medium yellow square in block B is below medium blue square two, which is also interacting with medium blue square one, making it fulfill the criteria.

","Let's break down the information given for each block:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
   - Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of the block, below the medium blue square, and below medium black square number two.
   - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.
   - The medium blue square is above medium black square number one but below medium black square number two.
   - Thus, medium blue square is above medium black square number one.

3. **Block C**:
   - Has one medium black square.
   - There is no mention of anything being above the medium black square in block C.

Now, we need to determine which object—either the yellow square in Block A or the blue square in Block B—is above any medium black square.

- In Block A, there is no other object mentioned that the yellow square is above. Thus, the yellow square is not above any medium black square.
- In Block B, the medium blue square is above medium black square number one.

Since the blue square in Block B is above one of the medium black squares, the correct answer is the blue object.

Therefore, the correct choice is:

3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem, let's analyze the positions of the blocks and the shapes:

1. **Block A:** 
   - Contains a *medium black square*.
   - A *medium yellow square* is touching the bottom edge of Block A, and it is below the medium black square.

2. **Block B:** 
   - Located below Block A.
   - Contains a *medium blue square*.

3. **Block C:** 
   - Located above Block B.
   - Contains a *medium blue square* and a *medium yellow square*.
   - The medium yellow square is above the medium blue square in Block C.

Now, we need to determine which object is directly above a medium blue square. There are two medium blue squares: one in Block B and one in Block C.

- **Medium blue square in Block B:** 
  - Block A is on top of Block B.
  - The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of Block A is indirectly above the medium blue square in Block B (since it's part of Block A).

- **Medium blue square in Block C:** 
  - The medium yellow square in Block C is directly above it as per the description.

Now, comparing the two options given:

- **""the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block"":** This describes the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of Block A, which is indirectly above the medium blue square in Block B.

- **""the medium yellow square that is in block C"":** This refers to the medium yellow square directly above the medium blue square in Block C.

Upon analyzing, the *medium yellow square in Block C* is directly above the medium blue square in Block C, while the square touching the bottom edge of Block A (the medium yellow square) is indirectly above the medium blue square in Block B. Direct positioning takes precedence.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

","To determine which object is to the left of the small blue circle in Block C, let's consider the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the blocks and objects:

1. **Block Structure and Positioning:**
   - Block A contains one big yellow triangle.
   - Block B contains a small black square and a small black circle, with the small black circle near the small black square.
   - Block C contains a small blue circle and a big blue triangle. The small blue circle is near the big blue triangle, which is touching the right edge of Block C. Block C is positioned above Block A and to the right of Block B.

2. **Logical Deduction:**
   - Since Block C is above Block A and to the right of Block B, the objects inside Block A and Block B cannot be directly left of any objects inside Block C. This is because blocks in distinct locations in different positional relationships do not share immediate horizontal alignment unless specified.
   - Thus, to determine what is directly to the left of the small blue circle in Block C, you have to consider only the contents of Block C. Given the statement that the big blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block C and is near the small blue circle, it's reasonable to infer that the small blue circle is positioned to the left of this large triangle, within the confines of Block C, but not influenced by the contents of other blocks.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the objects in Block A and Block B are not positioned within Block C, neither the black square nor the big yellow triangle is to the left of the small blue circle.

Therefore, the answer is that none of the objects in Blocks A and B are to the left of the small blue circle in Block C.

   - Contains a medium black circle touching the right edge.
   - Contains a big black circle.
   - Contains a big blue triangle.
   - Small black square number one is below and near the big blue triangle.
   - Small black square number two is to the left of the big blue triangle and the medium black circle.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains a big black square.

Since Block B is to the right of Block A, anything in Block A is naturally to the left of any object in Block B according to the given positions.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains a big yellow circle and is below Block A. Objects in Block C wouldn't affect the horizontal positioning relative to Block B.

To determine which specific objects from Block A are to the left of the big black square in Block B:

- The medium black circle in Block A is touching the right edge of Block A.
- The big blue triangle is in Block A.

Now we consider the choices:

- Option 0: the medium black circle that is touching the right edge of Block A. Since Block A is to the left of Block B, this puts the entire Block A including this medium black circle to the left of the big black square in Block B.
- Option 1: the big blue triangle is also in Block A, so this is also to the left of the big black square in Block B.

","To determine which medium black square is above a medium yellow square, let's visualize or map out the problem as described:

1. **Block A**:
   - It contains two medium black squares.
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

   This means, in terms of placement within block A:
   - Medium black square number two is at the top.
   - Medium black square number one is directly below it.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

3. **Block C**:
   - It is positioned below block B and to the right of block A.
   - Contains one medium blue square.
   - A medium yellow square is below the medium blue square within block C.

Given these placements, we have two medium yellow squares in total: one in block B and one in block C (below the blue one).

Now, we need to determine the relationship of the medium yellow square, specifically the one in block B, with the medium black squares in block A:

- Block A (containing the black squares) is to the left of block C.
- Block C's contents don’t directly interact with block A as block C is strictly to the right of block A. Therefore, the placement within block C doesn't affect which black square in block A is above the yellow square in block B.
- Since block C lies neither above nor directly adjacent to block A vertically, any spatial relationship in height between squares in blocks A and B can be directly imagined by their vertical alignment.

The question asks specifically about the relation of medium black squares to the medium yellow square in block B since only block B's adjacency to block A is described without vertical displacement:

- As the question implies a cross-block examination, and block C's referenced content is directional and non-impactful based on positioned ‘below’ text.
  
Conclusion:
- Out of medium black square number one and medium black square number two in block A, only the square number two is logically placed higher within block A, also further vertically with consideration to block B’s yellow square, since no vertical bounding beyond its block location is inferred.

Therefore, medium black square number two (which is above medium black square number one) is above the medium yellow square present in Block B.

So, the answer to which medium black square within Block A lies above a medium yellow square in Block B is:
- Medium black square number two.

1. Block A has one medium blue square. 
2. Block B, which is directly to the right of Block A, contains one medium black square.
3. Block C, which is to the right of Block B, contains four medium yellow squares.

Since block B is immediately to the right of block A and contains one medium black square, the object directly to the right of the medium blue square in block A is the medium black square in block B. 

The medium yellow squares are located in block C, which is to the right of block B. Therefore, they are two blocks away from the medium blue square and not directly adjacent to it.

","To answer the question, let's break down the arrangement of the objects in both blocks.

Block A:
- The objects present are one big yellow triangle, one big black circle, and one medium black triangle.
- The big yellow triangle is touching the bottom edge.
- A big black square is touching the right edge.
- Given the description, the medium black triangle and the big black circle are to the left of the big yellow triangle which is also below the big black square.

Block B:
- The objects present are a medium yellow circle, a small black circle and a big blue triangle.
- The big blue triangle is to the right of and below the medium yellow circle.
- The medium yellow circle is to the right of the small black circle.
- The big blue triangle is not mentioned as touching a specific block edge, but it is specifically noted that it is below the medium yellow circle.

Now, considering the specific request:
- We need to find what is immediately ""to the right of a small object.""
- The small object we have in the arrangement is the ""small black circle"" in Block B.
- To the right of the small black circle is the ""medium yellow circle,"" and to the right of the medium yellow circle is the ""big blue triangle.""

Given these facts, the object directly to the right of the small object (small black circle) is the medium yellow circle. Thus, the object we consider next (to the right of this entire arrangement) is the big blue triangle.

The big blue triangle, described as part of Block B:
- Is the big blue triangle in the position right of the small object (small black circle)?
- The big blue triangle is to the right of the small black circle through intermediary of the medium yellow circle and thus is relevant for our purpose of determining proximity to the small black circle.
- It is not mentioned to be touching the bottom edge of block A, however.

From these deductions, to the right of the small black circle in Block B, we find:
Big blue triangle is there.

Thus, ""to the right of the small object,"" we have a ""big blue triangle.""
Considering the provided options: 
0) medium black triangle 
1) big blue triangle which is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Since the big blue triangle in block B is to the right of the small black circle:
Not both of them and the medium black triangle is not part of block B as per the provided layout.

","To solve the problem, let's analyze the position and arrangement of each object within the given blocks:

- Block A contains:
  - A medium yellow square at the top.
  - Below the medium yellow square, there is a medium black square.

- Block B is to the left of Block A and contains:
  - Two medium blue squares and a medium yellow square.
  - The medium yellow square is below the two medium blue squares.
  - It is also stated that ""below medium blue square number two there is medium blue square number one.""

From this, we deduce:
- Medium blue square number two is on top.
- Directly below medium blue square number two is medium blue square number one.
- Below medium blue square number one is a medium yellow square.

Now, let's focus on what is touching the bottom edge of Block B:
- The bottom position of Block B is occupied by the medium yellow square, as it is mentioned that both medium blue squares (number one and number two) are above it.

The question asks, which object is to the right of a thing touching the bottom edge of a block. Therefore, we are concerned with any objects to the right of the medium yellow square (since the medium yellow square is at the bottom edge of Block B).

Looking at the arrangement:
- Block B is to the left of Block A.
- This means that Block A is directly to the right of Block B.
- Therefore, objects within Block A can be to the right of the objects at the bottom of Block B.

In Block A:
- The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

Therefore, the medium black square in Block A could be to the right of the objects in Block B that touch the bottom edge, but they are not the specific medium blue squares number one or two as mentioned in the options.

So, specifically asking about medium blue square numbers: 
- Neither medium blue square number one nor medium blue square number two satisfies being to the right of the thing touching the bottom edge of the block, given that the only thing in Block B touching the bottom is the medium yellow square in Block A.

","Let's go through the description carefully to identify the relative positions of the objects:

1. **Block A** contains one medium yellow square.
   
2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares: Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.
   - There is a medium black square touching the bottom edge of block B.
   - There is also a medium blue square below medium yellow square number two and medium yellow square number one.
     - This means the medium blue square is at the same lower level or further down from these yellow squares.
   - The medium black square is below both medium yellow square number one and medium yellow square number two.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares: Medium yellow square number two is above medium yellow square number one.
   - The medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom edge of block C and is below medium yellow square number two.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square, we need to consider each block configuration:
   
- For Block A: The medium yellow square in block A can only have objects in block B to the right. From the description, the arrangement in block B is such that the two medium yellow squares and the blue square are lined up. The blue square sits below the yellow squares in block B, so it is technically to the right of any lowest edge-aligned yellow square in block A.
  
- For Block B: The two yellow squares in block B are vertically aligned, so neither has a direct touch with an object to its right. The medium blue square below doesn't constitute being directly ""to the right"" of either. 

In Block B, considering yellow square number one, if we assume these blocks have lateral alignment, the blue square would be more aligned with the block below than beside. So for the horizontal layout to maintain, the only context where the blue square may visually occupy as ""to the right"" is when viewed within or across block depths adjacent.

- For Block C: It's to the left of Block B thus no direct interaction in the context of right-bound alignment with objects in other blocks unless block alignments explicitly crisscross beyond side viewing parallel plains. 

By isolating cases initially, objects strictly within blocks have lesser probability of relative out-block alignment unless prescribed physical crossover is stated.

We conclude overall discernibly, in tally: 
- **The medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge** suggests aligning with baseline orientation and that is placed commonly in depth across, gains warmth in strict association upon assessment given layouts interchange.
Thus:
- Both block A and general cross reflections convey objects periphery across arch-base line (blue).

Hence the final answer more chiefly witnesses:
- **The blue object experiences vertical cue adherence to defining broader lined internal area basis to support its stable attributive in depicting utmost edges through leveling across~interior range create visible in part-region inclusion contrasting based conventions.**

The blue object is juxtaposed in contrasting the layout when considering overarching header base alignments. Therefore the definitive answer we hold suggests the alignment is chiefly toward vertical.

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
   - Block C is below B.
   - Block B is above A.

2. Block A contains a medium yellow square.

3. Block B contains a medium black square.

4. Block C contains one medium blue square. Furthermore, it states:
   - A medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - Below the medium blue square is a medium yellow square.
   - The medium black square is below both the medium yellow square and the medium blue square.

Now, let's break down the setup:

- **Block C**: Contains a medium blue square, beneath which there is a medium yellow square.
  - ""A medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block"" implies that this black square is directly below Block C.

- The medium black square mentioned as touching the bottom edge of Block C does not have anything stated below it within the same block since it is at the very bottom edge of Block C.

- Based on the spatial arrangement explained:
  1. From Block C, we have in order from top to bottom: Medium blue square, then medium yellow square, and lastly the medium black square.
  2. Block B (above Block C) has a medium black square.
  3. Block A (below Block B) has a medium yellow square.

Now, to answer the primary question: Which object is below a medium black square?
- In Block C, beneath the medium black square (which touches the bottom edge of Block C), there is nothing further within Block C itself.
- The medium blue square is above the medium black square in Block C.
- The medium black square in Block B doesn't specify any additional object beneath it, based on given data.

Considering the bottom black square in Block C explicitly exists at the edge and has nothing confirmed below it, and other scenarios (such as separate blocks) not affecting 'below' relation the way asked:

The concrete scenario detailed doesn't declare anything beneath either the black square (in Block B) or the non-edge blue square operative to answer as if something lies physically further beneath its footing--we synthesized all we could from given configuration in descriptive present isolation:

The answer remains:
- The stated configuration involving the medium black square touching the bottom edge, vis-à-vis being terminal in descend figure, stipulates no acknowledged order otherwise insinuating it is floating beyond depth described.

Thus, under potentially typical question framing and peer convention formula:

   - Block B is above Block A and contains one big yellow square.
   - Block C contains a small yellow square and a medium blue triangle.
   - The small yellow square is positioned to the right of and below the medium blue triangle.

3. A big blue triangle is mentioned, but its block placement and other relations aren't explicitly stated, except that:
   - To the right of the big blue triangle, there is a big black circle. 
   - The big black circle is near and to the left of the medium blue circle (in Block A).

From the above, we focus on:
- The big blue triangle's relative position influences where other shapes might be located.
- We are asked what is specifically to the right of the big blue triangle.

If the big black circle is near and to the left of the medium blue circle, this implies:
- The big black circle is in Block A due to the proximity described.

For determining what's directly to the right of the big blue triangle:
1. In Block C, the small yellow square is below and right of the medium blue triangle.
2. There is no mentioned medium blue triangle being to the right of the big blue triangle. We only know about the positioning of the medium blue triangle in Block C concerning its small yellow square.

2. Below the medium blue square number one, which touches the bottom edge of Block B (cannot have any object below it within Block B per the description), there doesn't seem to be any object listed below it directly since it's indicated that it is touching the bottom edge of the block.
3. Medium blue square number two is positioned below the medium black square as well, perhaps directly or through another intermediary object (e.g., below medium blue square number one); however, the description is slightly unclear about direct or intermediary positioning since blue square number one touches the bottom.
4. Finally, the medium yellow square is below both the medium black square and the second medium blue square.

With this understanding:
- The medium blue square number one touches the bottom of Block B so it fulfills the condition of touching the bottom edge.
- The medium yellow square is described as being below the second medium blue square, which is still below the medium black square, making it also below the black square.

Thus, considering the question, both items end up being described as below the medium black square. However, due to the information given that blue square number one is touching the block's bottom, it suggests that in lower hierarchy below within their respective block's content orders, the yellow one is sequentially described to be lower in positioning.

Thus, more integrally, the end answer should be the object below based on what is directly indicated above all in terms: the yellow square is considered more explicitly aligned to below as it defines to the content while the prepositional phrasing is more indicative of its bottom line sequential state. But in literal possible terms, the wording allows either technically:

However: ""Which object is below a medium black square?""

is satisfied by:
- blue square number one is immediately directly below;
- yellow square in descriptive structural list.

","To solve the problem, let's analyze the spatial arrangement of the blocks and squares:

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains a medium blue square and a medium black square.
   - The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of block A, and it is below the medium black square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square.
   - The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

3. **Block C**:
   - It is positioned below Block B and to the right of Block A.
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

Now, we need to determine which medium black square is to the left of a medium yellow square.

- The medium yellow square in Block B is above the medium black square within the same block; therefore, the medium black square cannot be to the left of its own block's yellow square—it can only be below it.
- Block C, placed to the right of Block A, only contains one medium yellow square and does not affect the relative positioning of the squares in Block A and B.

Hence, the only medium black square that could be to the left of the medium yellow square in Block B is the medium black square in Block A. However, the text does not specify if Block A and Block B are adjacent horizontally, so we assume unrelated horizontality or standard conventional arrangement.

Since Block A is not directly related horizontally with Block B, there's no direct adjacency suggested. Thus, neither of the medium black squares is definitively to the left of the medium yellow square vertically or horizontally in terms of relative horizontal (left) adjacency.

Final conclusion: The correct answer is that none of the black squares are to the left of a medium yellow square based on spatial alignment solely described. Therefore, the concise form of the final answer is:

","To determine the answer, we will use the described positions of the elements within and across the blocks.

1. **Analyzing Block A:**
   - Block A contains one small blue circle.

2. **Analyzing Block B:**
   - Block B contains:
     - One small blue triangle
     - One big blue triangle
     - One big blue circle
   - The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - The small blue triangle is located directly below the big blue triangle and is positioned to the right of and above the big blue circle.

3. **Analyzing Block C:**
   - Block C contains:
     - One medium yellow square
     - One big black square
     - One medium blue triangle
     - One medium black square
   - The medium black square is located to the left of the big black square.
   - The big black square touches the right edge of Block C.
   - The medium yellow square is to the right of the medium black square.
   - The medium blue triangle is below both the big black square and the medium black square.

4. **Position Relationship Between Blocks:**
   - Block C is above Block B.
   - Block A is below Block B.

5. **Determining What is Above the Small Blue Circle (in Block A):**
   - The small blue circle is in Block A, which is the lowest block in the stack of three blocks (A, B, and C).
   - Block B is directly above Block A. The small blue triangle and the big blue circle are in Block B.
   - Above Block B is Block C, which contains both the medium yellow square and the medium black square.
   - Therefore, since Block B is above Block A, and the small blue triangle is a part of Block B, the small blue triangle is directly above Block A's single small blue circle.
   
Thus, the correct element directly above the small blue circle is a small blue triangle, which is within Block B.

Hence, the answer to what is directly above the small blue circle is: {0} (small blue triangle)."

**Block A:**
- It has two medium black squares.
- There is a medium blue square in Block A.
- The medium blue square is below medium black square number two.

Given this information, in Block A, the medium blue square is indeed below a medium black square (specifically medium black square number two).

**Block B:**
- It contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square.
- Below medium blue square number two is medium blue square number one.
- Below medium blue square number one is the medium black square.

So, in Block B, the medium black square is below medium blue square number one.

**Block C:**
- It contains a medium blue square and a medium black square.
- The medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of Block C.
- The medium blue square is below the medium black square.

In Block C, the blue square is indeed below the medium black square according to the positioning.

   - Contains a big yellow circle.
   - The big yellow circle is to the left of both the big yellow triangle and the big blue square.

Now, the question asks what is below the big black triangle in Block A.

- Since Block A is above Block B, the contents of Block B are directly below the black triangle in Block A.
- In Block B, there is a medium yellow circle and a big black circle. The big black circle is to the right of the medium yellow circle.

Next, since Block A is to the right of Block C, the contents of Block C are not directly below Block A. Therefore, the big blue square in Block C, even though it touches the right edge of Block C, cannot be directly below the big black triangle in Block A.

Thus, the only content directly below the big black triangle in Block A is in Block B, specifically the big black circle.

   - The big yellow circle is below the medium black square.
   - The small blue triangle is to the left of the big yellow circle.

We need to determine what is to the left of the medium blue circle in Block B.

We know:
- Since Block B is directly to the right of Block A, the medium blue square in Block A is to the left of the medium blue circle in Block B.
- Block C objects are located further to the left of Block B as Block C is to the left of Block B.

From the given positions of the big yellow circle and the medium yellow square in Block C:
- Both the big yellow circle and the thing touching the bottom edge of Block C (medium yellow square) are placed within Block C, to the left of Block B.

   - A medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - A medium blue square is present. It's explicitly mentioned that this shape is below medium yellow square number two (Y2).
   - The medium black square is below Y1, Y2, and the medium blue square.

   From the description:
   - Y2 is above the medium blue square because it's explicitly stated.
   - Y1 is below Y2, so Y1 cannot be above the medium blue square.
   - Therefore, medium yellow square number two (Y2) is the square that is above the medium blue square in Block A.

2. **Block B Configuration**:
   - Contains a medium blue square, but no information is provided about any other squares above or below it.

Considering both blocks, we only determine the relationship within Block A:

- Y2 (medium yellow square number two) is directly above the medium blue square.
- Y1 (medium yellow square number one), being below Y2, cannot be above the medium blue square.

","To determine which object is to the right of a medium yellow square, let's first outline the positions of the squares in each block based on the given description:

**Block A:**
- Contains a medium blue square and a medium black square.
- The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.
- The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.
- Given the spatial relationship, the stacking order from top to bottom in Block A should be: medium yellow square, medium black square, and then the medium blue square.

**Block B:**
- Contains one medium yellow square.

**Block C:**
- Contains two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
- The medium blue square touches the bottom edge of this block.
- Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
- The arrangement from top to bottom could be: medium black square number two, medium black square number one, and then the medium blue square.

Next, consider the horizontal relation:
- Block A is said to be below Block B.
- Block B is to the left of Block C.

So in a horizontal layout, Block B has the medium yellow square that needs to be considered for this question.

Considering the entire layout:
- Block B has one medium yellow square.
- Block C, to the right of Block B, has both medium black squares. These are medium black square number one and medium black square number two.

Analyzing which object is to the right of a medium yellow square in Block B:
- Block C is located to the right of Block B.
- Within Block C, both medium black square number one and medium black square number two reside.
- There is no indication that Block A is horizontally to the left or right of Block C, but we know it's below Block B.

Between the two medium black squares in Block C, the position order doesn't require that one specifically be to the right of the medium yellow square; they are simply to the right because Block C is to the right.

Therefore, the medium black square in Block A cannot be to the right of the medium yellow square in Block B because Block A is below Block B, not horizontally aligned.

Summary of the positions relative to the medium yellow square in Block B:
- Medium black square number one in Block C is indeed to the right.
  
Thus, the correct answer is medium black square number one in Block C.

   - Below the yellow square is a medium black square.

2. **Block B Details:**
   - Contains two medium black squares and one medium yellow square.
   - Medium black square number one is at the bottom edge.
   - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.
   - A medium yellow square is above medium black square number two.

3. **Spatial Configuration:**
   - Both blocks are described as having squares stacked in a vertical alignment.
   - Block A: Has a vertical configuration where the yellow square is on top, and underneath it is a black square.

   - Block B: 
     - The yellow square is on top.
     - Underneath it is medium black square number two.
     - At the bottom, touching the bottom edge, is medium black square number one.

4. **Finding the Object to the Left of a Medium Black Square:**
   - Block B is to the left of Block A.
   - Within Block A, there is a black square below the yellow square, but there is no indication of a square being to the left or right within Block A alone.
   - Within Block B, given that the squares are vertical, the medium yellow square is directly above medium black square number two, not to the left.
   - The proximity of Block A and Block B could imply adjacency, but there is no explicit statement that the yellow square in Block A is directly to the left of a black square.

5. **Final Examination:**
   - Both descriptions imply vertical stacks within their respective blocks.
   - The question asks which yellow square, if any, is to the left of a black square.
   - Since blocks are adjacent, none of the yellow squares explicitly lie directly to the left of a medium black square based on vertical positioning alone.

Hence, the appropriate answer would be that neither yellow square is directly to the left of a medium black square.

   - Two medium black squares, where medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.
   - Below medium black square number two, there is a black object (not named in the question).
   - Below this black object, there is a medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block C.

We are specifically interested in what is above the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of Block C:
- Directly above it is a black object.
- Directly above this black object is medium black square number two (from Block C).

The question asks us to determine whether this medium black square number two in Block C or the medium black square from Block B is above the medium blue square touching the bottom edge of a block.

Since the medium black square number two from Block C is directly above the blue square, and the medium black square from Block B is in an entirely different block, it is clear that:

- The medium black square number two from Block C is directly above the thing touching the bottom edge of the block.

Thus, the medium black square number two in Block C is above the medium blue square, and not the medium black square in Block B.

Consequently, the correct answer is:

","Let's walk through the scenario step by step:

1. **Blocks and Arrangements:**
   - We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
   - Block B is to the right of Block C and below Block A.

2. **Block A's configuration:**
   - Block A contains:
     - Two medium black squares (let's call them Black1 and Black2).
     - One medium blue square.
   - Black1 is below Black2.
   - The medium blue square is below Black2 and touches the bottom edge of Block A.
   
   - Arrangement in Block A from top to bottom: Black2, Black1, and then the blue square.

3. **Block B's configuration:**
   - Contains only one medium black square.

4. **Block C's configuration:**
   - One medium black square and one medium blue square.
   - The medium blue square is below the medium black square.

   - Arrangement in Block C: the black square is above the blue square.

5. **Identify which blue square is to the left of a medium black square:**

   - Block B (to the right of Block C) only has one black square without any blue square, so no blue squares are involved here in terms of left-right positioning.
   
   - Examining Block C (which is to the left of Block B):
     - The black square is above the blue square, suggesting that from a vertical perspective, not a given horizontal left-right relationship.
   
   - From the problem setup, there is no information about Block A being to the left or right of these blocks, but Block A is above B.

   - At the level Block C is (since A is above B), there isn't a clear indication that A's blue square would be horizontally left of Block C's black square due to the vertical arrangement and given relationships.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the information about B being to the right of C, Block C’s arrangement internally, and without horizontal positioning for A relative to C apart from its vertical relationship via B, no blue square is specified to be left of C’s black square.
   - Hence, both blue squares (A's and C's) do not qualify in terms of being directly horizontally to the left of C's black square without further horizontal specifics laid out in the positioning.

The right selection, given the established orientations and information lacking for horizontal alignment relative to the orientation of A with respect to C (as A is vertically aligned relative to B, which is right of C), would be:

   - **Block B:** Contains two medium black squares. Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge and is below medium black square number two.
   - **Block C:** Contains one medium black square.

2. **Positions of the Blocks:**
   - Block B is above Block A.
   - Block A is to the left of Block C.

3. **Analysis:**
   - In **Block B**, since there are two medium black squares and one is below the other, the medium black square number one touches the bottom edge of Block B.
   - In **Block C**, there is one medium black square, but there is no information about its vertical position relative to any other object other than it being in Block C.

4. **Determining Which Object is Below a Medium Black Square:**
   - The two squares in Block A (medium blue and medium yellow) are not in Block B or Block C, which contain medium black squares.
   - Since Block B is above Block A, neither the medium blue square nor the medium yellow square in Block A is below a medium black square in Block B, even though Block B itself is above Block A.
   - In Block C, the medium black square is solitary, and Block C is to the right of Block A. There is no vertical relationship with Block A mentioned.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The medium blue and medium yellow squares in Block A are positioned below each other but not in relation to any medium black squares in Blocks B or C.

Therefore, neither the medium blue square nor the medium yellow square is below a medium black square.

   - Medium Blue Square 1 is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - Medium Blue Square 2 is below both Medium Yellow Square 1 and Medium Yellow Square 2.
   - Medium Yellow Square 1 and Medium Yellow Square 2 are positioned above both medium blue squares, as Medium Blue Square 1 is below Medium Yellow Square 1 and Medium Yellow Square 2. 

2. **Block B Configuration:**
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - Medium Black Square 1 is below Medium Black Square 2.

3. **Block C Configuration:**
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

Given that Block B is below Block C, the medium yellow square in Block C is positioned above Block B where both medium black squares reside. Thus, the medium yellow square in Block C is above medium black squares in Block B.

Medium Yellow Square 1 from Block A does not have any information linking it to a position above or below any medium black squares in Block B. Since Block A is to the right of Block B, there's no implication that it is directly above or below Block B's squares.

1. Block A is to the left of Block B.
2. Block A has one small blue circle.
3. Block B contains:
   - A small black circle
   - A small yellow square
   - A small yellow circle
   - A small yellow triangle

Key spatial relationships:
- The small black circle is to the right of a small yellow triangle.
- To the right of and below the small yellow triangle is the small yellow square.
- The small yellow square is to the left of and above the small yellow circle.

Now, let's derive the positions:

- Start with the small yellow triangle. We know:
  - The small black circle is to its right.
  - The small yellow square is below and to the right.
  - The small yellow circle is to the right of the yellow square.

Construct the layout based on these rules:

**Layout:**
- The small yellow triangle is the reference point.
- Directly right of the yellow triangle is the yellow square, because the square is both to the right and below the triangle.
- The small black circle is further right of the yellow square and triangle.
- The small yellow circle is right of the yellow square.

By verifying these placements:
- The direct right of the yellow triangle must be the small yellow square. 
- There is no blue shape directly right of the yellow triangle, as the blue circle is in Block A. 

Therefore, the answer to what is to the right of the yellow triangle is the yellow square.

     - Topmost: Medium blue square number three
     - Middle: Medium blue square number two
     - Bottom: Medium blue square number one

2. **Block B:**
   - This block contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
   - The arrangement is that the medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.

3. **Position Relative to Blocks:**
   - Block B is to the right of Block A.

Now, let's consider which object is to the right of a medium blue square in Block A:

- Since Block B is to the right of Block A, the squares in Block B are effectively to the right of all the squares in Block A.
- Within Block B, the medium blue square is directly below the medium yellow square.

The important consideration here is the relative horizontal positioning of Block A and Block B:

- Block B as a whole is to the right of all medium blue squares in Block A.
- Thus, the medium blue square and the medium yellow square in Block B are to the right of all medium blue squares in Block A.

Therefore, both medium blue square number two and medium blue square number three in Block A have the medium blue and medium yellow squares of Block B to their right.

                         Yellow Square
```

Given the position of the blocks, Block B is directly above Block A. Thus, the question “What is below the blue shape?” is asking what is directly below the **Blue** square in Block B.

- Directly below the **Blue** square in Block B is **B2** in Block A because Block A sits directly beneath Block B vertically.
- The **medium black square that is in Block C (**C1**) is not directly below the **Blue** shape as Block C is to the left of Block B.

Hence, the only square directly below the blue shape (Block B) is **medium black square number two** (**B2**).

Therefore, the answer is {0}."

0) medium yellow square  number two
1) the medium yellow square  that is in block A
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, we need to analyze the relationships between the squares as described.

1. Block B contains one medium yellow square (let's call this B-Y1). B is above C, so objects in B do not affect what is under the yellow squares in C.

2. Block C contains:
   - Two medium blue squares (call them C-B1, C-B2).
   - Two medium yellow squares (call them C-Y1, C-Y2).

From the description of C, we have:
- C-B1 is touching the bottom edge of block C.
- Below C-B2 is C-B1.
- C-Y2 is above C-B2.
- C-Y1 is above C-Y2.
- Below C-Y1 there is C-B2.
- Below C-B2 and C-Y1 (hence they are at higher levels) there is C-B1.

Now, evaluating:
- Below C-Y1, we have C-B2.
- C-Y2 is above C-B2 directly, implying nothing is directly beneath it except potentially adjacent parts of C-B2 on another level since it is smaller.

Block A:
- Contains only one medium yellow square (let's call it A-Y1).

Conclusion:
- For C-Y2, which is above C-B2, there is nothing directly below except possibly a portion of C-B2 on another axis (if considering 3D placement).
- A-Y1 is in Block A with nothing stated as below it within the context of Block A.

Hence, medium yellow square number two (C-Y2) is the one with another object (C-B2) directly below it. The square in block A (A-Y1) has no mention of an object below it.

Therefore, the answer is that there is an object below medium yellow square number two.

1. **Block Arrangement**: 
   - Block C is to the left of Block B.
   - Block C is to the right of Block A.
   - Thus, the order from left to right is: Block A, Block C, Block B.

2. **Block A Details**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium black square.
   - Arrangement: 
     - Medium yellow square number one is touching the bottom.
     - Above it is a medium black square.
     - Above the medium black square is medium yellow square number two.

3. **Block B Details**:
   - Contains one medium blue square.

4. **Block C Details**:
   - Contains one medium black square (touching the bottom) and one medium blue square (above the black square).

5. **Query**: 
   - We need to identify which object is to the left of a medium blue square.
   - **Medium Blue Squares**: 
     - Block B has a medium blue square.
     - Block C has a medium blue square.

6. **Object to the Left of Medium Blue Squares**:
   - Block B's medium blue square: To the left is the entire Block C.
     - Block C contains a medium black square (touching the bottom) and a medium blue square.
   - Block C's medium blue square: Directly below is the medium black square in Block C. 

Conclusion: The medium black square in Block C is directly related to the query as it is positioned below, and not necessarily to the left, but Block C itself lies entirely to the left of the medium blue square in Block B. The medium black square in Block A is entirely in a different block to the left of all medium blue squares, but because it is not required to be touching, it doesn't directly relate to the left edge scenario raised about touching squares in blocks.

Therefore, only the configuration inside Block C places a medium black square relevantly in proximity below the blue and thus make it a logical choice for ""below the left"" analysis within blocks, not between them overall.

Thus, the concise form of the answer, which includes something physically to the left when it pointing towards the top right edge from below within the block, will be in this specific multiple-choice context.

","To determine which object is above a medium blue square, medium blue square number two or the medium blue square in block C, we need to analyze the structure described:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium black square (above) and a medium blue square (below).
   
2. **Block B (below Block A):**
   - Contains two medium blue squares:
     - Medium blue square number two (above).
     - Medium blue square number one (below).
   
3. **Block C (below Block B):**
   - Contains one medium blue square.

Analyzing each option:

1. **Medium blue square number two:**
   - It is located in block B, and above it is block A, which has a medium blue square as its lowest object.
   - Therefore, the object directly above medium blue square number two is the medium blue square in block A.

2. **The medium blue square in block C:**
   - Since block C is the lowest block, there cannot be anything below it.
   - Hence, there is no object above the medium blue square in block C.

In conclusion, medium blue square number two has a medium blue square (from block A) above it, whereas there is nothing above the medium blue square in block C.

Thus, the correct answer is that medium blue square number two has something above it.

1) big black circle 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, let's visualize the arrangement of the blocks and the shapes they contain based on the provided descriptions:

1. Block A contains one big black triangle.
2. Block B contains one medium yellow circle.
3. Block C contains:
   - Two small blue triangles (let's label them as small blue triangle 1 and small blue triangle 2).
   - One big black circle.
   - One medium blue triangle.

Now, let's understand the given spatial relationships:

- Block C is to the left of Block B.
- Block C is below Block A. This means Block A is above Block C vertically.
- The big black circle in Block C is above both small blue triangles.
- The medium blue triangle in Block C is to the left of and above small blue triangle 1.

With these considerations in mind, we visualize the following:

Vertical arrangement:
- Block A is at the top.
- Directly below Block A is Block C.
- To the right of Block C is Block B, but Block A's position only matters relative to Block C.

Horizontal arrangement in Block C:
- The medium blue triangle is positioned to the left of small blue triangle 1.
- The big black circle is above both small blue triangles in Block C.

Given these, the big black triangle in Block A is vertically directly above the contents of Block C. Inside Block C, the shapes from top to bottom could be the big black circle and then the small blue triangles since the big black circle is above the small ones.

Thus, directly below the big black triangle of Block A, we find the contents of Block C. Since the big black circle is above small blue triangle 1 and small blue triangle 2, the big black circle is the first shape directly below the big black triangle in Block A.

After this thorough step-by-step consideration, the answer to what is directly below the big black triangle in Block A is a big black circle.

","To solve this problem, let's break down the positions of each object step-by-step:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium blue square (""blue A"") and a medium yellow square (""yellow A"").
   - Below ""yellow A"" is a medium black square (""black A"").
   - ""Blue A"" is below both ""yellow A"" and ""black A"". Since both ""yellow A"" and ""black A"" are above ""blue A"", they cannot be to its right. Therefore, within Block A, no square is to the right of ""blue A"".

2. **Block B:**
   - Located directly below Block A.
   - Contains one medium yellow square (""yellow B"").
   - Given that Block B is below Block A, there can be no horizontal relationship (i.e., to the right or left) between the squares in Block A and those in Block B. Therefore, ""yellow B"" is not to the right of ""blue A"".

3. **Block C:**
   - Located to the left of Block A.
   - Contains a medium blue square (""blue C"").
   - Since Block C is entirely to the left of Block A, and ""blue C"" is inside Block C, ""blue C"" has no horizontal relationship with objects in Block A. 

Now, considering the medium blue square we are analyzing:

- ""Blue A"" has no square explicitly stated to be to its right within Block A.
- With Block C completely to the left of Block A, this prevents ""blue C"" from having any square to its right.

Therefore, given the constraints, there is no square mentioned to the right of the medium blue squares within their respective blocks or between blocks that permits such a position. Consequently, the answer is:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square.
   - The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block B, which means it is positioned at the very bottom of this block.
   - The medium black square is above the medium yellow square in Block B.

3. **Block C:**
   - Contains two medium yellow squares (Y1 and Y2) and one medium blue square.
   - The medium blue square is below both medium yellow squares Y1 and Y2.
   - Medium yellow square number one (Y1) is below medium yellow square number two (Y2).

**Analyzing the vertical arrangement of the blocks:**
- Block A is above Block B.
- Block B is below Block C.

This means the arrangement from top to bottom is Block C, Block A, and then Block B.

**Identifying what is above the black shape in Block B:**
- In Block B, there are only two shapes: a medium black square and a medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge.
- Since the medium yellow square in Block B is at the very bottom, the only thing above the black square in Block B can be any part of Block A (a medium yellow square).

**Checking the positions from blocks:**
- Since Block B is below Block C and below Block A, and there are no specified shapes from Block C or Block A impacting Block B directly above the black square, the only yellow square pertinent to the choices given is the one really touching the bottom edge of a block (Block B's yellow square).

Since Block A's yellow square is part of Block A and not touching the bottom edge of Block B, the only relevant figure is given as the yellow square within Block B:
   
Thus, the answer about what is immediately above the black shape (considering blocks as given):

- The medium yellow square that touches the bottom edge of Block B is in Block B with the black square but it is under it.

- And from the blocks given, we should determine what's above the configuration accounting blocks as whole and if numbers match this with the rest of the info which is appropriate.

","To solve this problem, let's first interpret the arrangement of squares based on the description given:

1. **Block A:**
   - Consists of two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
   - The description says the medium blue square is touching the bottom edge of Block A. It is specified to be below both medium black square number one and medium black square number two. This means the arrangement of squares in Block A from top to bottom is:
     - Top: Medium black square number two.
     - Middle: Medium black square number one.
     - Bottom: Medium blue square.

2. **Block B:**
   - Consists of three medium blue squares.
   - The arrangement of squares in Block B is determined by the given order: 
     - Top: Medium blue square number three.
     - Middle: Medium blue square number two.
     - Bottom: Medium blue square number one.

Next, let's analyze which object is to the left of a medium black square:

- The medium black squares are part of Block A. Since Block A is described as being to the right of Block B, Block B and all of its squares (including medium blue square number three, medium blue square number two, and medium blue square number one) are positioned to the left of Block A and its medium black squares.
- Both medium blue square number one, medium blue square number two, and medium blue square number three in Block B are to the left of the medium black squares in Block A since the entirety of Block B is positioned to the left of Block A.

Let's address the options:
- **Medium blue square number two in Block B:** This lies within Block B which is to the left of Block A's squares. Hence it is to the left of the medium black squares in Block A.
- **The thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block (Medium blue square in Block A):** This is located within Block A itself. Therefore, it is not to the left of any medium black square because both black squares are within the same block and the arrangement is linear from top to bottom.

By this logic, only the squares in Block B (for example, medium blue square number two) can be to the left of the medium black squares.

Thus, the answer is:

","To determine which medium blue square is below a black shape, we need to thoroughly analyze the arrangement of squares within each block.

1. **Block A**:
   - Contains a medium yellow square.
   - There are no blue squares in this block, so we can disregard Block A for our question.

2. **Block B**:
   - Contains two medium blue squares, one medium black square, and one medium yellow square.
   - The arrangement is as follows:
     - Medium blue square number two is above the medium yellow square and the medium black square.
     - The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square number two and the medium black square.
     - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block B, below all other squares in this block (including the medium blue square number two, medium yellow square, and medium black square).
   - Therefore, the medium yellow square is below the medium black square. Medium blue square number one is not below the black square, since it is below everything.

3. **Block C**:
   - Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium blue square.
   - The arrangement is as follows:
     - Medium blue square is below medium yellow square number two.
     - Medium yellow square number one is below both medium yellow square number two and the medium blue square.
   - There is no black square in Block C, thus the medium blue square in Block C cannot be below a black shape.

Upon reviewing the arrangement:
- The medium blue square that touches the bottom edge of Block B (medium blue square number one) is not below a black square because it is simply at the bottom of the block.
- The medium blue square in Block C is not below any black shape since Block C contains no black squares.

Therefore, neither medium blue square is below a black shape.

- None of the given medium blue squares is below a black shape.

**Analyzing the question:**

- We need to determine what is directly above the big blue triangle in Block A.

- Given that the medium yellow circle is described as ""below"" the big blue triangle, the medium yellow circle is not above it.
  
- Now, considering Block B is above Block A and evaluating the objects in Block B:
  - The problem does not specify the direct spatial relationship of Block B's contents in terms of what could possibly be directly above the big blue triangle in Block A.
  
  - There's no explicit statement indicating the placement of a big black circle in Block B being above Block A's triangle; the only relation mentioned is about being below the small black square and to the left of the medium yellow square.

   - Block C contains a medium yellow square and a medium black square.
   - The medium yellow square is below the medium black square in Block C.

Now, we evaluate which medium black square is to the left of a medium yellow square:

- The medium black square in Block A cannot be to the left of a medium yellow square because:
  - The medium yellow square in Block B is horizontally to its right.
  - The medium yellow square in Block C is also horizontally to its right.

- The medium black square in Block C is directly above its corresponding yellow square in Block C. Therefore, it is vertically positioned directly with it, not to the left or right.

2. Block A contains one medium black square (let's call it MB_A).
3. Block B contains one medium black square (let's call it MB_B).
4. Block C contains two medium black squares and one medium yellow square. 
   - Let's call the medium black squares in block C MB_C1 and MB_C2.
   - Let's call the medium yellow square in block C MY_C.
5. We're given that MB_C1 is below the medium yellow square (MY_C) and MB_C2. Therefore:
   - MY_C is above MB_C1.
   - MY_C is beside MB_C2, or MY_C is vertically rendered with MB_C2 on the same layer.
6. MB_C2 is specified as being below the medium yellow square, thus MB_C2 is beside, or at least partially below MY_C, given the structure.

Since blocks A and C are both to the right of block B, we're comparing something within blocks A and C, and neither block contains a block for comparison in block B's representation in this problem.

Now, relating these:

- The medium black square in block A (MB_A) doesn't have other squares next to it specified other than being part of the sequence with B and C.
- MB_C2 is directly below MY_C, possibly making it to the right of MB_A if MY_C is part of the inline sequence as visually interpreted.

The question asks: 
""Which object is to the right of a medium black square? The medium black square which is in block A (MB_A) or medium black square number two (MB_C2)?"" Based on no explicit rendering beyond descriptive layering without horizontal nuance, we are therefore asked to identify vertical interaction aspects.

Since MB_C2 is associated directly with MY_C's placement in sequential block C arrangements and not explicitly right of MB_A:

The answer is {3}."
1824,"We have three blocks. Lets call them A, B and C. Block A contains one medium blue circle and a medium blue triangle. It also contains a big blue triangle. Above the medium blue circle which is to the right of and below the medium blue triangle is the big blue triangle. Above block A there is block B. It contains a big black square and a medium yellow triangle. The big black square is below the medium yellow triangle. Finally, we have block C which is to the right of block B. It has a big blue triangle and a big black square. A small blue triangle is to the left of and above the big blue triangle which is to the right of the big black square. The big blue triangle is touching the right edge of this block. What is above the medium blue triangle? a blue circle or a big black square??
0) blue circle 
1) big black square 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine what is above the medium blue triangle, let's analyze the blocks step by step based on the provided description:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains:
     - A medium blue circle
     - A medium blue triangle
     - A big blue triangle
   - Description: 
     - The medium blue circle is to the right of and below the medium blue triangle.
     - The big blue triangle is above the medium blue circle, which means it is also above the medium blue triangle since the circle is below the triangle.

In block A, the big blue triangle is above the medium blue triangle.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains:
     - A big black square
     - A medium yellow triangle
   - Description: 
     - The big black square is below the medium yellow triangle.

Block B is above Block A. For the contents to affect Block A, the big black square has to be positioned in such a way in Block B that it is directly above the medium blue triangle in Block A.

3. **Block C:**
   - Is to the right of Block B.
   - Since we are looking for what is above the medium blue triangle in Block A, Block C's positioning and contents are not relevant for this specific question.

**Conclusion:**
Since Block A has a direct hierarchy of shapes described within itself and Block B is situated above Block A indicating the possibility of overlap if needed, the only content from Block B possibly above or connected to the medium blue triangle in Block A, as per the description, is the position of the shapes within Block B relative to the medium blue triangle's vertical alignment.

We do not have explicit horizontal or vertical alignment information about where exactly Block B's contents are positioned over Block A's, but we do know that the big black square is described relative to the yellow triangle, and the description didn't directly place any part of the square over the medium blue triangle.

Thus, above the medium blue triangle directly inside Block A is simply the big blue triangle without interference from other blocks.

The answer is that the blue circle could not be above because it is below and does not rise above the medium blue triangle on any vertical alignment, given the context. Thus, neither are directly above from an inter-block perspective compromising Block B as discussed.

Therefore, the final answer is {3} as neither the blue circle nor the big black square are above the medium blue triangle from any provided perspective."
261,"We have three blocks, A, B and C. There is a medium yellow square in block A. Above block A there is block B which contains a medium black square.

","Let's analyze the setup step by step:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains a medium yellow square.

2. **Block B:**
   - This block is above block A.
   - Contains a medium black square.
   - There is a medium yellow square from block A below this block (directly below the medium black square).

3. **Block C:**
   - This block is above block B.
   - Contains a medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - Also contains a medium blue square.
   - The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

**Question to Answer:**
- Which object is above a medium yellow square: the black object, or the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block?

**Analysis:**

- The medium black square in block B is directly above the medium yellow square in block A (as block B is on top of block A).
- The medium yellow square in block C is touching the bottom edge of block C, and it is below the medium blue square in the same block.

Now, determine what is above:

- The medium black square in block B is above the medium yellow square in block A.
- The medium blue square in block C is above the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of block C.

**Conclusion:**
- The medium black square is above a medium yellow square in block A.
- The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of block C, so the medium blue square is above this yellow square in block C.

Thus, both the medium black square and the medium blue square are above medium yellow squares in their respective situations. However, since the question specifically asks for either the black object or the yellow square at the bottom of a block, the answer focuses on scenarios with both yellow squares.

The correct answer is {2}, since both the black object (black square in block B) and the medium blue object are involved in being above their respective yellow squares."

","To determine which medium square is to the right, let's carefully analyze the positions of the blocks and squares:

1. **Block Arrangement**:
   - Block A is to the left of Block B.
   - Block B is to the left of Block C.

   Thus, the arrangement is: *(Block A) → (Block B) → (Block C)*.

2. **Contents of Blocks**:
   - **Block A**: 
     - Contains three medium black squares and one medium blue square.
     - Medium blue square is above medium black square number three.
     - Medium black square number three is above medium black square number two.
     - Medium black square number two is not directly below the medium blue square; it's below medium black square number three.
     - Medium black square number one is directly below the medium blue square.

   Based on the information, the order vertically in Block A is:
   - (Top) Medium Blue Square
   - Medium Black Square #3
   - Medium Black Square #2
   - (Bottom) Medium Black Square #1
   
   However, from a left-to-right per block basis, all squares in Block A are horizontally aligned just as squares in Block B and C.

   - **Block B**: Contains one medium yellow square.
   - **Block C**: Contains one medium black square.

3. **Position Comparison**:
   - Medium black square number two is in Block A.
   - The medium black square in Block C is, by the block arrangement, to the right of everything in Block A, including medium black square number two.

Based on the horizontal arrangement of the blocks, the medium black square in Block C is to the right of medium black square number two.

   - A medium yellow square above a medium black square.
   - Below these, another medium blue square (implying there are two medium blue squares in Block A in total).

3. **Block B** is below Block A and contains one medium yellow square.

To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, let's place all the described objects:

- In **Block C**: There is only one medium blue square with no particular object positioned to its right, if we're considering the arrangement relatively.
  
- In **Block A**:
  - Assume the medium yellow square and the medium black square are aligned vertically with the yellow on top (because it says ""below the medium yellow square is a medium black square"").
  - The bottom part of the block contains a medium blue square. 

With this setup, we need to analyze:
- The medium yellow square in *Block A* sits above the medium black square. This vertical arrangement doesn't affect the placement to the right of the bottom medium blue square. 
- The information isn't suggesting any direct horizontal adjacency within **Block A** that could place a yellow square directly to the right of the medium blue square.

Given the spatial descriptions, the problem doesn't suggest any *horizontal* rights adjacency of yellow squares to any medium blue square. 

Having identified the positions, it's clear that neither of the medium yellow squares (in Block A or Block B) is specified to be directly adjacent (to the right) of the blue squares in this layout.

- The medium yellow square in block C

To make distinctions:
- In Block A, we have the medium black square below the yellow square, with no mention of anything to the left specifically within Block A.
- In Block C, there is no further description besides containing a medium yellow square.

**Conclusion:**
- For the medium yellow square in Block A, it's embedded among its peers with none noted specifically to its left.
- The medium yellow square in Block C similarly is solitary in position context.
- Ultimately, with the provided details, neither of these blocks has ""something"" listed as being directly to the left of the medium yellow square in either block.

3. Block A contains:
   - A medium yellow square (let's call it Y4) touching the bottom edge of the block.
   - Above Y4 is a medium blue square (let's call it BL1).

Considering these configurations:

- Block C has a black square (B1) which is described and it is below the yellow square Y1.

   - **Block A** contains a medium yellow square.
   - **Block B** contains two medium blue squares. 
     - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
     - Medium blue square number two is located below the medium yellow square in Block A.
     - Medium blue square number one is also below the square that's below the medium yellow square in Block A. Additionally, it is specified to be below the medium yellow square in Block A as well.
   - **Block C** contains one medium black square.

3. **Analyzing Relative Positions:**
   - Since Block C contains the medium black square and Block C is above Block A, any content in Block A is positioned below this medium black square.
   - As we concluded from the position of the blocks in step 1, Block A (and its contents, including the medium yellow square) is below Block C.
   - Block B is also going to be below the black square (since Block B is below Block A), but let’s focus on the medium yellow square in particular.
   - Given the arrangement and descriptions, the medium yellow square in Block A is directly below the black square in Block C.

4. **Comparisons of Positions with the Black Square:**
   - The problem asks which medium yellow square is below the black square.
   - The medium yellow square in Block A is certainly below the black square in Block C, since Block A (and its contents) are directly below Block C.

Therefore, the medium yellow square that is in Block A is the one directly below the medium black square in Block C. The medium yellow square in Block B is indirectly positioned relative to the black square because it resides in a block lower than Block A.

In conclusion, the medium yellow square in Block A is what we are looking for.

","To determine which object is above a medium square, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. We have three blocks: A, B, and C.
2. Block A is to the right of block B.
3. Block A is above block C.
4. Block A contains three medium black squares: numbers one, two, and three.
5. Within block A:
   - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number three and medium black square number two.
   - Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three.

From this information about the arrangement within block A:
- Medium black square number one is below both medium black square number three and medium black square number two.
- Medium black square number two is below medium black square number three.

From this, it follows that:
- Medium black square number three is at the top within block A.
- Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one but below medium black square number three.
- Medium black square number one is at the bottom within block A.

Therefore, considering the hierarchical arrangement:
- Medium black square number three is above medium black square number two.

The question asks which object is above a medium square. Specifically, we need to determine if medium black square number three, medium black square number two, both, or none is above another medium square. Since:

- Medium black square number three is above both number two and number one.
- Medium black square number two is above number one but below number three.

Hence, medium black square number three is above medium black square number two.

   - Block B contains a medium blue square and a medium black square.
   - The medium blue square is below the medium black square.

Now, let's determine what object is below the specified medium yellow square:
- The specific medium yellow square we are considering is medium yellow square 1, which is touching the bottom edge of Block A. 

- With block B being entirely below block A, any squares within block B are physically below block A, including the medium yellow square 1 (since it is touching the bottom edge of block A).

- Medium yellow square 1 is located at the bottom edge of block A. Since block B is directly below block A, any square inside block B will be below medium yellow square 1.

- Therefore, the medium black square in Block B, being one of the squares in Block B, is below the medium yellow square 1.

","To solve this problem, we need to understand the spatial arrangement of the blocks and squares mentioned:

1. **Block A**:
   - Consists of two medium blue squares.
   - Medium blue square number two has a medium black square below it.
   - Medium blue square number one is below the black object, which in turn is below medium blue square number two. This implies that medium blue square number one is at the bottom most position within Block A.

2. **Block B**:
   - Located to the left of Block A.
   - It consists of one medium yellow square.

3. **Block C**:
   - Located to the right of Block B.
   - It consists of one medium black square.

Next, we derive the positions of the squares within Block A based on the description provided:

- Let's assume the arrangement is viewed vertically; therefore, we have:
   - At the top: Medium blue square number two.
   - Below medium blue square number two: A medium black square.
   - Further below this black square is medium blue square number one, which means medium blue square number one is at the bottom of this vertical arrangement.

The question asks about the object to the right of a medium square, particularly comparing ""medium blue square number two"" and ""medium blue square number one"".

- Block B and Block C are described as being left and right relative to Block A, respectively. However, there's no mention of any horizontal arrangement within these blocks in connection to each other, besides their order. There are no additional squares within Block A horizontally to either blue square number one or two since the arrangement described is entirely vertical within Block A.

- The only horizontal arrangements mentioned are the block positioning.

Hence, without any horizontal shift of the squares within Block A, there is:
- No object directly to the right of medium blue square number two, within the context of Block A; similarly for medium blue square number one.

- Contains one medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
- The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

Now, evaluate the two possible options for which object is below a medium square:

1) ""The shape which is touching the bottom edge of a block"":
   - In Block A, Yellow 1 is touching the bottom edge and is below both the medium black square and Yellow 2. Thus, Yellow 1 is below a medium black square.
   - In Block B, the medium blue square is the only shape; hence, no room for it to be below another shape.
   - In Block C, the medium yellow square touches the bottom edge of the block and is below the medium blue square.

In summary, in both Block A and Block C, the shape touching the bottom is below another medium square (Yellow 1 below the black square in Block A, and the yellow square below the blue square in Block C).

2) ""Medium yellow square number two"":

","To determine which object is to the right of a small blue triangle, let's go through the given positioning information step by step:

1. We have two blocks, A and B. Block A is to the left of B.
2. In Block B:
   - There are two big black triangles.
   - There are two small blue triangles.
   - There is one small black circle.
   - There is one medium blue square.

3. Specific positioning in Block B:
   - Big black triangle number one is touching the right edge of Block B.
   - Small blue triangle number one is near to and to the right of a small black circle.
   - Big black triangle number one is to the right of, below, and near to small blue triangle number one.

Based on these details, we can deduce the following:
- Small blue triangle number one is positioned in such a way that big black triangle number one (touching the right edge) is to its right.
- The medium blue square's position relative to this specific blue triangle above is not explicitly mentioned in the description, so it cannot be assumed it is to the left of, right of, or even in close proximity without more information.

Therefore, with the given information, the big black triangle that is touching the right edge of Block B is specifically described to be to the right of small blue triangle number one.

Thus, the only object explicitly described as being to the right of a small blue triangle is the big black triangle touching the block edge.

","To determine which medium yellow square is to the left of a medium blue square, let's analyze the given information.

We have two blocks: Block A and Block B.

### Block A:
- Contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
- The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

Arrangement of Block A:
```
Medium blue square (above)
Medium yellow square (below)
```

### Block B:
- Contains a medium black square, a medium yellow square, and a medium blue square.
- The medium black square is below both the medium blue square and the medium yellow square, and is touching the bottom edge.
- The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

Arrangement of Block B:
```
Medium blue square (top)
Medium yellow square (middle)
Medium black square (bottom)

### Position of Blocks:
- Block B is to the left of Block A.

Now, let's evaluate:
- In Block A, the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.
- In Block B, the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

The key point is that Block B itself is to the left of Block A, meaning everything in Block B is to the left of everything in Block A.

Therefore, the medium yellow square that is in Block B is to the left of the medium blue square that is in Block A.

2. **Block B** is positioned above Block A and contains three medium yellow squares:
   - Medium yellow square number three is above number two.
   - Medium yellow square number two is above number one.
   - Medium yellow square number one touches the bottom edge of Block B, thus it is the lowest square in Block B.

3. **Medium black square** is located below medium yellow square number three and medium yellow square number two.

4. **Block C** is positioned to the left of Block A and contains one medium yellow square.

Upon reviewing these points, the medium blue square in Block A is directly below Block B. Therefore, any squares within Block B will be candidates for being ""above"" the medium blue square.

- Medium yellow square number two, being part of Block B, is above the medium blue square in Block A.
- The medium yellow square in Block C is not above the medium blue square, as Block C is located to the left of Block A.

- **Block A**:
  1. Contains three squares: medium black, medium blue, and medium yellow.
  2. The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.
  3. The medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block A, meaning it is the lowest square in this block.
  4. The medium black square is below the medium blue square, which in turn is below the medium yellow square.

This indicates the order from top to bottom in Block A is: medium yellow -> medium blue -> medium black.

- **Block B**:
  1. Contains two medium black squares.
  2. The first medium black square is touching the bottom edge of Block B.
  3. The first medium black square is below the second medium black square.

This suggests that, from top to bottom in Block B, we have: second medium black -> first medium black (touching Block B's bottom edge).

Now let's examine the configuration:

Block B is above Block A. Thus, Block B's structure is positioned entirely above Block A's structures.

In Block A, the medium yellow square is on top. Directly above the medium yellow square is Block B. The block B configuration is: second medium black (above) -> first medium black (touching Block B’s bottom edge).

We need to determine what is directly above the medium yellow square:

- The first object we encounter directly above the medium yellow square is the first medium black square in Block B, which is touching Block B’s bottom edge.

","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the positions described for blocks A, B, and C:

1. **Block A Configuration:**
   - ""A medium yellow triangle, one big black square and a big blue square are in block A.""
   - A medium black circle is to the right of the big black square and the big blue square.
   - The medium yellow triangle is touching the right edge and is far from the big blue square.
   - The big blue square is touching the bottom edge.
   - ""Near to the big blue triangle is the medium black circle."" This implies they are close in position.
   - The big blue triangle is touching the right edge.

   Based on this, within block A:
   - The big blue square must be at the bottom.
   - The medium black circle is near the right side and likely above the big blue square given the touching condition.
   - The medium yellow triangle is on the right edge, further from the big blue square.
   - The big blue triangle is also on the right edge, touching there and near the medium black circle.
   - Arrangement: Medium black circle near right and above the big blue square due to top-bottom relation.

   - This block has no relevance regarding under the small shape in block C since it's to the left of block A.

3. **Block C Configuration:**
   - Contains a small black square and a medium blue circle.
   - ""To the left of the medium blue circle is the small black square.""
   - The small black square is to the left, and the medium blue circle is to the right.

   Since block C is above block A, we need to determine what's directly below the small black square:
   - If block C is aligned directly above block A, then directly under the small black square might line up with the upper left section of block A.
   - The medium black circle is towards the right of block A.
   - Big blue square is in bottom of block A.

Given block A's configuration, the primary position under the small black square within a typical vertical alignment and given shapes described (primarily wider, big blue square situated lower and broader in shape) is aligned mostly beneath it.

Hence, the big blue square is likely most directly beneath considering size description provided (touching bottom edge implies more spread out).

3. The small blue circle is to the left of both the big black triangle and the small black circle.
  
Additionally, since block A and block B are adjacent, we can focus on the positioning within block A where the details are provided:

   - The medium yellow square is touching the bottom edge of Block A and is located below the medium blue square.

2. **Block B:**
   - Contains: One medium blue square. 
   - It is stated to the right of Block A and above Block C.

3. **Block C:**
   - Contains: A medium black square and a medium blue square.
   - The medium black square is below the medium blue square.

From the descriptions:
- Block B (with a blue square) being above Block C suggests a vertical stack, which does not affect the horizontal relation but indicates vertical layering.
- Block B being to the right of Block A suggests a horizontal order of A -> B.
- Block C is below Block B, but no direct horizontal relation to A or B is specified.

The question is: which object is to the left of a medium blue square, the one in Block C or the one in Block A?

- **Block A's medium blue square**: 
   - There is no explicit mention of any other object or square to the left of it within Block A.
   - Block A is the leftmost block in the given horizontal alignment (A -> B).

- **Block C's medium blue square**:
   - Given Block B is above Block C, but no horizontal placement relative to Block A is given, Block C's position has no squares directly left within its own block. 

Conclusion:
- Since Block A is in the clear horizontal order to the left of Block B, any object in Block B, including its blue square, would be to the right. Thus, a square in Block A being to the left is not possible when considering Block B.
  
Therefore, the medium blue square in Block A is the leftmost in its orientation concerning Block B. However, both blue squares in Block A and C have no specification of objects within their blocks to the left, aligning with the logical vertical or horizontal implications outside their context. 

Thus, when considering relative to one another within fleshed context and standard left-right conditions beyond the textual horizontal arrangement, both fail to offer left-aligned conditions, assuming absolute assured context misinterpretive or involves understanding beyond specific horizontal order:

2. According to the arrangement:
   - Medium black square 1 is below medium black square 2, medium black square 3, and medium black square 4.
   - Medium black square 2 is below medium black square 3.
   - Medium black square 3 is below medium black square 4.

Therefore, the arrangement of squares in Block A from top to bottom is:
- Top: Medium black square 4
- Below 4: Medium black square 3
- Below 3: Medium black square 2
- The base: Medium black square 1 (aligned below 2, 3, and 4)

Now, regarding Block B, it contains a single medium yellow square.

The task is to determine which medium square has another object to its right.

Since we know Block A (with the black squares) is to the right of Block B (with the yellow square), Block A’s squares are all to the right of this yellow square.

However, within Block A:
- Medium black squares 4, 3, 2, and 1 are part of the same vertical stack, making it improbable any of them are to the direct left or right of each other. 

Given this vertical stack, neither medium black square 4 nor medium black square 3 has another part of Block A to the direct right within Block A. The question of what is to the right of a medium square within Block A can only relate to Block B.

Thus, medium black square 4 and medium black square 3 are to the right of Block B's single medium yellow square.

Now we will list potential configurations:
- Block B is entirely to the left of Block A, affecting all of Block A’s squares equally.
- Therefore, there are no distinctions between which specific squares of Block A are uniquely affected by Block B's position.
- Block B influences all parts collectively without a unique left-right relationship among the medium black squares.

Therefore, within Block A:
- Nothing is of distinction to the right of medium black squares 4 or 3.
- The entire Block A is collectively to the right of Block B.

However, the real question regards overcropping internal joint formations across internal confines of focused reference. Therefore, choice 3) none of them require an object strictly to the right of a supposed internal configuration concerning external validity feedback:

Given shared assumptions, configuration mapping validates both vertical alignments equally block confines constraints:

System constraints showcase inherent lack concerning definitive locational logic excluding normative constraints logic:

The final choice regarding present local defined knowledge insight persists regarding lack shared as internal defining contrast specifics:

- **Medium Blue Square:** This is mentioned as part of Block B and is placed near to, below, and to the right of the small yellow square. According to the description, the medium blue square itself is not below the yellow square; rather, it is below and to the right of it.

- **Small Yellow Square:** Since the problem states that the small black circle is below the small yellow square, and since the medium blue square is stated as being ""near to, below and to the right"" of the small yellow square, it does not sit directly below the yellow square. Thus, the yellow square is above the medium blue square.

- **Verification:** Any object in Block B that is above the medium blue square but not directly above it would make the yellow square the only candidate for being directly above the blue square, which is in line with the given relationships.

   - **Block C**: Contains a small blue square, a medium yellow circle, and a medium black triangle. The small blue square is near to and to the right of the medium black triangle, and it is also above the medium yellow circle.

3. **Positioning within Block C**:
   - The small blue square is above the medium yellow circle.
   - The small blue square is to the right of the medium black triangle.
   - Hence, the position of the small blue square relative to the triangle means it's primarily oriented to the right, rather than strictly above it.

4. **Understanding the Structure**:
   - In terms of what is directly above Block B (which contains the medium black circle), we consider Block A whose only component is the medium yellow square.
   - Therefore, the contents of Block C are not directly relevant to what's vertically above the medium black circle because Block C itself is positioned above Block A, not the black circle in Block B.

5. **Concluding what's above the Medium Black Circle in Block B**:
   - The only component directly in Block A, which is immediately above Block B, is a medium yellow square. 
   - None of the small square from Block C or the black triangle are directly above the medium black circle in this vertically layered configuration.

Hence, none of the items (0) small square or (1) black triangle is above the medium black circle directly in this configuration.

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the positioning of the squares within the blocks as described. Let's break it down:

1. **Block A**: Contains a medium blue square. There is no information provided about other squares in Block A, so we don't need to consider this further.

2. **Block B**: Contains one medium black square and one medium yellow square. The medium black square is below the medium yellow square.

3. **Block C**: Contains a medium black square and a medium blue square. The description states that below the medium black square, there is the medium blue square.

Let's summarize the setup for Blocks B and C since these directly affect the question posed:

- In **Block B**, the medium yellow square is on top, and the medium black square is below it. There is no medium blue square mentioned in Block B.

- In **Block C**, the medium black square is on top, and the medium blue square is below it.

The question asks which medium black square is above a medium blue square:

- The medium black square in **Block B** is not above any medium blue square because there is none mentioned in Block B.

- The medium black square in **Block C** is directly above a medium blue square as explicitly stated.

Therefore, the only medium black square that is above a medium blue square is the one in Block C.

","To determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, let's analyze the positions of the squares within each block:

- Block A: Contains one medium blue square.
- Block B: Contains one medium blue square.
- Block C: Contains one medium yellow square, one medium black square, and one medium blue square. Given the description, the setup in Block C is such that the medium yellow square is below both the medium black square and the medium blue square. Furthermore, the medium black square is below the medium blue square. 

This description suggests the following vertical arrangement for Block C:
1. At the top: Medium blue square
2. Below it: Medium black square
3. At the bottom: Medium yellow square

The question is asking which object is to the right of:
- The medium blue square in Block A
- The medium blue square in Block C

According to the arrangement described:
- Block C is to the right of Block B. 
- Thus, Block B might logically be considered to be to the right of Block A since Block C is also above Block A.

Now, consider each medium blue square:
- The medium blue square in Block A: Block B is to the right of Block A, but its content (another medium blue square) and position do not detail that it's directly to the right of the medium blue square in Block A. No information suggests anything is directly to the right of the blue square in Block A.
  
- The medium blue square in Block C: It's at the top of the arrangement within Block C with no lateral object explicitly described to the right within the block.

Therefore, there is no clear statement of any object directly to the right of either the medium blue square in Block A or in Block C within the blocks given.

In conclusion, based on the arrangement and descriptions, no object is specifically described as being to the right of either medium blue square distinctly.

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem, let's start by analyzing the descriptions of the blocks and the positions of the squares within them:

1. **Block A**: 
   - One medium blue square.
   - One medium yellow square.
   - The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.

2. **Block B**:
   - Two medium blue squares.
   - Below medium blue square number two is medium blue square number one.
   - Below medium blue square number two (at the bottom of the block) is a medium black square.

Now, let's determine the specific positions of the squares in each block:

**Block A:**
- Medium yellow square is on top.
- Medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.

**Block B:**
- Medium blue square number two is on top.
- Medium blue square number one is below medium blue square number two.
- Medium black square is at the bottom and below medium blue square number two.

Next, determine what each question is asking:

The question asks which object is to the right of a medium square.

- ""Medium blue square number one"" refers to the square in Block B that is below medium blue square number two.
- ""The medium blue square that is in block A"" refers to the single medium blue square located below the medium yellow square.

Since Block A (containing the blue and yellow squares) is to the left of Block B, Block B (containing the two blue squares and the black square) is to the right of Block A.

We can conclude that the square in Block B is to the right of the square in Block A.

Therefore, the reference to ""which object is to the right of a medium square"" is partially correct if considering both the relative positions within their respective blocks and the spatial relationship between Blocks A and B.

Ultimately, the precise interpretation depends on the phrasing, but based on the context of the configuration:

- ""Medium blue square number one"" in Block B is to the right of the ""medium blue square that is in Block A"" because Block B is positioned to the right of Block A.

Thus, the correct answer to the question, given the placements, is {0) medium blue square number one}, since that square is located in Block B, which is to the right of Block A. However, you could adapt this conclusion according to specifics if, spatially, elements within Blocks will also be evaluated horizontally or within additional shared horizontal spaces. But, primarily, this conclusion is based on their primary left-right block positions.

Thus, the answer based on given spatial arrangement and interpretation of ""right of a medium square"" between these two Blocks in context will be:

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve the problem and determine which object is to the right of a medium black square, we need to visualize the layout of the blocks:
  
1. **Block A**:
   - Contains two medium black squares.
   - Arrangement: 
     - Medium black square number two is on top.
     - Medium black square number one is below medium black square number two.

2. **Block B**:
   - Positioned to the right of Block A.
   - Contains two medium black squares and one medium blue square.
   - Arrangement:
     - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.
     - The medium blue square is above medium black square number two.
     - Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.

3. **Block C**:
   - Positioned below block A.
   - Contains one medium yellow square.

Now, considering the positions and arrangements:

- In **Block A**, both medium black squares do not have any squares to their immediate right within this block.
  
- In **Block B**:
  - The medium black square number one is at the bottom and touches the block's edge, so no square is below it, but it is mentioned that ""Below a medium blue square is medium black square number two"", implying that to the right of the medium blue square (since Block B is to the right of Block A) could also be a place for another medium black square, since Block C does not extend to this position.

- **Block C** is strictly below Block A and, therefore, does not directly touch any black squares to their right in the given arrangement.

Based on this setup:
- The medium black squares in Block A do not have a square immediately to their right in Block A.
- However, in Block B (which is to the right of Block A), the medium blue square is above medium black square number two.
- Thus, the blue shape is to the right of medium black squares of Block A.

Therefore, the blue shape is positioned to the right of a medium black square from Block A considering the block arrangement.

Thus, the correct choice is the blue shape. The concise form of the final answer is:

  - Contains three medium blue squares and one medium black square:
    - Medium blue square number one is below a medium black square and medium blue square number two.
    - Medium blue square number two is below medium blue square number three.
    - Medium blue square number three is below the medium black square.

  This can be visualized as:
  ```
  Black
  Blue 3
  Blue 2
  Blue 1

- **Block B**:
  - Contains a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
    - The medium blue square is below the medium yellow square.

  Yellow
  Blue (Block B)
  ```

- **Block C**:
  - Contains a medium yellow square and is located to the right of Block A and to the left of Block B.

  Visualization doesn't specify vertical positions relevant to our query since Block C just has one medium yellow square.

Now, to determine which object is to the right of a medium blue square, specifically whether it's medium blue square number three or the medium blue square that is in Block B:

1. **Medium Blue Square Number Three** is part of Block A. Block C is located to the right of Block A. Therefore, Block C (containing a medium yellow square) would be directly to the right of medium blue square number three.

2. **The Medium Blue Square in Block B** is located below the medium yellow square in Block B. Since Block C is between Block A and Block B, this medium blue square would not have anything directly to its right because Block B is the last listed block in the description.

Conclusively, only the medium blue square number three in Block A has an object directly to its right, which is Block C (containing a medium yellow square).

","To determine which object is below a medium yellow square, let's review the arrangement of the squares:

1. **Block A:** 
   - Contains three medium yellow squares: MYS1, MYS2, and MYS3.
   - MYS1 is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
   - MYS2 is below MYS3.
   - MYS1 is below both MYS3 and MYS2. 
   - Therefore, the sequence from top to bottom in Block A is: MYS3, MYS2, MYS1.

2. **Block B:** 
   - Contains one medium yellow square (let's call it MYSB).

Given this arrangement, we need to determine what is below each of these medium yellow squares:

- **Below MYS3 (Block A),** there is MYS2.
- **Below MYS2 (Block A),** there is MYS1.
- **Below MYS1 (Block A),** there is nothing (or only the bottom of Block A).
- **Below MYSB (Block B),** by definition, since it is the only square in Block B and nothing is mentioned below it in Block B, we can consider that there is nothing specific mentioned as being below it.

Now we analyze the options:

0) **Medium yellow square number two (MYS2):** Below MYS2 in Block A is medium yellow square number one (MYS1).
1) **The medium yellow square that is in Block B (MYSB):** Nothing specific is mentioned as being directly below MYSB.
2) **Both of them:** This would mean both objects have something below them.
3) **None of them:** This would mean neither has any other object below them.

Since there is an object (MYS1) below MYS2 in Block A, while MYSB in Block B does not clearly have anything below it, the answer is:

- MYS2 has an object (MYS1) below it.

1. **Analyze Block A:**
   - There are two big triangles in Block A: one black and one blue.
   - The big black triangle is touching the bottom edge of Block A and is below the big blue triangle.
   
   Therefore, the big blue triangle is above the big black triangle, which is touching the bottom of Block A.

2. **Analyze Block B:**
   - Block B is situated below Block A.
   - Block B contains two medium blue circles.
   - The position of the medium blue circles in Block B doesn't directly affect what is directly below the big blue triangle in Block A because Block A and B are separate blocks.

3. **Determine what is directly below the big blue triangle:**
    - Within Block A, below the big blue triangle, is the big black triangle, which is touching the bottom edge of Block A.
    - Block B, being entirely below Block A, may contain objects vertically below the big blue triangle when viewed as a whole arrangement, but within Block A itself, the big black triangle is directly beneath it.

Therefore, within the confines of the structures described in Block A, the object directly below the big blue triangle is a big object that is touching the bottom edge of Block A, specifically the big black triangle.

### Block B (Below Block A):
- Contains three medium yellow squares. 
- Medium yellow square number two is below medium yellow square number three.
- A medium black square is mentioned to be touching the bottom edge of this block.

Next, we need to decipher the relative positions of the yellow squares based on the information:
1. Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number three and also below medium yellow square number two.
2. This triangular relationship implies:
   - Medium yellow square number three is at the top.
   - Medium yellow square number two is below yellow square number three.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below number two.

This means the medium black square is positioned below medium yellow square number one.

### Block C (Also Below Block A):
- Contains one medium yellow square and one medium blue square.
- The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

### Conclusion:
- In Block B, the medium black square is below the bottommost medium yellow square (yellow square number one).
- In Block C, the medium blue square is above the medium yellow square, so the medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

Now we determine which square is below a medium yellow square:
1. The medium black square is below a medium yellow square number one.
2. The medium blue square is not below any yellow square; rather, it is above a yellow square.

   - The big yellow square is below the big blue square.
   - The medium black triangle is to the right of the square which is below the big blue square (itself being below the big blue square).

Now, back to the key question:

- The medium blue square is in Block B.
- The candidate objects for ""left of the medium blue square"" are in the same block as the medium blue square (Block B) and other blocks do not directly affect its left-side objects. Thus, objects in Block C won't be to the left of the medium blue square as they are in separate block spaces.

Therefore, in **Block B**, the arrangement is as such:
- Big Yellow Circle (left) → Medium Blue Square (right)

From this information, neither the big blue square nor the big yellow square in Block C are to the left of the medium blue square located in Block B.

The medium yellow triangle is near the medium yellow circle. The problem asks which object is to the left of a medium yellow square.

- In Block B, the medium yellow square is located within Block A and within Block C. There is no explicit medium yellow square in Block B.

However, the question asks which object (medium yellow triangle or medium yellow circle) is to the left of a medium yellow square outside of Block B:

Given the spatial arrangement effects of block position:
- The medium yellow square in Block A, which is in Block A that is to the Right, meaning Block B objects have no relevancy.
 
- In Block C, there is a medium yellow square which is below and to the right of the small blue triangle:
  - The positioning of objects within Block B will not be relevant because it focuses on Block C internal arrangement.

Therefore, neither the medium yellow triangle nor the medium yellow circle is specifically to the left when analyzing all block dynamics.

The answer is {3} - none of them are explicitly to the left within the scope of neighboring yellow squares."
410,"We have three blocks, A, B and C. Block C is to the right of block B and it is above block A. Block A has one medium yellow square. Block B has two medium black squares.

What is to the left of the thing that is touching the bottom edge of a block? a medium black square or a medium yellow square??
0) medium black square 
1) medium yellow square 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To determine what is to the left of the thing touching the bottom edge of a block, let's analyze the setup:

1. **Block A** contains one medium yellow square.
2. **Block B** contains:
   - Two medium black squares (labeled as number one and number two).
   - One medium blue square.
   - The arrangement is such that the medium blue square is above medium black square number two. Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.

3. **Block C** contains:
   - One medium black square.
   - One medium blue square.
   - The arrangement is such that the medium black square is below the medium blue square and is touching the bottom edge of Block C.

Now, let's find what is touching the bottom edge of each block:
- In **Block A**, there is only a medium yellow square. Since there's no square below it, nothing is specifically at the bottom edge or below a level.
- In **Block B**, medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.
- In **Block C**, the medium black square is touching the bottom edge of this block.

The things touching the bottom edges are:
- **In Block B**: Medium black square number one.
- **In Block C**: Medium black square.

The question asks what is to the left of the thing that is touching the bottom edge:
- To the left of the medium black square number one in Block B, there is no information about another block or square adjacent to the left. Hence, none.
- To the left of the medium black square at the bottom of Block C is Block B. In Block B, the medium black square number one also touches the bottom, meaning it aligns with the medium black square in Block C.

In this scenario, the alignment of blocks suggests there is no medium yellow square to the left of the medium black square touching the bottom edge of Block C. So:

The answer is {3 (none of them)} because neither a medium yellow square nor another medium black square can be definitively said to be to the left of the lowest or touching part described given the positions."

","To solve this problem, let's visualize the positions of squares in each block and determine which object is to the left of a medium blue square.

- **Block A:** Contains one medium blue square. There's no additional context from the other blocks affecting block A since we don't have any medium black square information in this block.

- **Block C:** Contains one medium black square and one medium blue square. The medium blue square is below the medium black square and also touches the bottom edge of Block C. Since the medium blue square is below the medium black square in this block, it is not to the left of the medium black square.

- **Block B:** Contains two medium blue squares and one medium black square. The medium black square is above both medium blue squares. Therefore, none of the medium blue squares in Block B can be to the left of the medium black square, as they are both below it.

Given that:
- The medium blue square in Block A doesn't have a medium black square with which to be compared position-wise.
- The medium blue square in Block C is positioned below the medium black square.
- The medium blue squares in Block B are positioned below the medium black square.

There is no configuration where any medium black square is directly to the left of a medium blue square.

Thus, neither the medium black square from Block C nor any of the medium black squares from Block B are to the left of a medium blue square.

","To solve this problem, let's visualize the placement of blocks and the squares within them based on the given information:

1. **Block A**: Contains two medium black squares.
   - Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of the block.
   - Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one.

2. **Block B**: Contains one medium black square.
   - Let's denote this square as the medium black square in block B.

3. **Block C**: Contains two medium yellow squares.
   - Medium yellow square number one is below medium yellow square number two.
   - Block C is to the right of Block B and below Block A.

Now, determine which medium black square is directly above a medium yellow square:

- **Block A** is above **Block C**. Therefore, any squares in Block A might potentially be above squares in Block C.
  
- **Medium black square number two** is in Block A, which is above Block C. Thus, it could potentially be above one of the medium yellow squares in Block C.

- **Block B** is to the left of Block C, implying a horizontal separation. Therefore, the medium black square in Block B could not be directly above any of the yellow squares in Block C since it is not vertically aligned with Block C.

Since blocks are described as vertically stacked (A over C) and B is adjacent horizontally (beside C), it implies only squares from Block A can be directly above squares in Block C.

Therefore, **medium black square number two** is the only one that could be directly above a medium yellow square, as it's in the block above Block C.

The concise final answer is:

   - Two small yellow triangles.
   - One medium black circle.

   - The medium black circle is furthest to the left.
   - Small yellow triangle 2 is to the right and below the medium black circle.
   - Small yellow triangle 1 is to the right of small yellow triangle 2.

6. Since block C is below Block B, both the medium black circle and small yellow triangle 2 are positioned above the big yellow circle in Block C.

Now, let's focus on the information about Block C:

- The medium yellow square is below both medium black square number one and medium black square number two.
- Medium black square number two is above medium black square number one, which is also above the medium yellow square.

- Block B is directly above Block C.
- The top of Block C, directly under Block B, is medium black square number two.

Therefore, below the medium blue square in Block B is medium black square number two.

The medium black square in Block A is not below the blue square because it's in a different block (Block A is to the right of Block B, not below it).

Thus, below the blue object in Block B is medium black square number two.

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains one big black square. 
   - No other details are provided about Block A, except that Block B is below it. 

2. **Block B:**
   - Is below Block A.
   - Contains: 
     - One small blue square.
     - One medium blue square.
     - One big yellow triangle, which is touching the right edge of this block.
     - The medium blue square is described as to the left of and below the big yellow triangle.

3. **Block C:**
   - Is above Block A.
   - Contains:
     - One big black triangle, which is touching the bottom edge of this block.
     - One small yellow triangle, which is above the big black triangle.

Next, we assess the spatial relationships:

- **Block B** is placed below **Block A**, so the contents of Block B are directly below the contents of Block A.
- **Block C** is above **Block A**, thus not affecting the vertical relationships between Blocks A and B.
  
Now, let's evaluate the key objects:

- The **big yellow triangle** is located in Block B, touching the right edge of Block B.
- The **big black triangle** is in Block C, touching the bottom edge of Block C.

Since Block C is above Block A, the big black triangle in Block C cannot be below the big black square in Block A.

In Block B, the big yellow triangle is directly below Block A (since B is below A). It specifically touches the right edge of Block B but is still below Block A's black square due to their relative block positions.

Therefore, the object directly below the big black square in Block A is the big yellow triangle touching the right edge of Block B.

Conclusively, the yellow object touching the right edge of a block (the big yellow triangle in Block B) is below the big black square in Block A.

Thus, the correct option is:
1) the yellow thing that is touching the right edge of a block

1. **Information about Blocks:**
   - Block C is above Block A. 
   - Block A is to the right of Block B.
   
   Thus, the configuration in horizontal adjacency is Block B to the left of Block A.

2. **Contents of Block A:**
   - Block A contains one medium black square.
   
3. **Contents of Block B:**
   - Block B has three medium blue squares.
   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block.
   - Below medium blue square number three, there is medium blue square number two.
   - Below medium blue square number two, there is medium blue square number one.

5. **Analyzing which object is to the left of a medium black square:**

   - The medium black square in Block A has no mentioned other object to its left within Block A.
   - Block B is to the left of Block A. Therefore, considering the whole setup, the medium blue squares in Block B are to the left of the medium black square in Block A.
   - Within Block B, the bottom-most medium blue square, which is medium blue square number one, is the one touching the bottom edge of Block B.
   - The medium black square in Block C is irrelevant for this question since it's positioned within Block C and there is no spatial relation described between Block C and the blocks horizontally adjacent to it. The question focuses on horizontal adjacency and necessity only involves Block A and Block B.

Given the spatial configuration, the object directly left-of the medium black square in Block A is the  medium blue square number one located at the bottom edge of Block B. The medium yellow square is located in Block C (above Block A) and does not directly relate horizontally in the given scenario.

Therefore, the only object directly to the left of the black square within Block A is the medium blue square number one (touching the bottom of Block B).

3. We are asked which object is to the right of a medium black square. We need to determine if it is the medium black square in Block B or the medium black square in Block C.

4. From the initial statement:
   - Block A is to the left of Block C, and Block A is above Block B.
   - Therefore, Block B is below Block A, and since block C is separate, it must be to the right of Block A.

5. Block A is to Block C's left, hence within Block C, there are no blocks or squares to the right of the medium black square – only empty space is there.

6. Now consider Block B:
   - Since Block B is below Block A and blocks are not horizontally adjacent (i.e., B and C), there are no squares to the left or right within their own block and only provide vertical orientation.

7. Thus, there are no objects or squares to the right of either of the medium black squares in Blocks B or C as they are not sharing placement in line horizontally directly next to other objects or blocks containing squares to their right in that described setup.

   - Below a medium black triangle and a small blue triangle is the first big black triangle. This suggests the big black triangle is at the bottom, with the medium black triangle above it and the small blue triangle to the left and above the medium black triangle.

2. **Block B Composition:**
   - Block B is located below Block A.
   - Block B contains a big yellow square.

3. **Question Analysis:**
   - We are asked what is above the big yellow square inside Block B.

Since Block B is directly below Block A, anything in Block A could be positioned above the big yellow square by virtue of their vertical relationship.
- The description suggests that the first big black triangle in Block A could be nearest to Block B due to its placement below the medium black triangle and the small blue triangle.
- The small blue triangle, being the upper-left item with respect to the medium black triangle, is not located at the bottom of Block A. 
- Hence when considering vertical layers as Block A is directly above Block B, the first thing above the big yellow square is most likely the first big black triangle of Block A.

   - Block B consists of 1 medium black square and is to the right of block A.

2. **Arrangement of Squares in Block A**:
   - Label the squares in Block A for clarity:

     - Medium blue square number one (MB1)
     - Medium black square number two (BK2)
     - Medium black square number one (BK1)

- **Row 1**: MB2
- **Row 2**: BK2
- **Row 3**: MB1
- **Row 4**: BK1

4. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - We need to determine which object is to the left of a medium black square.
   - Analyze the positioning:
     - MB2 in Row 1 has no squares to its left.
     - In Row 2, BK2 may have something to its left.
     - In Row 3, MB1 is present, and BK2 might be to its right.
     - Check MB1: If it is below BK2, BK2 is directly above MB1, implying MB1 is to the left of BK1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - MB1 is positioned below BK2, which means MB1 may also extend to the left. Thus, MB1 is directly left of BK1.
   - MB2 is positioned above BK2, occupying its own space with no mentioned square on the left directly.

Since only MB1 is positioned to the left of a medium black square (BK1 in the column alignment), the answer is determined by following the arrangement.

","Let's break down the given information:

1. **Block A:**
   - Contains two medium blue squares.
   - Contains one medium yellow square.
   - Contains one medium black square.

2. **Position Details in Block A:**
   - Medium blue square number two is positioned above the medium yellow square and the medium black square.
   - The medium yellow square is below both medium blue square number two and the medium black square.
   - Medium blue square number one is touching the bottom edge of Block A and is below both the medium yellow square and medium blue square number two.

3. **Block B:**
   - Contains a medium black square.

Now we need to determine which object (the medium black square in Block A or Block B) is below a medium square:

- In **Block A**, the medium black square is above the medium yellow square, but below medium blue square number two.

- In **Block B**, we only have one medium black square with no information about it being below another square.

From the given descriptions, we know that:

In Block A:
- The medium black square is below medium blue square number two because it’s mentioned that both the medium yellow square and the medium black square are below medium blue square number two.

In Block B:
- There’s no information that indicates the medium black square in Block B is below any other square.

Thus, in Block A, the medium black square is indeed below medium blue square number two. Therefore, the medium black square that is definitely below a medium square is the one in Block A.

The correct answer is: {0}"

","To solve this problem, let's break down the spatial arrangement of the blocks and squares step by step:

1. **Block Arrangement:** 
   - Block C is to the left of Block B.
   - Block C is to the right of Block A.
   - Therefore, the order of the blocks from left to right is: A, C, B.

2. **Content of Blocks:**
   - **Block A:** Contains two medium yellow squares and one medium black square. 
     - Medium yellow square number one is at the bottom of Block A.
     - Medium yellow square number one is below both the medium black square and medium yellow square number two.
     - Therefore, from bottom to top in Block A, the order is: medium yellow square number one, medium black square, medium yellow square number two.

   - **Block B:** Contains a medium blue square.
   - **Block C:** Contains a medium black square and a medium blue square.
     - The medium black square is at the bottom of Block C and below the medium blue square.

3. **Identify Blocks Relative to Medium Blue Squares:**
   - Block B contains a medium blue square.
   - Block C contains a medium blue square.

4. **Medium Yellow Squares Relative to Medium Blue Squares:**
   - The medium blue square in Block B: Both medium yellow squares in Block A are to the left of this medium blue square.
   - The medium blue square in Block C: Both medium yellow squares in Block A are also to the left of this medium blue square.
   
Therefore, both medium yellow square number two and the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of Block A are to the left of medium blue squares.

Thus, the correct answer is that both medium yellow square number two and the medium yellow square that is touching the bottom edge of a block (i.e., Block A) are to the left of medium blue squares. The appropriate response is:

2641,"There are two blocks. We call them A and B. Block A is to the left of B. Block A has a medium black triangle, one medium black circle and one small black circle. The medium black triangle is touching the bottom edge of this block. To the right of and above the small black circle is the medium black circle. To the right of and below the small black circle is the medium black triangle. Block B contains a big black triangle and one small black square. The big black triangle is to the right of and above the small black square. Which object is to the left of a big object? the square or the medium black triangle that is touching the bottom edge of a block??
0) the square 
1) the medium black triangle  that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this problem, let's go through the scenario step by step.

1. **Block A**:
    - Contains one medium black triangle (touching the bottom edge), one medium black circle, and one small black circle.
    - The medium black circle is to the right of and above the small black circle.
    - The medium black triangle is to the right of and below the small black circle.

2. **Block B**:
    - Contains a big black triangle and one small black square.
    - The big black triangle is to the right of and above the small black square.

The question asks which object is to the left of a big object: the square or the medium black triangle that is touching the bottom edge of the block.

- Block B contains a big black triangle. Therefore, we will consider Block B’s relative positioning.
- The small black square in Block B is positioned to the left of the big black triangle, as it is stated that the big triangle is to the right of the small square.

Now let's analyze Block A's setup:
- The medium black triangle in Block A is only defined by its relation to other objects within Block A (such as the small black circle that is above and to the left of it). There are no objects in Block A bigger than the medium triangle.

Thus, comparing across blocks, the smaller black square in Block B is indeed to the left of a larger object (the big black triangle). In Block A, although the medium black triangle is the largest in its block, it does not qualify for the question about being to the left of a larger object because it isn't to the left of anything within its block that is larger than itself.

Therefore, the object to the left of a big object is the small black square.

Final Answer: {the square}"
1421,"We have two blocks. Lets call them A and B. Block A is to the right of B. Block A has one medium yellow square and one medium blue square. Below the medium blue square is the medium yellow square. Block B has two medium black squares. Below medium black square number two and a medium yellow square there is medium black square number one.. Medium black square number one is touching the bottom edge of this block. Below medium black square number two is the medium yellow square. Which object is below a medium black square? the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block or the blue thing??
0) the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block 
1) the blue thing
2) both of them
3) none of them

Think through your answer step by step. Put the concise form of your final answer in curly brackets e.g. {A}, {True} or {3.0}.
","To solve this, let's break down the given descriptions of blocks A and B:

1. **Block A:**
   - A has a medium yellow square and a medium blue square.
   - The medium yellow square is below the medium blue square.

2. **Block B:**
   - B consists of two medium black squares and one medium yellow square.
   - Below medium black square number two is a medium yellow square.
   - Below a medium yellow square and medium black square number two, there is medium black square number one, which rests on the bottom edge of block B.

Now, analyze these to understand what is below each medium black square in block B:

- **Medium black square number one**: This is at the bottom edge of block B, so there is no shape below it in block B.
- **Medium black square number two**: Below it is a medium yellow square (as per the information provided).

Now consider what the task is asking: 
""We are asked which object is below a medium black square—the shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block, or the blue thing?""

- Medium black square number one: Touching the bottom edge (nothing below it).
- Medium black square number two: Medium yellow square is below it.

Conclusion:
- A medium yellow square is below medium black square number two.
- The blue square mentioned is in block A above the yellow square and is not underneath any squares in block B.
- The shape touching the bottom edge of block B (medium black square number one) has nothing below it.

Hence, the correct answer to the question ""Which object is below a medium black square?"" refers to the medium yellow square below medium black square number two, and it's certainly not referring to the shape that is touching the bottom or the blue thing from block A.

Therefore, the options given are:
0) The shape that is touching the bottom edge of a block (medium black square number one has nothing below).
1) The blue thing (which is above the yellow square and not located in block B).
2) Both of them.
3) None of them.

The correct answer is: **Neither the shape at the bottom edge (0)** nor the blue square (1) is below a black square in context of block B. The object is a medium yellow square (which wasn't directly asked in any option).

Based on given options, option 3 (""none of them"") aligns with this information.

The correct simplified form is:
