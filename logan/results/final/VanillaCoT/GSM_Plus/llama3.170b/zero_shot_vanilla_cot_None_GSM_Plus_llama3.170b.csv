1578,"Colby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 80 quarters, 60 dimes, 140 nickels, and 150 pennies, how many can he buy?","To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. 

First, let's calculate the value of each coin type in cents:
- 80 quarters = 80 * 25 cents = 2000 cents
- 60 dimes = 60 * 10 cents = 600 cents
- 140 nickels = 140 * 5 cents = 700 cents
- 150 pennies = 150 * 1 cent = 150 cents

Now, let's convert the value of all coins into nickels (5 cents each):
- 2000 cents / 5 cents = 400 nickels
- 600 cents / 5 cents = 120 nickels
- 700 cents / 5 cents = 140 nickels (already in nickels)
- 150 cents / 5 cents = 30 nickels

Now, let's add up the total number of nickels:
400 + 120 + 140 + 30 = 690 nickels

Since each gumball costs a nickel, Colby can buy {690} gumballs."
1723,"Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 1.5 times of ten cookies, how many people were in the church next door?","To find out how many people were in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests:
   Total guests = 100
   Cookies per guest = 15
   Total cookies = Total guests * Cookies per guest
   Total cookies = 100 * 15
   Total cookies = 1500

2. Calculate the number of cookies given to the church next door:
   Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * Total cookies
   Cookies given to the church = 1/2 * 1500
   Cookies given to the church = 750

3. Calculate the number of cookies each person in the church received:
   Each person received 1.5 times of ten cookies
   Cookies per person = 1.5 * 10
   Cookies per person = 15

4. Calculate the number of people in the church next door:
   Number of people = Cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
   Number of people = 750 / 15
   Number of people = 50

What is the total amount of money, in dollars, that they have all collected together?","To find the total amount of money collected, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alexandra gathered $430.
2. Kim gathered $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim gathered $430 + $320 = $750.
3. The total amount gathered by Kim and Alexandra is $430 + $750 = $1180.
4. Sarah gathered $300.
5. Maryam gathered $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam gathered $300 + $400 = $700.
6. The total amount gathered by Maryam and Sarah is $300 + $700 = $1000.
7. The total amount gathered by all four girls is $1180 + $1000 = $2180.

1061,"On Tuesday, the tank was filled with seven more feet of water. Wednesday's water depth was two-thirds of Tuesday's. If the water depth of the tank was 16 on Wednesday, what is the depth of the water on Monday?","To find the depth of the water on Monday, let's start with the information we have.

1. Wednesday's water depth was 16 feet.
2. Wednesday's water depth was two-thirds of Tuesday's water depth.

Let's find Tuesday's water depth. If Wednesday's depth is two-thirds of Tuesday's, we can set up an equation:

Wednesday's depth = (2/3) * Tuesday's depth
16 = (2/3) * Tuesday's depth

Multiply both sides by 3/2 to isolate Tuesday's depth:

Tuesday's depth = 16 * (3/2)
Tuesday's depth = 24 feet

Now we know Tuesday's depth was 24 feet.

3. On Tuesday, the tank was filled with seven more feet of water.

So, Monday's depth was 7 feet less than Tuesday's:

Monday's depth = Tuesday's depth - 7
Monday's depth = 24 - 7
Monday's depth = 17 feet

How much profit did she earn on her bags?,"To find the profit earned on the bags, we'll calculate the total cost and total revenue from the bags, then find the difference.

1. Total number of bags: 8 packs * 5 bags/pack = 40 bags
2. Total cost of bags: 8 packs * $4/pack = $32
3. Total revenue from bags: 40 bags * $8/bag = $320
4. Profit earned on bags: Total revenue - Total cost = $320 - $32 = $288

1991,Mattison stands at a height of 60 inches. The height of his double-story dwelling is seven times his own height. The distance from the floor to the ceiling on the ground floor is three times Mattison's height. Can you determine the height in inches from the floor of the second floor to the roof?,"To find the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof, we need to subtract the height of the ground floor from the total height of the dwelling.

First, let's calculate the total height of the dwelling. It's seven times Mattison's height. 
Mattison's height = 60 inches
Total height of the dwelling = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches

Next, let's calculate the height of the ground floor. It's three times Mattison's height.
Height of the ground floor = 3 * 60 inches = 180 inches

Now, we subtract the height of the ground floor from the total height of the dwelling to find the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof.
Height from the floor of the second floor to the roof = Total height of the dwelling - Height of the ground floor
= 420 inches - 180 inches
= 240 inches

She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 3/10 of one hundred letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. There are 3/5 of one hundred letters needing stamps. 
   3/5 * 100 = 60 letters needing stamps.

2. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
   1/3 * 60 = 20 letters.

3. Now, there are 3/10 of one hundred letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.
   3/10 * 100 = 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

4. Since Jennie added 20 letters to the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to subtract 20 to find out how many were in that pile when Jennie began.
   30 - 20 = 10

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.

After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?","To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to calculate the total cost including the extra fees.

1. Calculate the 25% fee on the final bill: 
25% of $40.50 = 0.25 * $40.50 = $10.13

2. Add the 25% fee to the final bill: 
$40.50 + $10.13 = $50.63

3. Add the delivery fee:

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $400/month, her credit card's minimum is $300/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $600/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?","To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt and then add them together. 

1. Student loans: 50% more than the minimum payment of $400 is $400 * 0.5 = $200. So, the new monthly payment is $400 + $200 = $600. 

2. Credit card: 50% more than the minimum payment of $300 is $300 * 0.5 = $150. So, the new monthly payment is $300 + $150 = $450.

3. Mortgage: 50% more than the minimum payment of $600 is $600 * 0.5 = $300. So, the new monthly payment is $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, we add the new monthly payments together: $600 (student loans) + $450 (credit card) + $900 (mortgage) = $1950 per month.

To find the yearly payment, we multiply the monthly payment by 12: $1950 * 12 = $23400.

1467,"Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together. Paisley ran 4.5 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran and 3.5 miles farther than Lynn. How many miles did Lynn run?","To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to first determine how many miles Reggie ran. 

Paisley ran 4.5 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. 
Reggie's miles = 5 * Paisley's miles
Reggie's miles = 5 * 4.5
Reggie's miles = 22.5

Reggie also ran 3.5 miles farther than Lynn. 
Reggie's miles = Lynn's miles + 3.5
22.5 = Lynn's miles + 3.5

To find Lynn's miles, subtract 3.5 from both sides.
Lynn's miles = 22.5 - 3.5
Lynn's miles = 19

2390,"A fruit farm specializing in apples offers them in packs of 10. On a particular day, they managed to sell 2000 apples. If each pack is priced at $5, what is the total revenue the farm made from these sales?","To find the total revenue, we need to first find out how many packs were sold. 

Since each pack contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold (2000) by the number of apples per pack (10).

2000 apples / 10 apples per pack = 200 packs

Now that we know 200 packs were sold, we can multiply this by the price per pack ($5) to find the total revenue.

200 packs * $5 per pack = $1000

895,"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days with 20kg of paint, how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days with 20kg of paint. 
   This means that one person can paint a whole house in 10 days with 40kg of paint (since painting a whole house requires twice the time and paint of painting half a house).

2. If one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, then 5 people can paint a whole house in 10 / 5 = 2 days.

3. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days is equivalent to 2 * 24 = 48 hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

If his car payment is $500 and he spends $5 on fuel each time he rents out his car, how much profit does he make on his car?","To calculate John's profit, we need to calculate his total income and total expenses.

1. Calculate total income:
   - Number of rentals per month: 10
   - Hours per rental: 3
   - Total hours per month: 10 * 3 = 30 hours
   - Hourly rate: $25
   - Total income per month: 30 hours * $25/hour = $750

2. Calculate total expenses:
   - Car payment per month: $500
   - Fuel cost per rental: $5
   - Total fuel cost per month: 10 rentals * $5/rental = $50
   - Total expenses per month: $500 (car payment) + $50 (fuel) = $550

On average, each student sold  0.1 times of one hundred lollipops. If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops?","To find the total profit from selling lollipops, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total cost.

1. First, we need to find the number of students who sold lollipops. 3/10 of 100 students is (3/10) * 100 = 30 students.

2. Next, we need to find the total number of lollipops sold. Each student sold 0.1 times 100 lollipops, which is 0.1 * 100 = 10 lollipops per student. Since there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300 lollipops.

3. Now, we can calculate the total revenue. Each lollipop costs $0.8, so the total revenue is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

4. Then, we need to find the total cost. Each lollipop costs $0.5, so the total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

5. Finally, we can calculate the total profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $240 - $150 = $90.

1155,"Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have monthly interest of 0.02 times. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, how much should she give to Benedict?","To find out how much Mandy should give to Benedict, we need to calculate the interest for 3 months and add it to the principal amount.

Initial amount = $100
Monthly interest rate = 0.02
Number of months = 3

Interest for the first month = $100 * 0.02 = $2
Total amount after the first month = $100 + $2 = $102

Interest for the second month = $102 * 0.02 = $2.04
Total amount after the second month = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

Interest for the third month = $104.04 * 0.02 = $2.0808
Total amount after the third month = $104.04 + $2.0808 ≈ $106.12

So, Mandy should give Benedict approximately $106.12.

If the class is able to raise $90 from the profits from selling the lollipops, how much does each lollipop cost?","To find the cost of each lollipop, we first need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops and then subtract the total profit to find the total cost. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
Number of students = 30
Average lollipops sold per student = 10
Total lollipops sold = Number of students * Average lollipops sold per student
Total lollipops sold = 30 * 10 = 300

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
Price per lollipop = $0.80
Total revenue = Total lollipops sold * Price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 * $0.80 = $240

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the lollipops.
Total profit = $90
Total cost = Total revenue - Total profit
Total cost = $240 - $90 = $150

Total corn chips = 225
Amora's corn chips = 70
Lainey's corn chips = 70
Total corn chips Amora and Lainey got = 70 + 70 = 140

Now, let's subtract the total amount of corn chips Amora and Lainey got from the total amount of corn chips to find out how many Collins got.

Collins' corn chips = Total corn chips - Total corn chips Amora and Lainey got
Collins' corn chips = 225 - 140

1. First, find out how many hours Jordan spends playing video games per day:
   Since Jordan plays video games for 1/5 of ten hours, we multiply 10 hours by 1/5.
   10 * (1/5) = 10/5 = 2 hours per day.

2. Next, find out how many hours Jordan spends playing video games per week:
   There are 7 days in a week, so multiply the hours per day by 7.
   2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.

3. Now, find out how much money Jordan would earn if he worked those 14 hours per week:

Each duck needs 1400 grams per week. 
There are 10 ducks, so they need 1400 * 10 = 14000 grams per week.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total amount of insects they need per week by 7 to find the amount they need per day.

If she gave the cards to 30 students, how many boxes of baseball cards does Miss Maria have in total?","To find out how many boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has, let's first calculate the total number of cards she gave to her students and the number of cards she kept for herself.

Miss Maria gave 10 cards to each of her 30 students, so she gave away 10 * 30 = 300 cards.

She kept 50 cards for herself.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards she had initially. We know that she gave away 300 cards and kept 50, so the total number of cards she had initially is 300 + 50 = 350 cards.

We know that Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, each with 25 cards. So, the total number of basketball cards she has is 6 * 25 = 150 cards.

Since she had a total of 350 cards initially, and 150 of them are basketball cards, the number of baseball cards she has is 350 - 150 = 200 cards.

We know that each box of baseball cards has 40 cards. To find out how many boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has, we divide the total number of baseball cards by the number of cards in each box: 200 / 40 = 5.

If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, they each will get 4 pounds of candy. Then how many pounds of candy does Aaron have?","Let's break this down step by step.

1. Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy. The total amount of candy they have is 3 + 5 = 8 pounds.

2. Since they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, including Aaron, the total amount of candy will be divided by 3 (the number of people). 

3. We know that each person will get 4 pounds of candy after sharing. To find the total amount of candy, we multiply the amount each person gets by the number of people: 4 pounds/person * 3 people = 12 pounds.

4. We already know that Robert and Cindy have a total of 8 pounds of candy. To find out how much candy Aaron has, we subtract the total amount of candy Robert and Cindy have from the total amount of candy: 12 pounds - 8 pounds = 4 pounds.

So, Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they use on the first day?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. On the first day, the nurses started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had a total of 19 + 50 = 69 bandages.

Let's denote the number of bandages used on the first day as x.

2. After using x bandages on the first day, they were left with 69 - x bandages.

3. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is x - 10.

So, the total number of bandages left after the second day is 69 - x - (x - 10) = 69 - 2x + 10 = 79 - 2x.

4. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each (2 * 50 = 100) and used half a pack (50/2 = 25).

After using 25 bandages, they had 179 - 2x - 25 = 154 - 2x bandages left.

5. According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

154 - 2x = 78

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 154 - 78
2x = 76
x = 38

So, the nurses used 38 bandages on the first day.

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 400 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile walk, in minutes?","To find the total time taken for the entire 30-mile walk, we need to find the time taken for the sidewalk and add it to the time taken for the beach.

We know that Grandma spends 400 minutes walking on the beach. Let's assume her speed on the beach is 'x' miles per minute. Then, the distance covered on the beach (20 miles) can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed * Time
20 = x * 400
x = 20 / 400
x = 1/20 miles per minute

We are given that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2x = 2 * (1/20) = 1/10 miles per minute.

The distance covered on the sidewalk is 10 miles. We can calculate the time taken for the sidewalk as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 10 / (1/10)
Time = 10 * 10
Time = 100 minutes

Now, we add the time taken for the beach (400 minutes) and the time taken for the sidewalk (100 minutes) to find the total time taken for the entire 30-mile walk:

Total Time = 400 + 100
Total Time = 500 minutes

1. Number of cards with the letter A: 0.4 * 80 = 32
   Remaining cards: 80 - 32 = 48

2. Number of cards with the letter B: 0.5 * 48 = 24
   Remaining cards: 48 - 24 = 24

3. Number of cards with the letter C: (5/8) * 24 = 15

He'd dumped a lego boxed set on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the first one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces. How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?","To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to know the number of pieces in the first box and then calculate the number of pieces in the other two boxes.

Let's assume the first box has 'x' pieces. 

The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3x pieces.

The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has (1/4)x or 0.25x pieces.

Now, we need to add the number of pieces in all three boxes to find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up.

Total number of blocks = x + 3x + 0.25x
Total number of blocks = 4.25x

However, we still don't know the value of 'x'. Since we don't have the exact number of pieces in the first box, we can't find the exact total number of blocks. But if we knew the value of 'x', we could calculate the total.

For example, if the first box had 100 pieces (x = 100), then:
Total number of blocks = 4.25 * 100
Total number of blocks = 425

So, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is 4.25 times the number of pieces in the first box."

1. Total cost of four pizzas: 64 dollars
2. Price of two pizzas: 30 dollars

First, subtract the price of the two pizzas from the total cost to find the cost of the remaining two pizzas:
64 (total cost) - 30 (price of two pizzas) = 34 dollars

Since the remaining two pizzas were priced equally, divide the cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:
34 / 2 = 17 dollars

So, the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas is 17 dollars.

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?","To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her total monthly payments. 

1. Calculate 50% of each minimum payment:
- Student loans: 50% of $3000 = $3000 * 0.5 = $1500
- Credit card: 50% of $2000 = $2000 * 0.5 = $1000
- Mortgage: 50% of $5000 = $5000 * 0.5 = $2500

2. Add 50% to each minimum payment:
- Student loans: $3000 + $1500 = $4500
- Credit card: $2000 + $1000 = $3000
- Mortgage: $5000 + $2500 = $7500

While the second charges, $25.5 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5.5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5.5x (food cost per guest). 
So, the total cost of the first venue is 200 + 5.5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25.5 per guest, so the total cost is 25.5x.

Since we want to find out when the costs are equal, we set up the equation:

200 + 5.5x = 25.5x

Now, let's solve for x:

200 = 25.5x - 5.5x
200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 200 / 20
x = 10

So, the two venues will be equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

256,The school has 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to know the total number of students in the school and the total number of girls. 

Since we don't know the total number of students, let's assume the total number of students in the school is 'x'. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls is 0.5x and the total number of boys is 0.5x.

We know the number of girls in the first and second classes. Let's find the total number of girls in these two classes: 
15 (girls in the first class) + 12 (girls in the second class) = 27 girls.

Since the total number of girls in the school is 0.5x, and 27 girls are in the first two classes, the number of girls in the third class is 0.5x - 27.

However, we still don't know the value of 'x'. To find 'x', we can use the fact that the school has 3 classes and the ratio of boys to girls is 1:1. We know the number of girls in the first two classes, but we don't know the total number of students in these classes.

Let's assume the total number of students in the first class is 'a' and the total number of students in the second class is 'b'. We know that the number of girls in the first class is 15, so the number of boys in the first class is 'a - 15'. Similarly, the number of boys in the second class is 'b - 12'.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 1:1, the total number of boys is equal to the total number of girls. We can set up an equation using the number of boys and girls in the first two classes:
(a - 15) + (b - 12) = 27 (since there are 27 girls in the first two classes)

Combine like terms:
a + b - 27 = 27
a + b = 54

Now, we know that the total number of students in the school is 'x', and the total number of students in the first two classes is 'a + b', which is 54. Since the school has 3 classes, the total number of students in the third class is 'x - 54'.

We also know that the total number of girls in the school is 0.5x, and 27 girls are in the first two classes. So, the number of girls in the third class is 0.5x - 27.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 1:1, the number of boys in the third class is also 0.5x - 27 (since the number of boys is equal to the number of girls).

Now, we can set up an equation using the total number of students in the school:
x = (number of students in the first two classes) + (number of students in the third class)
x = 54 + (number of students in the third class)

We know that the number of students in the third class is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls:
(number of students in the third class) = (0.5x - 27) + (0.5x - 27)
(number of students in the third class) = x - 54

Now, substitute this expression into the equation for 'x':
x = 54 + (x - 54)
x = x

This equation is true for all values of 'x'. However, we can use the fact that the number of boys in the third class is 0.5x - 27, and the number of boys is equal to the number of girls. Since the number of girls in the first two classes is 27, the number of girls in the third class is also 27 (since the total number of girls is 0.5x, and 0.5x = 27 + 27).

Now, we can find the number of boys in the third class:
(number of boys in the third class) = (number of girls in the third class)
(number of boys in the third class) = 27 - (number of girls in the first and second classes that are not in the third class) + (number of girls in the third class that are not in the first and second classes)
(number of boys in the third class) = 27

However, this is not the number of boys in the third class, this is the number of girls in the third class. We know that the total number of girls in the school is 0.5x, and 27 girls are in the first two classes, so the number of girls in the third class is also 27. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 1:1, the number of boys in the third class is also 27.

However, this is not correct. We assumed the total number of students in the school is 'x', but we don't know the value of 'x'. Let's go back to the beginning and try again.

We know the number of girls in the first and second classes. Let's find the total number of girls in these two classes: 
15 (girls in the first class) + 12 (girls in the second class) = 27 girls.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls is equal to the total number of boys. Let's assume the total number of students in the first class is 'a' and the total number of students in the second class is 'b'. We know that the number of girls in the first class is 15, so the number of boys in the first class is 'a - 15'. Similarly, the number of boys in the second class is 'b - 12'.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 1:1, the total number of boys is equal to the total number of girls. We can set up an equation using the number of boys and girls in the first two classes:
(a - 15) + (b - 12) = 27 (since there are 27 girls in the first two classes)

Combine like terms:
a + b - 27 = 27
a + b = 54

Now, we know that the total number of students in the first two classes is 54. Since the school has 3 classes and the ratio of boys to girls is 1:1, the total number of students in the school must be a multiple of 2 (since the number of boys is equal to the number of girls). Let's assume the total number of students in the school is 108 (which is a multiple of 2).

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls is 54 (which is half of 108). We know that 27 girls are in the first two classes, so the number of girls in the third class is 54 - 27 = 27.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 1:1, the number of boys in the third class is also 27.

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 girls and 10 boys.

2. Let's say the number of seashells brought by each boy is x.

3. Since there are 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10x.

4. According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, the total number of seashells brought by the girls is 10x + 4(10x) = 10x + 40x = 50x.

5. Since there are 10 girls, the number of seashells brought by each girl is the total number of seashells brought by the girls divided by 10, which is 50x / 10 = 5x.

However, we still need to find the value of x. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the value of x. But we can express the number of seashells brought by each girl in terms of x.

Average height of heels = 3 inches
Number of women = 6

Total height of heels = Average height * Number of women
Total height of heels = 3 * 6
Total height of heels = 18 inches

Now, we know three women are wearing 2-inch heels. 

Total height of 2-inch heels = 2 * 3
Total height of 2-inch heels = 6 inches

To find the height of heels the other three women are wearing, we subtract the total height of 2-inch heels from the total height of heels.

Total height of heels the other three women are wearing = Total height of heels - Total height of 2-inch heels
Total height of heels the other three women are wearing = 18 - 6
Total height of heels the other three women are wearing = 12 inches

Since there are three women wearing the same height heels, we divide the total height by 3.

If he used 160 square feet of fabrics, what is the length of the bed?","To find the length of the bed, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the length of the bed as 'L' and the width as 'W'. We are given that the width of the bed is 2 feet longer than the length, so we can write:
   W = L + 2

2. We are also given that the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the dimensions of the fabric are:
   Fabric length = L + 2
   Fabric width = W + 2

   Substituting W = L + 2 into the fabric width equation:
   Fabric width = (L + 2) + 2
   Fabric width = L + 4

3. The area of the fabric is given as 160 square feet. Since Jim has two pieces of fabric, the total area of the fabric is twice the area of one piece. The area of one piece of fabric is:
   Area of one piece of fabric = (L + 2) * (L + 4)

   Since Jim has two pieces of fabric, the total area is:
   Total area = 2 * (L + 2) * (L + 4)

   We are given that the total area is 160 square feet, but we need to divide this by 2 since we're working with the area of one piece of fabric for now, so the equation becomes:
   (L + 2) * (L + 4) = 160 / 2
   (L + 2) * (L + 4) = 80

4. Now, let's solve the equation (L + 2) * (L + 4) = 80.
   L^2 + 4L + 2L + 8 = 80
   L^2 + 6L + 8 = 80
   L^2 + 6L - 72 = 0

   Factoring the quadratic equation:
   (L + 12)(L - 6) = 0

   This gives us two possible values for L:
   L + 12 = 0 or L - 6 = 0
   L = -12 or L = 6

   Since the length of the bed cannot be negative, we discard L = -12.

   Therefore, the length of the bed is 6 feet.

On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?","To find the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, there are 48 people riding the bus.

At the first stop:
- 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 48 - 8 = 40.
- 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus, which is 5 * 8 = 40 people.
- So, the total number of passengers after the first stop is 40 (remaining) + 40 (new) = 80.

At the second stop:
- 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is 80 - 21 = 59.
- 3 times fewer passengers get on, which means 1/3 of 21 get on. So, (1/3) * 21 = 7 people get on.
- So, the total number of passengers after the second stop is 59 (remaining) + 7 (new) = 66.

2325,"Last night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. Rick killed 73 animals in all, so how many cougars did he kill last night?","Let's break down the information given:

1. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and some cougars.
2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
3. Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.
4. Rick killed 73 animals in all.

Let's denote the number of cougars killed last night as 'x'. Then the number of cougars killed today is 'x - 3'.

The number of wolves killed today is three times the number of cougars killed today, which is 3(x - 3).

The total number of wolves killed is 10 (last night) + 3(x - 3) (today).

The total number of cougars killed is x (last night) + x - 3 (today).

The total number of animals killed is 73. We can set up an equation to represent this:

10 + 3(x - 3) + x + x - 3 = 73

Combine like terms and simplify the equation:

10 + 3x - 9 + 2x - 3 = 73
Combine like terms:
5x - 2 = 73
Add 2 to both sides:
5x = 75
Divide both sides by 5:
x = 15

So Rick killed 15 cougars last night.

Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can represent their ages as 7x and 11x, respectively.

We are also given that Allen's age 10 years from now is 109. Since Allen's current age is 11x, his age 10 years from now will be 11x + 10. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
11x + 10 = 109

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:
11x = 99

Dividing both sides by 11 gives us:
x = 9

Now that we know x, we can find Darrell and Allen's current ages:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7(9) = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11(9) = 99

Finally, we can find their total age now by adding their individual ages:
Total age now = 63 + 99 = 162

How many total times can both DVDs be played before they break?","To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to find out how many times each DVD can be played before it breaks, then add those numbers together.

DVD 1 has been played 3560 times. It can be played 10000 times before it breaks. So, the number of times it can be played before it breaks is:
10000 - 3560 = 6440

DVD 2 has been played 1350 times. It can be played 10000 times before it breaks. So, the number of times it can be played before it breaks is:

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house: 
   Number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house = x / 3
   Number of vacuum cleaners left = x - x / 3
   Number of vacuum cleaners left = 2x / 3

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house:
   Number of vacuum cleaners left = 2x / 3 - 2

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house:
   Number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house = (2x / 3 - 2) / 2
   Since she sold half of what was left, the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is also (2x / 3 - 2) / 2.

Now, let's find the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:
   Number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house = x / 3
   Number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house = 2
   Number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house = (2x / 3 - 2) / 2
   Total number of vacuum cleaners sold = x / 3 + 2 + (2x / 3 - 2) / 2
   Since Melanie sold all her vacuum cleaners, we can equate the total number of vacuum cleaners sold to 'x':

- Highest trees: 30 apples
- Lowest trees: 15 apples
- Medium-height trees: x apples
- Total apples picked by Joanne: 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x

If there are 12 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?","To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum number of classes he can attend while still keeping the cost per class below $20.

The total cost of the classes is $80, and the maximum cost per class is $20. 

First, let's find the maximum number of classes Manny can attend while keeping the cost per class below $20:

Maximum number of classes = Total cost / Maximum cost per class
Maximum number of classes = $80 / $20
Maximum number of classes = 4

However, this is not the correct interpretation of the problem. Manny's parents will sign him up again if the cost per class is $20 or less. Since there are 12 classes, the cost per class will be:

Cost per class = Total cost / Number of classes
Cost per class = $80 / 12
Cost per class = $6.67

Since the cost per class ($6.67) is already less than $20, Manny's parents will sign him up again regardless of the number of classes he attends. However, we can find the minimum number of classes Manny must attend to keep the cost per class below $20:

Minimum number of classes = Total cost / Maximum cost per class
Minimum number of classes = $80 / $20
Minimum number of classes = 4

Now, let's find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss:

Maximum number of classes that can be missed = Total number of classes - Minimum number of classes
Maximum number of classes that can be missed = 12 - 4
Maximum number of classes that can be missed = 8

So, Manny can miss up to 8 classes before the cost per class exceeds $20.

Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames. But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If Polly is standing 200 feet away from the reach of the dragon's flames where she can just hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the gemstone, so how many feet can a dragon breathe fire?","To find out how many feet the dragon can breathe fire, we need to determine the distance from Polly to the dragon when she's holding the gemstone and can just hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

When Polly is holding the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can normally throw the javelin 400 feet, with the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.

However, we know that Polly is standing 200 feet away from the reach of the dragon's flames where she can just hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the gemstone. This means that the distance from Polly to the dragon is 1200 feet (her throwing distance with the gemstone) minus 200 feet (the distance from the dragon's flames to Polly).

So, the distance from Polly to the dragon is 1200 - 200 = 1000 feet.

Since the dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet, but the question asks how many feet the dragon can breathe fire, we can assume that the dragon can breathe fire up to the point where Polly can just hit it with the javelin while holding the gemstone. However, the question asks for the distance the dragon can breathe fire, and we know Polly is standing 200 feet away from the reach of the dragon's flames.

Therefore, the distance the dragon can breathe fire is 1000 - 200 = 800 feet, but that is from Polly. The question asks how many feet the dragon can breathe fire. We know the dragon can breathe fire to where Polly is standing 200 feet away from the flames, but we also know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone and hit the dragon. 

Since Polly can hit the dragon with the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, the dragon can breathe fire to 400 feet."

If a gallon jar costs $5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.","To find the total amount Cecelia spent, we need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar and then calculate the total cost of the jars she purchased.

1. A gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.

2. Now, we can calculate the total cost of the jars:
   - The cost of 10 gallon jars is 10 * $5 = $50.
   - The cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.

3. The total amount Cecelia spent on the jars is $50 + $48 = $98.

However, we also need to consider the cost of the yogurt cans. Since we don't have information about Cecelia buying any yogurt cans, we can ignore the information about the yogurt cans.

So, the total amount Cecelia spent is $98.

Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. How many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
3. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as 'x'.

Now, let's consider Joanne's sister:
1. She gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
2. She gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
3. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Since the problem doesn't provide the total number of apples gathered by either Joanne or her sister, we can't directly compare their total amounts. However, we can compare their amounts from each type of tree.

To find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we need more information. But if we assume the problem wants us to find 'x' based on the given information, we can say that the problem is incomplete.

However, we can express the total number of apples gathered by Joanne as 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x.

Since the problem doesn't provide enough information to find the exact value of 'x', we can't give a numerical answer."
1577,"Colby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 6 quarters, 5 dimes, 15 nickels, and 15 pennies, how many can he buy?","To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has in nickels. 

He has 6 quarters, which is 6 * $0.25 = $1.50. 
He has 5 dimes, which is 5 * $0.10 = $0.50. 
He has 15 nickels, which is 15 * $0.05 = $0.75. 
He has 15 pennies, which is 15 * $0.01 = $0.15.

Now, let's convert all the money into nickels. 
$1.50 = 30 nickels ($1.50 / $0.05)
$0.50 = 10 nickels ($0.50 / $0.05)
$0.75 = 15 nickels (he already has this in nickels)
$0.15 = 3 nickels ($0.15 / $0.05)

Now, let's add the nickels together. 
30 + 10 + 15 + 3 = 58

Since each gumball costs a nickel, Colby can buy 58 gumballs.

1299,"Chatty prepared 3/10 of ten dozen eggs for her 0.4 times of ten children's Easter activity. Assuming each child gets the same number of eggs, how many eggs does each child receive?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many eggs Chatty prepared. We know she prepared 3/10 of ten dozen eggs. 
   - Ten dozen eggs is 10 * 12 = 120 eggs.
   - 3/10 of 120 eggs is 3/10 * 120 = 36 eggs.

2. Now, we know Chatty prepared 36 eggs for her children.

3. Next, we need to find out how many children are participating in the Easter activity. We know it's 0.4 times of ten children.
   - 0.4 times of ten children is 0.4 * 10 = 4 children.

4. Now, we know there are 36 eggs for 4 children. To find out how many eggs each child gets, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.
   - 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs per child.

So, each child receives 9 eggs.

If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, how many grams of protein does he get per week?","To determine the grams of protein John gets per week from mushrooms, we need to know the protein content of mushrooms. The protein content of mushrooms varies depending on the type, but on average, a cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains about 2-3 grams of protein. Let's assume an average of 2.5 grams of protein per 100 grams of mushrooms.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cups of mushrooms John eats per day.
Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day and 1 cup is 100 grams, he eats 2 cups of mushrooms per day.

Step 2: Calculate the grams of protein John gets per day.
Since 1 cup of mushrooms contains 2.5 grams of protein, 2 cups of mushrooms contain 2.5 * 2 = 5 grams of protein per day.

Step 3: Calculate the grams of protein John gets per week.
There are 7 days in a week. If John gets 5 grams of protein per day, he gets 5 * 7 = 35 grams of protein per week.

1. Claire uses 3 eggs per omelet.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days = 21 eggs/week.
3. Since there are 4 weeks, she will use 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.
4. To convert the number of eggs to dozens, we divide by 12 (since 1 dozen = 12 eggs): 84 eggs / 12 = 7 dozen eggs.

776,"Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk starts out several feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?","To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than 20 feet. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, let's start with a height of 1 foot (the smallest possible height) and calculate the height for each day.

Day 1: 1 foot (initial height)
Day 2: 2 feet (doubled from 1 foot)
Day 3: 4 feet (doubled from 2 feet)
Day 4: 8 feet (doubled from 4 feet)
Day 5: 16 feet (doubled from 8 feet)
Day 6: 32 feet (doubled from 16 feet)

On the 6th day, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window (20 feet). Since the beanstalk can start at any height, we need to consider the minimum number of days it will take to be taller than 20 feet.

If the beanstalk starts at 1 foot, it will take 6 days to be taller than 20 feet. If it starts at 2 feet, it will take 5 days. If it starts at 4 feet, it will take 4 days. If it starts at 8 feet, it will take 3 days. If it starts at 16 feet, it will take 2 days.

However, the problem asks for the number of days it will take to be taller than Mark's window, regardless of the initial height. Therefore, the minimum number of days it will take is 2 days, assuming the beanstalk starts at 16 feet or more. But if the beanstalk starts at a height less than 16 feet, it will take more days.

Since we do not know the exact initial height of the beanstalk, we can say that it will take at least 2 days to be taller than Mark's window if it starts at 16 feet or more, but it will take more days if it starts at a height less than 16 feet.

However, if we assume that the beanstalk starts at a height of 1 foot, the answer will be {6}."

How much is Walter's lawyer going to contribute?,"To determine the lawyer's contribution, we need to calculate the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer's donation.

1. Let's call the amount collected from the neighbors 'x'. 
2. Walter collects $1500 from the online fund.
3. The total amount collected before the lawyer's donation is x + 1500.
4. The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. This means the lawyer will donate 3 times the total amount collected by Walter from the neighbors and the online fund.
5. The lawyer's donation is 3 * (x + 1500).
6. However, Walter also receives $200 from his friend. So, the total amount collected by Walter is x + 1500 + 200 = x + 1700.
7. Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that the lawyer donates 3 times the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer's donation. We also know that the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer's donation is x + 1700. Since the lawyer donates 3 times this amount, we can set up the equation:
   Total amount collected = x + 1700 + 3 * (x + 1700)
   However, we don't have the total amount collected. We need more information to find 'x'. 
8. Fortunately, we can find the lawyer's donation without knowing 'x'. We know that the lawyer donates 3 times the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer's donation. We also know that the total amount collected by Walter before the lawyer's donation is x + 1500 + 200 (from the friend).

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, let's set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

The cost of the first venue is $2000 (flat fee) + $50x (food cost per guest). 
The cost of the second venue is $250x (cost per guest).

Since we want to find out when the costs are equal, we set up the equation:

2000 + 50x = 250x

Now, let's solve for x:

2000 = 250x - 50x
2000 = 200x

Divide both sides by 200:

x = 2000 / 200
x = 10

So, the two venues will be equal in cost when there are 10 guests.

Dr. Grumpus told Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, and to place them all on the lab bench. By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested. And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost several on the way to the lab bench. How many beakers did Igor lose?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

3. Since Igor gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes, and he was supposed to gather 16 test tubes and 14 Petri dishes, we can find the total number of items he gathered and the total number of items he was supposed to gather.
   Total items gathered: 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers, which we know he gathered correctly initially) = 31 items.
   Total items requested: 16 (test tubes) + 14 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) = 37 items.

4. However, we are told that Igor lost several beakers on the way to the lab bench. Since we know the total number of items requested and the total number of items gathered, we can set up an equation to find the number of beakers lost.
   Let x be the number of beakers lost. Then, the total number of items gathered (including the lost beakers) is 31 + x.
   We know that the total number of items gathered (including the lost beakers) is equal to the total number of items requested, which is 37.
   So, we can set up the equation: 31 + x = 37.

5. Solving for x, we get: x = 37 - 31 = 6.

However, we know that Igor initially gathered 7 beakers. So, the number of beakers lost is 7 - (7 - x) = x. Since x = 6, Igor initially gathered 7 beakers and lost 6 beakers is not possible. 

We need to revisit step 3 and 4. 
In step 3, we know that Igor gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes. So, the total number of test tubes and Petri dishes gathered is 8 + 16 = 24. 
The total number of items requested is 16 (test tubes) + 14 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) = 37 items.
The total number of items gathered is 24 (test tubes and Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers, which we know he gathered correctly initially) = 31 items.

In step 4, we can set up an equation to find the number of beakers lost.
Let x be the number of beakers lost. Then, the total number of beakers gathered is 7 - x.
The total number of items gathered is 24 (test tubes and Petri dishes) + 7 - x (beakers).
We know that the total number of items gathered is equal to the total number of items requested minus the difference in the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.
The difference in the number of test tubes and Petri dishes is (16 - 8) + (14 - 16) = 6.
So, the total number of items gathered is 37 - 6 = 31.
We can set up the equation: 24 + 7 - x = 31.

Solving for x, we get: 31 - 24 - 7 = -x, -x = -6, x = 6 is not possible. 
31 - 24 - 7 + x = 0, x = 0 is not possible.
31 - 24 - 7 = -x + x, -x + x = 0, 0 = 0.

We need to revisit the problem again. 
We know that Igor gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes. 
So, the total number of test tubes and Petri dishes gathered is 8 + 16 = 24.
The total number of items requested is 16 (test tubes) + 14 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) = 37 items.
The total number of items gathered is 24 (test tubes and Petri dishes) + x (beakers).
We know that the total number of items gathered is equal to the total number of items requested minus the difference in the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.
The difference in the number of test tubes and Petri dishes is (16 - 8) + (14 - 16) = 6.
So, the total number of items gathered is 37 - 6 = 31.
We can set up the equation: 24 + x = 31.

Solving for x, we get: x = 31 - 24 = 7.

However, we know that Igor initially gathered 7 beakers. 
So, the number of beakers lost is 7 - x. 
We need to revisit the problem again.

We know that Igor gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes. 
So, the total number of test tubes and Petri dishes gathered is 8 + 16 = 24.
The total number of items requested is 16 (test tubes) + 14 (Petri dishes) + 7 (beakers) = 37 items.
The total number of items gathered is 24 (test tubes and Petri dishes) + x (beakers).
We know that the total number of items gathered is equal to the total number of items requested minus the difference in the number of test tubes and Petri dishes.
The difference in the number of test tubes and Petri dishes is (16 - 8) + (16 - 14) = 10.
So, the total number of items gathered is 37 - 10 = 27.
We can set up the equation: 24 + x = 27.

Solving for x, we get: x = 27 - 24 = 3.

However, we know that Igor initially gathered 7 beakers. 
So, the number of beakers lost is 7 - 3 = 4.

1. First, we need to find out how much money Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. 
   Since she sets aside 25% of her paycheck, we'll multiply her monthly income by 0.25.
   Jessica's monthly income: $2,000.50
   Monthly savings for shoes: $2,000.50 * 0.25 = $500.13

2. Next, we need to find out how much money Jessica saves for shoes in a year.
   Since there are 12 months in a year, we'll multiply her monthly savings by 12.
   Yearly savings for shoes: $500.13 * 12 = $6,001.56

3. Now, we need to find out how many shoes Jessica can buy with her yearly savings.

Given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, we can write the equation:
P + L + J = 100

Also, we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write:
P = L + J

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one:
(L + J) + L + J = 100

Combine like terms:
2L + 2J = 100

Divide both sides by 2:
L + J = 50

Since P = L + J, we can substitute L + J with 50:
P = 50

So, Peter's age is 50 years old.

Can you determine how many tennis balls Rory collected in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of balls collected in the first set as 'x', the second set as 'y', and the third set as 'z'. 

We know from the problem that:
1. The number of balls collected in the first set exceeded the number in the second set by four: x = y + 4
2. In the third set, he collected half the number of balls as he did in the second set: z = y / 2 or z = 0.5y
3. The total number of balls collected from all three sets is 19: x + y + z = 19

We can substitute x and z from the first two equations into the third equation:
(y + 4) + y + 0.5y = 19
Combine like terms:
2.5y + 4 = 19
Subtract 4 from both sides:
2.5y = 15
Divide both sides by 2.5:

x = y + 4
x = 6 + 4
x = 10

If 0.9 times of ten kids want 2 smores apiece and 3/5 of ten adults will eat 1 smore apiece, how many boxes of graham crackers will they need?","To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we need to calculate the total number of s'mores required.

First, let's calculate the number of s'mores the kids want: 
0.9 * 10 kids = 9 kids
9 kids * 2 s'mores/kid = 18 s'mores

Next, let's calculate the number of s'mores the adults want:
3/5 * 10 adults = 6 adults
6 adults * 1 s'more/adult = 6 s'mores

Now, let's add the total number of s'mores:
18 s'mores (kids) + 6 s'mores (adults) = 24 s'mores

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes 8 s'mores, we need:
24 s'mores / 8 s'mores/sleeve = 3 sleeves

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need:
3 sleeves / 3 sleeves/box = 1 box

2149,"If Sam and Harry have some feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, and 20 feet is left over for Sam. How many feet of fence are there between Sam and Harry?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say the total length of the fence is x feet.
2. Sam and Harry agree to split the fence, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam.
3. Let's say Sam gets y feet of the fence. Then, Harry gets y + 60 feet of the fence.
4. We know that the total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths that Sam and Harry get, plus the 20 feet that is left over for Sam. This can be represented by the equation:

x = y + (y + 60) + 20
5. Combine like terms:

x = 2y + 80
6. We are also told that 20 feet is left over for Sam, which means that the length of the fence that Sam gets is 20 feet. So, we can set up the equation:

y = 20
7. Substitute this value of y into the equation from step 5:

x = 2(20) + 80
x = 40 + 80
x = 120

So, the total length of the fence is 120 feet.

1. There are 30 helmets.
2. There are half as many helmets as footballs, so the number of footballs is 2 times the number of helmets: 2 * 30 = 60 footballs.
3. There are half as many robots as helmets, so the number of robots is half the number of helmets: 30 / 2 = 15 robots.

Now, we can find the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs:
15 (robots) + 30 (helmets) + 60 (footballs) = 105

He has $120 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $10. A 2 x 8 costs $12. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to find out which type of wood gives the most sticks per dollar.

For the 2 x 4 piece of wood:
- Cost: $10
- Number of sticks: 200
- Sticks per dollar: 200 / 10 = 20

For the 2 x 8 piece of wood:
- Cost: $12
- Number of sticks: 400
- Sticks per dollar: 400 / 12 = 33.33

Since 33.33 is greater than 20, the 2 x 8 piece of wood is the cheapest option in terms of sticks per dollar.

Now, let's find out how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $120:
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces = 120 / 12 = 10

965,Rong has been saving some coins in his piggy bank every month. Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. They have 5760 coins in total in ten years after they started their savings. How much money does Rong save  in his piggy bank every month?,"To find out how much Rong saves in his piggy bank every month, let's denote the number of coins Rong saves per month as 'x'. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, Neil saves (x + 2/5x) coins per month, which simplifies to (7/5)x.

They have been saving for 10 years, which is 120 months. The total number of coins they have saved is 5760. 

The total number of coins saved by Rong is 120x, and the total number of coins saved by Neil is (7/5)x * 120. 

We can write the equation as follows:
120x + (7/5)x * 120 = 5760

Combine like terms:
(120 + 168)x = 5760
288x = 5760

Now, divide both sides by 288:
x = 5760 / 288
x = 20

How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?,"To find the distance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to break down the information provided.

1. Henry's total trip distance was 100 miles.
2. He stopped after 20 miles (first stop).
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means he stopped 15 miles before the 100-mile mark. To find this distance, we subtract 15 from 100: 100 - 15 = 85 miles. This is the point where he made his second stop.
4. Now, we need to find the distance between the first stop (20 miles) and the second stop (85 miles). To do this, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop: 85 - 20 = 65 miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 65 miles between his first and second stops.

What is the daily saving amount he needs to set aside during the second half of the month?","To find the daily saving amount Elvis needs to set aside during the second half of the month, we'll break it down step by step.

1. Elvis' monthly goal is $1125.
2. Since April has 30 days, we can divide the monthly goal by 30 to find the average daily savings needed for the entire month: $1125 / 30 ≈ $37.50 per day.
3. However, Elvis plans to save double the amount each day in the latter half of the month compared to the first half. Let's assume the daily savings for the first half is x.
4. Since Elvis saves double the amount in the second half, the daily savings for the second half is 2x.
5. The first half of the month has 15 days (1-15 April), and the second half also has 15 days (16-30 April).
6. The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half. We can set up an equation:

   15x (first half) + 15(2x) (second half) = $1125

   Simplifying the equation:
   15x + 30x = $1125
   45x = $1125
   x ≈ $25

   So, the daily savings for the first half is approximately $25.

7. Since Elvis saves double the amount in the second half, the daily savings for the second half is 2x = 2($25) = $50.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle and the green toad weigh the same as the pink frog, so they also weigh 50 pounds each.
3. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then add them together. 

1. Sugar cubes: 2 * 1 pound = 2 pounds
2. Carrots: 4 * 12 pounds = 48 pounds
3. Hay: 42 * 75 pounds = 3150 pounds
4. Oats: 20 * 65 pounds = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add the weights together: 
2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds

A typical pickup truck has a payload capacity of around 1,000-2,000 pounds. A larger farm truck might have a capacity of 5,000-6,000 pounds. 

Assuming a capacity of 2,000 pounds per trip, the farmer would need:

1. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. There are 3 classes, each with 20 students, making a total of 60 students. 
   Since it's 50% boys and 50% girls, there are 30 boys and 30 girls in the entire school.

2. The first class has 15 girls. Since there are 20 students in the class, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5.

3. The second class has 12 girls. Since there are 20 students in the class, the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8.

4. Now, let's find the total number of boys in the first two classes: 5 + 8 = 13.

What will be the length of each of these final segments?,"To find the length of each final segment, we'll break down the problem into steps.

1. Marty has a 100-centimeter ribbon that needs to be divided into 4 identical sections. To find the length of each section, we'll divide 100 by 4:

100 cm / 4 = 25 cm per section

2. Now, each of these 25-centimeter sections needs to be further divided into 5 equal segments. To find the length of each segment, we'll divide 25 by 5:

25 cm / 5 = 5 cm per segment

So, the length of each final segment will be 5 centimeters.

The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?","Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Let's say the number of lines in the song is x. Then the number of lines in the second scene is x + 6.

2. Since four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is (4/5)(x + 6).

3. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so the number of lines in the first scene is 2x. Since only a third of them are Sean's lines, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is (1/3)(2x) = (2/3)x.

4. The number of lines Sean has to memorize from the song is x.

5. Now, let's add up the number of lines Sean has to memorize from all three parts: 
   (2/3)x + (4/5)(x + 6) + x

   To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. So we can rewrite the expression as:
   (10/15)x + (12/15)(x + 6) + (15/15)x

   Combine like terms:
   (10/15)x + (12/15)x + (12/15)(6) + (15/15)x
   (37/15)x + (72/15)

   To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by 15 to get rid of the fraction:
   37x + 72

   However, we still don't know the value of x. We need more information to find the exact number of lines Sean has to memorize.

   Unfortunately, we can't find the exact number of lines Sean has to memorize without knowing the value of x."
897,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys three 2-pound boxes of them for the entire barn. He only wants enough apples to feed the ponies while the fruits are fresh, so he buys five 15-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his ponies, so he buys fifty 80-pound bales. Oats is a staple to supplement the straw, so he buys thirty 70-pound sacks. If his ranch truck can carry 3000 pounds at a time, how many trips does the rancher need to transport all the food?","To find the total number of trips the rancher needs to transport all the food, we need to calculate the total weight of the food and divide it by the capacity of the truck.

1. Calculate the weight of the sugar cubes: 3 boxes * 2 pounds = 6 pounds
2. Calculate the weight of the apples: 5 bags * 15 pounds = 75 pounds
3. Calculate the weight of the hay: 50 bales * 80 pounds = 4000 pounds
4. Calculate the weight of the oats: 30 sacks * 70 pounds = 2100 pounds

Now, add up the weights of all the food items:
6 pounds + 75 pounds + 4000 pounds + 2100 pounds = 6181 pounds

Since the truck can carry 3000 pounds at a time, we divide the total weight by the capacity of the truck:
6181 pounds / 3000 pounds = 2.06 (round up to the nearest whole number, since we can't make a fraction of a trip)

So, the rancher needs to make 3 trips to transport all the food.

How much is each doughnut?","To find out how much each doughnut costs, we need to first determine the total number of doughnuts sold in June and then divide the total amount made by the total number of doughnuts.

1. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen = 12, 
   10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

2. Since June has 30 days, 
   Total doughnuts in June = 120 * 30 = 3600 doughnuts.

3. Derrick makes $7200 in June when he sells all the doughnuts. 
   To find the cost per doughnut, we divide the total amount made by the total number of doughnuts:
   Cost per doughnut = Total amount made / Total doughnuts
                      = 7200 / 3600

If it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, how tall did the beanstalk start out?","To find the initial height of the beanstalk, let's work backwards from the fourth day when it's taller than Mark's window.

Day 4: The beanstalk is taller than 20 feet. Since it doubles every day, on the previous day (Day 3), it must have been half of its height on Day 4. Let's call the height on Day 4 'x'. Then, on Day 3, the height would be x/2.

Since the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet on Day 4, let's assume its height on Day 4 is at least 20 feet (the minimum height to be taller than the window). However, it must be more than 20 feet because it was half that height on Day 3 and still needs to double to be taller than the window. So, the height on Day 4 is at least 20 feet but more than that. Let's assume it's more than 20 feet but less than 40 feet (doubling 20 feet would make it 40 feet). 

Day 3: The height is at least 10 feet but less than 20 feet (half of 20-40 feet).

Day 2: The height would be half of the height on Day 3, so it's at least 5 feet but less than 10 feet.

Day 1: The height would be half of the height on Day 2, so it's at least 2.5 feet but less than 5 feet.

However, the height on Day 4 must be more than 20 feet because the beanstalk is taller than Mark's window on that day. If the height on Day 4 is 40 feet (the maximum of our assumption), then we can work backwards to find the exact initial height.

Day 4: 40 feet
Day 3: 20 feet (half of 40)
Day 2: 10 feet (half of 20)
Day 1: 5 feet (half of 10)

Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount (30/2 = 15) from the shortest trees, and an unknown amount (let's call it x) from the average trees.

2. Joanne also gathers 20 oranges, but this information is irrelevant to the question about apples, so we can ignore it.

3. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees (2 * 30 = 60), three times as many apples from the shortest trees (3 * 15 = 45), and no apples from the average trees.

4. The combined total of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. We can set up an equation to represent this:

   Joanne's apples + sister's apples = 500
   (30 + 15 + x) + (60 + 45) = 500

5. Simplify the equation:

   (30 + 15 + x) + 105 = 500
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   150 + x = 500

6. Solve for x:

   x = 500 - 150
   x = 350

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs. Since they sold 40 TVs, one-fourth of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10. So, they sold 10 smart TVs.

One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs. One-eighth of 40 is 40 / 8 = 5. So, they sold 5 analog TVs.

One-fifth of the sales are projection TVs. One-fifth of 40 is 40 / 5 = 8. So, they sold 8 projection TVs.

Now, let's add the number of smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs sold: 10 + 5 + 8 = 23.

Since the number of offensive players is double that of the defensive players, the number of offensive players is 2D.

The special teams consist of half the number of defensive players, so the number of special teams players is D/2.

We know the total number of players is 105, so we can set up the equation:
D + 2D + D/2 = 105

To simplify, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
2D + 4D + D = 210

1. First, we'll calculate the total monthly electricity bill that Jenna's roommates will pay, including the additional $5 each to cover Jenna's share. Since there are 4 roommates, they will each pay $5 extra, but we only need to calculate the total extra cost and divide it by 4 to find out how much extra each will pay for Jenna's share. However, Jenna's share is $100 / 5 = $20. So the extra amount each roommate will pay is $20 / 4 = $5. But this $5 is already agreed upon by the roommates, so we just need to add this to their original share.

2. The original monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 5 people (including Jenna) who will split the bill. So each person's original share is $100 / 5 = $20.

3. Since Jenna's roommates agreed to pay an additional $5 each to cover Jenna's share, their new monthly share will be $20 (original share) + $5 (additional share) = $25.

The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5.5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time it takes to peel and cut each potato, then multiply that by the total number of potatoes.

1. First, let's convert the time it takes to peel a potato into seconds, since the time to cut a potato is already in seconds. 
   1 minute = 60 seconds, so 1.5 minutes = 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds.

2. Now, we can add the time it takes to peel a potato (90 seconds) to the time it takes to cut a potato (5.5 seconds).
   Total time per potato = 90 seconds + 5.5 seconds = 95.5 seconds.

3. Finally, we multiply the total time per potato by the total number of potatoes (60).
   Total time = 95.5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5730 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, we can convert the total time from seconds to minutes by dividing by 60.
   Total time = 5730 seconds / 60 = 95.5 minutes.

1. The first aquarium has 4 snails and 5 starfish. 
2. The second aquarium has 32 snails and 7 sea urchins.
3. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

First, let's find the difference in the number of snails:
32 (snails in the second aquarium) - 4 (snails in the first aquarium) = 28

This difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the total number of fish in both aquariums as 'x'. Then, we can set up the equation:

To find 'x', we divide both sides by 2:
x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Since 'x' represents the total number of fish in both aquariums, and both aquariums have the same number of fish, we divide 'x' by 2 to find the number of fish in each aquarium:

4. The first class has 3/4 of a score of girls. A score is 20, so 3/4 * 20 = 15 girls. Since the class has 20 students, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5 boys.

5. The second class has 0.6 of a score of girls. A score is 20, so 0.6 * 20 = 12 girls. Since the class has 20 students, the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8 boys.

6. Since the school has an equal number of boys and girls, and we have 3 classes with 20 students each (60 students total), there must be 30 boys and 30 girls in the school.

7. We already know the number of boys in the first two classes: 5 boys + 8 boys = 13 boys.

8. To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys: 30 boys - 13 boys = 17 boys.

How many Valentine's Day cards does Erica have at present?","To find the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has, let's break it down step by step.

1. Erica initially created 20 cards.
2. Her father gave her 2 packages of 15 cards each. So, she received 2 * 15 = 30 cards.
3. Now, Erica has 20 (initially created) + 30 (received from her father) = 50 cards.
4. She gave away 24 cards to her school friends and 5 to her relatives. So, she gave away a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.
5. After giving away 29 cards, Erica is left with 50 - 29 = 21 cards.
6. Erica received 17 cards from her loved ones. So, now she has 21 (remaining) + 17 (received) = 38 cards.

If Richie scored some goals, how many goals did all three teenagers score?","To find the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers, we need to express the number of goals scored by Mark and Anna in terms of Richie's goals.

Let's say Richie scored x goals.

Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored x - 20 goals.

Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, Anna scored x - 45 goals.

The total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is the sum of their individual goals:

Total goals = Richie's goals + Mark's goals + Anna's goals
= x + (x - 20) + (x - 45)
= 3x - 65

Since Richie scored some goals, x is a positive integer. However, we cannot determine the exact value of x without more information.

So, the total number of goals scored by the three teenagers is {3x - 65}, where x is the number of goals scored by Richie."

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To find the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day, let's break down the information step by step.

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack (50 / 2 = 25 bandages).

Now, let's calculate the total number of bandages used and ordered:

Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.

Total bandages ordered: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

Since they had bandages left at the end of the third day, the total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is the total ordered minus the total used: 150 - 91 = 59 bandages.

However, we need to find the number of bandages they started with on the first day. Let's call the initial number of bandages 'x'. 

The total number of bandages at the end of the third day would be the initial number 'x', plus the bandages ordered (150), minus the bandages used (91). We know that the total number of bandages at the end of the third day is 59.

So, we can set up the equation: x + 150 - 91 = 59.

Combine like terms: x + 59 = 59.

Subtract 59 from both sides: x = 0.

Therefore, the nurses started with 0 bandages on the first day.

The second location, on the other hand, charges $30 per person. However, the first venue does not include food, which John estimates will cost $10 for each guest. At the second location, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

The cost of the first venue is a flat fee of $300 plus $10 per guest for food, so the total cost is:
300 + 10x

The cost of the second venue is $30 per guest, with food included, so the total cost is:
30x

Since we want to find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we set the two equations equal to each other:
300 + 10x = 30x

Now, let's solve for 'x'. Subtract 10x from both sides:
300 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:
15 = x

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 15.

How many shoes can she buy in a year?","To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate her total annual income, the amount she sets aside for shoes, and then divide that by the cost of each pair of shoes.

1. Calculate Jessica's total monthly income: 
   $2,000.00 (main income) + $500.00 (part-time income) = $2,500.00 per month

2. Calculate Jessica's total annual income: 
   $2,500.00 per month * 12 months = $30,000.00 per year

3. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside for shoes each month: 
   25% of $2,500.00 = 0.25 * $2,500.00 = $625.00 per month

4. Calculate the total amount Jessica sets aside for shoes each year: 
   $625.00 per month * 12 months = $7,500.00 per year

5. Calculate the number of shoes Jessica can buy in a year: 
   $7,500.00 per year / $1,000.00 per pair of shoes = 7.5

Since Jessica cannot buy a fraction of a pair of shoes, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, since their ages are in the ratio of 7:11.

We know their total age is 144, so we can set up an equation:

x = 8

Now we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

Darrell's age: 7x = 7(8) = 56
Allen's age: 11x = 11(8) = 88

2. Convert the pounds to calories (since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound):
   30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

3. Calculate the number of days Andy has to reach his goal:
   From December 31st to July 19th, there are 201 days (December has 31 days, January to June have 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 = 181 days, and July has 19 days, so 31 + 181 + 19 = 231 days in total, but since the problem states ""by his birthday"", we'll count from the start of the year to his birthday, thus the start date should be January 1st. There are 31 days in December, but we start counting from January 1st, so we subtract 1 day from 231 days, which is 230 days, but since the question states ""Today is December 31st"", so we should count the whole year, 365 days in total - 164 days = 201 days).

Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?","To find the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold, let's break down the information step by step.

1. The price of a small stuffed animal is $40.
2. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one. So, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $40 = $120.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's assume she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. Then, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.
4. The total earnings from the sales are $1200.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings in terms of 'x':

Earnings from large stuffed animals: $120 * x
Earnings from small stuffed animals: $40 * 2x
Total earnings: $120 * x + $40 * 2x = $1200

Combine like terms:
$120x + $80x = $1200
$200x = $1200

Divide both sides by $200:
x = $1200 / $200
x = 6

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and procured one large pack of 50 bandages. So, at the end of the first day, they had:
x - 38 + 50 = x + 12 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 bandages less than the previous day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, at the end of the second day, they had:

1. Total cost of all four pizzas: 640 dollars
2. Cost of two pizzas: 300 dollars
3. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, let's call this amount 'x'. The total cost of these two pizzas is 2x.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

Cost of two pizzas + Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost
300 + 2x = 640

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate 'x' on one side of the equation. Subtract 300 from both sides:

2x = 640 - 300
2x = 340

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find 'x':

x = 340 / 2
x = 170

Since 'x' represents the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we can conclude that each of the other two pizzas cost 170 dollars.

At check out, Marcus shows his loyalty card that gives him 10% off of his purchase. What is Marcus' total bill?","To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together. 

1. Cost of 5 croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
2. Cost of 4 cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
3. Cost of 3 mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
4. The cost of 13 blueberry muffins is not given. We will assume 'x' as the cost of 1 blueberry muffin. 
   So, the cost of 13 blueberry muffins is 13 * x = 13x

Now, let's add the costs together: 
$15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + 13x = $37.00 + 13x

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his purchase. 
So, the final bill will be 90% of the total cost. 
Final bill = ($37.00 + 13x) * 0.9

Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for one-fifth of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to two-fifths the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?","To find the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day, let's break down the information step by step.

1. The second plane flies 44 times a day, and this is two-fifths of the number of trips the first plane makes. To find the total number of trips the first plane makes, we can set up the following equation:

   2/5 * x = 44 (where x is the total number of trips the first plane makes)
   
   Multiply both sides by 5/2 to solve for x:
   
   x = 44 * 5/2
   x = 110

   So the first plane makes 110 trips in a day.

2. The first plane goes to Greece for one-fifth of its flights. To find the number of flights to Greece, we can multiply the total number of trips by 1/5:

   110 * 1/5 = 22

   The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The total number of remaining flights is:

   110 - 22 = 88

   Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

   88 / 2 = 44

Therefore, the first plane takes {44} flights to France in one day."

If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?","To make a quadruple batch of brownies, Mark will need 4 times the normal amount of ingredients.

For flour, the normal recipe calls for 4 cups, so a quadruple batch will need 4 x 4 = 16 cups of flour. Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need 16 / 2 = 8 bags of flour.

For milk, the normal recipe calls for 2 cups, so a quadruple batch will need 4 x 2 = 8 cups of milk. Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need 8 / 2 = 4 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 8 - 4 = 4.

In 9 years, despite any intergalactic events that may occur, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. If the alien doppelganger's age follows the same pattern, how old is Sam now in our universe?","Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S. 

We are given that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write:
R = 6S

In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9, and Sam's age will be S + 9. We are given that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write:
R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, substitute R = 6S into the second equation:
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Expand the equation:
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:
3S = 18

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old now in our universe.

481,Ryan’s allowance is $8 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 4 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 2 friends at $1.50 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $7.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Ryan's total allowance: 
Ryan's weekly allowance is $8. He completed his chores for 4 weeks, so his total allowance is:
$8 * 4 = $32

2. Calculate the cost of ice cream cones:
Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 2 friends. The total number of cones is 3, and each cone costs $1.50. The total cost of ice cream cones is:
3 * $1.50 = $4.50

3. Calculate Ryan's remaining money after buying ice cream cones:
Ryan had $32 and spent $4.50 on ice cream cones. His remaining money is:
$32 - $4.50 = $27.50

4. Calculate the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy:
Each movie ticket costs $7.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of a ticket:
$27.50 / $7.50 = 3.67 (round down to 3 since we can't buy a fraction of a ticket)

However, before buying the puzzle, he found a discount coupon that allowed him to get a 50% discount on the puzzle. After buying the comic book and the discounted puzzle, how much money does Raymond have left?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He then received an allowance from which he saved $11. This means his total money now is $21 (initial) + $11 (saved) = $32.
3. The comic book cost him $5, so he has $32 - $5 = $27 left.
4. The puzzle initially cost $19, but he found a 50% discount coupon. This means he only paid 50% of $19, which is $19 * 0.5 = $9.50.

717,"After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara,  Erin has 18 points before. How many points does Sara have?","To find out how many points Sara has, let's first determine how many points Erin has now. Erin initially had 18 points and then scored 14 more points. 

Erin's current points = Initial points + Points scored
Erin's current points = 18 + 14
Erin's current points = 32

Now, we know Erin has three times more points than Sara. Let's denote Sara's points as 'x'. We can set up an equation based on this information:

Erin's current points = 3 * Sara's points
32 = 3x

To find Sara's points, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 32 / 3
x = 10.67

Since points can't be in fractions, we'll round down to the nearest whole number (as you can't have a fraction of a point). However, given the context, it's more likely that Sara's points are a whole number, and the 'three times more points' relationship is exact. 

Given that, let's re-examine the relationship. If Erin has 32 points and that's exactly three times more than Sara's points, then Sara's points would be:

32 = 3x
x = 32 / 3
x = 10.67

However, since the problem implies whole numbers, we should find the closest multiple of 3 to 32 that still makes sense in the context. The closest multiple of 3 to 32 is 30 (3 * 10 = 30), but that's not the case here, as Erin has 32 points.

Now, re-examining the relationship: If Erin has 32 points and that's exactly three times more than Sara's points, and considering the initial points Erin had (18) and scored (14), we should look for a number that when multiplied by 3 equals 32 or a number close to it that makes sense in the context.

Given that 3 * 10 = 30 and 3 * 11 = 33, we can see that 32 is not exactly three times a whole number. However, considering the context, we can deduce that Sara's points must be a whole number. 

If Erin has 32 points and that's exactly three times more than Sara's points, then we should find a number that when multiplied by 3 equals 32 or a number close to it that makes sense in the context.

However, in this case, since 32 is not exactly three times a whole number, we should consider the closest whole number multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 32, which is 30 (3 * 10 = 30). This implies that Sara's points could be 10, and Erin would have 30 points before scoring the last 2 points to reach 32.

So, considering the context and the information provided, Sara's points could be 10 (as 3 * 10 = 30 and Erin scored 2 more points to reach 32).

However, when they went to place the order, they discovered that due to a surge in demand, the price of each computer had increased by 10%. Despite the price increase, the company decided to proceed with the purchase. Calculate the total amount of money the company ended up spending to buy the computers at the new prices.","To calculate the total amount of money the company spent on the computers at the new prices, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original total cost of the computers:
   Original price per computer = $700
   Number of computers = 500
   Original total cost = Original price per computer * Number of computers
   Original total cost = $700 * 500
   Original total cost = $350,000

2. Calculate the price increase per computer:
   Price increase percentage = 10%
   Price increase per computer = Original price per computer * Price increase percentage
   Price increase per computer = $700 * 10%
   Price increase per computer = $700 * 0.1
   Price increase per computer = $70

3. Calculate the new price per computer:
   New price per computer = Original price per computer + Price increase per computer
   New price per computer = $700 + $70
   New price per computer = $770

4. Calculate the total amount spent at the new prices:

Additionally, Manny's parents have decided to give him an extra $20 to sign up for Karate classes. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?","To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class they are willing to pay, and then find out how many classes Manny needs to attend to stay within that limit.

Manny's parents initially gave him $60 to sign up for Karate classes. However, they also gave him an extra $20. So the total amount Manny has is $60 + $20 = $80.

Since there are 10 total classes, and Manny's parents are willing to pay a maximum of $10 per class, the total amount they are willing to pay is $10 * 10 = $100. However, Manny only has $80, so we will use that as the total amount.

Now, let's calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can miss. If Manny attends x classes, then the cost per class will be $80 / x. Since Manny's parents are willing to pay a maximum of $10 per class, we can set up the equation:

$80 / x ≤ $10

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by x:

$80 ≤ $10x

Now, divide both sides by $10:

8 ≤ x

Since x is the number of classes Manny attends, and there are 10 total classes, the number of classes Manny can miss is 10 - x. So, the maximum number of classes Manny can miss is:

10 - 8 = 2

So, Manny can miss at most 2 classes before his parents don't sign him up again.

3. There's a bird's nest 2 feet from the top of the second tree.

4. The combined height of the two trees = 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

5. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, plus the distance of the bird's nest from the top of the second tree.

What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic?","To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first find the number of semi-automatic cars.

We know that there are 20 available cars for rent in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic cars and 4 are manual cars. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars can be found by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic cars) - 4 (manual cars) = 4

Now, we have found that there are 4 semi-automatic cars. To find the percentage, we will divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) * 100

If Jordan decided to spend his video game time working instead, and he also worked an additional 3 hours on the weekend, how much money would Jordan earn in one week?","To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week, let's break down the information:

1. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, which he decides to spend working instead. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will work 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

2. He also works an additional 3 hours on the weekend.

3. So, the total hours he works in a week is 14 hours (from video game time) + 3 hours (on the weekend) = 17 hours.

4. Since Jordan earns $10 an hour, his total earnings in a week will be 17 hours * $10/hour = $170.

Let's say the dinner bill is 'x'. Since you and your wife are splitting the bill evenly, you would pay x/2.

You are also paying an additional 20% tip on the dinner bill. 20% of the dinner bill is 0.2x. 

So, the total amount you pay is the half of the dinner bill plus 20% of the dinner bill, which is x/2 + 0.2x.

We know that you end up paying $35. So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 0.2x = 35

Combine like terms:

0.7x = 35

Divide both sides by 0.7:

x = 50

So, the dinner bill is $50.

1. Calculate the new price of each computer.
   The company initially planned to pay $700 per computer. However, the price of each computer is 0.1 times higher than they had planned for.
   So, the increase in price is 0.1 * $700 = $70.
   The new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.

Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet of the driveway. After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. However, Richard also needs to spend an additional 2 seconds at each bottle to ensure the candy is properly placed. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?","To find the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottles: Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and a bottle is placed every 3 feet, we divide the width of the driveway by the distance between bottles. 
   Number of bottles = 24 / 3 = 8

2. Calculate the time spent moving between bottles: Since it takes 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next, and there are 7 intervals between 8 bottles (because we start at the first bottle), we multiply the time spent moving between bottles by the number of intervals.
   Time spent moving = 5 * 7 = 35 seconds

3. Calculate the time spent placing the candy: Since Richard spends 2 seconds at each bottle to ensure the candy is properly placed, and there are 8 bottles, we multiply the time spent placing the candy by the number of bottles.
   Time spent placing candy = 2 * 8 = 16 seconds

4. Calculate the total time: We add the time spent moving between bottles and the time spent placing the candy.
   Total time = 35 + 16 = 51 seconds

If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, 3 of the photographs of the ducks are accidentally deleted, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?","To find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we need to start by finding the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. 

Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as x. Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs.

We are given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can set up the equation:
6x = 1800

To find x, divide both sides by 6:
x = 1800 / 6
x = 300

This means Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Now, we are given that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of birds (or ducks) as y. Then, we can set up the equation:
50y = 300

To find y, divide both sides by 50:
y = 300 / 50
y = 6

However, we are told that 3 of the photographs of the ducks are accidentally deleted. Since the question asks for the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, and the deletion of photographs does not affect the number of ducks in one photograph, we can ignore the deletion of photographs.

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is 6.

In June, some of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.","To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the amount paid in May and June separately.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. Each employee is paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 

First, calculate the amount paid to each employee in a week:
$15 per hour * 40 hours per week = $600 per week

Since there are 4 weeks in May, calculate the amount paid to each employee in May:
$600 per week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee

Now, calculate the total amount paid to all employees in May:
$2400 per employee * 40 employees = $96,000

In June, some of the employees' contracts expired, but the exact number is not specified. Assuming all 40 employees continued to work in June, we can calculate the amount paid to each employee in June:
$600 per week * 4 weeks = $2400 per employee

Now, calculate the total amount paid to all employees in June:
$2400 per employee * 40 employees = $96,000

After helping people, Billy also decides to take a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. He also spends 30 minutes each day to organize his paperwork.  (Remember there are 31 days in March.)","To find the number of people Billy helps, we need to first find the total number of days he works.

March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Since Billy takes 20% of the days off, the number of days he takes off is 20% of 50, which is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.

So, the number of days Billy works is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day, so the number of people he helps per day is 2 * 3 = 6 people.

Since Billy works for 40 days, the total number of people he helps is 6 * 40 = 240 people.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of caffeine Billy consumes and the total time he spends on breaks.

Billy works for 3 hours a day and takes a 15-minute break every hour. So, the total break time per day is 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.

Since Billy also spends 30 minutes each day to organize his paperwork, the total time he spends on breaks and paperwork per day is 45 + 30 = 75 minutes.

The total time Billy spends on breaks and paperwork in 40 days is 75 * 40 = 3000 minutes.

Since Billy drinks a cup of coffee every hour, the total number of cups of coffee he drinks in 40 days is 3 * 40 = 120 cups.

The total amount of caffeine Billy consumes is 120 * 95 = 11400 milligrams.

How many total times can both DVDs be played before they break?","To determine the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to consider the average lifespan of a DVD. 

The average lifespan of a DVD is typically around 1000 to 2000 plays, depending on various factors such as quality, handling, and playback conditions. However, since we don't have the exact lifespan of these DVDs, let's assume an average lifespan of 1500 plays for each DVD.

Now, let's calculate the remaining lifespan of each DVD:

DVD 1: 1500 (average lifespan) - 356 (times played) = 1144 plays left
DVD 2: 1500 (average lifespan) - 135 (times played) = 1365 plays left

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining lifespan of both DVDs:

1144 (plays left for DVD 1) + 1365 (plays left for DVD 2) = 2509

However, this calculation assumes that both DVDs will be played simultaneously until they break. In reality, one DVD will break before the other. To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before one of them breaks, we should consider the DVD with the shortest remaining lifespan, which is DVD 1 with 1144 plays left.

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before one of them breaks is approximately 1144 + 135 (times DVD 2 has already been played) = 1279, but since DVD 1 has already been played 356 times, the total number of times that both DVDs can be played is {1279}."

If Jackie decides to use only 1 pump for each wash, what would be the cost of each pump in cents?","To find the cost of each pump in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps are needed for each wash and there are 120 washes, the total number of pumps is 2 * 120 = 240 pumps.

2. However, Jackie decides to use only 1 pump for each wash. So, the total number of washes she can get from the bottle is 240 pumps / 1 pump per wash = 240 washes.

3. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00, which is equivalent to 2400 cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents).

4. To find the cost of each pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps. The total number of pumps is 240. So, the cost of each pump is 2400 cents / 240 pumps = 10 cents per pump.

How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?","To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and subtract the total cost of buying them in bunches.

First, let's find out the total number of bananas. Jenny bought 10 bunches that average 4 bananas per bunch, and then she bought 5 more bunches. The total number of bunches is 10 + 5 = 15 bunches. Since each bunch has 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is 15 * 4 = 60 bananas.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. The cost of one banana is $0.80, so the total cost of buying 60 bananas individually is 60 * $0.80 = $48.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. The cost of one bunch is $3.00, so the total cost of buying 15 bunches is 15 * $3.00 = $45.00.

Now, let's find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches. The amount saved is the difference between the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying them in bunches. So, the amount saved is $48.00 - $45.00 = $3.00.

How many cases of shingles will the third house need?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as x. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2.

2. The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2(x/2) = x.

3. We know the total number of cases of shingles needed is 250. So, the sum of the cases needed for each house is:
   x/2 (first house) + x (second house) + x (third house) = 250
   Combine like terms:
   2.5x = 250

4. Solve for x:

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation:
R = 6S

In 21 years, Ruby's age will be R + 21 and Sam's age will be S + 21.

According to the problem, in 21 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. We can write another equation:
R + 21 = 3(S + 21)

Now, substitute the first equation (R = 6S) into the second equation:
6S + 21 = 3(S + 21)

Expand the equation:
6S + 21 = 3S + 63

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 21 = 63

Subtract 21 from both sides:
3S = 42

Divide both sides by 3:
S = 14

So, Sam's current age is 14.

Remaining money = $160 - $80 = $80.

Step 6: Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner.
Ali uses 0.6 times the remaining amount of money to buy dinner, which is 0.6 * $80 = $48.

Step 7: Calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner.
Money left after buying dinner = Remaining money - money used for dinner
Money left after buying dinner = $80 - $48 = $32.

Meanwhile, two men at the party are wearing 1 inch heel dress shoes and another two men are wearing 1.5 inch heel boots. Ignoring the men's footwear, what is the average height of heels worn by the women at this party?","To find the average height of heels worn by the women at the party, we need to add up the total height of heels and divide by the number of women.

Three women are wearing 4 inch heels, so their total heel height is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Three women are wearing 2 inch heels, so their total heel height is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Total heel height for all women is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

There are 6 women in total (3 wearing 4 inch heels and 3 wearing 2 inch heels).

To find the average, divide the total heel height by the number of women: 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.","To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, let's break it down step by step.

In May, the company hired 100 employees, paying each employee $120 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total hours worked by each employee in a week is 40 hours.
The total hours worked by each employee in 4 weeks (1 month) is 40 hours * 4 = 160 hours.
The total amount paid to each employee in May is 160 hours * $120/hour = $19,200.
The total amount paid to all employees in May is $19,200 * 100 employees = $1,920,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. 
This means 1/4 * 100 = 25 employees left.
The remaining employees are 100 - 25 = 75 employees.
The total amount paid to each employee in June is the same as in May, which is $19,200.
The total amount paid to all employees in June is $19,200 * 75 employees = $1,440,000.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $1,920,000 + $1,440,000 = $3,360,000.

1. For the red tulips, Jackson can fit 6 in a row. He has 36 red tulips, so the number of rows of red tulips is:
36 / 6 = 6

2. For the blue tulips, we don't know how many blue tulips can fit in a row. However, we can assume that the same spacing is used for both colors, so 6 blue tulips can fit in a row. Jackson has 24 blue tulips, so the number of rows of blue tulips is:
24 / 6 = 4

3. Now, we add the number of rows of red and blue tulips to find the total number of rows:

However, we can still calculate the total cost for the first 5 years and express the total cost after 8 years in terms of the unknown price.

For the first 5 years, Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, and the cost of one visit is $2. So, the total cost for the first 5 years is:

The bed is 8 feet wide. Since Jim needs the fabric to be 2 feet wider than the bed, the width of the fabric will be:

Each small stuffed animal costs $6. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as 'S' and the price of a large stuffed animal as 'L'. Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for four times the price of small stuffed animals, we can express 'L' in terms of 'S' as L = 4S.

2. We know that the price of a small stuffed animal is $6. So, S = $6.

3. Using the relationship L = 4S, we can calculate the price of a large stuffed animal as L = 4 * $6 = $24.

4. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as 'x'. Since Teresa sold three times as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 3x.

5. The total earnings from the sales is $240. We can express this as the sum of the earnings from large stuffed animals and small stuffed animals: 24x + 6(3x) = 240.

6. Simplifying the equation, we get 24x + 18x = 240, which gives us 42x = 240.

7. Solving for x, we get x = 240 / 42 = 40/7.

8. Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and we want to find the number of small stuffed animals sold, we multiply x by 3: 3 * (40/7) = 120/7.

9. However, we can simplify this by finding the number of large stuffed animals sold and then multiplying by 3. x = 240 / 42 = 40/7 = 5.71 (approximately). Since we can't sell a fraction of an animal, this approximation is not needed. We'll use the exact numbers. We can find the number of large stuffed animals sold as 240 / 42 * 7 / 7 = 40 / 7. Now, 240 / 42 * 7 / 7 = 40 / 7 * 7 / 7 = 40 / 7 = 5.71 (approximately).  We can multiply 40 by 3 and then divide by 7 to get 120 / 7. But we can also multiply 5.71 * 3 to get 17.13.

205,"Kelly has 5 quarters and some dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and she has left 90 cents, how many dimes does Kelly have originally?","To find out how many dimes Kelly has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents and has 90 cents left. This means she had 55 + 90 = 145 cents before buying the pop.

2. Kelly has 5 quarters. Since each quarter is 25 cents, the total value of the quarters is 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

3. To find out how many cents Kelly has in dimes, subtract the value of the quarters from the total amount of money she had before buying the pop: 145 - 125 = 20 cents.

4. Since each dime is 10 cents, the number of dimes Kelly has is 20 / 10 = 2.

If a 10% tax is imposed on all non-food items, and if the total cost is $16, how many dollars are spent on eggs?","To find the cost of the eggs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the non-food items and the tax imposed on them.

Non-food items: 
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cup: $3
- Cockroach trap: $4
Total non-food items: $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

Tax on non-food items: 
- 10% of $10 = 0.10 * $10 = $1

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-food items and the tax:

- Tax: $1
- Total non-food items and tax: $10 + $1 = $11

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the food items excluding eggs:

Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked in a week.
Total hours worked per day = 6 hours
Total hours worked per week = 6 hours/day * 5 days/week = 30 hours/week

Step 2: Convert the total hours worked per week into minutes.
1 hour = 60 minutes
Total minutes worked per week = 30 hours/week * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes/week

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls handled per week.
Time per call = 15 minutes
Total calls handled per week = Total minutes worked per week / Time per call
Total calls handled per week = 1800 minutes/week / 15 minutes/call = 120 calls/week

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all, seven of which were green. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'.
2. Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 'x + 4'.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is 'x/2'.
4. The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation: (x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19.
5. To simplify the equation, we can multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2(x + 4) + 2x + x = 38.
6. Expanding the equation: 2x + 8 + 2x + x = 38.
7. Combining like terms: 5x + 8 = 38.
8. Subtracting 8 from both sides: 5x = 30.
9. Dividing both sides by 5: x = 6.
10. Now we know the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 6. Since the first set had 4 more balls, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 6 + 4 = 10.

Given information:
1. G = R - 2 (2 fewer green cars than red cars)

R + G + B + 23 = 75
R + G + B = 52

Substitute G and B in terms of R:
R + (R - 2) + 3(R - 2) = 52
R + R - 2 + 3R - 6 = 52

If the rink has 80 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"To find the number of yellow cars, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The rink has 20 red cars.
2. They have 3 fewer green cars than they have red cars, so the number of green cars is:
   20 (red cars) - 3 = 17 green cars
3. They have 2 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so the number of blue cars is:
   2 * 17 (green cars) = 34 blue cars
4. Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars:
   20 (red cars) + 17 (green cars) + 34 (blue cars) = 71 cars
5. The rink has a total of 80 cars, so to find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total:
   80 (total cars) - 71 (red, green, and blue cars) = 9 yellow cars

She keeps 60 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got twelve cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?","To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to determine how many cards she gave away. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards.
8 decks * 30 cards/deck = 240 basketball cards

Step 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards.
7 boxes * 50 cards/box = 350 baseball cards

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has.
240 basketball cards + 350 baseball cards = 590 cards

Step 4: Calculate the number of cards Miss Maria gave away.
590 cards - 60 cards (kept) = 530 cards

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. If 66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop, how many passengers were initially on the bus before the first stop?","Let's denote the initial number of passengers as 'x'.

On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is x - 8. Then 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 * 8 = 40 people get on. Now the total number of passengers is (x - 8) + 40 = x + 32.

On the second stop, 21 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is (x + 32) - 21 = x + 11. Then 3 times fewer passengers get on, meaning 1/3 of the number who got off get on. Since 21 people got off, 21 / 3 = 7 people get on. Now the total number of passengers is (x + 11) + 7 = x + 18.

We are given that 66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop. So we can set up the equation:
x + 18 = 66

Subtracting 18 from both sides:
x = 48

So, the initial number of passengers on the bus before the first stop is 48.

488,Ryan’s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for some weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"To solve this problem, we need to know how many weeks Ryan did his chores. However, the problem doesn't provide this information. Let's assume Ryan did his chores for 'x' weeks.

Ryan's allowance is $6 per week, so his total allowance is 6x dollars.

He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, so the total cost of ice cream cones is 4 * $1.25 = $5.

Now, he has 6x - $5 dollars left.

He wants to buy movie tickets for himself and 3 friends at $6.50 each. The total cost of movie tickets is 4 * $6.50 = $26.

We can set up an inequality to find the minimum number of weeks Ryan needs to have done his chores to buy the movie tickets:

6x - $5 ≥ $26

Solving the inequality:

6x ≥ $26 + $5
6x ≥ $31
x ≥ $31 / 6
x ≥ 5.17

Since Ryan can't do his chores for a fraction of a week, he needs to have done his chores for at least 6 weeks.

Now, let's calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy if he did his chores for 6 weeks:

His total allowance is 6 * 6 = $36.
He spent $5 on ice cream cones, so he has $36 - $5 = $31 left.
He can buy $31 / $6.50 = 4.77 movie tickets. Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy 4 movie tickets for himself and 3 friends, but he will be short $1.50 to buy the 4th ticket for the last friend.

However, if we consider that he can buy tickets for himself and 3 friends (a total of 4 tickets), and he is willing to spend all his remaining money, then he will be short of money. 

But if we consider he will buy only the tickets he can afford, then he will buy 4 tickets, and he will have 3 friends with him and himself, so he will have 4 people and 4 tickets.

Therefore, the answer to the question is {4}."

After spending 50 dollars on fuel and setting aside 100 dollars for his bank deposit, how many pens, each priced at 25 dollars, can he purchase after buying 5 pencils that are priced at 10 dollars each?","To find out how many pens John can purchase, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate John's total earnings for the week: 
   John makes 50 dollars per hour and has worked for 6 hours, so his total earnings are 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

2. Calculate John's total expenses:
   John spent 50 dollars on fuel and set aside 100 dollars for his bank deposit. He also bought 5 pencils priced at 10 dollars each. The total cost of pencils is 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.
   So, John's total expenses are 50 (fuel) + 100 (bank deposit) + 50 (pencils) = 200 dollars.

3. Calculate John's remaining money after expenses:
   John's remaining money is his total earnings minus his total expenses: 300 - 200 = 100 dollars.

4. Calculate how many pens John can purchase:
   Each pen is priced at 25 dollars. To find out how many pens John can purchase, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one pen: 100 / 25 = 4.

Therefore, John can purchase {4} pens."

1. Jack initially had $100.
2. Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100. To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing by 5. 
   1/5 * $100 = $100 / 5 = $20
   So, Sophia gave Jack $20.
3. Now, we add the $20 Sophia gave Jack to his initial $100:
   $100 + $20 = $120
4. Peter had $500, but he didn't give Jack any money. So, this information doesn't affect the amount of money Jack has.

If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.),"To find out how many people Billy helps, we need to calculate the number of days he works and then multiply it by the number of people he helps per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
March has 31 days, and from April 1st to April 19th is 19 days. 
Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Billy takes off (20% of 50 days).
Days off = 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.
Days worked = Total days - Days off = 50 - 10 = 40 days

Step 4: Calculate the number of people Billy helps per day.
People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3.5 hours/day = 7 people/day

Step 5: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.
Total people helped = People helped per day * Days worked = 7 people/day * 40 days = 280 people

Oranges are the most expensive and cost 3.5 times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","To find the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.

1. First, we find the cost of one banana. Since one banana costs twice as much as one apple, and one apple costs $0.5, the cost of one banana is 2 * $0.5 = $1.

2. Next, we find the cost of one orange. Since one orange costs 3.5 times as much as one banana, and one banana costs $1, the cost of one orange is 3.5 * $1 = $3.5.

3. Now, we calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate:
   - The cost of 5 bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
   - The cost of 12 apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
   - The cost of 7 oranges is 7 * $3.5 = $24.5.

They had 0.98 times of one hundred bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To find out how many bandages the nurses started with, let's analyze the information step by step.

1. The nurses used 0.38 times of one hundred bandages on the first day. This is equal to 0.38 * 100 = 38 bandages.

2. On the first day, they ordered 1.5 bulk packs of bandages. Since each bulk pack contains 50 bandages, 1.5 bulk packs contain 1.5 * 50 = 75 bandages.

3. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

4. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.

5. On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

6. At the end of the third day, they had 0.98 times of one hundred bandages left, which is 0.98 * 100 = 98 bandages.

Now, let's calculate the total bandages used and ordered to find the initial number of bandages.

Total bandages used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages.

Total bandages ordered = 75 + 100 = 175 bandages.

Let x be the initial number of bandages. The equation becomes:

x + 175 - 91 = 98

x + 84 = 98

x = 98 - 84

x = 14

So, the nurses started with 14 bandages on the first day.

How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?","To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, let's break down the information step by step.

1. On Monday, Walt walked 4.5 miles.

2. On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. 
   So, Walt walked 6 * 4.5 = 27 miles on Tuesday.

3. The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles.

4. To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total mileage.
   Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday = 4.5 + 27 = 31.5 miles
   Miles walked on Wednesday = Total mileage - Miles walked on Monday and Tuesday
   Miles walked on Wednesday = 41 - 31.5

How many penguins are still left sunbathing?,"To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, let's break down the information step by step.

1. Initially, there are 300 penguins sunbathing in the snow.

2. One-third of the penguins jump in and swim in the ocean. 
   To find one-third of 300, we divide 300 by 3:

3. Another one-third of the penguins go inside the cave to eat their dinner. 
   Again, we find one-third of 300:
   300 / 3 = 100 penguins

   So, 100 penguins are now eating inside the cave.

4. To find the number of penguins left sunbathing, we subtract the penguins swimming and eating from the initial total:

How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?","To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to calculate the total number of bottles and the total number of trips.

1. Calculate the total number of bottles:
   Driveway width: 24 feet
   Distance between bottles: 3 feet
   Total number of bottles = Driveway width / Distance between bottles
   Total number of bottles = 24 / 3
   Total number of bottles = 8

2. Since Richard drops 3 candies in each bottle, he will need to make 3 trips to each bottle. However, he only needs to walk the length of the driveway once for each trip.

3. Calculate the total number of trips along the length of the driveway:
   Total number of trips = 3 (trips per bottle) * 1 (since he only walks the length once per trip)

4. However, the actual number of trips is just 3, because he's dropping 3 candies at a time, not walking the length 3 times per candy.

5. Calculate the total time:
   Time per trip = (Total number of bottles - 1) * Time per bottle
   Time per trip = (8 - 1) * 5 seconds
   Time per trip = 7 * 5 seconds

Assume Carly had 'x' cards.

1. 2/5 of the cards had the letter A on them. 
   The number of cards with 'A' is (2/5)x.
   The remaining cards are x - (2/5)x = (3/5)x.

2. 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B.
   The number of cards with 'B' is (1/2)(3/5)x = (3/10)x.
   The remaining cards are (3/5)x - (3/10)x = (3/10)x.

3. 5/8 of the rest had the letter C on them.
   The number of cards with 'C' is (5/8)(3/10)x = (3/16)x.
   The remaining cards are (3/10)x - (3/16)x = (3/80)x = (3/16)x * (4/5) = (3/16)x - (3/16)x * (4/5) = (3/16)x * (1/5) = (3/80)x.

4. The remaining cards had the letter D on them.
   The number of cards with 'D' is (3/80)x = (3/16)x * (1/5).

To find the fraction of cards with 'D', we can simplify the expression:
   (3/16)x * (1/5) = (3/80)x.

Since we want the fraction of cards with 'D', we can express it as:
   (3/80)x / x = 3/80.

So, 3/80 of the cards had the letter D on them.

Andrea has 5.2 times of ten apples. 
So, Andrea has 5.2 * 10 = 52 apples.

Since Andrea has 4/5 of ten more apples than Jamal, let's represent the number of apples Jamal has as x. Then, 
4/5 * (x + 10) = 52
4/5 * x + 8 = 52
4/5 * x = 52 - 8
4/5 * x = 44
x = 44 * 5/4
x = 55

So, Jamal has 55 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 55 + 4 = 59 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 59/2 = 29.5 bananas.

The total number of fruits is the sum of the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have.
Total number of fruits = 52 (Andrea's apples) + 55 (Jamal's apples) + 29.5 (Andrea's bananas) + 59 (Jamal's bananas)
Total number of fruits = 52 + 55 + 29.5 + 59

3. According to the problem, in some years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age. Let's call this number of years 'y'. So, after 'y' years, Melanie's age will be x + y.
4. We are told that after 'y' years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age. So, we can set up the equation: x + y = 3x.
5. Now, we can solve for 'y': y = 3x - x = 2x.
6. However, we are also given that in 10 years, Melanie will be some years old. We can use this information to find Melanie's present age. Let's call Melanie's age in 10 years 'x + 10'. We are told that this is some years old, but we are not given the exact number. So, we can set up an equation using the information we have: x + 10 = 3x - y. But we already know that y = 2x. So, we can substitute this into the equation: x + 10 = 3x - 2x = x. Now, we can solve for 'x': x + 10 = x + 10 = x + 10 - x = 10 = x + 10 - x. This equation is true for all x. We need more information to find Melanie's present age.
   However, we can still find 'y' in terms of Melanie's present age. We already found that y = 2x.

Now, let's find Melanie's present age in terms of 'y'. We already found that y = 2x. So, x = y/2.

We also know that in 10 years, Melanie will be x + 10 years old. We can substitute x = y/2 into this equation: x + 10 = y/2 + 10.

Now, we can substitute x + 10 = y/2 + 10 into the equation x + 10 = 3x - y. We already know that y = 2x. So, we can substitute this into the equation: y/2 + 10 = 3x - 2x = x. Now, we can substitute x = y/2 into this equation: y/2 + 10 = y/2. Now, we can solve for 'y': y/2 + 10 = y/2 + 10 - y/2 = 10 = y/2 + 10 - y/2. This equation is true for all y. We need more information to find 'y'.

If the teacher goes back to using only 10% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The teacher starts with a 6-inch piece of chalk and uses 35% of it on Monday. 
   35% of 6 inches = 0.35 * 6 = 2.1 inches

   So, the teacher has 6 - 2.1 = 3.9 inches of chalk left after Monday.

2. The teacher then goes back to using only 10% of the chalk each day. 
   Since the teacher has 3.9 inches of chalk left, we need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 3 inches.

   Let's calculate 10% of the remaining chalk:
   10% of 3.9 inches = 0.1 * 3.9 = 0.39 inches per day

3. We need to find the number of days it will take for the chalk to be less than 3 inches. 
   Let's calculate the remaining chalk after each day:

   Day 1 (Tuesday): 3.9 - 0.39 = 3.51 inches
   Day 2 (Wednesday): 3.51 - 0.39 = 3.12 inches
   Day 3 (Thursday): 3.12 - 0.39 = 2.73 inches
   Day 4 (Friday): 2.73 - 0.39 = 2.34 inches
   Day 5 (Saturday): 2.34 - 0.39 = 1.95 inches
   Day 6 (Sunday): 1.95 - 0.39 = 1.56 inches
   Day 7 (Monday): 1.56 - 0.39 = 1.17 inches

   The chalk will be less than 3 inches after Day 3 (Thursday) and will be completely used up by Day 7 (Monday). However, the teacher will need to recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 3 inches. Therefore, the teacher has 3 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk, considering that on the 4th day the chalk will be less than 3 inches.

2. In the next 300 seconds, three times that amount pop, which is 3 * 200 = 600 kernels.

3. In the next 300 seconds, the kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate. Since the initial rate is 200 kernels in 300 seconds, four times that amount is 4 * 200 = 800 kernels.

1. Total number of members: 1.05 * 100 = 105 members.

2. Let's assume the number of players on the defense is 'x'. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2x.

3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

4. The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams: x + 2x + x/2 = 105.

5. To simplify the equation, multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2x + 4x + x = 210.

6. Combine like terms: 7x = 210.

7. Divide both sides by 7: x = 210/7 = 30.

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is {30}."
169,"Griffin had 30 french fries, but Kyle took 6 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. If in the end Griffin had 33 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 30 french fries.
2. Kyle took 6 fries, so Griffin had 30 - 6 = 24 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 6 = 12 fries. Griffin now had 24 - 12 = 12 fries left.
4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, increasing Griffin's total to an unknown number. Let's call this number x.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 6 - 3 = 3 fries. After Colby took 3 fries, Griffin had x - 3 fries left.
6. We are told that Griffin had 33 fries in the end. So, we can set up the equation x - 3 = 33.

To solve for x, we can add 3 to both sides of the equation:
x = 33 + 3
x = 36

Since x represents the number of fries Griffin had after Ginger gave him some, and before Colby took 3, we need to find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin. We know that before Ginger gave him fries, Griffin had 12 fries left. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is the difference between x and 12:
Number of fries Ginger gave Griffin = x - 12
= 36 - 12
= 24

1105,"In 20 years, Melanie will be 36 years old. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?","To find Melanie's present age, we subtract 20 from 36. 
36 - 20 = 16

Melanie's present age is 16.

Now, we need to find out when her age will be thrice her present age. 
Thrice her present age is 3 * 16 = 48.

Since she will be 36 in 20 years, we need to find out how many years it will take for her to be 48. 
First, we find the difference between 48 and 36.
48 - 36 = 12

This 12-year difference is the additional years after 20 years. 
So, the total years it will take for her to be 48 is 20 + 12 = 32.

In 32 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

How many bottles of water does he drink while trying to solve an extreme sudoku?,"To solve this problem, we need to know how long it takes to solve a normal sudoku puzzle. Unfortunately, that information is not provided. However, we can still express the answer in terms of the time it takes to solve a normal sudoku puzzle.

Let's denote the time it takes to solve a normal sudoku puzzle as 't' hours. Since an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that of a normal sudoku puzzle, the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku is 4t hours.

John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is 0.5 hours. To find the number of bottles of water he drinks while trying to solve an extreme sudoku, we need to divide the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku (4t hours) by the time interval between drinking water (0.5 hours).

Number of bottles = 4t / 0.5 = 8t

Since we don't know the value of 't', we can express the answer as {8t}."

Original price = $140
Discount rate = 0.05

Discount amount = Original price * Discount rate

Now, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the price after the discount.

Price after discount = Original price - Discount amount

1. First, let's find out how many days are in 12 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply 12 weeks by 7 days per week:
   12 weeks * 7 days per week = 84 days

2. Since Claire eats 3 eggs every day, we multiply the number of days by the number of eggs she eats per day:
   84 days * 3 eggs per day = 252 eggs

3. Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

However, the number of colored pencils does not affect the number of glue stick packs he needs. How many packs of glue sticks will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed: 
   Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, we multiply the number of students by 2.
   Total glue sticks needed = 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

2. Determine the number of glue sticks in each pack:
   Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

3. Calculate the number of packs needed:
   To find the number of packs needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in each pack.
   Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks needed / Glue sticks per pack = 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

4. Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks and he has some extra glue sticks left over.
   Number of packs needed = 7 packs (rounded up from 6.75 packs).

1. Convert the shark's length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 100 * 12 = 1200 inches long.

2. Calculate the combined length of the remoras. There are 12 remoras, each 6 inches long. So the combined length is 12 * 6 = 72 inches.

3. Now, find the percentage of the shark's length that the combined length of the remoras is. To do this, divide the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length and multiply by 100.

Percentage = (72 / 1200) * 100 = 6%

So, the combined length of the remoras is 6% of the shark's body length.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. After that, he found an additional 5 balls in the corner. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. So we can set up the equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

Now that we know x (the number of balls retrieved in the second set), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

First set = x + 4
= 6 + 4
= 10

So Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match. The additional 5 balls found in the corner do not affect this answer.

Since he walks around the edge of the rectangular park, we need to find the perimeter of the park.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Given the dimensions of the park: Length = 6 miles, Width = 1.5 miles

Perimeter = 2(6 + 1.5)
Perimeter = 2 * 7.5
Perimeter = 15 miles

Now that we know the distance Gary walks, we can find the time he spends walking. We are given his walking speed: 3 miles/hour.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking. We don't need to consider the 5 minutes of stretching in this calculation, as it's not part of the walking time.

736,Andrea has more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Jamal has fewer apples than Andrea, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's call the number of apples Jamal has 'x'.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is 'x + 4'.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is '(x + 4) / 2'.
5. Since Andrea has more apples than Jamal, 'x' must be less than 52.
6. Now, let's find the value of 'x'. We know that Andrea has more apples than Jamal, but we don't have a direct equation to solve for 'x'. However, we can use the information that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal to set up an equation. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to directly solve for 'x' or the number of bananas Andrea has.

However, let's re-examine the problem. We know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, and Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. If Andrea has 52 apples, then Jamal must have fewer than 52 apples. Let's try to find the number of bananas Andrea has.

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, and Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, let's assume Jamal has 'x' apples. Then Jamal has 'x + 4' bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has '(x + 4) / 2' bananas.

Now, we know that Andrea has more apples than Jamal, but we don't know the exact number of bananas Andrea has. However, we can try to find the total number of fruits.

The total number of fruits is the sum of the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have. We know Andrea has 52 apples, but we don't know the number of bananas Andrea has or the number of apples and bananas Jamal has.

However, we can try to find the total number of fruits by using the information that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. Let's assume Jamal has 'x' apples. Then Jamal has 'x + 4' bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has '(x + 4) / 2' bananas.

Since Andrea has 52 apples, and Andrea has more apples than Jamal, Jamal must have fewer than 52 apples. Let's try to find the number of bananas Andrea has.

If Jamal has 'x' apples, then Jamal has 'x + 4' bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has '(x + 4) / 2' bananas.

Now, let's try to find the total number of fruits. We know Andrea has 52 apples, and Andrea has '(x + 4) / 2' bananas. We also know that Jamal has 'x' apples and 'x + 4' bananas.

The total number of fruits is the sum of the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have. 

Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples) + (Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples) + (Jamal's bananas)
= 52 + (x + 4) / 2 + x + x + 4

Combine like terms:

Total number of fruits = 52 + (x + 4) / 2 + 2x + 4
= 52 + x / 2 + 2 + 2x + 4
= 52 + 5x / 2 + 6
= 58 + 5x / 2

Unfortunately, we still can't find the total number of fruits without knowing the value of 'x'. However, we can try to find the value of 'x' by using the information that Andrea has more apples than Jamal.

Since Andrea has 52 apples, and Andrea has more apples than Jamal, Jamal must have fewer than 52 apples. Let's try to find the number of apples Jamal has.

We know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is 'x + 4'. We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so the number of bananas Andrea has is '(x + 4) / 2'.

Now, let's try to find the number of apples Jamal has. We know that Andrea has more apples than Jamal, and Andrea has 52 apples. Let's try to find the largest possible value of 'x' such that 'x' is less than 52 and '(x + 4) / 2' is an integer.

The largest possible value of 'x' such that 'x' is less than 52 and '(x + 4) / 2' is an integer is 48, since 48 is less than 52 and '(48 + 4) / 2' is an integer.

So, Jamal has 48 apples, and Jamal has 48 + 4 = 52 bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 52 / 2 = 26 bananas.

Now, we can find the total number of fruits. We know Andrea has 52 apples, and Andrea has 26 bananas. We also know that Jamal has 48 apples and 52 bananas.

The total number of fruits is the sum of the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal have.

Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples) + (Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples) + (Jamal's bananas)

If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?","To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to find out how many cards she gave away and then divide that number by the number of cards each student received.

Step 1: Find the total number of basketball cards. Since there are 6 decks with an unknown number of basketball cards in each deck, we can't calculate the exact number of basketball cards. However, we can represent it as 6x, where x is the number of cards in each deck.

Step 2: Find the total number of baseball cards. There are 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. 
Total baseball cards = 5 * 40 = 200

Step 3: Find the total number of cards Miss Maria has. 
Total cards = 6x + 200

Step 4: Find the total number of cards Miss Maria gave away. 
Total cards given away = Total cards - 50 
Total cards given away = 6x + 200 - 50 
Total cards given away = 6x + 150

Step 5: Find the number of students Miss Maria has. 
Each student received 10 cards. 
Number of students = Total cards given away / 10 
Number of students = (6x + 150) / 10 

Since we don't know the value of x, we can't give an exact number of students. However, if we knew the number of cards in each deck of basketball cards, we could calculate the number of students."
1971,"The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $25.20.  The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo and this will give you 120 washings.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?","To find the cost per pump, we need to first find the total number of pumps in the bottle. Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washings with 1 pump will be the same as 2 pumps, which is 120 * 2 = 240 washings.

Now, we know that 2 pumps give 120 washings, so the total number of pumps is 240 (total washings) * 1 (pump per washing) = 240 pumps.

The cost of the bottle is $25.20, or 2520 cents. 

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps to find the cost per pump:
2520 cents / 240 pumps = 10.5 cents per pump.

The younger male sibling is 12 years old, an age that is half that of his elder brother. Can you calculate the combined age of all these siblings?","To find the combined age of the siblings, let's calculate the age of the elder male sibling first.

The younger male sibling is 12 years old, which is half the age of his elder brother. 
So, the elder brother's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.

Now, let's calculate the combined age of the siblings:
- 3 female siblings: 3 * 16 = 48 years
- Younger male sibling: 12 years
- Elder male sibling: 24 years

Combined age = 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years

His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to a veteran.   If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and some 1-hour lessons with a veteran, and the total amount of money he will make for the day is $440 in dollars. How many 1-hour lessons does Charlie give to the veteran?","To find out how many 1-hour lessons Charlie gives to the veteran, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Charlie makes from the standard lessons:
   Charlie has 4 standard lessons at $80 per hour, so the total amount from these lessons is:
   4 hours * $80/hour = $320

2. Calculate the reduced rate for lessons with a veteran:
   Charlie reduces his standard rate by 25%, so the reduced rate is:
   $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - (0.25 * $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

3. Calculate the total amount of money Charlie makes from the veteran lessons:
   The total amount Charlie makes for the day is $440, and we know he makes $320 from the standard lessons. So, the total amount from the veteran lessons is:
   $440 - $320 = $120

4. Calculate the number of 1-hour lessons Charlie gives to the veteran:
   Since the reduced rate is $60 per hour, we can divide the total amount from the veteran lessons by the reduced rate to find the number of lessons:
   $120 / $60 per hour = 2 hours

So, Charlie gives 2 1-hour lessons to the veteran.

Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?","To find out how many flights the first plane takes to France in one day, let's break down the information provided.

1. The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it flies to Greece 3/4 of the time.
2. The remaining flights (1 - 3/4 = 1/4) are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.

Let's assume the total number of flights the first plane takes in a day is 'x'. 

- Flights to Greece: 3/4 * x
- Remaining flights (France + Germany): 1/4 * x
- Since these remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, flights to France would be half of 1/4 * x, which is (1/2) * (1/4) * x = 1/8 * x.

Since we don't know the exact number of flights 'x', we can express the number of flights to France as a fraction of the total flights: 1/8 * x.

However, without knowing the total number of flights 'x', we can't provide a specific number. The problem doesn't give us enough information to determine the exact number of flights to France.

So, the answer would be in terms of 'x', but since you asked for a concise form of the answer in curly brackets, and we can't give a specific number without knowing 'x', the answer can't be provided in the requested format."

On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. Additionally, on Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for three days?","To find the total amount Sunny earned, we need to calculate the number of boxes sold for each item on each day and multiply it by the price of each item.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and he sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.

On Monday, Sunny sold 2 boxes of gingerbread and 4 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's calculate the total number of boxes sold for each item:
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 2 (Monday) = 27 boxes
- Apple pie: 11 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) + 4 (Monday) = 30 boxes

Now, let's calculate the total amount earned:
- Gingerbread: 27 boxes * $6 = $162
- Apple pie: 30 boxes * $15 = $450

Total amount earned: $162 + $450 = $612

When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then four pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole three quarters of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving six behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?","To find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it, we need to work backwards.

First, we know that six fries were left behind after the ants took one. So before the ants took one, there were 6 + 1 = 7 fries.

Then, a raccoon stole three quarters of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries before the raccoon stole some 'x'. Since the raccoon stole three quarters, the raccoon stole 3/4x fries. This means that 1/4x fries were left behind. We know that 1/4x = 7, so x = 7 * 4 = 28.

So, before the raccoon stole some fries, there were 28 fries.

Then, four pigeons each ate three fries. This means that the pigeons ate a total of 4 * 3 = 12 fries. Before the pigeons ate some fries, there were 28 + 12 = 40 fries.

Then, a seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 20 fries, so the seagull ate 20 / 2 = 10 fries. Before the seagull ate some fries, there were 40 + 10 = 50 fries.

So, when Dave bought the pack, there were 50 + 20 = 70 fries.

Later, a raccoon, who had previously stolen a bag of 30 chips, stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants, who had just finished carrying off a breadcrumb weighing 0.01 grams, carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.

2. The seagull ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

3. So, after Dave and the seagull ate, the total fries eaten is 14 + 7 = 21 fries.

4. Three pigeons, each eating 3 fries, ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

5. Now, the total fries eaten is 21 + 9 = 30 fries.

6. Let's denote the total number of fries in the pack initially as 'x'. After 30 fries were eaten, the remaining fries are x - 30.

7. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * (x - 30). The remaining fries after the raccoon's theft are (1/3) * (x - 30).

8. Ants carried off 1 fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, (1/3) * (x - 30) = 5 + 1 = 6.

In the midst of this, his friend, Timmy, was throwing cheese slices at the balloons as well, who threw 4 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, but Benny didn't count those. If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow, regardless of how many cheese slices Timmy threw?","To find out how many yellow balloons there were, we'll start by determining how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons. 

Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and there were 20 red balloons, he threw 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

Now, we know Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. To find out how many pieces he threw at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:

58 - 40 = 18

Since Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we divide the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by 3 to find out how many yellow balloons there were:

18 / 3 = 6

So, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.

In addition, Sophia decided to buy 2 onions and 1 more potato. how many onions and potatoes in total did Sophia buy at the market?","To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, let's break down the information given.

Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up equations to represent the relationship between the number of items Rose and Sophia bought.

Let x be the number of onions Sophia bought and y be the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
4x = 12
x = 12 / 4
x = 3

Since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
4y = 4
y = 4 / 4
y = 1

So, initially, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.

In addition, Sophia decided to buy 2 onions and 1 more potato. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these additional items to the initial amount.

Total onions = 3 (initial) + 2 (additional) = 5
Total potatoes = 1 (initial) + 1 (additional) = 2

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 5 onions and 2 potatoes.

If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 0.006 times of one million gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.","To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, let's break down the information step by step.

Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 0.004 times one million gallons. 

One million gallons * 0.004 = 0.004,000,000 gallons = 4,000 gallons.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles. 

So, the amount of water passing through the river becomes 2 * 4,000 gallons = 8,000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 0.006 times one million gallons.

One million gallons * 0.006 = 0.006,000,000 gallons = 6,000 gallons.

Step 4: The total number of animals killed is the sum of wolves and cougars killed on both nights. This can be expressed as:
10 (wolves last night) + x (cougars last night) + 3 * (x - 3) (wolves today) + (x - 3) (cougars today)

Combine like terms:
10 + x + 3x - 9 + x - 3
Combine like terms:

33,A news website publishes an average of 30 political and weather news articles every day. Its sister company publishes an average of 15 business news articles daily. Calculate the total number of articles the two websites published together in February if there are 31 days in the month.,"To calculate the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we need to first calculate the number of articles each website publishes in a month and then add them together.

The news website publishes an average of 30 articles per day. Since there are 31 days in February, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
30 articles/day * 31 days = 930 articles

The sister company publishes an average of 15 articles per day. The total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
15 articles/day * 31 days = 465 articles

Now, let's add the total number of articles published by both websites:

She keeps 500 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got one hundred cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?","To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to first find out how many cards she gave away. 

Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards.
Number of decks = 60
Number of basketball cards per deck = 250
Total basketball cards = Number of decks * Number of basketball cards per deck
Total basketball cards = 60 * 250 = 15,000

Step 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards.
Number of boxes = 50
Number of baseball cards per box = 400
Total baseball cards = Number of boxes * Number of baseball cards per box
Total baseball cards = 50 * 400 = 20,000

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has.
Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards
Total cards = 15,000 + 20,000 = 35,000

Step 4: Calculate the number of cards given away.
Number of cards kept = 500
Number of cards given away = Total cards - Number of cards kept
Number of cards given away = 35,000 - 500 = 34,500

Step 5: Calculate the number of students.
Number of cards per student = 100
Number of students = Number of cards given away / Number of cards per student
Number of students = 34,500 / 100 = 345

If Pete purchases two boxes of these lenses, what would be the cost of each pair of lenses?","To find the cost of each pair of lenses, we'll need to calculate the total cost of two boxes after the discount and then divide that by the total number of lenses.

1. Calculate the total cost of two boxes after the discount:
   Original price per box: $100.00
   Discount: 10%
   Discount amount per box: $100.00 * 0.10 = $10.00
   Price per box after discount: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
   Total cost for two boxes: $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

2. Calculate the total number of lenses in two boxes:
   Number of lenses per box: 90
   Total number of lenses in two boxes: 90 * 2 = 180

3. Calculate the number of pairs of lenses:
   Since there's one lens per eye, we'll divide the total number of lenses by 2 to get the number of pairs:
   Number of pairs of lenses: 180 / 2 = 90

4. Calculate the cost per pair of lenses:
   Total cost for two boxes: $180.00

1188,"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast. She also bakes a cake every Sunday which requires 4 eggs. Considering that she doesn't eat eggs on any other occasion, how many dozens of eggs will she consume in 4 weeks?","To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, let's break down her egg consumption:

1. Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for breakfast. Since there are 7 days in a week, she consumes 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.
2. She bakes a cake every Sunday, which requires 4 eggs. This adds 4 eggs/week to her total consumption.
3. So, her total egg consumption per week is 21 eggs/week + 4 eggs/week = 25 eggs/week.
4. Since there are 4 weeks, her total egg consumption is 25 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 100 eggs.
5. There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will consume, divide the total number of eggs by 12: 100 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 8.33 dozen eggs.

Since you can't buy a fraction of a dozen eggs, we round down to 8 dozen eggs. However, the question asks for the number of dozens of eggs she will consume, so we provide the exact value.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, and one-half of the students under 16 are male. If there are 1875 female students, how many students are there in total?","To find the total number of students in Brook Hills High School, let's break down the given information step by step.

Let's assume the total number of students is 'x'.

Since half of the students are over 16 years old, the number of students over 16 years old is x/2.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so the number of male students over 16 years old is (x/2) * (1/4) = x/8.

The remaining number of students over 16 years old who are female is (x/2) - (x/8) = 3x/8.

Since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, the number of students under 16 years old is also x/2.

One-half of the students under 16 are male, so the number of male students under 16 years old is (x/2) * (1/2) = x/4.

The remaining number of students under 16 years old who are female is (x/2) - (x/4) = x/4.

The total number of female students is given as 1875. This is the sum of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old:

3x/8 + x/4 = 1875

To simplify, multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fraction:

3x + 2x = 1875 * 8
5x = 15000

Now, divide both sides by 5:

x = 15000 / 5
x = 3000

So, the total number of students in Brook Hills High School is {3000}."

Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?","To find the answer, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone. Since she can throw it three times farther than without the gemstone, we multiply the original distance by 3:
   4000 feet * 3 = 12000 feet

2. Now, we need to find out how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. To do this, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone:
   12000 feet - 10000 feet = 2000 feet

So, Polly can stand 2000 feet outside of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.

890,"If one person can paint half a house in 10 days, how many hours would it take for 10 people to paint a whole house?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. If one person can paint half a house in 10 days, then one person can paint a whole house in 20 days (since painting a whole house is twice as much work as painting half a house).

2. If one person can paint a whole house in 20 days, then the total number of hours required for one person to paint a whole house is 20 days * 24 hours/day = 480 hours.

3. If 10 people work together to paint a whole house, then the total number of hours required would be 480 hours / 10 people = 48 hours.

Therefore, it would take 10 people 48 hours to paint a whole house. {48 hours}"

He tried to get home within four hours, but was stuck in traffic for the first two hours. For the next half hour, he drove at 30 miles per hour before being able to drive the rest of the time faster than he had ever done before. If he's 45 miles from home in four hours, how fast is he going the rest of the time?","To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

1. John drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour, so he covered a distance of:
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles

2. Since he turned around and went back, he covered the same distance to return home. So, the total distance he drove to return to the starting point is:
   Total distance = 180 * 2 = 360 miles

3. John tried to get home within 4 hours, but he was stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours, so he didn't move during this time.

4. For the next half hour, he drove at 30 miles per hour. To convert half an hour to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   Half an hour = 30 minutes / 60 = 0.5 hours
   Distance covered in half an hour = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles

5. Now, let's find the remaining distance he needs to cover to reach home:
   Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered in half an hour = 360 - 15 = 345 miles

6. However, we are given that he is 45 miles from home in 4 hours. So, the remaining distance he needs to cover is 45 miles.

7. Since we know that he drove for 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours at 30 miles per hour, the total time he drove at the unknown speed is:
   Total time = 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours

8. We also know that he covered a distance of 345 - 45 = 300 miles in 1.5 hours at the unknown speed.

9. Now, we can calculate the unknown speed:
   Speed = Distance / Time = 300 / 1.5 = 200 miles per hour

1. First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim spends at work each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the number of hours by 60.

6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

2. Since it takes 15 minutes to deal with a call, we can find out how many calls Tim deals with in a day by dividing the total minutes by 15.

360 minutes/day / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

3. To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls per day by 5.

24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

The 2-hour movie after work doesn't affect the number of calls Tim deals with during his work hours.

His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, it takes 1 more day to recycle the chalk, what's the length of the chack that the teacher will recycle?","To find the length of the chalk that the teacher will recycle, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the 5-inch chalk. So, the length of chalk left after Monday is:
   5 inches - (45% of 5 inches) = 5 inches - (0.45 * 5 inches) = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

2. The teacher then goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. We are told that it takes 1 more day to recycle the chalk. So, after Tuesday, the length of the chalk left should be less than the minimum required for recycling.

   Let's calculate the length of chalk left after Tuesday:
   2.75 inches - (20% of 2.75 inches) = 2.75 inches - (0.20 * 2.75 inches) = 2.75 inches - 0.55 inches = 2.20 inches

902,"A rancher is purchasing food for his equines. He gets a mix of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Sugar cubes are an occasional indulgence, so he only gets two boxes, each weighing 1 pound, for all the horses. He only needs enough carrots to feed the horses while they are still fresh, so he gets four bags, each weighing 12 pounds. Hay is the primary food source for his horses, so he gets forty-two bales, each weighing 75 pounds. Oats are a necessary addition to the hay, so he gets twenty sacks, each weighing 65 pounds. If his ranch vehicle can transport 2250 pounds per trip, how many trips does the rancher need to make to move all the food?","To find the total number of trips the rancher needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the food.

1. Calculate the weight of sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
2. Calculate the weight of carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
3. Calculate the weight of hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
4. Calculate the weight of oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, add up the total weight of all the food:
2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 4500 pounds

Since the ranch vehicle can transport 2250 pounds per trip, we need to divide the total weight by the vehicle's capacity:
4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips

However, since 4500 is not exactly divisible by 2250 and the rancher cannot make a fraction of a trip, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to accommodate all the food. 

Therefore, the rancher needs to make 2 trips, but since he cannot transport the remaining 0 pounds of food in a fraction of a trip, and in fact he can transport all the food in 2 trips, the answer is {2}."

The second venue charges $25 per person, with food included in the price. If Mark has 10 guests to attend the party to make the cost equal to the first venue, how much is the flat fee for the first venue?","To find the flat fee for the first venue, we need to determine the total cost of the second venue and then set it equal to the total cost of the first venue.

The second venue charges $25 per person, and Mark has 10 guests. The total cost of the second venue is:

10 guests * $25 per guest = $250

The first venue charges a flat fee plus $5 per person for food. Let's denote the flat fee as 'x'. The total cost of the first venue is:

x (flat fee) + 10 guests * $5 per guest (food cost)
= x + $50

Since Mark wants the cost of the first venue to be equal to the cost of the second venue, we can set up an equation:

x + $50 = $250

To solve for x, we subtract $50 from both sides of the equation:

x = $250 - $50
x = $200

So, the flat fee for the first venue is $200.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  How long did it take him to get across the lake?","To find the total time taken, we'll break down the problem into steps.

1. James swims 70% of the distance:
   Distance = 30 miles
   70% of the distance = 0.7 * 30 miles = 21 miles

2. Time taken to swim 21 miles at 3 miles per hour:
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 21 miles / 3 miles per hour = 7 hours

3. James rests for half as long as the swimming time:
   Rest time = 7 hours / 2 = 3.5 hours

4. James swims the remaining distance at half the speed:
   Remaining distance = 30 miles - 21 miles = 9 miles
   New speed = 3 miles per hour / 2 = 1.5 miles per hour
   Time taken to swim the remaining distance = 9 miles / 1.5 miles per hour = 6 hours

5. Total time taken to cross the lake:
   Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   Total time = 7 hours + 3.5 hours + 6 hours
   Total time = 16.5 hours

How much did Bentley pay to fill 150 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?","To find the cost of inflating 150 balloons after the price increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the original cost of inflating one balloon:
   Total cost for 15 balloons = $750
   Original cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
   Original cost per balloon = $750 / 15
   Original cost per balloon = $50

2. Find the new cost of inflating one balloon after the price increase:
   New cost per balloon = Original cost per balloon + Price increase
   New cost per balloon = $50 + $15
   New cost per balloon = $65

3. Find the cost of inflating 150 balloons at the new price:
   Total cost for 150 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
   Total cost for 150 balloons = $65 * 150
   Total cost for 150 balloons = $9750

So, Bentley paid $9750 to fill 150 balloons after the price increase.

87,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. She decorates each plant with six pebbles. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"To find out how many cups of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the total amount of water required by all her plants.

1. 4 plants need half of a cup of water each. 
   Half a cup is 0.5 cups. 
   4 * 0.5 = 2 cups.

2. 8 plants need 1 cup of water each. 
   8 * 1 = 8 cups.

3. The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. 
   There are 20 plants in total, and we've already accounted for 4 + 8 = 12 plants. 
   So, 20 - 12 = 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. 
   A quarter of a cup is 0.25 cups. 
   8 * 0.25 = 2 cups.

Now, we add up the total amount of water required by all the plants:
2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.

If Erika now only needs an extra $500 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information given:

1. The original price of the laptop is $6000.
2. The price is reduced by $2000 after trading in her old laptop, so the new price is $6000 - $2000 = $4000.
3. Erika needs an extra $500 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has $4000 - $500 = $3500.
4. We know Erika has been paid $1500 for her part-time job and her mom is giving her $800, so the total amount from these sources is $1500 + $800 = $2300.
5. Since Erika currently has $3500 and $2300 of that comes from her job and her mom, the amount she has in her purse is $3500 - $2300 = $1200.

2360,"Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in some times, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Elise writes the alphabet some times: Let's assume she writes it 'n' times. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, she has written 26n letters.

2. Then, she writes half of the alphabet once: Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.

3. Then, she re-writes everything she has already written: This means she re-writes the 26n letters from step 1 and the 13 letters from step 2. So, she re-writes a total of 26n + 13 letters.

Now, let's calculate the total number of letters Elise has written:

- She wrote 26n letters initially.
- Then, she wrote 13 letters.
- Then, she re-wrote 26n + 13 letters.

The total number of letters Elise has written is: 26n + 13 + 26n + 13.

Combine like terms: 52n + 26.

1277,There are three trees in Eddy's backyard. The second tree has a height of 5 feet more than the shortest tree. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet. How tall is the shortest tree?,"To find the height of the shortest tree, let's denote the height of the shortest tree as 'x'. 

Since the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, the height of the second tree is 'x + 5'.

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. The combined height of the shortest and second tree is 'x + (x + 5)'. 

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet. According to the problem, the height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So we can write the equation as:

2(x + x + 5) = 34

Combine like terms:

2(2x + 5) = 34

Expand the equation:

4x + 10 = 34

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4x = 24

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 6

So the height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.

She has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is 6 * 8 = 48.

Since she wants to make an equal number of vanilla and chocolate cupcakes, she needs to divide the total number of cupcakes by 2. 
48 / 2 = 24

So, she needs to bake 24 vanilla cupcakes and 24 chocolate cupcakes.

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she needs to bake 24 / 12 = 2 pans of vanilla cupcakes and 2 pans of chocolate cupcakes.

In total, she needs to bake 2 + 2 = 4 pans of cupcakes.

How much money does he spend in total on ties?","To find the total amount spent on ties, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John spends $200 on blue ties, each priced at $40. To find the number of blue ties purchased, we divide the total amount spent on blue ties by the price of each blue tie:
   Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Price of each blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. John purchases two times the quantity of red ties as blue ties. So, the number of red ties purchased is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The red ties are priced at 1.5 times the cost of the blue ties. The price of each blue tie is $40, so the price of each red tie is:
   Price of each red tie = 1.5 * Price of each blue tie
   Price of each red tie = 1.5 * $40
   Price of each red tie = $60

4. Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties:
   Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Price of each red tie
   Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total amount spent on red ties = $600

5. Finally, we add the total amount spent on blue ties and red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:

If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?","To calculate the total amount billed by Patty, we need to break down the costs into three components: the service fee, labor, and parts.

1. Service fee: The service fee is $40.

2. Labor: The labor cost is $35 per hour or fraction of an hour. Since the job required 2.25 hours of work, we need to round up to the nearest whole number of hours, which is 3 hours (since 2.25 hours is more than 2 hours but less than 3 hours, and we can't have a fraction of an hour for billing purposes). So, the labor cost is 3 hours * $35 per hour = $105.

3. Parts: The cost of parts is $60.

Now, we add the three components together to get the total amount billed:

$40 (service fee) + $105 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $205

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. On top of that, Mark is considering hiring a DJ for the party, which will cost an additional $100. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, let's denote the number of guests as 'x'. 

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee ($200) plus the cost of food for each guest ($5x) and the cost of the DJ ($100). So, the total cost for the first venue is:
200 + 5x + 100

Combine like terms:
300 + 5x

For the second venue, the total cost is $25 per guest (including food), plus the cost of the DJ ($100). So, the total cost for the second venue is:
25x + 100

Now, set the two total costs equal to each other to find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost:
300 + 5x = 25x + 100

Subtract 5x from both sides:
300 = 20x + 100

Subtract 100 from both sides:
200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20:

Now, consider that this person also has a coupon for a free car wash worth $10, but the car wash machine is broken and they can't use it. Also, they find a lucky penny on the ground, but it doesn't change the price of the gas.","To find the total cost of the gas after cashback rewards, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial cost of the gas: 
   The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon. The person buys 10 gallons of gas.
   Initial cost = 10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

2. Calculate the cashback reward:
   The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon.
   Cashback reward = 10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

3. Calculate the final cost after cashback rewards:
   Final cost = Initial cost - Cashback reward
   Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

The coupon for the free car wash and the lucky penny do not affect the price of the gas.

The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, some kernels that popped also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","To find the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat, we need to calculate the number of kernels popped in each 30-second interval.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, three times the initial amount popped: 3 * 20 = 60 kernels.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels popped at four times the initial rate: 4 * 20 = 80 kernels.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds (which was 80 kernels). So, it slowed down to 80 / 2 = 40 kernels.

Now, we add up the number of kernels popped in each interval:
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200

However, the problem also mentions that some kernels popped from the residual heat after the pan was taken off the heat. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide a specific number for this, so we can't give an exact total. But if we only consider the kernels that popped while the pan was on the heat, Garrett has at least 200 pieces of popcorn to eat.

We know that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar. Let's call the cost of a half-gallon jar 'x'. 

Since a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up the equation: 
x + 2.5 = 5.5

Now, let's solve for x: 
x = 5.5 - 2.5 
x = 3

So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.

2. Cost of 4 cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
3. Cost of 3 mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00

Martha, on the other hand, has managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. However, there is a twist. The school has decided to deduct 10% of each student's points due to a minor misconduct. After this deduction, how many more points does the class need to collect to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points for the trip?","To find out how many more points the class needs to collect, we need to calculate the total points they have after the deduction.

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. 
   30% of 50 is 0.3 * 50 = 15.
   So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
4. Martha has 3 times more points than Tom.
   So, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's calculate the total points before the deduction:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Martha: 105
Total points before deduction: 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

Since the school deducts 10% of each student's points:
Adam's points after deduction: 50 - (0.1 * 50) = 50 - 5 = 45
Betty's points after deduction: 65 - (0.1 * 65) = 65 - 6.5 = 58.5
Tom's points after deduction: 35 - (0.1 * 35) = 35 - 3.5 = 31.5
Martha's points after deduction: 105 - (0.1 * 105) = 105 - 10.5 = 94.5

Now, let's calculate the total points after the deduction:
Total points after deduction: 45 + 58.5 + 31.5 + 94.5 = 229.5 points.

However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund of $5600. How much is the milk per gallon?","To find the cost of milk per gallon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of milk that was returned: 
   2/5 of 4000 gallons = (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons

2. Calculate the amount of milk that was not returned (i.e., the amount that was usable):
   4000 - 1600 = 2400 gallons

3. Since Mr. Marcellus ordered a refund of $5600 for the returned milk, we can calculate the cost per gallon of the returned milk. However, we know that the cost per gallon is the same for all the milk, so we can calculate the cost per gallon using the total amount of milk and the total cost.

   The total cost of the milk is the cost of the milk that was not returned plus the refund for the returned milk. However, we do not know the cost of the milk that was not returned. But we can calculate the cost per gallon using the refund for the returned milk and the amount of returned milk.

   The refund for the returned milk is $5600, and the amount of returned milk is 1600 gallons. 

   Cost per gallon = Total refund / Total gallons returned
   Cost per gallon = $5600 / 1600
   Cost per gallon = $3.50

   Alternatively, we can calculate the total cost of the milk and then calculate the cost per gallon.

   The total cost of the milk is the cost of the milk that was not returned plus the refund for the returned milk. We know that the cost per gallon is the same for all the milk, so we can calculate the total cost of the milk using the refund for the returned milk and the amount of returned milk.

   The refund for the returned milk is $5600, and the amount of returned milk is 1600 gallons. The cost per gallon is the same for all the milk, so the total cost of the milk is:

   Total cost = Cost per gallon * Total gallons
   $5600 = Cost per gallon * 1600
   Cost per gallon = $5600 / 1600
   Cost per gallon = $3.50

   Now, we can calculate the total cost of the milk using the cost per gallon and the total amount of milk.

   Total cost = Cost per gallon * Total gallons
   Total cost = $3.50 * 4000
   Total cost = $14000

   The cost of the milk that was not returned is the total cost minus the refund for the returned milk.

   Cost of the milk that was not returned = Total cost - Refund for the returned milk
   Cost of the milk that was not returned = $14000 - $5600
   Cost of the milk that was not returned = $8400

   Now, we can calculate the cost per gallon using the cost of the milk that was not returned and the amount of milk that was not returned.

   Cost per gallon = Cost of the milk that was not returned / Amount of milk that was not returned
   Cost per gallon = $8400 / 2400
   Cost per gallon = $3.50

So, the cost of milk per gallon is { $3.50 }."

Total number of eggs = 36

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find the total number of dozen eggs.

3. Now we know the cost of an additional phone is $10. 
   There are 4 additional phones in the plan. 
   The total cost of the additional phones is 4 * 10 = $40.

4. The total cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones.

1. There are 20 students in total, and they are split into two equal groups of boys and girls. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. Each boy collected 60 seashells.

3. The girls collected a number of seashells equal to the quantity collected by the boys (60 seashells) plus four times that amount. 

   To find the total number of seashells collected by the girls, we need to calculate four times the amount collected by the boys and add the original amount.
   
   Four times the amount collected by the boys: 4 * 60 = 240 seashells
   
   Adding the original amount: 240 + 60 = 300 seashells

   This is the total number of seashells collected by the girls. Since there are 10 girls, we need to divide this total by 10 to find the number of seashells each girl collected.

1. Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 steps is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.

2144,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To find the cheapest lumber, we need to calculate the cost per stick for both 2 x 4 and 2 x 8 pieces of wood. 

First, let's calculate the cost per stick for a 2 x 8 piece of wood. 
Since a 2 x 8 costs $6 and gives 400 sticks, the cost per stick is $6 / 400 = $0.015 per stick.

Now, let's calculate the cost per stick for a 2 x 4 piece of wood. 
Since we don't know the cost of a 2 x 4, we'll call it x. 
A 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks, so the cost per stick is x / 200.

We know that Frederick has $24 to buy wood for sticks. 
If he buys the cheapest lumber, he can get the most sticks if he buys 2 x 8 pieces of wood (assuming they are cheaper) or a combination of 2 x 8 and 2 x 4 pieces of wood.

Since a 2 x 8 costs $6, Frederick can buy 24 / 6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood.
4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood will give him 4 * 400 = 1600 sticks.

However, we still don't know the cost of a 2 x 4 piece of wood. 
If the cost of a 2 x 4 is less than $3 (half of $6), then buying 2 x 4 pieces of wood might give more sticks.

Let's assume the cost of a 2 x 4 is less than $3.
If the cost of a 2 x 4 is $3 or less, then Frederick can buy 24 / 3 = 8 pieces of 2 x 4 wood.
8 pieces of 2 x 4 wood will give him 8 * 200 = 1600 sticks.

Since both options give the same number of sticks, we can't conclude that one is better than the other without knowing the cost of a 2 x 4 piece of wood.

However, if we assume that Frederick wants to buy the cheapest lumber and that the cost of a 2 x 4 is more than $3, then buying 2 x 8 pieces of wood will give him the most sticks.

2188,"Derrick has a bakery that makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, selling at $2 per doughnut. Then he decided to give it a 20% discount. How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?","To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total amount of money he makes in a day and then multiply it by the number of days in June.

1. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

2. The original price of each doughnut is $2. However, Derrick decided to give a 20% discount. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $2 * 0.2 = $0.4.

3. Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the new price: $2 - $0.4 = $1.6 per doughnut.

4. To find the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day, we multiply the number of doughnuts by the new price: 120 * $1.6 = $192 per day.

5. Since June has 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30 to find the total amount of money Derrick makes in June: $192 * 30 = $5760.

114,"Mrs. Tatiana owns a grocery store that sells different fruits and vegetables, which includes carrots. The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would be the price of carrots after three years if it was $1000 initially? (Round to the nearest integer)","To find the price of carrots after three years, we need to calculate the price increase for each year and add it to the initial price.

Initial price of carrots: $1000

Year 1: 
Price increase = 5% of $1000 = 0.05 * $1000 = $50
New price = Initial price + Price increase = $1000 + $50 = $1050

Year 2: 
Price increase = 5% of $1050 = 0.05 * $1050 = $52.50
New price = Previous price + Price increase = $1050 + $52.50 = $1102.50

Year 3: 
Price increase = 5% of $1102.50 = 0.05 * $1102.50 = $55.125
New price = Previous price + Price increase = $1102.50 + $55.125 = $1157.625

Rounded to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years is $1158.
