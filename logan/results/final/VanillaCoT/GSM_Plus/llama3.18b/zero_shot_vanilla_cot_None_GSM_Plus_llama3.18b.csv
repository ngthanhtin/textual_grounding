1578,"Colby wants to buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. If he has 80 quarters, 60 dimes, 140 nickels, and 150 pennies, how many can he buy?","To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to find the total value of his money in cents and then divide it by the cost of each gumball (5 cents).

1. Convert the quarters to cents: 80 quarters * 25 cents = 2000 cents
2. Convert the dimes to cents: 60 dimes * 10 cents = 600 cents
3. Convert the nickels to cents: 140 nickels * 5 cents = 700 cents
4. Convert the pennies to cents: 150 pennies * 1 cent = 150 cents
5. Add up the total value of Colby's money: 2000 + 600 + 700 + 150 = 3350 cents
6. Divide the total value by the cost of each gumball: 3350 / 5 = 670

So, Colby can buy {670} gumballs."
1723,"Dylan attended a wedding where there were 100 guests in the reception. Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 1.5 times of ten cookies, how many people were in the church next door?","To find the number of people in the church next door, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests:
   Total guests = 100
   Cookies per guest = 15
   Total cookies = Total guests * Cookies per guest
   Total cookies = 100 * 15
   Total cookies = 1500

2. Calculate the number of cookies given to the church next door:
   The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.
   Cookies given to the church = Total cookies / 2
   Cookies given to the church = 1500 / 2
   Cookies given to the church = 750

3. Calculate the number of people in the church next door:
   Each person in the church got 1.5 times 10 cookies, which is 15 cookies.
   Number of people in the church = Cookies given to the church / 15
   Number of people in the church = 750 / 15
   Number of people in the church = 50

166,"The girls are collecting funds for a fair. Kim manages to gather $320 more than Alexandra, who gathers $430, while Maryam collects $400 more than Sarah, who collects $300. What is the total amount of money, in dollars, that they have all collected together?","To find the total amount of money collected, we need to find the amount collected by each person and add them together.

1. Alexandra collects $430.
2. Kim collects $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim collects $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah collects $300.
4. Maryam collects $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam collects $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add the amounts collected by each person:
$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180.

So, the total amount of money collected is $2180.

1061,"On Tuesday, the tank was filled with seven more feet of water. Wednesday's water depth was two-thirds of Tuesday's. If the water depth of the tank was 16 on Wednesday, what is the depth of the water on Monday?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Tuesday, the tank was filled with seven more feet of water. Let's call the depth of the water on Monday 'x'. Then, the depth of the water on Tuesday is x + 7.

2. Wednesday's water depth was two-thirds of Tuesday's. This means the depth of the water on Wednesday is (2/3) * (x + 7).

3. We are given that the water depth of the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet. So, we can set up the equation:

(2/3) * (x + 7) = 16

4. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3/2 to get:

x + 7 = 24

5. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation gives us:

x = 17

Therefore, the depth of the water on Monday was {17}."
2095,Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags and 6 packs of 3 hats for $4 each. She painted them and sold them at a craft fair for $8 each. How much profit did she earn on her bags?,"To find the profit earned on the bags, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue from selling the bags.

1. Calculate the total number of canvas bags:
   Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags, so the total number of bags is 8 * 5 = 40.

2. Calculate the total cost of the canvas bags:
   Each pack of bags costs $4, but since we are only considering the cost of the bags, we don't need to consider the packs. So, the total cost of the bags is 40 * $4 = $160.

3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:
   Tara sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue from selling the bags is 40 * $8 = $320.

4. Calculate the profit earned on the bags:
   Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   Profit = $320 - $160
   Profit = $160

1991,Mattison stands at a height of 60 inches. The height of his double-story dwelling is seven times his own height. The distance from the floor to the ceiling on the ground floor is three times Mattison's height. Can you determine the height in inches from the floor of the second floor to the roof?,"To find the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof, we need to calculate the total height of the double-story dwelling and subtract the height of the ground floor.

1. Calculate the height of the double-story dwelling:
   Mattison's height: 60 inches
   The height of his double-story dwelling is seven times his own height: 7 * 60 = 420 inches

2. Calculate the height of the ground floor:
   The distance from the floor to the ceiling on the ground floor is three times Mattison's height: 3 * 60 = 180 inches

3. Calculate the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof:
   Total height of the dwelling: 420 inches
   Height of the ground floor: 180 inches
   Height of the second floor: 420 - 180 = 240 inches

So, the height from the floor of the second floor to the roof is 240 inches. {240}"
1659,"Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has a pile of 3/5 of one hundred letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. If there are now 3/10 of one hundred letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, how many were in that pile when Jennie began?","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the number of letters needing stamps. 
3/5 of one hundred letters is (3/5) * 100 = 60 letters.

Step 2: Calculate the number of letters that Jennie put stamps on. 
One-third of the letters needing stamps is (1/3) * 60 = 20 letters.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie added 20 letters to it. 
Let's say the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is x. 
After Jennie added 20 letters, the total number of letters in the pile is x + 20.

Step 4: Calculate the fraction of the total number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters after Jennie added 20 letters to it. 
3/10 of one hundred letters is (3/10) * 100 = 30 letters.

Step 5: Set up an equation to find the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. 
Since the pile now contains 30 letters, which is 3/10 of the total number of letters, and Jennie added 20 letters to the pile, the initial number of letters in the pile is (30 - 20) = 10 letters.

However, we also know that the pile of already-stamped letters is 3/10 of the total number of letters, and the total number of letters is 100. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 20 = (3/10) * 100

x + 20 = 30

x = 10

However, this is the number of letters that Jennie added to the pile, not the initial number of letters in the pile. The initial number of letters in the pile is actually the number of letters that were already-stamped before Jennie added 20 letters. 

Let's call the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters y. Then, the number of letters in the pile after Jennie added 20 letters is y + 20. We know that y + 20 = 30, since the pile now contains 30 letters.

y + 20 = 30

y = 10

However, this is the number of letters in the pile after Jennie added 20 letters, not the initial number of letters. We know that the pile of already-stamped letters is 3/10 of the total number of letters, and the total number of letters is 100. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

y = (3/10) * 100

y = 30

However, we also know that the pile now contains 30 letters, which is the result of adding 20 letters to the initial number of letters in the pile. Therefore, the initial number of letters in the pile is actually 30 - 20 = 10 letters.

However, we know that the pile of already-stamped letters is 3/10 of the total number of letters, and the total number of letters is 100. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

y = (3/10) * 100

y = 30

However, this is the number of letters that were already-stamped when the pile was 3/10 of one hundred letters. To find the initial number of letters in the pile, we need to find the initial number of letters in the pile when the pile was 3/10 of one hundred letters."
1243,"Stephen placed an online order for groceries.  His final bill came to $40.50.  Because this was through a delivery vendor, they tacked on a 25% fee to his final total and charged him $3.50 in delivery fees.  Stephen also added a $4.50 tip.  After the extra fees, what was the final price of Stephen's groceries?","To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to follow the steps:

1. Calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.50:
   25% of $40.50 = 0.25 * $40.50 = $10.125
   Round the fee to two decimal places: $10.13

2. Add the 25% fee to the final bill:
   $40.50 + $10.13 = $50.63

3. Add the delivery fee of $3.50 to the total:
   $50.63 + $3.50 = $54.13

4. Add the tip of $4.50 to the total:
   $54.13 + $4.50 = $58.63

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $58.63.

1953,"Jessica is trying to figure out how much to pay on all her debts each month. Her student loans have a minimum payment of $400/month, her credit card's minimum is $300/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $600/month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a year?","To find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to calculate the increased monthly payments for each debt and then multiply by 12.

1. Student loans: 
   - Minimum payment: $400
   - Increased payment: $400 + (50% of $400) = $400 + $200 = $600
   - Monthly payment: $600
   - Annual payment: $600 * 12 = $7,200

2. Credit card:
   - Minimum payment: $300
   - Increased payment: $300 + (50% of $300) = $300 + $150 = $450
   - Monthly payment: $450
   - Annual payment: $450 * 12 = $5,400

3. Mortgage:
   - Minimum payment: $600
   - Increased payment: $600 + (50% of $600) = $600 + $300 = $900
   - Monthly payment: $900
   - Annual payment: $900 * 12 = $10,800

1467,"Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together. Paisley ran 4.5 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran and 3.5 miles farther than Lynn. How many miles did Lynn run?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Paisley ran 4.5 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran: 5 * 4.5 = 22.5 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 3.5 miles farther than Lynn. So, Reggie's total distance is the sum of Lynn's distance and 3.5 miles: Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3.5 miles.
4. We know Reggie's total distance is 22.5 miles. So, we can set up the equation: Lynn's distance + 3.5 miles = 22.5 miles.
5. To find Lynn's distance, we need to subtract 3.5 miles from Reggie's distance: Lynn's distance = 22.5 - 3.5 = 19 miles.

2390,"A fruit farm specializing in apples offers them in packs of 10. On a particular day, they managed to sell 2000 apples. If each pack is priced at $5, what is the total revenue the farm made from these sales?","To find the total revenue, we need to determine the number of packs sold and then multiply it by the price of each pack.

1. The farm sold 2000 apples in packs of 10. To find the number of packs sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack:
   2000 apples / 10 apples per pack = 200 packs

2. Now that we know the number of packs sold, we can find the total revenue by multiplying the number of packs by the price of each pack:
   200 packs * $5 per pack = $1000

Therefore, the total revenue the farm made from these sales is {1000}."
895,"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days with 20kg of paint, how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days with 20kg of paint. This means one person can paint a whole house in 10 days (double the time to paint the entire house).
2. Since one person can paint a whole house in 10 days, we need to find out how many hours this is. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
   10 days * 24 hours/day = 240 hours
3. Now, we know that one person can paint a whole house in 240 hours. We want to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house. Since 5 people can work together, they will complete the task 5 times faster.
4. To find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we need to divide the time it takes for one person by 5:
   240 hours / 5 = 48 hours

So, it would take 5 people {48} hours to paint a whole house."

If his car payment is $500 and he spends $5 on fuel each time he rents out his car, how much profit does he make on his car?","To find John's profit, we need to calculate his total income from renting out his car and then subtract his expenses.

1. Calculate John's total income:
   He rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. 
   So, the total hours he rents out his car per month is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.
   He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total income is 30 * $25 = $750.

2. Calculate John's total fuel expenses:
   He spends $5 on fuel each time he rents out his car, and he rents it out 10 times a month.
   So, his total fuel expenses per month is 10 * $5 = $50.

3. Calculate John's total expenses (car payment + fuel expenses):
   His car payment is $500 and his fuel expenses are $50, so his total expenses per month is $500 + $50 = $550.

4. Calculate John's profit:
   His total income is $750 and his total expenses are $550, so his profit is $750 - $550 = $200.

She gives ten cards to each of her students and keeps the remaining 50 cards for herself. If she gave the cards to 30 students, how many boxes of baseball cards does Miss Maria have in total?","To find out how many boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards she has. Since she has 6 decks with 25 cards in each deck, the total number of basketball cards is:
   6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards

2. Since she gives 10 cards to each of her 30 students and keeps 50 cards for herself, the total number of cards given to students is:
   30 students * 10 cards/student = 300 cards

3. The total number of cards she has is the sum of the cards given to students and the cards she kept for herself:
   300 cards + 50 cards = 350 cards

4. Since she has 350 cards in total and all of these are basketball cards, she doesn't have any basketball cards left. However, this information is not relevant to the question about the baseball cards.

5. To find out how many boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has, we need to know how many cards she has in total and how many cards are in each box. Since we know she has 350 basketball cards, but the question is about baseball cards, we need to consider the information about the baseball cards.

6. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide any information about how many basketball cards Miss Maria has in relation to the baseball cards. However, since we know she gives 10 cards to each student and keeps 50 cards for herself, we can assume that the remaining cards are baseball cards.

7. Since she gave cards to 30 students, the total number of cards given to students is 300. She kept 50 cards for herself. The total number of cards given to students and kept for herself is 350. However, this total is made up of basketball cards. 

8. Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the number of baseball cards, we can't calculate the number of boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has. However, we can infer that she has some baseball cards since she has some boxes of baseball cards.

9. Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the number of baseball cards, we can't calculate the number of boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has. However, we can infer that she has some baseball cards since she has some boxes of baseball cards.

10. To find out how many boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has, we need to know how many cards are in each box and how many cards she has in total. Since we know she has 40 cards in each box, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.

11. Let x be the number of boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has. The total number of baseball cards is 40x.

12. However, we don't know how many baseball cards Miss Maria has in total. Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the number of baseball cards, we can't calculate the number of boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has.

13. Since we can't calculate the number of boxes of baseball cards Miss Maria has, we can't provide a numerical answer.

However, if we assume that the number of baseball cards is the same as the number of basketball cards (which is not given in the problem), we can calculate the number of boxes of baseball cards.

If we assume that the number of baseball cards is 350 (the same as the number of basketball cards), we can calculate the number of boxes of baseball cards as follows:

350 cards / 40 cards/box = 8.75 boxes

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we can round down to 8 boxes.

Therefore, the answer is {8}."
303,"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles and 8 jars of cream in her pantry. Each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes. Mary wants to bake enough cupcakes to use up all of her sprinkles. If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, how many pans worth of cupcakes should she bake?","To find out how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with all the sprinkles. Since each jar of sprinkles can decorate 8 cupcakes and Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles:
   Total cupcakes = 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes

2. Now, we need to find out how many pans are needed to bake these cupcakes. Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes:
   Number of pans = Total cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans

Therefore, Mary should bake {4} pans worth of cupcakes."

He decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $4.00 which will add chips and a drink. He has a gift card for $6.00 that he uses at check out. How much does he still owe?","To find out how much Chad still owes, let's break down the cost of his meal step by step:

1. Base burrito: $7.50
2. Extra meat: $2.50
3. Extra cheese: $1.50
4. Avocado: $1.50
5. 2 sauces: $0.35 * 2 = $0.70
6. Total cost of burrito: $7.50 + $2.50 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $0.70 = $13.70
7. Upgrade meal: $4.00
8. Total cost with upgrade: $13.70 + $4.00 = $17.70
9. Gift card: -$6.00 (since it's a gift card, we subtract the value from the total cost)
10. Final cost: $17.70 - $6.00 = $11.70

So, Chad still owes { $11.70 }."

If they decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, they each will get 4 pounds of candy. Then how many pounds of candy does Aaron have?","To find out how many pounds of candy Aaron has, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robert had 3 pounds of candy, and Cindy had 5 pounds of candy. 
2. When they pool and share their candy equally, each of them gets 4 pounds of candy. 
3. Since they are sharing their candy equally, the total amount of candy they have must be a multiple of 4 (because 4 pounds each is a multiple of 4). 
4. The total amount of candy Robert and Cindy have is 3 + 5 = 8 pounds. 
5. If they share this 8 pounds of candy equally among themselves, each of them would get 4 pounds, but in this case, they would not have any extra candy left over. 
6. Since we know that each of them gets 4 pounds of candy after sharing, and we know that Robert and Cindy together have 8 pounds of candy, we can infer that Aaron must have contributed enough candy to make the total amount a multiple of 4. 
7. Since 8 pounds is not a multiple of 4, we need to add some amount of candy to make it a multiple of 4. 
8. The next multiple of 4 greater than 8 is 12 pounds. 
9. Therefore, the total amount of candy must be 12 pounds for each of them to get 4 pounds of candy after sharing. 
10. Since Robert and Cindy together have 8 pounds of candy, Aaron must have contributed 12 - 8 = 4 pounds of candy.

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they use on the first day?","To find out how many bandages the nurses used on the first day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The nurses started with 19 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they had 19 + 50 = 69 bandages at the end of the first day.

2. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day. Since they used 69 bandages on the first day, they used 69 - 10 = 59 bandages on the second day.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack of 50 bandages, which is 25 bandages. So, they used 25 bandages on the third day.

4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left. Let's find out how many bandages they had at the beginning of the third day: 78 (left) + 25 (used on the third day) + 100 (ordered on the third day) = 203 bandages.

5. Now, let's find out how many bandages they had at the beginning of the second day: 203 (at the beginning of the third day) - 25 (used on the third day) - 100 (ordered on the third day) = 78 bandages.

6. Since they used 59 bandages on the second day, they used 59 + 25 = 84 bandages on the second and third days combined.

7. Now, let's find out how many bandages they used on the first day: 69 (at the end of the first day) - 19 (initial bandages) = 50 bandages."
1450,"Grandma walks 30 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 20 miles of walking on the beach and 10 miles of walking on the sidewalk. On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 400 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 30-mile walk, in minutes?","To find the time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 30-mile walk, we need to first determine her speed on the beach and on the sidewalk. 

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as x miles per minute. Since she walks 20 miles on the beach, it takes her 400 minutes to walk on the beach. 

So, 20 miles / x miles per minute = 400 minutes. 
Solving for x, we get x = 20 miles / 400 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute (or 1/20 miles per minute).

Now, we know that Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

It takes her 10 miles / 0.1 miles per minute = 100 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

The total time taken to complete the entire 30-mile walk is the sum of the time taken to walk on the beach and the time taken to walk on the sidewalk.

He'd dumped a lego boxed set on the floor, and another one that had 3 times more pieces than the first one, and another one that had 1/4 the number of pieces. How many blocks does Johnny pick up if he picks up all the legos?","To find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up, we need to determine the number of blocks in each set.

Let's denote the number of blocks in the first set as x.

The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first one, so it has 3x blocks.

The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first one, so it has x/4 blocks.

Now, let's add up the blocks in each set to find the total number of blocks Johnny picks up:

x (first set) + 3x (second set) + x/4 (third set)

To add these, we need a common denominator, which is 4. 

We can rewrite the first two sets with a common denominator:

4x/4 (first set) + 12x/4 (second set) + x/4 (third set)

Now we can add them:

(4x + 12x + x)/4 = 17x/4

So, Johnny picks up {17x/4} blocks."

1. First, we know that the total cost of four pizzas is $64. 
2. We also know that the price of two of the pizzas was $30. 
3. So, the total cost of the two pizzas that we know the price is $30.
4. Now, we need to find the total cost of the remaining two pizzas. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas we know from the total cost: $64 - $30 = $34.

The cost of the first venue is $200 (flat fee) + $5.5x (food cost).

The cost of the second venue is $25.5x (per person).

To find the break-even point, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5.5x = 25.5x

Now, let's isolate 'x' by subtracting 5.5x from both sides:

256,The school has 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls. The first class has 15 girls. The second class has 12 girls. How many boys are in the third class?,"To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to determine the total number of students in the school and the number of girls in the third class.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of girls in the school.
The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. Let's assume the third class has x girls. The total number of girls is 15 + 12 + x.

Step 2: Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls is half of the total number of students. If we let the total number of students be S, then 15 + 12 + x = 0.5S.

Step 3: We know that the total number of students is the sum of the students in all three classes. However, we don't know the number of boys in the first two classes. Let's denote the number of boys in the first class as B1, the number of boys in the second class as B2, and the number of boys in the third class as B3.

Step 4: Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys is also half of the total number of students. Therefore, B1 + B2 + B3 = 0.5S.

Step 5: We need to find the number of boys in the third class (B3). To do this, we need to find the total number of students (S) and the number of girls in the third class (x).

Step 6: We can't find the total number of students (S) without knowing the number of boys in the first two classes. However, we can use the fact that the total number of students is the sum of the students in all three classes: S = B1 + B2 + B3 + 15 + 12 + x.

Step 7: Since we are looking for the number of boys in the third class, we can express B1 + B2 as a function of S, x, and B3.

Step 8:  We can express S in terms of x and B3. 

Step 9:  Since we know that the total number of girls is half of the total number of students, we can express x in terms of S: x = 0.5S - 27.

Step 10:  Now we have S = B1 + B2 + B3 + 27 + 0.5x, and x = 0.5S - 27.

Step 11:  We can substitute the expression for x into the equation for S: S = B1 + B2 + B3 + 27 + 0.5(0.5S - 27).

Step 12:  Simplify the equation: S = B1 + B2 + B3 + 27 + 0.25S - 13.5.

Step 13:  Combine like terms: S - 0.25S = B1 + B2 + B3 + 27 - 13.5.

Step 14:  Simplify the equation: 0.75S = B1 + B2 + B3 + 13.5.

Step 15:  Since B1 + B2 + B3 = 0.5S, we can substitute this expression into the equation: 0.75S = 0.5S + 13.5.

Step 16:  Subtract 0.5S from both sides: 0.25S = 13.5.

Step 17:  Divide both sides by 0.25: S = 54.

Step 18:  Now that we have the total number of students, we can find the number of girls in the third class: x = 0.5S - 27 = 0.5(54) - 27 = 27 - 27 = 0.

Step 19:  Since the third class has 0 girls, the number of boys in the third class is half of the total number of students in the third class, which is 0.5(54 - 27) = 0.5(27) = 13.5.

However, the number of students must be a whole number."

1. The kids are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. Since there are 20 kids, each group has 10 kids.
2. Let's assume the number of shells brought by the boys is 'x'. 
3. Since the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, the number of shells brought by the girls is 'x + 4x' or '5x'.
4. Since there are 10 girls, the number of shells brought by each girl is '5x / 10' or 'x / 2'.
5. We are not given the actual number of shells brought by the boys, but we are given that the girls and boys are equal in number. However, we are not given the number of shells brought by the boys, so we cannot find the actual number of shells brought by each girl. We can only express it in terms of 'x'.

   Total cost = 100 * $15
   Total cost = $1500

2. Calculate the amount James saved with the discount:
   Discount percentage = 40%
   Discount amount = Total cost * Discount percentage

How many inches heels does three of the women wear?,"To find the total height of heels for the three women, we need to use the concept of averages. The average height of heels is 3 inches, and there are 6 women in total.

Let's denote the total height of heels for the three women wearing 1-inch heels as x, and the total height of heels for the three women wearing 2-inch heels as y.

We know that the average height of heels is 3 inches, so we can set up the equation:

(x + y) / 6 = 3

To solve for x + y, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 6:

x + y = 18

Now, we know that the three women wearing 1-inch heels have a total height of x = 3 inches, and the three women wearing 2-inch heels have a total height of y = 6 inches.

Substituting these values into the equation x + y = 18, we get:

3 + 6 = 9

However, this is the total height of the three women wearing 2-inch heels. To find the total height of the three women wearing 1-inch heels, we need to subtract 6 from 18:

18 - 6 = 12

   So, the total cost of strawberry gum is 2 * $2 = $4.

2. She bought 1 pack of grape gum for $2.

3. She bought 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum.
   Since the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2 = $1.

4. To find the total cost, we add the cost of all the packs together:
   $4 (strawberry gum) + $2 (grape gum) + $1 (green apple gum) = $7.

So, Suzie paid {7} dollars in total."
1000,Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 plants of eggplant. How many fruits can Ricardo get from his plants?,"To find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

1. Calculate the total number of tomatoes:
   - Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
   - Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
   - Total number of tomatoes = 22 tomatoes/plant * 5 plants = 110 tomatoes.

2. Calculate the total number of eggplants:
   - Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
   - Since eggplants are also fruits, we assume each plant yields 1 eggplant (for simplicity, as the problem doesn't specify the yield).
   - Total number of eggplants = 8 eggplants.

3. Add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to get the total number of fruits:
   - Total number of fruits = 110 tomatoes + 8 eggplants = 118 fruits.

So, Ricardo can get {118} fruits from his plants."
1333,"Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. He has two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. The width of the bed is 2 feet longer than the length. If he used 160 square feet of fabrics, what is the length of the bed?","To find the length of the bed, let's break down the information given:

1. The bed is king-sized, but we don't know the exact dimensions. Let's assume the length of the bed is x feet.
2. The width of the bed is 2 feet longer than the length, so the width is (x + 2) feet.
3. The fabric pieces are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the length of the fabric is (x + 2 + 2) = (x + 4) feet, and the width of the fabric is (x + 2 + 2) = (x + 4) feet.
4. The total area of the fabric used is 160 square feet. Since there are two fabric pieces, each with the same dimensions, the total area is twice the area of one piece. So, 2 * (x + 4) * (x + 4) = 160.

Now, let's simplify the equation:

2 * (x + 4) * (x + 4) = 160
2 * (x^2 + 8x + 16) = 160
2x^2 + 16x + 32 = 160
2x^2 + 16x - 128 = 0

Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:

x^2 + 8x - 64 = 0

Now, let's factor the quadratic equation:

(x + 16)(x - 4) = 0

This gives us two possible values for x: -16 and 4. Since the length of the bed cannot be negative, the correct answer is:

{x = 4}"
258,John goes to the market and buys 30 goats for $5000 each and 20 cows for $15000 each. How much money did he spend?,"To find the total amount of money John spent, we need to calculate the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows separately and then add them together.

1. Calculate the cost of the goats:
   Number of goats = 30
   Price per goat = $5000
   Total cost of goats = Number of goats * Price per goat
   Total cost of goats = 30 * $5000
   Total cost of goats = $150,000

2. Calculate the cost of the cows:
   Number of cows = 20
   Price per cow = $15,000
   Total cost of cows = Number of cows * Price per cow
   Total cost of cows = 20 * $15,000
   Total cost of cows = $300,000

3. Add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:
   Total amount spent = Total cost of goats + Total cost of cows
   Total amount spent = $150,000 + $300,000
   Total amount spent = $450,000

783,"48 people are riding a bus.24 people are riding a bike. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?","To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus and 24 people on the bike. We are only concerned with the bus, so we'll ignore the bike.

2. At the first stop, 8 people get off the bus. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   48 - 8 = 40

3. Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off (8) get into the bus:
   5 * 8 = 40
   Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
   40 (left) + 40 (new) = 80

4. At the second stop, 21 people get off the bus. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   80 - 21 = 59

5. Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus compared to those who got off (21). 3 times fewer is 1/3 of 21:
   21 / 3 = 7
   Now, the total number of people on the bus is:
   59 (left) + 7 (new) = 66

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is {66}."
2325,"Last night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. Rick killed 73 animals in all, so how many cougars did he kill last night?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Yesterday, Rick killed 10 wolves and some cougars. Let's call the number of cougars killed yesterday 'c'. 

2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. If we let 'w' be the number of wolves killed today, then w = 3c (since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars).

3. Today, Rick also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. So, the number of cougars killed today is c - 3.

4. The total number of wolves killed is 10 (yesterday) + w (today). We know that w = 3c, so the total number of wolves killed is 10 + 3c.

5. The total number of cougars killed is c (yesterday) + (c - 3) (today).

6. The total number of animals killed is 73. So, the sum of the total number of wolves and cougars is 73: (10 + 3c) + (c + c - 3) = 73.

7. Simplifying the equation, we get 10 + 3c + 2c - 3 = 73, which simplifies to 5c + 7 = 73.

8. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get 5c = 66.

9. Dividing both sides by 5, we get c = 66 / 5 = 13.2. However, the number of cougars must be a whole number, so we need to re-evaluate the steps.

10. Let's re-evaluate the steps and correct the mistake. We have (10 + 3c) + (c - 3) = 73. Simplifying this, we get 7 +  + 4c = 73.

11. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 4c = 66.

12. Dividing both sides by 4, we get c = 66 / 4 = 16.5. However, we need to re-evaluate the steps as we still have a non-integer result.

13. We should re-check our equation. We know that w = 3c and c - 3 are the cougars killed today. So, the total number of cougars killed is c + (c - 3). The total number of wolves killed is 10 + 3c. We should use the correct equation for the total number of animals killed.

14. The correct equation is: (10 + 3c) + (c + c - 3) = 73.

15. Simplifying the equation, we get 10 + 3c + 2c - 3 = 73.

16. However, we should simplify the equation correctly. 2c + 3c is 5c. So, the correct equation is 10 + 5c - 3 = 73.

17. Simplifying the equation, we get 7 + 5c = 73.

18. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get 5c = 66.

19. However, we should re-evaluate the equation 5c = 66. We can check if 5c is indeed equal to 66.

20. If we divide 66 by 5, we get 13.2. However, we should re-check our steps.

21. Let's re-check our steps. We know that 5c = 66. However, we made a mistake in our previous steps.

22. Let's re-check the equation 7 + 5c = 73. We should subtract 7 from both sides of the equation.

25. If we divide 66 by 5, we get 13.2. However, we should re-check our steps.

26. Let's re-check our steps. We know that 5c = 66. However, we made a mistake in our previous steps.

27. The number of cougars killed today is c - 3, and the number of cougars killed yesterday is c.

27. The total number of cougars killed is c + (c - 3) = 2c - 3.

28. We know that the total number of wolves killed is 10 + 3c.

29. The total number of animals killed is 73, so the sum of the total number of wolves and cougars is 73: (10 + 3c) + (2c - 3) = 73.

30. Simplifying the equation, we get 10 + 3c + 2c - 3 = 73.

31. Simplifying the equation, we get 7 + 5c = 73.

32. Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get 5c = 66.

33. However, we should re-evaluate the equation 5c = 66. We can check if 5c is indeed equal to 66.

909,"Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. If Allen's age 10 years from now is 109, calculate their total age now.","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11. We can represent their current ages as 7x and 11x, where x is a constant.

2. Ten years from now, Allen's age will be 11x + 10. According to the problem, this is equal to 109.

   So, we can set up the equation: 
   11x + 10 = 109

3. Now, let's solve for x:
   11x = 109 - 10
   11x = 99
   x = 99 / 11
   x = 9

4. Now that we know x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:
   Darrell's age: 7x = 7 * 9 = 63
   Allen's age: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99

5. To find their total age, we add their current ages:
   Total age = Darrell's age + Allen's age = 63 + 99 = 162

So, the total age of Darrell and Allen now is {162}."
978,"A DVD can be played 10000 times before it breaks. There are two DVDs in the public library, one has been played 3560 times and the other has been played 1350 times. How many total times can both DVDs be played before they break?","To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate how many times each DVD has left to be played and then add those numbers together.

1. The first DVD has been played 3560 times and can be played 10000 times before it breaks. So, it has 10000 - 3560 = 7440 times left to be played.

2. The second DVD has been played 1350 times and can be played 10000 times before it breaks. So, it has 10000 - 1350 = 8650 times left to be played.

3. Now, we add the remaining times for both DVDs: 7440 + 8650 = 16090.

Therefore, both DVDs can be played a total of {16090} times before they break."
584,"Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. How many vacuum cleaners did she start with?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's say Melanie started with x vacuum cleaners.

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.
   The remaining vacuum cleaners are: x - x/3 = (3x - x)/3 = 2x/3.

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. Now, she has: 2x/3 - 2.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Half of what was left is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x - 4)/6.
   The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is: x/3 + 2 + (2x - 4)/6.

Now, we need to set up an equation. Since Melanie sold all the vacuum cleaners, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold should be equal to the initial number of vacuum cleaners:
x/3 + 2 + (2x - 4)/6 = x

To simplify the equation, we need to find a common denominator, which is 6:
(2x)/6 + 12/6 + (2x - 4)/6 = x
(2x + 12 + 2x - 4)/6 = x
(4x + 8)/6 = x

Now, multiply both sides by 6 to get rid of the denominator:
4x + 8 = 6x

Subtract 4x from both sides:
8 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:
4 = x

So, Melanie started with {4} vacuum cleaners."

3. Students under 16: The remaining half of the students are under 16, so students under 16 = 30000 / 2 = 15000
4. Male students over 16: One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so male students over 16 = 15000 / 4 = 3750
5. Female students over 16: Since there are 15000 students over 16, and 3750 of them are male, the number of female students over 16 = 15000 - 3750 = 11250
6. Male students under 16: One-half of the students under 16 are male, so male students under 16 = 15000 / 2 = 7500
7. Female students under 16: Since there are 15000 students under 16, and 7500 of them are male, the number of female students under 16 = 15000 - 7500 = 7500

If the total number of apples picked by both sisters is 500, how many apples did Joanne pick from the medium-height trees?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne picks 30 apples from the highest trees.
   Her sister picks twice the number of apples from the highest trees, so her sister picks 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the highest trees.

2. Joanne picks half of 30 apples (which is 15) from the lowest trees.
   Her sister picks thrice the number of apples from the lowest trees that Joanne did, so her sister picks 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the lowest trees.

3. The total number of apples picked by both sisters from the highest and lowest trees is:
   Joanne's apples: 30 (highest) + 15 (lowest) = 45
   Her sister's apples: 60 (highest) + 45 (lowest) = 105

Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.,"To find the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ali has 10 $10 bills and 12 $20 bills. 
   The total amount of money from $10 bills is 10 * 10 = $100.
   The total amount of money from $20 bills is 12 * 20 = $240.
   The total amount of money Ali has is $100 + $240 = $340.

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is 1/2 * $340 = $170.
   So, the amount of money Ali has left after giving his sister half is $340 - $170 = $170.

3. Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. 
   The amount of money used for dinner is 3/5 * $170 = $102.

2. Ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each pack:
   10 packs * $0.30 each = $3

3. Five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each can:
   5 cans * $2 each = $10

The total cost of Carly's order is:
$20 (hamburgers) + $3 (fries) + $10 (fruit drinks) = $33

She decides not to buy the toy ($2) and the dessert ($3), so we don't add those to the total cost.

Now, Carly hands over a $50 bill to the cashier. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill:

If there are 12 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?","To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to determine the maximum cost per class.

The total cost of the classes is $80. There are 12 classes in total. 

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as x. Then, the number of classes he will attend is 12 - x.

The cost per class can be represented as the total cost divided by the number of classes attended. 

The cost per class = Total cost / Number of classes attended

According to the problem, the cost per class should not exceed $20. 

80 / (12 - x) ≤ 20

Now, let's solve for x.

80 ≤ 20(12 - x)
80 ≤ 240 - 20x
20x ≤ 240 - 80

But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If Polly is standing 200 feet away from the reach of the dragon's flames where she can just hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the gemstone, so how many feet can a dragon breathe fire?","To find the distance the dragon can breathe fire, we need to determine the total distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 400 = 1200 feet with the gemstone.

Since Polly is standing 200 feet away from the reach of the dragon's flames and can just hit the dragon with the javelin while holding the gemstone, we need to add the distance she is standing away to the distance she can throw the javelin to find the total distance the dragon can breathe fire.

Total distance = Distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone + Distance Polly is standing away from the dragon's flames
Total distance = 1200 + 200

   - Pasta: $13.50
   Total cost = $42.00 + $94.50 + $13.50 = $150.00

2. Subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

1193,Jame will turn 30 in 7 years.  In 9 years his cousin will be 6 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age of the two now?,"To find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin, let's break down the information given:

1. Jame will turn 30 in 7 years. This means Jame's current age is 30 - 7 = 23 years.

2. In 9 years, his cousin will be 6 years younger than twice Jame's age in 9 years. Let's represent Jame's age in 9 years as 'J' and his cousin's age in 9 years as 'C'.

   We know that Jame's age in 9 years will be 23 + 9 = 32 years.
   We are given that C = 2J - 6.

3. We also know that C = 2J - 6, and J = 32. 
   Therefore, C = 2(32) - 6 = 64 - 6 = 58 years.

4. Since Jame's age in 9 years is 32 and his cousin's age in 9 years is 58, the age difference between them in 9 years is 58 - 32 = 26 years.

5. Now, we need to find the age difference between Jame and his cousin now. Since Jame is currently 23 and his cousin will be 26 in 9 years, we can find his current age by subtracting 9 from 26. Therefore, his cousin's current age is 26 - 9 = 17 years.

6. The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 23 - 17 = 6 years.

So, the age difference between Jame and his cousin now is {6}."
512,"Jenna has several roommates. Each month the electricity bill is $100. How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally?","To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total cost of electricity per year: 
   There are 12 months in a year, and the electricity bill is $100 per month. 
   So, the total cost of electricity per year is $100 * 12 = $1200.

2. Divide the total cost by the number of roommates:
   However, we don't know how many roommates Jenna has. To give a general answer, we'll represent the number of roommates as 'n'. 
   The cost per roommate per year will be $1200 / n.

   Since we don't know the exact number of roommates, we can't give a specific numerical answer. But we can represent it mathematically.

   If we assume that Jenna has 4 roommates, the cost per roommate per year would be $1200 / 4 = $300."

In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells. The boys went out for the search and brought back 60 shells each. If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?","To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, let's break down the information step by step.

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 girls and 10 boys.

2. The boys went out for the scavenger hunt and brought back 60 shells each. Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 10 x 60 = 600 shells.

3. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus 4.5 times as many seashells as the boys. This can be expressed as:
   Number of shells brought by girls = Number of shells brought by boys + (4.5 x Number of shells brought by boys)
   Number of shells brought by girls = 600 + (4.5 x 600)

4. To find the number of shells brought by girls, we need to calculate 4.5 x 600:
   4.5 x 600 = 2700

5. Now, we can find the total number of shells brought by girls:
   Number of shells brought by girls = 600 + 2700
   Number of shells brought by girls = 3300

6. Since there are 10 girls, the number of shells brought by each girl is:
   Number of shells brought by each girl = Total number of shells brought by girls / Number of girls
   Number of shells brought by each girl = 3300 / 10
   Number of shells brought by each girl = 330

She paid $2.6 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7.5 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?","To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, let's break down the information given:

1. Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
2. She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
3. She paid $2.6 for a pack of grape gum.
4. She paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum as she did for the grape gum.
5. The total cost of all 4 packs was $7.5.

First, let's find the cost of the green apple gum. Since it's half the cost of the grape gum, the green apple gum costs $2.6 / 2 = $1.3.

Now, we know the total cost of the 4 packs is $7.5. We also know the cost of the grape gum ($2.6) and the green apple gum ($1.3). Let's subtract these costs from the total to find the cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum:

$7.5 (total) - $2.6 (grape) - $1.3 (green apple) = $3.6

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by 2:

$3.6 / 2 = $1.8

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $1.8.

2214,"Stephen took a loan of $300 from his sibling and agreed to repay it with an extra 2% interest on the total amount owed. For a period of 11 months, Stephen will repay his sibling $25 each month and the outstanding balance, inclusive of the interest, will be settled on the final, twelfth month. What is the amount that Stephen will need to pay on the twelfth month?","To find the amount Stephen will need to pay on the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total interest and the total amount owed.

1. Calculate the monthly interest:
   The monthly interest is 2% of the total amount owed. Since Stephen will repay $25 each month, the remaining balance after each month will be less than the previous month. We can calculate the monthly interest as follows:

   Let's assume the remaining balance after 11 months is x.
   The total amount owed after 11 months is x + 11*25.
   The total interest is 2% of (x + 11*25).

2. Calculate the total interest:
   We can set up the equation for the total interest as follows:

   Total interest = 2% of (x + 11*25)
   Total interest = 0.02(x + 11*25)

3. Calculate the remaining balance after 11 months:
   Since Stephen will repay $25 each month, the remaining balance after 11 months can be calculated as follows:

   x = 300 - 11*25
   x = 300 - 275
   x = 25

4. Calculate the total interest:
   Now that we have the remaining balance after 11 months, we can calculate the total interest as follows:

   Total interest = 0.02(x + 11*25)
   Total interest = 0.02(25 + 11*25)
   Total interest = 0.02(25 + 275)
   Total interest = 0.02(300)
   Total interest = 6

5. Calculate the total amount owed:
   The total amount owed is the sum of the remaining balance after 11 months and the total interest.

   Total amount owed = x + Total interest
Total amount owed = 25 + 6
Total amount owed = 31

However, this is the interest on the principal, not the principal itself. We need to add the interest to the principal, and then add the monthly payments. We can do this by adding the monthly payments to the principal, and then adding the interest to that result.

The total amount owed is the sum of the principal, the monthly payments, and the interest.

Total amount owed = Principal + (Monthly payments * Number of months) + Interest
Total amount owed = 300 + (25 * 11) + 6
Total amount owed = 300 + 275 + 6
Total amount owed = 581

Therefore, the amount that Stephen will need to pay on the twelfth month is {581}."
833,"Three friends ordered three pizzas for a total of 45 dollars. If one of the pizzas cost 20 dollars, how much did each of the other two pizzas cost if they cost the same amount?","To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we need to follow these steps:

1. We know that one pizza cost $20.
2. The total cost of all three pizzas is $45.
3. To find the total cost of the other two pizzas, we subtract the cost of the first pizza from the total cost: $45 - $20 = $25.
4. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of the other two pizzas by 2: $25 ÷ 2 = $12.50.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $12.50.

If the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, how many seashells were brought by each girl?","To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of boys and girls:
   Since the two groups are equal, each group has 200 / 2 = 100 kids.

2. Calculate the number of seashells brought by the boys:
   Each boy brought 600 shells, so the total number of shells brought by the boys is 100 * 600 = 60,000.

3. Calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls:
   The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. 
   This means the girls brought 60,000 (shells brought by boys) + 4 * 60,000 (four times the number of shells brought by boys) = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000 shells.

4. Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:

How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?","To find out how much money Jenny saved, we need to calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually and compare it to the cost of buying them in bunches.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought. Since she bought 10 bunches and each bunch averages 4 bananas, the total number of bananas is:
   10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

2. Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost is:
   40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

3. Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny bought 10 bunches for $2.50 each, so the total cost is:
   10 bunches * $2.50/bunch = $25.00

4. Finally, let's calculate the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually:
   $32.00 (individual cost) - $25.00 (bunch cost) = $7.00

1. First, let's find the cost of a half-gallon jar:
   Since a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, 
   the cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3.

2. Now, let's find the cost of a gallon can of yogurt:
   Since a gallon can of yogurt costs $4 more than a half-gallon can, 
   we need to know the cost of a half-gallon can of yogurt to calculate this. 
   However, the cost of a half-gallon can of yogurt is not provided, 
   so we will assume that the cost of a half-gallon can of yogurt is 'x'.

How many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so her sister gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
3. Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees as from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
4. Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
5. Since her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, the total number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 15 = 45. Her sister gathers 60 + 45 = 105 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

First, let's assume that 1 cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, and we need to find the protein content in this cup. However, the protein content in mushrooms is not provided. 

Let's denote the protein content in 1 cup of mushrooms as P grams. 

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day. Since 1 cup weighs 100 grams, he eats 2 cups of mushrooms per day (200/100 = 2).

In 1 cup of mushrooms, the protein content is P grams. So, in 2 cups, the protein content is 2P grams.

Now, let's calculate the protein content per week. There are 7 days in a week. 

The daily protein content is 2P grams, and the weekly protein content is 7 * 2P = 14P grams.

If the beanstalk starts out several feet tall, how many days will it take to be taller than Mark's window?","To find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to determine the height of the beanstalk each day.

Let's denote the initial height of the beanstalk as 'x'. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, we can express its height on the nth day as 2^(n-1) * x, where n is the number of days.

Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, so we want to find the smallest value of n such that 2^(n-1) * x > 20.

Since the beanstalk starts out several feet tall, we can assume that x > 0. However, to find the minimum number of days, we can consider the smallest possible value of x, which is 1 foot.

Now, we need to find the smallest value of n such that 2^(n-1) * 1 > 20.

We can test different values of n:

- n = 1: 2^(1-1) * 1 = 1 (less than 20)
- n = 2: 2^(2-1) * 1 = 2 (less than 20)
- n = 3: 2^(3-1) * 1 = 4 (less than 20)
- n = 4: 2^(4-1) * 1 = 8 (less than 20)
- n = 5: 2^(5-1) * 1 = 16 (less than 20)
- n = 6: 2^(6-1) * 1 = 32 (greater than 20)

Therefore, it will take 6 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

If Kelly was right, 40 people really attended the concert. What was the audience size according to Courtney?","To find the audience size according to Courtney, we first need to determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, which is 40. 

Kelly said that Courtney overstated the number of people in attendance by 20%. This means that the number of people according to Courtney is 20% more than the actual number of people.

Let's call the actual number of people 'x'. Since 40 is the actual number of people, x = 40.

We are told that Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%. This can be expressed as:
x + (20% of x) = Courtney's number

To find 20% of x, we multiply x by 0.20 (since 20% = 20/100 = 0.20).
20% of x = 0.20x

Now, we substitute the value of x into the equation:
40 + 0.20(40) = Courtney's number

First, we calculate 0.20(40):
0.20(40) = 8

Now, we add 8 to 40:

The cost for the second venue is $250 per guest, and food is already included, so the total cost for the second venue is $250x.

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the two equations equal to each other:

   25% of $2,000.50 = 0.25 * $2,000.50 = $500.13

2. Since we want to know how many shoes she can buy in a year, we need to calculate her yearly savings for shoes.
   Jessica's monthly savings for shoes = $500.13
   Jessica's yearly savings for shoes = $500.13 * 12 = $6,001.56

3. Now, we need to divide her yearly savings by the cost of each pair of shoes to find out how many pairs she can buy.
   Cost of each pair of shoes = $1,000.25
   Number of shoes she can buy in a year = $6,001.56 / $1,000.25 = 6

So, Jessica can buy {6} pairs of shoes in a year."
368,"The combined age of Peter, Paul and Jean is 100 years old. Find the age of Peter knowing that Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.","Let's denote Peter's age as P, Paul's age as p, and Jean's age as j.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. This can be written as:

P + p + j = 100

We are also given that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:

P = p + j

Now, let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(p + j) + p + j = 100

Combine like terms:

2p + 2j = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

p + j = 50

Now, we can substitute this expression into the second equation:

P = 50

So, the age of Peter is 50.

534,"During a tennis match, Rory is tasked with collecting the tennis balls from the court. The number of balls he collected in the first set exceeded the number in the second set by four. In the third set, he only collected half the number of balls as he did in the second set. The total number of balls he collected from all three sets is 19. Can you determine how many tennis balls Rory collected in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of balls collected in the first set as x, in the second set as y, and in the third set as z.

From the given information, we have the following equations:

1. x = y + 4 (the number of balls in the first set exceeded the number in the second set by four)
2. z = y/2 (in the third set, he only collected half the number of balls as he did in the second set)
3. x + y + z = 19 (the total number of balls he collected from all three sets is 19)

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 3 to get:
(y + 4) + y + (y/2) = 19

Combine like terms:
(3y + 4) + (y/2) = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
6y + 8 + y = 38

Combine like terms:
7y + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:
7y = 30

Divide both sides by 7:
y = 30/7
y = 4.29 (approximately)

Since y must be a whole number (you can't collect a fraction of a ball), this is a problem. However, we can try to find the nearest whole number that satisfies the equation.

Let's try y = 4:
7y = 7(4) = 28
7y + 8 = 28 + 8 = 36 (not equal to 38)

Let's try y = 5:
7y = 7(5) = 35
7y + 8 = 35 + 8 = 43 (not equal to 38)

Let's try y = 4.29 (the approximate value we found earlier):
7y = 7(4.29) = 29.93
7y + 8 = 29.93 + 8 = 37.93 (not equal to 38)

However, if we try y = 4.286 (a more precise value):
7y = 7(4.286) = 29.902
7y + 8 = 29.902 + 8 = 37.902 (not equal to 38)

y = 4
x = y + 4
x = 4 + 4
x = 8

Now, let's check if this solution satisfies the equation x + y + z = 19:
x + y + z = 8 + 4 + (4/2)
x + y + z = 8 + 4 + 2
x + y + z = 14 (not equal to 19)

Let's try y = 5:
x = y + 4
x = 5 + 4
x = 9

Now, let's check if this solution satisfies the equation x + y + z = 19:
x + y + z = 9 + 5 + (5/2)
x + y + z = 9 + 5 + 2.5
x + y + z = 16.5 (not equal to 19)

Let's try y = 4.286 (a more precise value):
x = y + 4
x = 4.286 + 4
x = 8.286

Now, let's check if this solution satisfies the equation x + y + z = 19:
x + y + z = 8.286 + 4.286 + (4.286/2)
x + y + z = 8.286 + 4.286 + 2.143

613,Rose went to the store on Monday and bought some cakes. Tuesday she went to a different store and bought three times that number of cakes. On Wednesday she went to another store and bought 5 times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday.She buys 76 cakes in total after all three days. How many cakes does she buy on Monday?,"Let's denote the number of cakes Rose bought on Monday as 'x'. 

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3x. 

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 * 3x = 15x.

The total number of cakes she bought over the three days is the sum of the cakes bought each day: x + 3x + 15x = 19x.

We are given that the total number of cakes she bought is 76. So, we can set up the equation:

19x = 76

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 19:

x = 76 / 19
x = 4

So, Rose bought {4} cakes on Monday."

1. Initially, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles. So, the amount of water on the second day is:
   2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons

3. On the same day, a nearby lake also doubles its water level, but this does not affect the river's water flow. This information is irrelevant to the problem.

Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has and uses 2/3 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. Calculate the amount of money he has after buying the dinner.,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ali has three $50 bills and five $10 bills:
   - Three $50 bills = 3 * $50 = $150
   - Five $10 bills = 5 * $10 = $50
   - Total money = $150 + $50 = $200

2. Ali gives his sister half of the total money:
   - Half of $200 = $200 / 2 = $100
   - Remaining money = $200 - $100 = $100

3. Ali uses 2/3 of the remaining money to buy dinner:
   - 2/3 of $100 = (2/3) * $100 = $66.67
   - Money remaining after buying dinner = $100 - $66.67 = $33.33

So, Ali has { $33.33 } after buying dinner."

On the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, including the interest, and also plans to buy a coin worth $100. How much will Stephen pay his sister in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases?","To find out how much Stephen will pay his sister in the twelfth month, we need to calculate the total amount he paid her in the first 11 months and subtract the total amount he spent on his hobby.

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen paid his sister in the first 11 months:
   Stephen paid $25 per month for 11 months, so the total amount is:
   $25 * 11 = $275

2. Calculate the total amount Stephen spent on his hobby in the first 11 months:
   Stephen spent $50 per month on his hobby for 11 months, so the total amount is:
   $50 * 11 = $550

3. Calculate the remaining amount Stephen owes his sister after paying $275 in the first 11 months:
   Stephen initially borrowed $300, so the remaining amount is:
   $300 - $275 = $25

4. Calculate the interest Stephen owes his sister:
   Stephen promised to return the borrowed amount with an additional 2% interest. 
   2% of $300 is (2/100) * $300 = $6.
   So, the interest is $6.

5. Calculate the total amount Stephen owes his sister in the twelfth month:
   The remaining amount after the first 11 months is $25, and the interest is $6, so the total amount is:
   $25 + $6 = $31

Therefore, Stephen will pay his sister $31 in the twelfth month, excluding his coin purchases.

If 0.9 times of ten kids want 2 smores apiece and 3/5 of ten adults will eat 1 smore apiece, how many boxes of graham crackers will they need?","To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, we need to calculate the total number of smores required.

First, let's find out how many kids want smores. 0.9 times ten kids is 0.9 * 10 = 9 kids. Since each kid wants 2 smores, the total number of smores for kids is 9 * 2 = 18.

Next, let's find out how many adults will eat smores. 3/5 of ten adults is (3/5) * 10 = 6 adults. Since each adult wants 1 smore, the total number of smores for adults is 6 * 1 = 6.

Now, we need to find the total number of smores required. This is the sum of smores for kids and adults, which is 18 + 6 = 24.

Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores, we need to divide the total number of smores by 8 to find out how many sleeves are needed. 24 / 8 = 3.

Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need 3 boxes of graham crackers.

2149,"If Sam and Harry have some feet of fence between them, and they agree to split it with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam, and 20 feet is left over for Sam. How many feet of fence are there between Sam and Harry?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's assume the number of feet of fence Sam gets is x. 
2. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, the number of feet of fence Harry gets is x + 60.
3. The total number of feet of fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get, plus the 20 feet left over for Sam. So, the total number of feet of fence is x + (x + 60) + 20.
4. We can simplify the equation: x + (x + 60) + 20 = 2x + 80.
5. Since the total number of feet of fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get, plus the 20 feet left over for Sam, we can set up the equation: 2x + 80 = total feet of fence.

However, we don't know the total number of feet of fence. We can still solve for x, and then find the total number of feet of fence.

6. We are told that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, and 20 feet is left over for Sam. This means that the total number of feet of fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get, plus the 20 feet left over for Sam. Let's assume the total number of feet of fence is y.

7. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, and 20 feet is left over for Sam, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) + 20 = y.

8. We can simplify the equation: 2x + 80 = y.

9. We are told that the total number of feet of fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get, plus the 20 feet left over for Sam. Let's assume that Sam gets x feet of fence, and Harry gets x + 60 feet of fence.

10. The total number of feet of fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get, plus the 20 feet left over for Sam. So, the total number of feet of fence is x + (x + 60) + 20.

11. We can simplify the equation: x + (x + 60) + 20 = 2x + 80.

12. We can also write an equation for the total number of feet of fence: y = x + (x + 60) + 20.

13. We can simplify the equation: y = 2x + 80.

14. Since we are told that 20 feet is left over for Sam, we can write an equation: x = 20.

15. Now we can substitute x = 20 into the equation y = 2x + 80.

16. We get: y = 2(20) + 80.

17. We can simplify the equation: y = 40 + 80.

18. We get: y = 120.

So, the total number of feet of fence is 120.

1. There are 30 helmets.
2. There are half as many robots as helmets, so the number of robots is 30 / 2 = 15.
3. There are half as many helmets as footballs, so the number of footballs is 30 * 2 = 60.
4. Now, let's add up the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: 15 (robots) + 30 (helmets) + 60 (footballs) = 105.

2138,Frederick is making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $120 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $10. A 2 x 8 costs $12. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of lumber gives him the most sticks per dollar.

Let's calculate the cost per stick for each type of lumber:

1. For a 2 x 4, he can get 200 sticks. The cost of a 2 x 4 is $10.
   Cost per stick = $10 / 200 sticks = $0.05 per stick

2. For a 2 x 8, he can get 400 sticks. The cost of a 2 x 8 is $12.
   Cost per stick = $12 / 400 sticks = $0.03 per stick

Since the 2 x 8 costs less per stick, it is the cheapest lumber for Frederick to buy.

Now, let's calculate how many sticks he can buy with his $120:

Number of 2 x 8s he can buy = $120 / $12 = 10
Number of sticks from 10 2 x 8s = 10 * 400 = 4000 sticks

Therefore, {4000}."
965,Rong has been saving some coins in his piggy bank every month. Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. They have 5760 coins in total in ten years after they started their savings. How much money does Rong save  in his piggy bank every month?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of coins Rong saves per month as x.
2. Since Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, Neil saves (2/5)x + x = (7/5)x coins per month.
3. They both save for 10 years, which is 120 months.
4. In 10 years, Rong will save 120x coins, and Neil will save 120 * (7/5)x = 168x coins.
5. The total number of coins they have is 5760, so we can set up the equation: 120x + 168x = 5760.
6. Combining like terms, we get 288x = 5760.
7. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 288: x = 5760 / 288 = 20.

So, Rong saves {20} coins in his piggy bank every month."
882,Henry made two stops during his 100-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?,"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to determine the distance between the two stops.

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. 

The total distance of the trip is 100 miles. If the second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, then the distance from the start of the trip to the second stop is 100 - 15 = 85 miles.

Since Henry's first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was after 85 miles, the distance between the first and second stops is 85 - 20 = 65 miles.

1718,"Elvis sets a goal to save $1125 each month. For the month of April, he plans to save double the amount each day in the latter half of the month compared to the first half to reach his goal. What is the daily saving amount he needs to set aside during the second half of the month?","To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. First, let's determine the total number of days in April. April has 30 days.

2. Since Elvis wants to save double the amount each day in the latter half of the month compared to the first half, we need to divide the month into two halves. 
   - The first half of the month will be from April 1 to April 15 (15 days).
   - The second half of the month will be from April 16 to April 30 (15 days).

3. Now, let's assume Elvis saves 'x' dollars each day in the first half of the month. Since he needs to save double the amount in the second half, he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half.

4. Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April. Since he is saving money for 30 days, we can set up the equation:
   - 15x + 15(2x) = 1125

5. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   - 15x + 30x = 1125
   - 45x = 1125

6. Now, let's solve for x:
   - x = 1125 / 45
   - x = 25

7. Since Elvis saves double the amount in the second half, the daily saving amount he needs to set aside during the second half of the month is 2x = 2(25) = {50}."

1. Let's assume the price of Juice Box A is x dollars.
2. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so the price of Juice Box B is x + 5 dollars.
3. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so the price of Juice Box C is x + 7 dollars.
4. Now, we need to find the difference between the price of Juice Box C and Juice Box B. This can be calculated as (x + 7) - (x + 5).
5. Simplifying the expression, we get x + 7 - x - 5 = 2.

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, what's the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal if the container also weighs 20 pounds?","Let's break down the information step by step:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. The pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad. So, the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each.

3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake. So, the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird. So, the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, we have the weights of all the animals:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds

The total weight of the animals is: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds.

1464,"Of the available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic?","To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the total number of cars available for rent. 

1. We know that there are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars. 
2. Let's add these two numbers together to get the total number of automatic and manual cars: 12 + 4 = 16.
3. Since we are not given the total number of cars, let's assume the total number of cars is x.
4. The number of semi-automatic cars is the difference between the total number of cars (x) and the number of automatic and manual cars (16). So, the number of semi-automatic cars is x - 16.
5. To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars (x - 16) by the total number of cars (x) and multiply by 100.

However, since we don't know the total number of cars (x), we can't find the exact percentage. But we can express it as a formula: 

((x - 16) / x) * 100

To find the percentage, we need to know the total number of cars (x).

But if we assume the total number of cars is 16 (which is not possible since there are 16 automatic and manual cars), then the number of semi-automatic cars would be 0.

In that case, the percentage of semi-automatic cars would be: 

((0) / 16) * 100 = 0%

However, this is not possible since there are cars other than automatic and manual. 

So, we need to know the total number of cars to find the exact percentage.

But if we consider the context of the problem, it seems like the problem is asking for a percentage of the total cars given that there are 16 cars that are either automatic or manual. If that is the case, then the total number of cars is the sum of the number of automatic, manual, and semi-automatic cars, which is 16 + x.

However, since we don't know the total number of cars, we can express the percentage of semi-automatic cars as a formula: 

((x) / (16 + x)) * 100

But this is still not a specific answer.

If they were able to sell a total of 60 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?","To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we first need to find the total proportion of smart TVs and analog TVs sold.

One-third of the sales are smart TVs, which is 1/3. 
One-sixth of the sales are analog TVs, which is 1/6.

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case. 

1/3 = 2/6 (multiply numerator and denominator by 2)
1/6 = 1/6 (no change)

Now we can add the fractions:
2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6

So, 3/6 of the sales are smart TVs and analog TVs combined. 
The rest of the sales are OLED TVs, which is 1 - 3/6 = 3/6.

Now, we know that the total number of TVs sold is 60. 
To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we can multiply the total number of TVs by the proportion of OLED TVs:

2. On weekdays, he also drinks 2 glasses of water before going to bed. So, the total glasses of water he drinks on a weekday is 6 (with meals) + 2 (before bed) = 8 glasses.

3. Since there are 5 weekdays, the total glasses of water he drinks on weekdays is 8 * 5 = 40 glasses.

4. On weekends, John drinks 2 glasses of water with each meal (breakfast and lunch), but not with dinner (he has a soda instead). So, he drinks 2 * 2 = 4 glasses of water on each weekend day.

5. Since there are 2 weekend days, the total glasses of water he drinks on weekends is 4 * 2 = 8 glasses.

6. The total glasses of water John drinks in a week is the sum of the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends: 40 (weekdays) + 8 (weekends) = 48 glasses.

In the month of May, they brought on board 40 workers, each receiving an hourly wage of $15 for a 40-hour work week. When June arrived, the contracts of a quarter of these workers came to an end. Determine the cumulative sum of money the company disbursed to its workers over these two months.","To determine the cumulative sum of money the company disbursed to its workers over these two months, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of workers in May:
   - The company brought on board 40 workers in May.

2. Calculate the total number of workers in June:
   - A quarter of the workers from May left, so we need to find a quarter of 40.
   - A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10 workers.
   - Therefore, 40 - 10 = 30 workers remained in June.

3. Calculate the total number of workers for both months:
   - May: 40 workers
   - June: 30 workers
   - Total workers = 40 + 30 = 70 workers

4. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the workers in May:
   - Each worker worked 40 hours per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in May.
   - Total hours worked by each worker in May = 40 * 4 = 160 hours.
   - Total hours worked by all workers in May = 160 * 40 = 6400 hours.

5. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the workers in June:
   - Each worker worked 40 hours per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in June.
   - Total hours worked by each worker in June = 40 * 4 = 160 hours.
   - Total hours worked by all workers in June = 160 * 30 = 4800 hours.

6. Calculate the total amount of money disbursed to workers in May:
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total hours worked in May: 6400
   - Total amount disbursed in May = 6400 * 15 = $96,000

7. Calculate the total amount of money disbursed to workers in June:
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Total hours worked in June: 4800
   - Total amount disbursed in June = 4800 * 15 = $72,000

8. Calculate the cumulative sum of money disbursed to workers over both months:
   - Total amount in May: $96,000
   - Total amount in June: $72,000
   - Cumulative sum = $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000

Therefore, the cumulative sum of money the company disbursed to its workers over these two months is: {168,000}"
780,"48 people are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. On the second stop 21, passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. How many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop?","To find the number of passengers after the second stop, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. 
   So, the number of passengers left on the bus is 48 - 8 = 40.
3. 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. 
   This means 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.
   So, the total number of passengers now is 40 (left on the bus) + 40 (got on the bus) = 80.
4. However, before the bus departs, 2 people who just got on decide to get off again. 
   So, the number of passengers left on the bus is 80 - 2 = 78.
5. Now, let's move to the second stop. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off.
   So, the number of passengers left on the bus is 78 - 21 = 57.
6. 3 times fewer passengers get on. 
   This means 1/3 the number of passengers who got off (21) get on the bus. 
   This is 21 / 3 = 7 people.
   So, the total number of passengers now is 57 (left on the bus) + 7 (got on the bus) = 64.

The number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is {64}."

He also planted 2 cucumber plants, which yielded 6 cucumbers each. How many fruits can Ricardo get from his plants?","To find the total number of fruits, we need to calculate the yield from each type of plant and then add them together.

1. Tomatoes: 
   - Each plant yields 22 tomatoes.
   - Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.
   - Total tomatoes = 22 * 5 = 110

2. Eggplants: 
   - Each plant yields 4 eggplants.
   - Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.
   - Total eggplants = 4 * 8 = 32

3. Cucumbers: 
   - Each plant yields 6 cucumbers.
   - Ricardo planted 2 cucumber plants.
   - Total cucumbers = 6 * 2 = 12

Now, we add the total yield from each type of plant:
Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants + Total cucumbers
Total fruits = 110 + 32 + 12
Total fruits = 154

If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many oranges each person can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 2.5 minutes peeling an orange. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can calculate Ana's rate as follows:

60 minutes/hour / 2.5 minutes/orange = 24 oranges/hour

Jane spends 7.5 minutes peeling an orange. We can calculate Jane's rate as follows:

60 minutes/hour / 7.5 minutes/orange = 8 oranges/hour

Now, we can calculate how many more oranges Ana will peel than Jane in an hour by subtracting Jane's rate from Ana's rate:

24 oranges/hour - 8 oranges/hour = 16 oranges

So, Ana will peel {16} more oranges than Jane after an hour."
1111,"In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Melanie also has a 3-year-old dog. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?","To find out Melanie's current age, we need to subtract 10 from her age in 10 years. 

Melanie's age in 10 years: 18
Melanie's current age: 18 - 10 = 8

Since Melanie's dog is 3 years old, we can ignore the dog's age for this problem.

Now, we need to find out when Melanie's age will be thrice her current age. 

Melanie's current age: 8
Three times Melanie's current age: 8 * 3 = 24

We need to find the number of years it will take for Melanie to reach 24 years old. 

Melanie's current age: 8
Age in x years: 8 + x
Age in x years: 24

Now, we can set up an equation and solve for x:

x = 24 - 8
x = 16

So, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age in {16} years."
480,"Samwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. How many OLED TVs were they able to sell?","To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to first find out the total percentage of sales that are not OLED TVs.

Smart TVs make up one-fourth of the sales, which is 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.
Analog TVs make up one-eighth of the sales, which is 1/8 = 0.125 or 12.5%.

So, the total percentage of sales that are not OLED TVs is 25% + 12.5% = 37.5%.

Since the rest of the sales are OLED TVs, the percentage of OLED TVs is 100% - 37.5% = 62.5%.

Now, let's say the total sales for the week are 100 units (we can use any number as the actual total sales are not given). 

The number of OLED TVs sold would be 62.5% of 100 units, which is 0.625 * 100 = {62.5} units."
904,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To find the total number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of each item and then find the total weight of all items combined. 

1. Calculate the total weight of sugar cubes:
   2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds

2. Calculate the total weight of carrots:
   4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

3. Calculate the total weight of hay:
   42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds

4. Calculate the total weight of oats:
   20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

5. Calculate the total weight of all items combined:
   2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 3400 pounds

6. Since the farmer is transporting the feed in a stable, we can assume that he has a truck or a vehicle with a certain capacity. For simplicity, let's assume the capacity of the vehicle is 2000 pounds (this can be adjusted based on the actual capacity of the vehicle).

7. To find the total number of trips, divide the total weight of all items combined by the capacity of the vehicle:
   3400 pounds / 2000 pounds = 1.7 trips

Since the farmer cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

1524,"A farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow. Since he has 3 cows and he buys 1 cow, how many more cows does he need to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day?","To find out how many cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk the farmer currently produces.

The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from each cow and he has 3 cows. So, the total amount of milk he currently produces is:
5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters/day

Since the farmer buys 1 cow, he now has 4 cows. The total amount of milk he now produces is:
5 liters/cow * 4 cows = 20 liters/day

The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how many more cows he needs, we subtract the current amount of milk from the desired amount:
25 liters - 20 liters = 5 liters

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 1 more cow to produce 5 more liters of milk a day.

699,Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24.6 liters of water. Then a boy got 6.5 liters of water. How many liters of water were left?,"To find out how many liters of water were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water the two girls got:
   Each girl got 1/6 of 24.6 liters. 
   To find 1/6 of 24.6, we multiply 24.6 by 1/6 or divide 24.6 by 6.
   24.6 / 6 = 4.1 liters per girl.
   Since there are two girls, the total amount they got is 4.1 * 2 = 8.2 liters.

2. Calculate the total amount of water left after the girls got their share:
   The total amount of water initially was 24.6 liters.
   The girls got 8.2 liters, so we subtract 8.2 from 24.6 to find the remaining amount.
   24.6 - 8.2 = 16.4 liters.

3. Calculate the total amount of water left after the boy got his share:
   The boy got 6.5 liters of water.

Half of them are men and half are women. 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 that number had previous commitments. How many people show up for Martha's party?","To find the number of people who show up for Martha's party, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Total number of families invited:
   - 2 families with 6 people = 2 * 6 = 12 people
   - 3 families with 4 people = 3 * 4 = 12 people
   Total people invited = 12 + 12 = 24 people

2. Since half of the people are men and half are women, the number of men and women is equal. 
   Therefore, men = women = 24 / 2 = 12 people each

3. 8 people couldn't come due to illness. 
   This is 8 people, but we don't know the gender distribution yet.

4. 1/4 of the 8 people had previous commitments. 
   This is 1/4 * 8 = 2 people.

5. Total people who couldn't come due to illness or previous commitments = 8 (illness) + 2 (previous commitments) = 10 people.

6. To find the number of people who show up for Martha's party, we subtract the total people who couldn't come from the total people invited.

If Rose bought 1200 onions and 400 potatoes, how many onions and potatoes in total did Sophia buy at the market?","To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to determine the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought per item, and then divide that by 4.

Rose bought 1200 onions and 400 potatoes. 

Let's find the number of items Rose bought per item:
- Total items Rose bought = 1200 onions + 400 potatoes = 1600 items
- Number of items Rose bought per item = 1600 items / 2 (since there are 2 types of items) = 800 items per type

Now, we know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. 
- Number of items Sophia bought per item = 800 items / 4 = 200 items per type

Since there are 2 types of items (onions and potatoes), Sophia bought a total of:

1. Total number of students in the school: 3 classes * 20 students per class = 60 students.

2. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of girls and boys is equal. 
   Let's assume the number of boys is x. Then the number of girls is also x.
   x + x = 60

The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?","To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the information given:

1. The solo song has some lines in the lyrics. However, we don't know the total number of lines in the song, but we know that some of them are his lines. Let's call the total number of lines in the song 'x'. Since some of them are his lines, let's call the number of his lines in the song 'y'. So, we have y = some of x.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. Since the song has 'x' lines, the first scene has 2x lines. Only a third of these lines are his. So, the number of his lines in the first scene is (1/3) * 2x = (2/3)x.

3. The second scene has six more lines than the song. Since the song has 'x' lines, the second scene has x + 6 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are his. So, the number of his lines in the second scene is (4/5) * (x + 6).

Now, let's add up the number of lines Sean has to memorize: 
- The number of his lines in the first scene: (2/3)x
- The number of his lines in the second scene: (4/5) * (x + 6)
- The number of his lines in the song: y

However, we still don't know the value of 'y'. But we know that 'y' is some of 'x'. We can represent 'y' as a fraction of 'x', say (m/n)x where m is some number and n is the total number of lines in the song). So, we have y = (m/n)x.

Now, let's find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 
(2/3)x + (4/5) * (x + 6) + (m/n)x

To simplify this, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. Let's assume n is the least common multiple of 3 and 5, which is 15. Now, we can rewrite the expression with a common denominator:
(10/15)x + (12/15) * (x + 6) + (m/15)x

Combine like terms:
(10/15)x + (12/15)x + (72/15) + (m/15)x

Combine like terms:
((10 + 12 + m)/15)x + (72/15)

Combine like terms:
((22 + m)/15)x + (72/15)

Now, let's simplify this expression:
((22 + m)/15)x + 72/15

To simplify this expression further, we need to know the value of 'm'. However, we don't know the value of 'm'. But we can represent the total number of lines Sean has to memorize as an expression:

1. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes every day. Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen is equal to 12, we can calculate the total number of doughnuts made per day:

10 dozen * 12 doughnuts/dozen = 120 doughnuts/day

2. Since Derrick makes 120 doughnuts per day, in a month like June which has 30 days, he makes:

120 doughnuts/day * 30 days = 3600 doughnuts/month

3. We know that Derrick makes $7200 in June when he sells all the doughnuts. To find the price of each doughnut, we can divide the total amount made by the total number of doughnuts sold:

Price per doughnut = Total amount made / Total number of doughnuts sold
= $7200 / 3600 doughnuts
= $2 per doughnut

Therefore, the price of each doughnut is {2}."

If it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, how tall did the beanstalk start out?","To find the initial height of the beanstalk, we need to work backwards from the fourth day when it is taller than Mark's window.

1. On the fourth day, the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet.
2. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day, on the third day, it was half the height of the fourth day.
3. On the third day, the beanstalk was taller than 20 feet, but not as tall as the fourth day. So, it was between 20 feet and the height of the fourth day.
4. On the second day, it was half the height of the third day.
5. On the first day, it was half the height of the second day.

Let's denote the height of the beanstalk on the first day as 'x'.

Then, on the second day, it was 2x.
On the third day, it was 2 * 2x = 4x.
On the fourth day, it was 2 * 4x = 8x.

Since the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet on the fourth day, we can set up the inequality:

8x > 20

To find 'x', we can divide both sides by 8:

x > 20 / 8
x > 2.5

So, the beanstalk started out at a height greater than 2.5 feet.

The passion fruit costs $6.5 per pound, the jackfruit is $8.5 per pound, and the honey is $10.5 per pound.  He sells each jar for $50.  How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?","To find the profit Tim makes, we need to calculate the cost of making 10 jars and the revenue from selling 10 jars.

1. Calculate the cost of passion fruit for 10 jars:
   - Each jar requires 2 pounds of passion fruit.
   - The cost of passion fruit per pound is $6.5.
   - So, the cost of passion fruit for 1 jar is 2 * $6.5 = $13.
   - The cost of passion fruit for 10 jars is 10 * $13 = $130.

2. Calculate the cost of jackfruit for 10 jars:
   - Each jar requires 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.
   - The cost of jackfruit per pound is $8.5.
   - So, the cost of jackfruit for 1 jar is 1.5 * $8.5 = $12.75.
   - The cost of jackfruit for 10 jars is 10 * $12.75 = $127.5.

3. Calculate the cost of honey for 10 jars:
   - Each jar requires 2 pounds of honey.
   - The cost of honey per pound is $10.5.
   - So, the cost of honey for 1 jar is 2 * $10.5 = $21.
   - The cost of honey for 10 jars is 10 * $21 = $210.

4. Calculate the total cost of making 10 jars:
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of passion fruit, jackfruit, and honey.
   - Total cost = $130 + $127.5 + $210 = $467.5.

5. Calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars:
   - Each jar is sold for $50.
   - The revenue from selling 10 jars is 10 * $50 = $500.

6. Calculate the profit:

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires and doesn't repair any truck tires.  How much more revenue did the mechanic earn on the day with higher revenue?","To find out which day had higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

1. Calculate the revenue for Thursday:
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

2. Calculate the revenue for Friday:
- Revenue from truck tires: 0 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $0
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday: $0 + $480 = $480

Comparing the revenues, we can see that Thursday had higher revenue ($520) than Friday ($480).

Therefore, the mechanic earned more revenue on the day with higher revenue, which is Thursday.

375,"While Joanne is gathering apples from her family’s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. In addition, Joanne gathers 20 oranges from the tallest, shortest, and average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
3. Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees, but we don't know the exact amount yet.
4. Joanne gathers 20 oranges from all three types of trees.
5. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 2 x 30 = 60 apples.
6. Joanne's sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 3 x 15 = 45 apples.
7. Joanne's sister doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne gathers x apples from the average trees (we need to find this value).
- Joanne gathers 20 oranges from all three types of trees (these are not included in the total apple count).

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 30 + 15 + x.

- Joanne's sister gathers 60 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
- Joanne's sister gathers 0 apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister is 60 + 45 = 105.

The combined total number of apples gathered by the sisters is 500. Therefore, the total number of apples gathered by Joanne is 500 - 105 = 395.

We know that Joanne gathers 30 + 15 + x = 395 apples. To find the value of x, we can subtract 45 from both sides of the equation:

30 + 15 + x = 395
45 + x = 395
x = 395 - 45
x = 350

So, Joanne gathers 350 apples from the average trees.

476,"Samwell owns an appliance store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, one-fifth are projection TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?","To find the number of OLED TVs sold, we need to calculate the combined fraction of sales for smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs, and then subtract that from 1 to find the fraction of OLED TVs sold.

1. One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs: 1/4
2. One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs: 1/8
3. One-fifth of the sales are projection TVs: 1/5

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 40 in this case. 

We can rewrite the fractions as:
- Smart TVs: (1/4) * (10/10) = 10/40
- Analog TVs: (1/8) * (5/5) = 5/40
- Projection TVs: (1/5) * (8/8) = 8/40

Now we can add them:
10/40 + 5/40 + 8/40 = 23/40

This is the combined fraction of sales for smart TVs, analog TVs, and projection TVs. To find the fraction of OLED TVs sold, we subtract this from 1:
1 - 23/40 = (40/40) - (23/40) = 17/40

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, we can multiply the fraction of OLED TVs sold by the total number of TVs to find the number of OLED TVs sold:
(17/40) * 40 = 17

Can you determine the number of players in the defensive team?","To find the number of defensive players, let's denote the number of defensive players as 'D'. 

1. The number of offensive players is double that of the defensive players, so the number of offensive players is 2D.
2. The total number of players in the special teams is half the number of defensive players, so the number of special teams players is D/2.
3. The total number of players in the team is 105, so the sum of the offensive, defensive, and special teams players is 105.
   This can be represented by the equation: 2D + D + D/2 = 105.

To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
   4D + 2D + D = 210
   Combine like terms:
   7D = 210

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for D:
   D = 210 / 7
   D = 30

Therefore, the number of defensive players is 30.

How much will each roommate pay per year for electricity, if they divide the share equally, and Jenna's roommates agreed to pay an additional $5 each per month to cover Jenna's share as she lost her job ?","To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how much each roommate will pay per month for electricity. Since there are 5 people (4 roommates + Jenna) and they divide the share equally, each person will pay 1/5 of the total electricity bill per month.

   Total electricity bill per month = $100
   Each person's share per month = $100 / 5 = $20

2. Next, we need to find out how much each roommate will pay per month to cover Jenna's share. Since Jenna's roommates agreed to pay an additional $5 each per month, each roommate will pay an extra $5.

   Each roommate's extra share per month = $5

3. Now, we need to find out how much each roommate will pay per month in total. We add the original share and the extra share.

   Each roommate's total share per month = $20 (original share) + $5 (extra share) = $25

4. Finally, we need to find out how much each roommate will pay per year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total share per month by 12.

   Each roommate's total share per year = $25 * 12 = $300

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
Time to cut one potato: 5.5 seconds

First, convert the time to cut one potato to minutes: 5.5 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 0.092 minutes (approximately)

Total time to peel and cut one potato: 1.5 minutes + 0.092 minutes = 1.592 minutes

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x.

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28.

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums, so we can write the equation:

1. Each class has 0.2 of a hundred students. This means each class has 20 students.
2. There are 0.15 of a score of classes. A score is 20, so 0.15 of a score is 0.15 * 20 = 3 classes.
3. The school as a whole is 1/2 boys and 1/2 girls. This means that the total number of boys and girls in the school is equal.
4. The first class has 3/4 of a score of girls. 3/4 of a score is 3/4 * 20 = 15 girls.
5. The second class has 0.6 of a score of girls. 0.6 of a score is 0.6 * 20 = 12 girls.

Since the school is 1/2 boys and 1/2 girls, and we know the number of girls in the first and second classes, we can find the total number of girls in the school.

Total girls in the first and second classes = 15 + 12 = 27 girls
Since the school is 1/2 girls, the total number of girls in the school is half of the total number of students. We know that each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so the total number of students in the school is 3 * 20 = 60. Half of 60 is 30, so there are 30 girls in the school.

Now we can find the total number of girls in the school.

Total girls in the school = 30
Total girls in the first and second classes = 27

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as M, Anna as A, and Richie as R.

We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so we can write:
R = M + 20

We also know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so we can write:
R = A + 45

Since both equations are equal to R, we can set them equal to each other:
M + 20 = A + 45

Subtracting 20 from both sides:
M = A + 25

Now we have two equations:
R = M + 20
R = A + 45
M = A + 25

We can substitute the value of M from the third equation into the first equation:
R = (A + 25) + 20
R = A + 45

This confirms that the second equation is correct. However, we still don't know the values of A, M, and R.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, let's break down the information given:

1. On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages (2 * 50 = 100 bandages) and used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.

Let's assume they started with x bandages on the first day. After using 38 bandages on the first day, they had x - 38 bandages left.

After using 28 bandages on the second day, they had (x - 38) - 28 = x - 66 bandages left.

After using 25 bandages on the third day, they had (x - 66) - 25 = x - 91 bandages left.

Since they had bandages left at the end of the third day, x - 91 > 0.

Now, let's consider the bandages they ordered. They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages on the first day, and two bulk packs of 100 bandages on the third day. So, they ordered a total of 50 + 100 = 150 bandages.

The total number of bandages they had at the end of the third day is the sum of the bandages they started with and the bandages they ordered, minus the bandages they used: x + 150 - 38 - 28 - 25 = x + 59.

Since they had bandages left at the end of the third day, x + 59 > 0.

We also know that x - 91 > 0, so x > 91.

The smallest possible value of x is 92, since x > 91.

If they started with 92 bandages on the first day, they would have used 38 bandages on the first day, 28 bandages on the second day, and 25 bandages on the third day. They would have ordered 150 bandages in total, so they would have had 92 + 150 - 38 - 28 - 25 = 151 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Therefore, the nurses started with {92} bandages on the first day."

At the second location, food for each guest is already included in the price. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, let's set up an equation for each scenario.

Scenario 1: The first venue charges a flat fee of $300, and food costs $10 per guest. The total cost for this venue is the sum of the flat fee and the cost of food for each guest.

Total cost for the first venue = $300 + ($10 * number of guests)

Scenario 2: The second venue charges $30 per person, and food is included in the price. The total cost for this venue is simply the number of guests multiplied by the per-person cost.

Total cost for the second venue = ($30 * number of guests)

To find the number of guests where the two venues are equal in cost, we need to set the total costs for each scenario equal to each other and solve for the number of guests.

$300 + ($10 * number of guests) = ($30 * number of guests)

Subtract ($10 * number of guests) from both sides:

$300 = ($30 - $10) * number of guests
$300 = $20 * number of guests

Divide both sides by $20:

number of guests = $300 / $20
number of guests = 15

So, {15} guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost."

   18x = 144

3. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
   x = 144 / 18
   x = 8

4. Now that we have the value of x, we can find Allen's age now:
   Allen's age now = 11x
   Allen's age now = 11 * 8
   Allen's age now = 88

5. To find Allen's age 12 years from now, we add 12 to his current age:
   Allen's age 12 years from now = 88 + 12
   Allen's age 12 years from now = 100

So, the final answer is {100}."

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. 
   So, Zack's locker is 4 * 5 = 20 cubic inches.
3. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   So, Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.

Therefore, Timothy's locker is {40} cubic inches."

She wants to upload all her photos on her Instagram. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 3/5 of ten batches each day, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?","To find out how many days Jade needs to upload all her photos, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of photos Jade took.
   Jade took 2.1 times one hundred photos. 
   So, the total number of photos is 2.1 * 100 = 210 photos.

2. Calculate the number of photos Jade can upload in one day.
   Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch and 3/5 of ten batches each day. 
   First, let's calculate the number of batches Jade uploads each day. 
   3/5 of 10 batches is (3/5) * 10 = 6 batches.
   Since each batch has 7 photos, Jade uploads 6 * 7 = 42 photos each day.

3. Calculate the number of days Jade needs to upload all her photos.
   Jade has 210 photos and can upload 42 photos each day. 
   To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload each day.
   So, the number of days is 210 / 42 = 5.

Therefore, {5}."
1787,"Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 0.6 times of one hundred cherries. If Robert has 0.3 times of one hundred cherries, and has 10 more than Richard, how many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?","Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Richard, Jerry, and Robert are going to share 0.6 times of one hundred cherries. 
   This means the total number of cherries they have together is 0.6 * 100 = 60 cherries.

2. Robert has 0.3 times of one hundred cherries, which is 0.3 * 100 = 30 cherries.

3. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. 
   Let's denote the number of cherries Richard has as 'R'. 
   Then Robert has 'R + 10' cherries.

4. We already know Robert has 30 cherries. 
   So, we can write the equation: R + 10 = 30
   Solving for R, we get R = 20. 
   This means Richard has 20 cherries.

5. Since the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert has 30 and Richard has 20, 
   Jerry must have 60 - (30 + 20) = 10 cherries.

6. Now we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. 
   Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries. 
   So, Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.

Therefore, {20}."
739,Carl buys ten packs of cookies. Each pack of cookies has 3/5 of ten cookies inside. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much change does Carl receive if he pay with a $10 bill?,"To find the total number of cookies, we need to calculate 3/5 of 10.

First, we multiply 10 by 3: 10 * 3 = 30

Then, we divide the result by 5: 30 / 5 = 6

So, each pack of cookies has 6 cookies inside.

Since Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, the total number of cookies is 10 * 6 = 60

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost of the cookies is 60 * $0.10 = $6

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he receives is $10 - $6 = $4

After paying with a $20 bill, how much change does the cashier give back?","To find the change, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items purchased:
   - Cocoa: $4.20
   - Laundry detergent: $9.45
   - Pasta: $1.35
   Total cost: $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $14.99

2. The mother decides not to buy the dress, so we don't need to include its price in the total.

3. The mother pays with a $20 bill.

4. To find the change, subtract the total cost from the $20 bill:
   Change = $20 - $14.99 = $5.01

2063,"For a New Year's resolution, Andy，who is currently weighing 200 lbs， wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?","To determine the calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, he needs to burn:
   30 pounds * 3500 calories/pound = 105,000 calories

2. Calculate the number of days Andy has to achieve his goal. His birthday is on July 19th, and today is December 31st, so:
   Number of days = July 19th - December 31st = 209 days

3. Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed to reach the goal:
   Daily calorie deficit = Total calories to burn / Number of days
   Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 209 days ≈ 502 calories/day

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately {502} calories to reach his goal."
1914,"Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $1200 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $40. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's assume the number of large stuffed animals sold is 'x'. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is '2x'.

2. The price of a small stuffed animal is $40. Therefore, the total earnings from small stuffed animals is 40 * 2x = 80x.

3. The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, which is 3 * 40 = $120.

4. Therefore, the total earnings from large stuffed animals is 120 * x = 120x.

5. The total earnings from both large and small stuffed animals is $1200. So, we can set up the equation: 80x + 120x = 1200.

6. Combining like terms, we get: 200x = 1200.

7. Dividing both sides by 200, we get: x = 6.

8. Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is '2x', we can calculate the number of small stuffed animals sold as: 2 * 6 = 12.

Therefore, {12}."

How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?","To find the total amount of money raised, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and add them together.

1. Alexandra raises $4300.
2. Kim raises $3200 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $4300 + $3200 = $7500.
3. The total amount raised by Alexandra and Kim is $4300 + $7500 = $11800.
4. Sarah raises $3000.
5. Maryam raises $4000 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $3000 + $4000 = $7000.
6. The total amount raised by Sarah and Maryam is $3000 + $7000 = $10000.

The following day, they used ten bandages less than the previous day. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages and only expended half a pack. They had 78 bandages remaining at the conclusion of the third day. Can you determine the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On the first day, the medical staff used 38 bandages and procured one large pack of bandages. Since each pack contains 50 bandages, they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages at the end of the first day.

2. On the second day, they used 10 bandages less than the previous day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. So, at the end of the second day, they had 88 - 28 = 60 bandages.

3. On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages, which means they had 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They also used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they used a total of 25 + 28 = 53 bandages on the third day. At the end of the third day, they had 60 + 100 - 53 = 107 bandages.

However, we are given that they had 78 bandages remaining at the end of the third day. This seems to be incorrect based on our calculation. Let's re-evaluate our steps.

Upon re-evaluation, we realize that we made an incorrect assumption. We assumed that they had 60 bandages at the end of the second day. However, this is not necessarily true. We only know that they used 28 bandages on the second day and had some bandages remaining from the first day.

Let's denote the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day as x. They used 38 bandages on the first day, so they had x - 38 bandages remaining. On the second day, they used 28 bandages, so they had (x - 38) - 28 = x - 66 bandages remaining.

On the third day, they acquired two large packs of bandages, which means they had 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They also used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they used a total of 25 + 28 = 53 bandages on the third day. At the end of the third day, they had (x - 66) + 100 - 53 = x - 19 bandages.

We are given that they had 78 bandages remaining at the end of the third day. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 19 = 78

Solving for x, we get:

x = 97

Therefore, the number of bandages they had at the beginning of the first day is {97}."

On Sunday, he sold 7 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 20 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $8 and the apple pie cost $18, how much did Sunny earn for two days?","To find out how much Sunny earned, we need to calculate the total sales for both Saturday and Sunday.

On Saturday:
- Gingerbread boxes sold: 15
- Apple pie boxes sold: 3 fewer than Sunday, which is 20 - 3 = 17
- Total boxes sold on Saturday: 15 + 17 = 32

On Sunday:
- Gingerbread boxes sold: 7 more than Saturday, which is 15 + 7 = 22
- Apple pie boxes sold: 20
- Total boxes sold on Sunday: 22 + 20 = 42

Total boxes sold in two days: 32 + 42 = 74

Now, let's calculate the total sales:
- Gingerbread: 74 boxes * $8 = $592
- Apple pie: 37 boxes (17 + 20) * $18 = $666

1. We know Lynn ran 17 miles.
2. Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie ran 17 + 3 = 20 miles.
3. Reggie also ran 5 times what Paisley ran. If we let 'x' be the miles Paisley ran, then Reggie ran 5x miles.
4. Since Reggie ran 20 miles, we can set up the equation: 5x = 20

If they use the stored water at a rate of 500 gallons daily, how much water will be left in the tank after a period of 6 days?","To find out how much water will be left in the tank after 6 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of water transferred from the pool to the storage tank:
   Since they transferred half of the 10000 gallons of water, we calculate it as:
   10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons

2. Calculate the total amount of water used in 6 days:
   Since they use 500 gallons daily, we calculate it as:
   500 * 6 = 3000 gallons

3. Subtract the amount of water used from the total amount of water transferred to the storage tank:

1. First, calculate the total hours she will spend outdoors: 
   4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

2. Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, the total amount of sunscreen she will use is:
   32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces

3. Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, divide the total amount of sunscreen she will use by the amount in each bottle:

Sara had a savings of $10 before she began her babysitting job. How many instances of lawn mowing does Sara need to do to gather enough money to buy the jacket and shoes?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sara wants to buy a jacket for $30 and two pairs of shoes for $20 each. The total cost of the shoes is 2 * $20 = $40. The total cost of the items she wants to buy is $30 (jacket) + $40 (shoes) = $70.

2. Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's children and has done this job 4 times. She has earned a total of 4 * $5 = $20 from babysitting.

3. She had a savings of $10 before she began her babysitting job. So, in total, she has $20 (from babysitting) + $10 (initial savings) = $30.

4. She still needs $70 - $30 = $40 to buy the items she wants.

5. Sara earns $4 each time she takes care of mowing the lawn. To find out how many instances of lawn mowing she needs to do to gather enough money, we can divide the total amount she needs ($40) by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn ($4). $40 / $4 = 10.

1. Calculate the number of rows of red tulips:
   Since we don't have any information about red tulips, we'll assume Jackson buys 0 red tulips.

2. Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips:
   Jackson can fit 7 blue tulips in a row and he buys 21 blue daisies. To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue daisies by 7.
   21 blue daisies / 7 blue tulips per row = 3 rows of blue tulips

3. Calculate the number of rows of yellow daisies:
   Jackson can fit 5 red tulips in a row, but since we're planting yellow daisies, we'll use the same row size. He buys 30 yellow daisies. To find the number of rows of yellow daisies, we divide the total number of yellow daisies by 5.
   30 yellow daisies / 5 yellow tulips per row = 6 rows of yellow daisies

   13 blueberry muffins at an unknown price. However, we are not given the price of the blueberry muffins. Let's assume the price per muffin is $x.

5. Calculate the total cost before discount:
   Total cost = $15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + 13x (blueberry muffins)
   Total cost = $37.00 + 13x

6. Apply the 10% discount:

The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to two-fifths the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?","Let's break down the information step by step:

1. The first plane goes to Greece for one-fifth of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for 1/5 * x flights, where x is the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.

2. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France and Germany is (4/5)x/2 = (2/5)x each.

3. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips in a day.

4. The 44 trips of the second plane amount to two-fifths the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. So, 2/5 * x = 44.

5. To find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day (x), we can solve the equation 2/5 * x = 44. Multiplying both sides by 5/2, we get x = 44 * (5/2) = 110.

6. Now that we know the first plane makes 110 flights in a day, we can find the number of flights to Greece: 1/5 * 110 = 22.

7. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to France is (2/5)x = (2/5) * 110 = 44.

If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?","To determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 4 cups of flour
- 2 cups of milk

For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:
- 4 cups * 4 = 16 cups of flour
- 2 cups * 4 = 8 cups of milk

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs to buy:
- 16 cups / 2 cups per bag = 8 bags of flour

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs to buy:
- 8 cups / 2 cups per bottle = 4 bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- 8 bags - 4 bottles = 4

So, Mark has to buy {4} more bags of flour than bottles of milk."

3. In 9 years, R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

We can rewrite equation (3) as:
R + 9 = 3S + 27

Now, substitute R from equation (1) into the rewritten equation (3):
6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Subtract 3S from both sides:
3S + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

481,Ryan’s allowance is $8 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 4 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 2 friends at $1.50 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $7.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate his total earnings and then subtract the cost of the ice cream cones and the movie tickets.

1. Ryan's allowance is $8 each week, and he completed his chores for 4 weeks.
   Total earnings = $8 * 4 = $32

2. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 2 friends at $1.50 each. 
   Total ice cream cost = $1.50 * (1 + 2) = $1.50 * 3 = $4.50

3. Subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings.
   Remaining money = $32 - $4.50 = $27.50

4. Now, they all want to go to the movies, and tickets cost $7.50 each. 
   Number of movie tickets Ryan can buy = $27.50 / $7.50

   $27.50 / $7.50 = 3.6667 (round down to 3 since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket)

Therefore, {3}."

However, before buying the puzzle, he found a discount coupon that allowed him to get a 50% discount on the puzzle. After buying the comic book and the discounted puzzle, how much money does Raymond have left?","To find out how much money Raymond has left, let's break down the steps:

1. Raymond initially had $21.
2. He received an allowance and saved $11. So, he now has $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He bought a comic book for $5. Now, he has $32 - $5 = $27.
4. He found a discount coupon for the puzzle, which costs $19. The discount is 50%, so the discount amount is $19 * 0.5 = $9.5. The discounted price of the puzzle is $19 - $9.5 = $9.5.
5. He bought the comic book for $5 and the discounted puzzle for $9.5. Now, he has $27 - $5 - $9.5 = $12.5.

So, Raymond has $12.50 left.

717,"After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara,  Erin has 18 points before. How many points does Sara have?","To find out how many points Sara has, let's follow the steps:

1. Erin scored 14 points, and now she has 18 points. So, before scoring 14 points, Erin had 18 - 14 = 4 points.

2. It is given that Erin has three times more points than Sara. This means Erin's points are 3 times Sara's points plus Sara's points (3 times Sara's points + Sara's points = 4 points that Erin had before scoring 14 points). 

   Let's represent Sara's points as 'x'. Then, 3 times Sara's points is 3x. Since Erin has 4 points more than 3 times Sara's points, we can write the equation: 3x + x = 4.

3. Combine like terms in the equation: 4x = 4.

4. Solve for 'x' by dividing both sides of the equation by 4: x = 1.

So, Sara has {1} point."

Despite the price increase, the company decided to proceed with the purchase. Calculate the total amount of money the company ended up spending to buy the computers at the new prices.","To find the total amount of money the company ended up spending on the computers, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the original total budget for the computers:
   The original budget per computer is $700, and the company plans to purchase 500 computers.
   So, the original total budget is 700 * 500 = $350,000.

2. Calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase:
   The original price of each computer is $700. A 10% increase means the new price is 700 + (700 * 0.10) = $770.

3. Calculate the total amount of money the company ended up spending on the computers at the new prices:
   The new price per computer is $770, and the company still plans to purchase 500 computers.

1. There are 27 unicorns left in total.
2. One third of the unicorns have made their home in the Scottish Highlands. 
   To find the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, we divide 27 by 3:
   27 / 3 = 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

3. Two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female.
   To find the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands, we multiply the total number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands by 2/3:

2084,"Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents tell him that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, then they won't sign him up again. Additionally, Manny's parents have decided to give him an extra $20 to sign up for Karate classes. If there are 10 total classes, how many can he miss before they don't sign him up again?","To find out how many classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again, we need to calculate the maximum cost per class.

The total cost of classes is $60. His parents are giving him an extra $20 to sign up. So, the total cost is covered by his parents.

The maximum cost per class is $10. Since his parents are giving him an extra $20, we can subtract this from the total cost and divide by the number of classes to get the maximum cost per class.

Total cost covered by parents = $60 (initial cost) + $20 (extra money) = $80

Maximum cost per class = $80 / 10 (number of classes) = $8

However, we know that the maximum cost per class is $10. So, we need to find the number of classes where the cost per class is $10 or less.

Let's say Manny misses 'x' classes. The total cost of classes he attends will be $80 / (10 - x).

The cost per class should be less than or equal to $10. So, we can write the inequality:

$80 / (10 - x) ≤ $10

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (10 - x):

$80 ≤ $10(10 - x)

Expanding the right-hand side:

$80 ≤ $100 - $10x

Subtracting $80 from both sides:

$0 ≤ $20 - $10x

Adding $10x to both sides:

$10x ≤ $20

Dividing both sides by $10:

x ≤ 2

So, Manny can miss 2 or fewer classes before his parents won't sign him up again."

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, plus the distance of the bird's nest from the top of the second tree. How tall is the tallest tree?","To find the height of the tallest tree, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree. 
   So, the height of the second tree = 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

3. There is a bird's nest that is 2 feet from the top of the second tree. 
   So, the height of the second tree + the distance of the bird's nest = 11 + 2 = 13 feet.

4. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined, plus the distance of the bird's nest from the top of the second tree.
   First, let's find the combined height of the two trees: 
   Combined height = Height of the shortest tree + Height of the second tree = 6 + 11 = 17 feet.

   Then, we add the distance of the bird's nest to the combined height: 
   17 + 2 = 19 feet.

   Finally, we multiply the result by 2: 
   19 * 2 = 38 feet.

   So, the height of the tallest tree is 38 feet.

Find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house?","To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's assume the initial number of cannolis is 'x'. Then, the initial number of corns is '2x' since there is twice as much corn as cannolis.

2. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store. So, the new number of cannolis is 'x + 60'.

3. Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. Since the number of cannolis is 'x + 60', the number of corns bought is '(x + 60) - 40 = x + 20'. 

4. The new number of corns is the initial number of corns plus the number of corns bought. So, the new number of corns is '2x + (x + 20) = 3x + 20'.

5. The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis is the sum of the new number of corns and the new number of cannolis. So, the combined total is '(3x + 20) + (x + 60) = 4x + 80'.

However, we still need to find the value of 'x'. Since we don't have any information about the initial number of cannolis, we can't find the exact value of 'x'. But we can still express the combined total in terms of 'x'.

Since we are asked to put the concise form of the final answer in curly brackets, we can express the combined total as {4x + 80}."

1. The total amount paid is $35.
2. This includes the dinner bill and a 20% tip.
3. Since the wife wants to evenly split the check, let's assume the dinner bill is x and the tip is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.
4. The total amount paid is the sum of the dinner bill and the tip: x + 0.2x = 1.2x.
5. We know that the total amount paid is $35, so we can set up the equation: 1.2x = 35.
6. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 1.2: x = 35 / 1.2.

If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, 3 of the photographs of the ducks are accidentally deleted, how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6:

Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 photographs.

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'x'. Then, we can write the equation:

1. Calculate the total number of employees in May.
   In May, the company hired 40 employees.

2. Calculate the total number of hours worked by the employees in May.
   Since each employee worked for 40 hours a week and there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of hours worked by each employee in May is:
   40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 hours/month
   Since there are 40 employees, the total number of hours worked by all employees in May is:
   160 hours/month * 40 employees = 6400 hours/month

3. Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in May.

After helping people, Billy also decides to take a 15-minute break every hour to drink a cup of coffee that contains 95 milligrams of caffeine. He also spends 30 minutes each day to organize his paperwork.  (Remember there are 31 days in March.)","To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to first find out how many days he works.

March has 31 days, and April has 19 days (since April 19th is the last day). So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

Billy takes 20% of the days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50:
20% of 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10 days

Now, we subtract the days he takes off from the total number of days to find out how many days he works:
50 - 10 = 40 days

Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

To find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:
6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people

Now, let's consider Billy's breaks and paperwork organization. He takes a 15-minute break every hour, which is 0.25 hours. So, he takes 0.25 hours * 6 people/day = 1.5 people-day of break time (but he still helps 6 people per day).

He spends 30 minutes (0.5 hours) each day to organize his paperwork. This doesn't affect the number of people he helps.

So, Billy helps 240 people in total.

How many total times can both DVDs be played before they break?","To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to consider the number of times each DVD can be played before it breaks.

Let's assume that each DVD can be played a certain number of times before it breaks. We'll call this number 'x'. 

Since we don't know the exact number of times each DVD can be played before it breaks, we'll represent it as a variable. However, we do know that both DVDs can be played a certain number of times before they break, and that number is the same for both DVDs.

Now, let's consider the information given in the problem:

- DVD 1 has been played 356 times.
- DVD 2 has been played 135 times.

We know that the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is the sum of the number of times each DVD can be played before it breaks. However, we also know that we can't play a DVD more times than it can be played before it breaks.

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is the minimum of the number of times each DVD can be played before it breaks.

Let's call the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break 'y'. Then, we can write the following equation:

y = min(356, x)
y = min(135, x)

Since both DVDs can be played 'x' times before they break, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

min(356, x) = min(135, x)

Now, we can solve for 'x'. We know that the minimum of 356 and 'x' is equal to the minimum of 135 and 'x'. This means that 'x' must be greater than or equal to 135 and less than or equal to 356.

However, we also know that 'x' is the number of times each DVD can be played before it breaks. This means that 'x'x' must be a positive integer.

So, we can conclude that 'x' is the minimum of 356 and 135, which is 135.

Now, we can find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break by adding the number of times each DVD can be played before it breaks:

y = 356 + 135
y = 491

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is {491}."

Bus time = 5.5 hours
Bus distance = 60 * 5.5 = 330 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance the car traveled.
Car speed = 30 miles per hour
Car time = 8.5 hours
Car distance = 30 * 8.5 = 255 miles

Step 3: Find the difference between the bus distance and the car distance.
Difference = Bus distance - Car distance
Difference = 330 - 255
Difference = 75 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled {75} miles farther than the car."

How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?","To find the total cost of buying bananas in bunches, we first need to find the total number of bananas and then compare it to buying them individually.

1. Jenny buys 10 bunches with 4 bananas per bunch. 
   Total bananas in 10 bunches = 10 * 4 = 40 bananas

2. Later, she buys 5 more bunches with 4 bananas per bunch.
   Total bananas in 5 bunches = 5 * 4 = 20 bananas

3. Total bananas = 40 + 20 = 60 bananas

4. The cost of buying 60 bananas individually = 60 * $0.80 = $48.00

5. The cost of buying 15 bunches = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

6. The amount saved by buying in bunches = $48.00 - $45.00 = $3.00

1472,"Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley ran together. Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran. How many miles did Lynn run?","To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to determine how many miles Reggie ran first, since we know Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.

1. Paisley ran 4 miles.
2. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran 5 * 4 = 20 miles.

Since Reggie and Paisley ran together, and we know the total distance they ran is the sum of their individual distances, we can set up an equation to find out how many miles Lynn ran. 

Let x be the number of miles Lynn ran. 

Reggie ran 20 miles and Paisley ran 4 miles, so together they ran 20 + 4 = 24 miles.

We know Lynn also ran, so the total distance they all ran is the sum of the distances each person ran: Reggie + Paisley + Lynn = 24 miles.

Now we can set up an equation: 20 + 4 + x = 24.

Combine like terms: 24 + x = 24.

Subtract 24 from both sides: x = 0.

So, Lynn ran 0 miles."

If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. Each box has 120 shingles. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?","To find the number of cases of shingles the third house needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of cases of shingles the second house needs as 'x'. Since the first house needs 1/2 of the second, the first house needs x/2 cases.

2. The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

3. The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. We can set up an equation: x/2 + x + x = 250.

4. Combining like terms, we get 5x/2 = 250.

5. Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get 5x = 500.

6. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 100.

7. Since the third house needs x cases, and x = 100, the third house needs {100} cases of shingles."

Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write the equation:
R = 6S

In 21 years, Ruby's age will be R + 21 and Sam's age will be S + 21. According to the problem, in 21 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can write the equation:
R + 21 = 3(S + 21)

Now, let's simplify the equation:
R + 21 = 3S + 63
R = 3S + 42

Since we already have R = 6S, we can substitute R in the second equation:
6S = 3S + 42
3S = 42
S = 14

So, Sam is currently {14} years old."

Allan purchased an additional 60 cannolis from the market and corns that were 40 less than the number of cannolis. Can you determine the total count of both corns and cannolis that Allan now has in his residence?","To find the total count of both corns and cannolis that Allan now has in his residence, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially, Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. The quantity of corn is double that of cannolis. Since Allan has 40 cannolis, the quantity of corn is 2 * 40 = 80.
3. Allan purchased an additional 60 cannolis from the market. Now, he has 40 (initial) + 60 (additional) = 100 cannolis.
4. He also purchased corns that were 40 less than the number of cannolis. Since he has 100 cannolis now, the quantity of corn purchased is 100 - 40 = 60.
5. The total quantity of corn Allan has now is the initial quantity (80) plus the purchased quantity (60), which is 80 + 60 = 140.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has.

Ali has 2/5 of ten $10 bills. 
2/5 * 10 = 4 $10 bills
The total amount from $10 bills is 4 * $10 = $40.

Ali also has six $20 bills.
The total amount from $20 bills is 6 * $20 = $120.

The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.

How many emails a day does she send to her boyfriend?","To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how many emails are not work-related. 
   Total emails = 7 (work emails) + (remainder of non-work emails)
   Since we don't know the total number of non-work emails yet, let's call it 'x'. 
   So, the total number of non-work emails = x.

2. Now, we know that two-thirds of the remainder are to family. 
   The number of emails to family = (2/3) * x

3. The remainder of non-work emails (excluding family) = x - (2/3)x
   = (1/3)x

4. Now, one-third of the other emails (excluding family) are to her boyfriend. 
   The number of emails to her boyfriend = (1/3) * (1/3)x
   = (1/9)x

5. To find the total number of non-work emails (x), we know that 7 (work emails) + x = total emails. However, we don't know the total number of emails. We'll assume it's y. 
   So, 7 + x = y
   x = y - 7

6. Since we don't know the total number of emails (y), let's assume it's a multiple of 9 (to make (1/9)x an integer).
   Let y = 9n (where n is an integer)

   x = 9n - 7

7. Now, let's find the number of emails to her boyfriend:
   The number of emails to her boyfriend = (1/9)x
   = (1/9)(9n - 7)
   = n - 7/9
   Since n is an integer, n - 7/9 will be an integer if n >= 8.

   For example, if n = 9, then x = 9*9 - 7 = 80, and the number of emails to her boyfriend = 9 - 7/9 = 8.

1714,"Elvis has a monthly saving target of $112,500. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to save for each day in the second half of the month?","To find out how much Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month, we first need to determine how much he needs to save in total for the month.

Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, we can assume the first half is x days long. 

Let's assume there are 30 days in April (which is a reasonable assumption). 

The total number of days in April is 30, so the second half will be 30 - x days long.

The total savings for the month will be the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half.

The savings in the first half will be x * y, where y is the daily savings in the first half.

The savings in the second half will be (30 - x) * 2y, since Elvis saves twice as much in the second half.

The total savings for the month is 112,500, so we can set up the equation:

x * y + (30 - x) * 2y = 112,500

Combine like terms:

x * y + 60y - 2xy = 112,500

Simplify the equation:

-x * y + 60y = 112,500

Since x * y is a positive quantity (you can't save a negative amount), we can move it to the right-hand side of the equation:

60y = 112,500 + x * y

Divide both sides by 60:

y = (112,500 + x * y) / 60

To solve for y, we need to know the value of x. However, we know that the second half of the month is 30 - x days long, and Elvis saves twice as much in the second half as in the first half.

So, the savings in the second half will be 2 * x 30y (since there are 30 days in the second half, and Elvis saves y in the first half).

The savings in the first half will be x * y.

The total savings for the month is 112,500, so we can set up the equation:

x * y + 2 * 30y = 112,500

Combine like terms:

x * y + 60y = 112,500

Simplify the equation:

y (x + 60) = 112,500

Since x + 60 is a positive quantity (you can't save a negative amount), we can divide both sides by (x + 60):

y = 112,500 / (x + 60)

However, we don't know the value of x, so we can't find y. But we can use the fact that Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half.

Let's assume that Elvis saves y in the first half. Then, he will save 2y in the second half.

The total savings for the month will be the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half:

y + 2y = 112,500

Combine like terms:

3y = 112,500

Divide both sides by 3:

y = 112,500 / 3

y = 37,500

Since Elvis saves y in the first half, and y = 37,500, we can find the number of days in the first half:

x * y = 37,500

Divide both sides by y:

x = 37,500 / y

x = 37,500 / 37,500

x = 1

So, there is 1 day in the first half of the month.

The second half of the month will be 30 - x = 30 - 1 = 29 days long.

Elvis saves 2y in the second half, and y = 37,500, so:

2y = 2 * 37,500

2y = 75,000

Elvis needs to save {75,000} in the second half of the month."

   - Saturday: 30 meals
   - Sunday: 48 meals
   Total meals given out = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

2. Since we don't know the initial number of meals, we'll call it 'x'. We know that after giving out 142 meals, Mamou has 'x - 142' meals left.

However, since we are asked to provide a concise answer, let's assume that the question implies that Mamou started with a certain number of meals, but we are not given that information. 

In that case, we can't determine the exact number of meals Mamou has left to distribute. But we can say that she has a certain number of meals left, which is the initial number of meals minus the number of meals given out.

So, the answer is {x - 142}, but since we don't know the value of 'x', we can't provide a specific number.

However, if we assume that the question is asking for the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute after giving out the meals, and that she has a certain number of meals left, then the answer would be {x - 142}, but since we don't know the value of 'x', we can't provide a specific number.

But if we are asked to provide a concise answer based on the information given, then the answer would be {x - 142}, but since we don't know the value of 'x', we can't provide a specific number.

However, if we are asked to provide a concise answer based on the information given, then we can say that the total number of meals given out is 142."

He has a $2 coupon but finds it expired. After ordering 4 bags, how much will each single bagel cost?","To find out how much each single bagel costs after ordering 4 packs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without any discount.
   Each pack costs $10, and there are 4 packs.
   Total cost = 4 packs * $10/pack = $40

2. Calculate the 10% discount on the total cost.
   Discount = 10% of $40 = 0.1 * $40 = $4

3. Subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final cost.
   Final cost = Total cost - Discount = $40 - $4 = $36

4. Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
   Each pack has 9 bagels, and there are 4 packs.
   Total bagels = 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels

5. Calculate the cost of each single bagel.
   Cost per bagel = Final cost / Total bagels = $36 / 36 bagels = $1 per bagel

So, the cost of each single bagel is $1.

   Total cost of goats: 3 * $500 = $1500

2. Calculate the cost of the cows:
   Number of cows: 2
   Price per cow: $1500
   Total cost of cows: 2 * $1500 = $3000

3. Add the total cost of goats and cows to find the total amount of money John expended:
   Total cost = Total cost of goats + Total cost of cows
   Total cost = $1500 + $3000
   Total cost = $4500

Therefore, the total amount of money John expended is {4500}."

John does this every weekday, but on the weekends he likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead. However, on weekends, he also drinks an additional glass of water in the morning. How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?","To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, let's break it down step by step:

1. John drinks a glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) on weekdays. Since there are 3 meals, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekdays.
2. John also drinks a glass of water before going to bed on weekdays. So, that's an additional 1 glass of water per day on weekdays.
3. On weekdays, John drinks a total of 3 (from meals) + 1 (before bed) = 4 glasses of water per day.
4. Since there are 5 weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.
5. On weekends, John drinks a glass of water with each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) like on weekdays, so that's 3 glasses of water per day on weekends.
6. However, on weekends, John drinks an additional glass of water in the morning, so that's 1 more glass of water per day on weekends.
7. On weekends, John drinks a total of 3 (from meals) + 1 (morning) = 4 glasses of water per day.
8. Since there are 2 weekend days, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day * 2 days = 8 glasses of water on weekends.

How many square feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?","To find the total square feet of fabric Jim needs, we need to calculate the area of each piece of fabric and then multiply it by 2 since he needs two pieces.

First, we find the dimensions of each piece of fabric. The bed is 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide. The bed is 80 feet long (since a king-sized bed is usually 80 inches or 6.67 feet longer than the width, but we're given the length in feet as 80), so the fabric pieces will be 80 + 2 = 82 feet long.

Now, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric: 
Area = Length x Width 
Area = 82 x 10 
Area = 820 square feet

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area by 2: 
Total Area = 2 x 820

1913,"Teresa sells large stuffed animals for four times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold three times as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $240 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $6. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals as L and the number of small stuffed animals as S. We are given that S = 3L.

2. The price of a large stuffed animal is 4 times the price of a small stuffed animal. Since each small stuffed animal costs $6, the price of a large stuffed animal is 4 * $6 = $24.

3. The total amount earned from the sales is $240. This is the sum of the earnings from large and small stuffed animals.

4. The earnings from large stuffed animals are the number of large stuffed animals (L) multiplied by the price of a large stuffed animal ($24). This gives us L * $24.

5. The earnings from small stuffed animals are the number of small stuffed animals (S) multiplied by the price of a small stuffed animal ($6). Since S = 3L, we can substitute S with 3L and get 3L * $6.

6. We can now set up the equation for the total earnings: L * $24 + 3L * $6 = $240.

7. Simplifying the equation, we get 24L + 18L = 240.

8. Combining like terms, we get 42L = 240.

9. To find the value of L, we divide both sides of the equation by 42, which gives us L = 240 / 42 = 5.714 (round to 2 decimal places).

10. Since S = 3L, we can find the number of small stuffed animals by multiplying L by 3: S = 3 * 5.714 = 17.142 (round to 2 decimal places).

However, since the number of items cannot be a decimal, we need to round it down to the nearest whole number. So, we can say {17}."
205,"Kelly has 5 quarters and some dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents and she has left 90 cents, how many dimes does Kelly have originally?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kelly has 5 quarters. 
   - The value of 5 quarters is 5 x $0.25 = $1.25.

2. Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. 
   - She is left with $1.25 - $0.55 = $0.70.

3. After buying the pop, Kelly has 90 cents left. 
   - This means she had $0.70 before spending the 55 cents.

4. Since she had $0.70 before buying the pop and she has 5 quarters, the remaining amount must come from dimes. 
   - The remaining amount is $0.70 - $1.25 (initial amount) = -$0.55, but since she actually had $0.70 before buying the pop, we should consider the value of the 5 quarters and the value of the 55 cents she spent. So, the initial amount was $1.25 and after spending 55 cents, she had $0.70. So the remaining amount of $0.70 must come from the dimes.

5. Since Kelly has 90 cents left and she already has 5 quarters worth $1.25, the total value of her quarters and dimes initially is $1.25 + $0.90 = $2.15.

6. The difference between the total value of her quarters and dimes initially ($2.15) and the value of the quarters ($1.25) is the value of her dimes. 
   - $2.15 - $1.25 = $0.90.

7. Since the value of her dimes is $0.90 and each dime is worth $0.10, we can calculate the number of dimes she has. 
   - $0.90 / $0.10 = 9.

Therefore, Kelly has {9} dimes originally."

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set as x, in the second set as y, and in the third set as z.

From the given information:

1. x = y + 4 (first set retrieved 4 more balls than the second set)
2. z = y / 2 (third set retrieved half as many balls as the second set)
3. Total number of balls retrieved is 19, and 7 of them are green. However, the color of the balls does not affect the calculation, so we can ignore this information for now.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set: x + y + z = 19.

Substituting the expressions for x and z from the first two equations into the total equation, we get:

y + 4 + y + y / 2 = 19

Combine like terms:

2.5y + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

2.5y = 15

Divide both sides by 2.5:

y = 6

x = y + 4
x = 6 + 4
x = 10

Therefore, Rory retrieved {10} tennis balls in the first set of the match."

Let's denote the number of red cars as R. We know that the rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is R - 2.

We also know that the rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is 3(R - 2).

The total number of cars in the rink is 75, and 23 of them are yellow. So, the total number of non-yellow cars (red, green, and blue) is 75 - 23 = 52.

We can now write an equation to represent the total number of non-yellow cars:

R + (R - 2) + 3(R - 2) = 52

Combine like terms:

R + R - 2 + 3R - 6 = 52

Combine R terms:

5R - 8 = 52

Add 8 to both sides:

5R = 60

Divide both sides by 5:

R = 12

So, the rink has 12 red cars.

875,"James is in charge of running messages from the office to each teacher's classroom. If he delivers 0.66 times of one hundred messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, how many messages does he deliver total?","To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu separately, and then add them together.

1. Messages to Ms. Thompson: 
   James delivers 0.66 times of one hundred messages to Ms. Thompson. 
   One hundred messages is 100, so 0.66 times 100 is 0.66 * 100 = 66 messages.

2. Messages to Mr. Yu: 
   James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. 
   Since he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson, he delivers 1/3 * 66 = 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

3. Total messages delivered: 
   Now we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu. 
   Total messages = 66 (to Ms. Thompson) + 22 (to Mr. Yu) = 88 messages.

So, James delivers {88} messages in total."

10,A bumper car rink has 20 red cars. They have 3 fewer green cars than they have red cars. They have 2 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. The rink also has yellow cars.  If the rink has 80 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"To find the number of yellow cars, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The rink has 20 red cars.

2. They have 3 fewer green cars than they have red cars. 
   So, the number of green cars = 20 - 3 = 17

3. They have 2 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.
   So, the number of blue cars = 2 * 17 = 34

4. The total number of red, green, and blue cars = 20 + 17 + 34 = 71

5. The rink has 80 cars in total. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.
   Number of yellow cars = 80 - 71 = 9

She keeps 60 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got twelve cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?","To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide it by the number of cards each student received.

1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards:
   Miss Maria has 8 decks with 30 basketball cards in each deck.
   Total basketball cards = 8 * 30 = 240

2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards:
   Miss Maria has 7 boxes with 50 baseball cards in each box.
   Total baseball cards = 7 * 50 = 350

3. Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has:
   Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards
   Total cards = 240 + 350 = 590

4. Subtract the cards Miss Maria keeps:
   Remaining cards = Total cards - 60
   Remaining cards = 590 - 60 = 530

5. Calculate the number of students:
   Each student received 12 cards.
   Number of students = Remaining cards / 12

781,"Some passengers are riding a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. On the second stop, 21 passengers get off and 3 times fewer passengers get on. If 66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop, how many passengers were initially on the bus before the first stop?","To find the initial number of passengers on the bus, let's break down the information given step by step.

1. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off.
2. The number of passengers who get into the bus at the first stop is 5 times the number who got off. So, 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get in.
3. The net change in the number of passengers at the first stop is 40 (getting in) - 8 (getting off) = 32 passengers.

Now, let's consider the second stop:

4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off.
5. The number of passengers who get in at the second stop is 3 times fewer than the number who got off. This means the number of passengers who get in is 21 / 3 = 7.

The net change in the number of passengers at the second stop is 7 (getting in) - 21 (getting off) = -14 passengers.

6. Since 66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop, we can set up an equation to represent the initial number of passengers (x). The equation would be: x - 32 - 14 = 66.

Simplifying the equation: x - 46 = 66.

Adding 46 to both sides: x = 112.

So, the initial number of passengers on the bus before the first stop is {112}."
488,Ryan’s allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for some weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?,"To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to calculate how much money he has.

1. First, let's find out how much money Ryan earned from doing his chores. Since he earns $6 each week he completes his chores, we need to know how many weeks he did his chores.

However, the problem doesn't provide the number of weeks Ryan did his chores. So, we will assume he earned x dollars.

2. Ryan spent $1.25 each on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. That's a total of 4 ice cream cones. The cost is 4 x $1.25 = $5.

3. Now, we need to subtract the cost of ice cream cones from the money Ryan earned. Let's call the remaining money y. So, y = x - $5.

4. The problem doesn't provide the value of x. However, we can express the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy in terms of x.

5. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. Since Ryan has y dollars left, the number of movie tickets he can buy is y / $6.50.

6. Substituting y = x - $5 into the equation, we get the number of movie tickets as (x - $5) / $6.50.

Since the problem doesn't provide the value of x, we cannot give a specific number of movie tickets Ryan can buy. However, if we assume x is a positive number (since Ryan earned money from doing his chores), we can say that the number of movie tickets is a positive number.

If you want to give a specific answer, you can assume a value for x and calculate the number of movie tickets. For example, if x = $20, then Ryan can buy (20 - 5) / 6.5 = 15/6.5 = {1}."

After spending 50 dollars on fuel and setting aside 100 dollars for his bank deposit, how many pens, each priced at 25 dollars, can he purchase after buying 5 pencils that are priced at 10 dollars each?","To find out how many pens John can purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's total earnings for the week:
   John makes 50 dollars per hour and has worked 6 hours. 
   Total earnings = 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

2. Calculate John's remaining money after spending on fuel and setting aside for the bank deposit:
   John spent 50 dollars on fuel and set aside 100 dollars for the bank deposit.
   Total expenses = 50 + 100 = 150 dollars.
   Remaining money = Total earnings - Total expenses = 300 - 150 = 150 dollars.

3. Calculate the cost of buying 5 pencils:
   Each pencil costs 10 dollars.
   Total cost of pencils = 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.

4. Calculate John's remaining money after buying the pencils:
   Remaining money after buying pencils = Remaining money - Total cost of pencils = 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.

If he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off and helps people on all the other days. How many people does he help? (Remember there are 31 days in March.),"To find the total number of people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th:
   March has 31 days and April has 19 days, so the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50.

2. Calculate the number of days Billy takes off:
   He takes 20% of the days off, so the number of days off is 20% of 50, which is 0.2 * 50 = 10 days.

3. Calculate the number of days Billy works:
   The number of days Billy works is the total number of days minus the number of days off, which is 50 - 10 = 40 days.

4. Calculate the total number of hours Billy works per day:
   Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3.5 hours a day, so the total number of people he can help per day is 2 * 3.5 = 7 people.

5. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps:
   The total number of people Billy helps is the number of days he works multiplied by the number of people he can help per day, which is 40 * 7 = 280 people.

Oranges are the most expensive and cost 3.5 times as much as a banana per piece. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","To find the price for the crate of fruit, we need to find the total cost of all the fruits in the crate and then add them together.

1. The price of one banana is twice as much as one apple, so it is 2 * $0.5 = $1.
2. The price of one orange is 3.5 times as much as one banana, so it is 3.5 * $1 = $3.5.
3. The total cost of the bananas in one crate is 5 * $1 = $5.
4. The total cost of the apples in one crate is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
5. The total cost of the oranges in one crate is 7 * $3.5 = $24.5.

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 0.98 times of one hundred bandages left at the end of the third day. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To solve this problem, we need to work backwards and use the information given to find the initial number of bandages.

Let's denote the initial number of bandages as x.

On the third day, they used half a pack of bandages, which is 25 bandages (since a pack has 50 bandages), and they had 0.98 times of one hundred bandages left. This means they had 98% of the initial number of bandages left after using 25 bandages. 

Let's represent the initial number of bandages as x. The number of bandages left after the third day is 0.98x.

On the first day, they ordered 1.5 bulk packs of bandages, which is 1.5 * 50 = 75 bandages. 

Since they had 0.98x bandages left after the third day, we can represent the number of bandages used from the first day to the third day as x - 0.98x = 0.02x.

The number of bandages used on the second day is 10 fewer than the first day, which is 0.38 * 100 - 10 = 23 bandages.

The number of bandages used from the first day to the second day is 0.38 * 100 = 38 bandages.

The number of bandages used from the first day to the third day is 38 + 23 = 61 bandages.

We know that the number of bandages used from the first day to the third day is 0.02x, so 0.02x = 61 / x.

Now, we can solve for x. 

0.02x = 61
x = 61 / 0.02
x = 3050

So, the initial number of bandages on the first day is {3050}."

And while he had picked up the correct number of beakers, he lost 2 on the way to the lab bench.  In total, how many items has Igor placed on the lab bench?","To find the total number of items placed on the lab bench, we need to determine the number of each item that Igor gathered and then subtract the lost beakers.

1. Test tubes: Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, so Igor gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.

2. Beakers: Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, and Igor picked up the correct number, which is 7 beakers. However, he lost 2 on the way, so Igor placed 7 - 2 = 5 beakers on the lab bench.

3. Petri dishes: Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, so Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.

On those tests, he received: 65, 94, 81, 86, and a certain number.  What is his current math grade?","To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the 5 test scores. 

First, we add up the scores of the 4 known tests: 
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 = 326

Since there are 5 test scores in total, and we have 4 known scores, we need to find the unknown score. Let's call the unknown score 'x'. 

The sum of all 5 test scores is 326 + x. 

To find the average, we divide the sum by 5 (the total number of test scores). 

The formula for the average is: (326 + x) / 5

Since Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 80 or higher in his math class, we need to find the minimum value of 'x' that will give us an average of 80 or higher.

We can set up an equation: (326 + x) / 5 ≥ 80

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:
326 + x ≥ 400

Now, we can subtract 326 from both sides:
x ≥ 74

This means that the unknown score must be 74 or higher. 

Since we don't know the exact value of 'x', we can't find the exact average. However, we can find the minimum average that Wilson can achieve, which is the average of the 4 known scores plus the minimum value of 'x'.

The sum of the 4 known scores is 326. 
The minimum value of 'x' is 74.

The sum of all 5 test scores is 326 + 74 = 400.

The average is: 400 / 5 = 80

Step 1: Calculate the relative speed between Bob and Tom. 
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70.5 mph - 55.5 mph
Relative speed = 15 mph

Step 2: Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we need to find the time it takes for the relative speed to cover this distance.

If Bernice drove 400 kilometers for 5 days, how many kilometers will she still need to drive?","To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

Step 1: Identify the total distance from San Francisco to New York City.
Total distance = 2500 kilometers

Step 2: Identify the distance Bernice has already driven.
Distance driven = 400 kilometers

Step 3: Subtract the distance driven from the total distance to find the remaining distance.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance driven
Remaining distance = 2500 - 400
Remaining distance = 2100 kilometers

So, Bernice still needs to drive {2100} kilometers."
1141,"Paul initially possessed a specific number of marbles. His friend gave him 28 marbles. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. He now has 60 marbles. How many marbles did Paul originally have before his friend gave him 28 marbles?","To find the original number of marbles Paul had, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the original number of marbles as 'x'.
2. Paul's friend gave him 28 marbles. So, the total number of marbles after receiving 28 marbles is 'x + 28'.
3. Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles. This means he lost (1/4) * (x + 28) marbles.
4. After losing the marbles, he has 60 marbles left. So, the equation can be written as:
   (x + 28) - (1/4) * (x + 28) = 60
5. Simplify the equation:
   (x + 28) - (x/4 + 7) = 60
   (4x + 112 - x - 28)/4 = 60
   (3x + 84)/4 = 60
6. Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:
   3x + 84 = 240
7. Subtract 84 from both sides:
   3x = 156
8. Divide both sides by 3:
   x = 52

So, Paul originally had {52} marbles."
77,John fills a 6 foot by 4 foot pool that is 5 feet deep.  It cost some money per cubic foot to fill.  It costs $12 to fill. How much is each cubic foot?,"To find the cost per cubic foot, we need to find the volume of the pool in cubic feet. 

The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet, and 5 feet deep. 

To find the volume, we multiply the length, width, and depth: 
Volume = length * width * depth 
Volume = 6 * 4 * 5 
Volume = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know it costs $12 to fill the pool, and the pool is 120 cubic feet. 

To find the cost per cubic foot, we divide the total cost by the total volume: 
Cost per cubic foot = total cost / total volume 
Cost per cubic foot = $12 / 120 cubic feet 
Cost per cubic foot = $0.10 per cubic foot

Ginger, feeling generous, shared some of her fries with Griffin. Then, Colby decided to take 3 fewer fries than what Kyle had previously taken from Griffin. If Griffin ended up with 27 fries, can you figure out how many fries Ginger shared with Griffin?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin started with 24 pieces of french fries.

2. Kyle grabbed 5 from Griffin's pile. Now, Griffin has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

3. Billy took double the amount that Kyle did. Since Kyle took 5, Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries. Now, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

4. Ginger shared some of her fries with Griffin. Let's call the number of fries Ginger shared 'x'. After Ginger shared her fries, Griffin ended up with 27 fries. Before Ginger shared her fries, Griffin had 9 fries. So, the number of fries Griffin gained is 27 - 9 = 18.

5. Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle had previously taken from Griffin. Since Kyle took 5, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

6. Since Colby took 2 fries and Griffin gained 18 fries, the total number of fries taken by Billy and Colby is 10 + 2 = 12. This means that Ginger shared 18 - 12 = 6 fries with Griffin.

Therefore, {6}."

Of the money Sarah raised, $100 came from donations from her classmates. How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?","To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to calculate the amount raised by each girl and then add them together.

1. First, let's find out how much Alexandra raised:
   Alexandra raised $430.

2. Since Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, we can calculate Kim's amount:
   Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320
   Kim's amount = $430 + $320
   Kim's amount = $750

3. Now, let's find out how much Sarah raised:
   Sarah raised $300.

4. Since Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, we can calculate Maryam's amount:
   Maryam's amount = Sarah's amount + $400
   Maryam's amount = $300 + $400
   Maryam's amount = $700

5. We also know that $100 of Sarah's amount came from donations from her classmates. To find out how much Sarah raised from other sources, we subtract $100 from her total amount:
   Sarah's other amount = Sarah's total amount - $100
   Sarah's other amount = $300 - $100
   Sarah's other amount = $200

6. Now, we can calculate the total amount raised by the girls:
   Total amount = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Maryam's amount + Sarah's other amount
   Total amount = $430 + $750 + $700 + $200
   Total amount = $2080

Miles walked on Monday = 4.5 miles
Miles walked on Tuesday = 27 miles
Total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday = 41 miles

1. Determine the depth of the water on Tuesday.
   Since we don't know the exact depth on Tuesday, let's call it 'x'.

2. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. 
   This can be represented as (2/3)x.

3. We know that on Monday, the depth of the water was 17 feet. However, this information is not directly relevant to finding the depth on Wednesday. But we can use it to find the depth on Tuesday.

4. Since we don't have any information about the change in water level from Monday to Tuesday, let's assume the depth on Tuesday is greater than 17 feet.

5. Let's assume the depth on Tuesday is 'x'. We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the depth on Tuesday and Monday: x > 17.

6. Since the depth on Wednesday is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship: (2/3)x.

7. We can plug in a value for x that is greater than 17 to test the relationship. Let's say x = 20 (a value greater than 17).

8. If x = 20, then the depth on Wednesday would be (2/3)(20) = (40/3) = 13.33 feet.

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is {13.33}."

How many penguins are still left sunbathing?,"To find the number of penguins still left sunbathing, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Total number of penguins: 300
2. One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean: 
   One-third of 300 is 300 / 3 = 100 penguins.
   So, 100 penguins are left after this action.
3. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner: 
   One-third of 300 is 300 / 3 = 100 penguins.
   Since 100 penguins were already left after the first action, we need to subtract 100 from 100 to find the number of penguins left after the second action.
   100 - 100 = 0 penguins left after the second action.
4. Now, we need to find the number of penguins left sunbathing.

After receiving his parents' contribution, how much money does Gabriel still need to buy the car and the phone?","To find out how much money Gabriel still needs, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends.
2. His brother gave him $200, so now Gabriel has $5000 + $200 = $5200.
3. Gabriel needs $10000 for the car and $800 for the phone, so in total, he needs $10000 + $800 = $10800.
4. Gabriel still needs $10800 - $5200 = $5600.
5. Gabriel's parents will contribute 50% of the remaining amount, which is 50% of $5600. 
   To find 50% of $5600, we multiply $5600 by 0.5. So, 50% of $5600 is $5600 * 0.5 = $2800.

How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?","To find the total time it takes Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of soda bottles: 
   Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and Richard wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we divide 24 by 3 to get the number of bottles.
   Number of bottles = 24 / 3 = 8

2. Calculate the total time it takes to set off one row of soda fountains:
   Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and there are 8 bottles, we multiply the time it takes for one bottle by the number of bottles.
   Time for one row = 5 * 8 = 40 seconds

3. Calculate the total time it takes to set off all the soda fountains:
   Since Richard drops 3 candies in each bottle of water at a time, we need to consider the number of rows of bottles.

1. Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'a' and the number of bananas Jamal has as 'b'.

   We know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so we can write an equation:
   b = a + 4

2. We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so we can write another equation:
   Andrea's bananas = b / 2

3. Andrea has 4/5 of ten more apples than Jamal, so we can write an equation:
   Andrea's apples = (a + 10) * 4/5

4. We are given that Andrea has 5.2 times of ten apples, so we can write an equation:
   Andrea's apples = 10 * 5.2
   Andrea's apples = 52

5. Now, we can equate the two expressions for Andrea's apples:
   (a + 10) * 4/5 = 52
   4(a + 10) = 260
   a + 10 = 65
   a = 55

6. Now that we know Jamal has 55 apples, we can find the number of bananas he has:

1. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. Let's call the cost of each additional phone 'x'. Then, the cost of the main phone is 2x.

2. We are given that the main phone plan costs $200. This is the total cost of the main phone and the additional phones. Since there are 50 phones in total, there are 49 additional phones (excluding the main phone).

3. The total cost of the additional phones is 49x. Adding this to the cost of the main phone (2x), we get the total cost of the plan: 49x + 2x = 51x.

4. We are given that the main phone plan costs $200. So, we can set up the equation: 51x = 200.

5. To find the cost of each additional phone (x), we divide both sides of the equation by 51: x = 200 / 51.

6. Now, we can find the total cost of the plan by multiplying x by 51: Total cost = 51x = 51 * (200 / 51) = 200.

However, we are also given that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, and that the main phone plan costs $200. Therefore, the cost of the main phone is 2x, and the cost of the additional phones is 49x. We are given that the total cost of the plan is $200, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 49x = 200.

7. Combining like terms, we get: 51x = 200.

8. Dividing both sides of the equation by 51, we get: x = 200 / 51.

9. Now, we can find the total cost of the plan by multiplying x by 51: Total cost = 51x = 51 * (200 / 51) = 200.

However, this is the same as the cost of the main phone plan. To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to add the cost of the main phone and the additional phones.

10. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, and the main phone plan costs $200, we can set up the equation: 2x + 49x = 200.

11. Combining like terms, we get: 51x = 200.

12. Dividing both sides of the equation by 51, we get: x = 200 / 51.

13. The cost of the main phone is 2x, and the cost of the additional phones is 49x. We are given that the total cost of the plan is $200, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 49x = 200.

14. Combining like terms, we get: 51x = 200.

15. Dividing both sides of the equation by 51, we get: x = 200 / 51.

16. Now, we can find the total cost of the plan by multiplying x by 51: Total cost = 51x = 51 * (200 / 51) = 200.

However, this is the same as the cost of the main phone plan. To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to add the cost of the main phone and the additional phones.

   Each basket has 3 petunias and the cost of each petunia is $3.00.
   So, the cost of petunias in one basket is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
   Since there are 5 baskets, the total cost of petunias is 5 * $9.00 = $45.00.

2. Calculate the cost of sweet potato vines:
   Each basket has 2 sweet potato vines and the cost is not given.
   However, we are not given the cost of sweet potato vines.  So, let's assume the cost of each sweet potato vine is $x.
   The cost of sweet potato vines in one basket is 2 * $x = $2x.
   Since there are 5 baskets, the total cost of sweet potato vines is 5 * $2x = $10x.

3. Calculate the total cost:
   The total cost is the sum of the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines.
   So, the total cost is $45.00 + $10x.

Since we do not have the cost of sweet potato vines, we cannot give a specific numerical answer. However, we can say that the total cost is $45.00 + $10x."
619,Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store. Dean bought 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears. Each toy car cost $2.5 and each teddy bear cost $1.5. His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra $10. How much money does Dean have left?,"To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the toy cars:
   Number of toy cars = 6
   Cost per toy car = $2.5
   Total cost of toy cars = 6 * $2.5 = $15

2. Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears:
   Number of teddy bears = 5
   Cost per teddy bear = $1.5
   Total cost of teddy bears = 5 * $1.5 = $7.5

3. Calculate the total cost of the items Dean bought:
   Total cost = Total cost of toy cars + Total cost of teddy bears
   Total cost = $15 + $7.5 = $22.5

4. Calculate the initial amount of money Dean had:
   Initial amount = $28

5. Calculate the total amount of money Dean has now:
   Total amount = Initial amount + Extra money from his mother
   Total amount = $28 + $10 = $38

6. Calculate the amount of money Dean has left:
   Money left = Total amount - Total cost
   Money left = $38 - $22.5 = $15.5

1112,"In 10 years, Melanie will be some years old. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In 10 years, Melanie will be some years old. Let's call her current age ""x"". Then, in 10 years, she will be x + 10 years old.

2. We are asked to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Let's call the number of years ""y"". So, in y years, her age will be x + y.

3. According to the problem, in y years, her age will be thrice her present age, which is 3x. So, we can set up the equation: x + y = 3x.

4. We can simplify the equation by subtracting x from both sides: y = 2x.

5. We are also given that in 10 years, Melanie will be some years old, which means her age in 10 years will be 3x. So, we can set up another equation: x + 10 = 3x.

6. We can simplify this equation by subtracting x from both sides: 10 = 2x.

7. Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 2: x = 5.

8. Now that we know Melanie's current age is 5, we can find the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age by substituting x into the equation y = 2x: y = 2(5) = 10.

However, we are looking for the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age, not the number of years it will take for her age to be 3 times her age in 10 years. 

We can set up the equation: x + y = 3(x + y). 

Simplifying the equation, we get: x + y = 3x + 3y.

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: y = 2x + 3y.

Subtracting 3y from both sides, we get: -2y = 2x.

Dividing both sides by -2, we get: y = -x.

However, we can't use this equation because we don't know the value of x. 

We can use the fact that in 10 years, Melanie will be 3x. 

We can set up the equation: x + y = 3x.

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: y = 2x.

However, we can't use this equation because we don't know the value of x.

She also bought a pack of grape gum, which she likes, for $2. Wanting to experiment with a new flavor, she bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum. If her total expenditure was $7, how much did she spend on each pack of strawberry gum?","To find out how much Suzie spent on each pack of strawberry gum, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Suzie bought a pack of grape gum for $2.
2. She bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum. 
   Since the grape gum costs $2, the green apple gum costs $2 / 2 = $1.
3. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. 
   - 2 packs are strawberry gum.
   - 1 pack is grape gum.
   - 1 pack is green apple gum.
4. The total expenditure was $7.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the non-strawberry gum packs:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1
Total cost of non-strawberry gum packs: $2 + $1 = $3

Since the total expenditure was $7, and the non-strawberry gum packs cost $3, the total cost of the strawberry gum packs is:
$7 (total expenditure) - $3 (non-strawberry gum packs) = $4

Since there are 2 packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is:
$4 (total cost of strawberry gum packs) / 2 (number of packs) = $2

What is the total amount of money he will make for the day, in dollars, despite these non-billable periods?","To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the income from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons, then subtract the non-billable periods.

1. Calculate the income from the standard rate lessons:
   Charlie has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour. 
   Income from standard rate lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

2. Calculate the income from the reduced rate lessons:
   Charlie has 2 lessons at a reduced rate of 75% of the standard rate (100% - 25% = 75%).
   Reduced rate = 0.75 * $80 = $60 per hour.
   Income from reduced rate lessons = 2 * $60 = $120

3. Calculate the total income:
   Total income = Income from standard rate lessons + Income from reduced rate lessons
   Total income = $320 + $120 = $440

4. Calculate the non-billable periods:
   Charlie spends 30 minutes on a lunch break and 15 minutes on a phone call. 
   Total non-billable time = 30 + 15 = 45 minutes
   Convert the non-billable time to hours: 45 minutes / 60 = 0.75 hours

5. Subtract the non-billable periods from the total income:
   Total income after non-billable periods = Total income - (non-billable time * rate)
   Total income after non-billable periods = $440 - (0.75 * $80)
   Total income after non-billable periods = $440 - $60
   Total income after non-billable periods = $380

1. The teacher started with a 6-inch piece of chalk.
2. On Monday, he used 35% of the chalk, which is 0.35 * 6 = 2.1 inches.
3. After Monday, the teacher has 6 - 2.1 = 3.9 inches of chalk left.
4. Since the teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 3 inches, he can use the chalk for 3.9 - 3 = 0.9 inches more.
5. The teacher uses 10% of the chalk each day, which is 0.1 * 6 = 0.6 inches.

1. In the first 300 seconds, 200 kernels popped.
2. In the next 300 seconds, three times the initial amount popped, which is 3 * 200 = 600 kernels.
3. So, in the first 600 seconds, a total of 200 + 600 = 800 kernels popped.
4. In the next 300 seconds, the popping rate increased to four times the initial rate, which is 4 * 200 = 800 kernels.
5. So, in the first 900 seconds, a total of 800 + 800 = 1600 kernels popped.
6. In the final 300 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half the rate of the past 300 seconds, which is 800 / 2 = 400 kernels.

147,A football team has 1.05 times of one hundred members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  How many players are on the defense?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The football team has 1.05 times one hundred members. 
   This means the team has 1.05 * 100 = 105 members.

2. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as 'd'. 
   Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of players on the offense is 2d.

3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, which is d/2.

4. The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on offense, defense, and special teams.
   Therefore, the total number of players = 2d (offense) + d (defense) + d/2 (special teams) = 105

5. Combining like terms, we get 2.5d = 105

6. To find 'd', we divide both sides by 2.5:
   d = 105 / 2.5
   d = 42

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken. If in the end Griffin had 33 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?","To find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Griffin initially had 30 french fries.
2. Kyle took 6 fries from Griffin, leaving Griffin with 30 - 6 = 24 fries.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 6 = 12 fries.
4. After Billy took his fries, Griffin had 24 - 12 = 12 fries.
5. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, increasing Griffin's total to 12 + x, where x is the number of fries Ginger gave.
6. Colby took 3 less fries than Kyle had taken, which is 6 - 3 = 3 fries.
7. After Colby took his fries, Griffin had 12 + x - 3 = 33 fries.
8. Simplifying the equation, we get 12 + x - 3 = 33, which simplifies to 9 + x = 33.
9. Solving for x, we get x = 33 - 9 = 24.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries.

1105,"In 20 years, Melanie will be 36 years old. In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?","To find Melanie's present age, we need to subtract 20 from her age in 20 years. 

Melanie's age in 20 years = 36
Melanie's present age = 36 - 20 = 16

Now, we need to find the number of years in which her age will be thrice her present age. Let's assume the number of years is x.

Melanie's age in x years = 16 + x
Melanie's age in x years = 3 * 16 (since it's thrice her present age)

Now, we can equate the two expressions:

16 + x = 3 * 16
16 + x = 48

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 48 - 16
x = 32

So, in 32 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

672,John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that of a normal sudoku puzzle. How many bottles of water does he drink while trying to solve an extreme sudoku?,"To find out how many bottles of water John drinks while trying to solve an extreme sudoku, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the time it takes to solve a normal sudoku puzzle. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we can assume it takes him 1 hour to solve a normal sudoku puzzle (2 half hours).

2. Find out how long it takes to solve an extreme sudoku. It is given that an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that of a normal sudoku puzzle. So, it takes 4 * 1 hour = 4 hours to solve an extreme sudoku.

3. Calculate how many half hours are in 4 hours. Since there are 2 half hours in 1 hour, there are 4 * 2 = 8 half hours in 4 hours.

4. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, he will drink 8 bottles of water while trying to solve an extreme sudoku.

1. Marked price: $140
2. Discount percentage: 5% = 0.05 (in decimal form)
3. Calculate the discount amount: 
   Discount = Marked price * Discount percentage
   Discount = $140 * 0.05
   Discount = $7

1186,Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 12 weeks?,"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 12 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in that time period, and then divide by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).

1. First, let's calculate the number of days in 12 weeks:
   There are 7 days in a week. So, 12 weeks will have 12 x 7 = 84 days.

2. Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 84 days:
   Since Claire eats 3 eggs every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day.
   So, in 84 days, she will eat 3 x 84 = 252 eggs.

3. Now, we need to convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

1479,"Mr. Jackson's fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. Additionally, Mr. Jackson also wants to buy 3 packs of colored pencils, each containing 12 pencils, for the art class. However, the number of colored pencils does not affect the number of glue stick packs he needs. How many packs of glue sticks will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?","To determine the number of glue stick packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first need to calculate the total number of glue sticks required.

Since there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks required is:
27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks

Since the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to divide the total number of glue sticks required by 8 to find the number of packs needed. However, since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To find the number of packs needed, we can divide 54 by 8:
54 ÷ 8 = 6.75

Since we can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, we round up to 7 packs.

What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?,"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy, we need to calculate the combined length of the remoras and divide it by the length of the shark, then multiply by 100.

1. First, calculate the combined length of the remoras:
   There are 12 remoras, each 6 inches long. 
   Combined length = 12 * 6 inches = 72 inches

2. Convert the length of the shark from feet to inches (since the length of the remoras is in inches):
   1 foot = 12 inches
   100 feet = 100 * 12 inches = 1200 inches

3. Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras occupy:
   Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Length of shark) * 100
             = (72 inches / 1200 inches) * 100
             = 6%

532,"Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. After that, he found an additional 5 balls in the corner. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as x.

In the first set, Rory retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in all, before finding the additional 5 balls. So, the total number of balls retrieved in the three sets is 19. Adding the 5 balls found later, the total becomes 24.

Now, we can set up the equation:

(x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 24

Combine like terms:

(2x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 24

Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2(2x + 4) + 2x + x = 48

Expand and simplify:

4x + 8 + 3x = 48

Combine like terms:

7x + 8 = 48

Subtract 8 from both sides:

7x = 40

Divide by 7:

x = 40/7
x = 5.71 (approximately)

Since x represents the number of balls retrieved in the second set, it must be a whole number. However, we obtained a decimal value. This suggests that our initial assumption about the number of balls in the second set might not be correct.

Let's re-examine the problem and try a different approach.

Since Rory retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second set, the number of balls in the third set is x/2. The total number of balls in the three sets is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

2x + 2(x + 4) + x = 38

Expand and simplify:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now that we have the correct value for x, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:

Number of balls in the first set = x + 4
= 6 + 4

1. Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:
   Number of milkshakes sold: 60
   Price per milkshake: $5.50
   Total revenue from milkshakes: 60 * $5.50 = $330

2. Calculate the revenue from burger platters:

If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?","To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park, since Gary walks around the edge.
   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
   Here, length = 6 miles and width = 1.5 miles
   Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 1.5) = 2 * 7.5 = 15 miles

2. Convert the perimeter from miles to a distance that can be used with Gary's walking speed in miles per hour.
   The perimeter is already in miles, so we can proceed.

3. Calculate the time Gary spends walking in hours.
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Here, distance = 15 miles and speed = 3 miles/hour
   Time = 15 / 3 = 5 hours

4. Add the time Gary spends on stretching before the walk.
   Time spent walking = 5 hours
   Time spent stretching = 5 minutes = 5/60 hours = 1/12 hours
   Total time = 5 + 1/12 hours

To convert the total time into a decimal, we can find a common denominator:
   Total time = 5 + 1/12 hours = 60/12 + 1/12 hours = 61/12 hours

So, the total time Gary spends walking and stretching is {61/12} hours."

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum on her debts and continues to pay the regular amount for her gym and Netflix, how much does she pay for her debts in a year?","To find out how much Jessica pays for her debts in a year, we need to calculate her total debt payment per month and then multiply it by 12.

1. First, let's calculate 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt:
   - Student loans: $300 * 1.5 = $450
   - Credit card: $200 * 1.5 = $300
   - Mortgage: $500 * 1.5 = $750

2. Now, let's add up the increased minimum payments:
   $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1500

3. Since Jessica continues to pay the regular amount for her gym and Netflix, we don't need to add anything else to her debt payment.

4. To find out how much she pays for her debts in a year, we multiply her monthly debt payment by 12:
   $1500 * 12 = $18,000

So, Jessica pays {18,000} for her debts in a year."

The lifespan of a DVD is 1000 plays. 

DVD 1 has been used 356 times. 
DVD 2 has been used 135 times.

Total number of times used = 356 + 135 = 491 times

Total lifespan = 1000 plays

1. Tom purchased a music disc for $4 and a set of headphones for an unknown price. His total expenditure was $48.

Let's denote the price of the headphones as 'x'. We can write the equation for Tom's total expenditure as:

4 + x = 48

2. We need to find the price of the headphones (x). To do this, we'll subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x = 48 - 4
x = 44

So, the price of the headphones is $44.

3. Now, we need to find out how many additional music discs Tom could have afforded if he had chosen not to purchase the headphones. To do this, we'll subtract the cost of the headphones from Tom's total expenditure:

Additional money Tom has = 48 - 44
Additional money Tom has = 4

4. Since each music disc costs $4, we can find out how many additional music discs Tom could have afforded by dividing the additional money he has by the cost of each music disc:

Additional music discs Tom could have afforded = 4 / 4
Additional music discs Tom could have afforded = 1

1. The initial price of the toy in November is $40.
2. In December, the price went up by 80%. To find the new price, we'll calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.

80% of $40 = 0.8 * $40 = $32
New price in December = $40 + $32 = $72

3. In January, the price was reduced by half. To find the final price, we'll divide the December price by 2.

Final price in January = $72 / 2 = $36

Given:
- Andrea has 52 apples.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.

Let's start by finding the number of apples Jamal has. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as 'x'. Then, the number of bananas Jamal has is 'x + 4'.

We know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, the number of bananas Andrea has is (x + 4) / 2.

Since Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal must have more apples. Let's assume Jamal has 'y' apples. We already know that 'x' is the number of apples Jamal has, but we need to find the total number of apples Jamal has, which is 'y'. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, 'x' is the number of apples Jamal has.

Now, let's set up an equation for the number of bananas Andrea has, which is (x + 4) / 2 = 52 (since Andrea has 52 apples and half as many bananas as Jamal). 

We can solve for x: 
(x + 4) / 2 = 52
x + 4 = 104
x = 100

Now that we know x is 100, we can find y, which is the total number of apples Jamal has. However, we already know x is the number of apples Jamal has. So, Jamal has 100 apples.

Now that we know Jamal has 100 apples, we can find the number of bananas Jamal has: x + 4 = 104.

Now that we know Jamal has 104 bananas, we can find the number of bananas Andrea has: (x + 4) / 2 = 104 / 2 = 52.

Now that we know the number of bananas Andrea has, we can find the total number of fruits.

Total number of fruits = (Andrea's apples + Jamal's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's bananas)
Total number of fruits = (52 + 100 + 52 + 104)

To simplify this, we can multiply the whole number part ($100) by 5 to make the denominator of the fraction the same, which results in $500.

Now, we can add the fraction (1/5)x to $500 by converting $500 to a fraction with the same denominator, which is $5000/5.

1652,"Greta wanted brownies for her birthday.  She made a batch for herself; one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  After the party, Greta decided to give 1/4 of the remaining brownies to her neighbor. How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire day?","To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she had initially and then subtract the number of brownies eaten or given away.

1. Greta made a batch of one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself. 
   1 dozen = 12 brownies

2. At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.
   1/2 dozen = 6 brownies
   Total brownies so far = 12 + 6 = 18

3. When she arrived home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting.
   4 dozen = 4 * 12 = 48 brownies
   Total brownies so far = 18 + 48 = 66

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   1 1/2 dozen = 1.5 * 12 = 18 brownies
   Total brownies eaten = 66 - 18 = 48

5. Greta decided to give 1/4 of the remaining brownies to her neighbor.
   Since Greta had 66 brownies initially and 48 were eaten, she had 66 - 48 = 18 brownies left.
   1/4 of 18 brownies = 18 / 4 = 4.5 brownies
   Total brownies given away = 48 + 4.5 = 52.5

6. To find out how many brownies Greta had left, we subtract the total brownies given away from the initial total.
   Initial total = 66
   Total brownies given away = 52.5
   Brownies left = 66 - 52.5 = 13.5

So, Greta had {13.5} brownies left over from the entire day."
1346,"Leah just got a new kitten. Spaying her cost $2000, her 30 vaccines costs $200 each, and the kitten broke 40 vases that cost $120 each. How much has the kitten cost so far?","To find the total cost of the kitten, we need to calculate the cost of spaying, vaccines, and the broken vases.

1. Spaying cost: $2000
2. Vaccine cost: 
   - Number of vaccines: 30
   - Cost per vaccine: $200
   - Total vaccine cost: 30 * $200 = $6000
3. Broken vase cost: 
   - Number of vases: 40
   - Cost per vase: $120
   - Total vase cost: 40 * $120 = $4800

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Spaying cost: $2000
- Vaccine cost: $6000
- Broken vase cost: $4800
- Total cost: $2000 + $6000 + $4800 = $12,800

So, the kitten has cost Leah $12,800 so far. {12800}"

And when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 116,000 pounds of gravel. How many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?","To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds Gordy's truck can carry.
   Gordy's truck can haul 8,000 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Since Gissela's truck can carry 40,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 40,000 + 8,000 = 48,000 pounds.

2. Calculate the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.
   Gissela's truck can carry 40,000 pounds and Gordy's truck can carry 48,000 pounds. So, their combined capacity is 40,000 + 48,000 = 88,000 pounds.

3. Find out how many pounds Gary's truck can carry.
   The three trucks combined can haul a total of 116,000 pounds of gravel. Since Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry 88,000 pounds together, Gary's truck can carry 116,000 - 88,000 = 28,000 pounds.

So, the final answer is {28,000}."

If there is a 10% tax on all nonfood items how much did everything cost.","To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of non-food items with a 10% tax and add it to the cost of food items.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of non-food items (excluding tax):
- Light bulbs: 3.5 dollars
- Cups: 3.5 dollars
- Roach traps: 4 dollars
Total non-food items cost: 3.5 + 3.5 + 4 = 11 dollars

Step 2: Calculate the tax on non-food items:
Tax rate: 10% or 0.1
Tax amount: 11 * 0.1 = 1.1 dollars

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of non-food items (including tax):
Total non-food items cost (including tax): 11 + 1.1 = 12.1 dollars

Step 4: Calculate the cost of food items:
- Milk: 2.5 dollars
- Eggs: 3.5 dollars
Total food items cost: 2.5 + 3.5 = 6 dollars

She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?","To find out how many students Miss Maria has, we need to calculate the total number of cards she has and then divide it by the number of cards each student received.

1. Calculate the total number of basketball cards:
   - 6 decks with 40 cards in each deck (since basketball cards are in decks of 40)
   - Total basketball cards = 6 * 40 = 240

2. Calculate the total number of baseball cards:
   - 5 boxes with 40 cards in each box
   - Total baseball cards = 5 * 40 = 200

3. Calculate the total number of cards:
   - Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards
   - Total cards = 240 + 200 = 440

4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so we subtract those from the total:
   - Remaining cards = Total cards - 50
   - Remaining cards = 440 - 50 = 390

5. Since each student got 10 cards, we divide the remaining cards by 10:
   - Number of students = Remaining cards / 10
   - Number of students = 390 / 10
   - Number of students = 39

If Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, how much will each pump cost, in cents?","To find the cost of each pump, we need to first find the total cost of the shampoo in cents. 

1. Convert the cost of the shampoo to cents: 
   $25.20 * 100 = 2520 cents

2. Find the total number of washes: 
   The directions say 2 pumps will give 120 washes, so 1 pump will give 120 / 2 = 60 washes.

3. Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes is equal to the total number of pumps. 
   Total number of pumps = 60

4. Now, we can find the cost of each pump by dividing the total cost by the total number of pumps:

1. The younger male sibling is 12 years old, and his age is half that of his elder brother. 
   So, the elder male sibling's age is 12 * 2 = 24 years.

2. Each of the female siblings is 16 years old, and there are 3 of them.

If today Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and some 1-hour lessons with a veteran, and the total amount of money he will make for the day is $440 in dollars. How many 1-hour lessons does Charlie give to the veteran?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour. 
   Total amount earned from standard lessons = 4 * $80 = $320

2. The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440.
   So, the amount earned from veteran lessons = $440 - $320 = $120

3. Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veteran lessons.
   New rate for veteran lessons = $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

4. Let's say Charlie gives x lessons to veterans.
   Total amount earned from veteran lessons = $60 * x = $120

5. To find the number of lessons Charlie gives to veterans, we need to solve the equation:

The other plane flies exclusively to Poland. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?","To find the number of flights to France by the first plane, we need to break down the information step by step.

1. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it goes to Greece for 3/4 of the total flights and to other destinations (France and Germany) for the remaining 1/4.

2. The remaining 1/4 of the flights are split equally between France and Germany. This means the first plane goes to France for half of the remaining 1/4 of the flights.

3. To find the number of flights to France, we need to calculate half of 1/4 of the total flights. Since 1/4 is the same as 4/16, half of 4/16 is 2/16.

When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then four pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole three quarters of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving six behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?","To find the initial number of french fries, let's work backwards from the last event.

1. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 6 behind. This means there were 7 fries before the ants took one.

2. A raccoon stole three quarters of the remaining fries. Let's call the number of fries the raccoon stole 'x'. This means the raccoon stole 3/4 of 7 fries, which is 5.25 fries. However, the raccoon can't steal a fraction of a fry, so it must have stolen 5 fries, leaving 2 fries.

3. Four pigeons bullied the seagull away from the food and each pigeon ate three fries. This means the pigeons ate a total of 4 x 3 = 12 fries. So, there were 2 + 12 = 14 fries left before the pigeons ate.

4. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Dave ate 20 fries, so the seagull ate 20 / 2 = 10 fries. This means there were 14 + 10 = 24 fries left before the seagull ate.

5. A hungry seagull stole the pack out of Dave's hand, but we don't know how many fries were left in the pack after Dave ate 20 fries. Let's call the initial number of fries 'x'. Dave ate 20 fries, leaving x - 20 fries. The seagull ate 10 fries, leaving x - 20 - 10 = x - 30 fries.

Now we have two equations: 
x - 30 = 24 and x - 20 = 24 + 10 = 34. Solving the first equation, we get x = 54.

However, we need to check the second equation. Solving it, we get x = 54. Since both equations give the same result, we can be confident in our answer.

Therefore, {54}"

Ants, who had just finished carrying off a breadcrumb weighing 0.01 grams, carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries.
2. A seagull stole the pack and ate half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. 
   - Since Dave ate 14, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   - So, the pack now has 14 + 7 = 21 french fries left.

3. Three pigeons, each eating 3 fries, ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 french fries.
   - Now, the pack has 21 - 9 = 12 french fries left.

4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. 
   - Two-thirds of 12 is (2/3) * 12 = 8.
   - So, the raccoon stole 8 fries, leaving 12 - 8 = 4 fries.

5. Ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 4 - 1 = 3 fries behind.

So, initially, the pack had 3 + 4 = 7 french fries that were not eaten or stolen, and then Dave ate 14 french fries before the pack was stolen. 

The total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 14 (Dave's fries) + 7 (fries left after the seagull's share) = 21."

In the midst of this, his friend, Timmy, was throwing cheese slices at the balloons as well, who threw 4 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, but Benny didn't count those. If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow, regardless of how many cheese slices Timmy threw?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. 
   Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as 'y'. 
   Since there are 20 red balloons, the total number of bologna pieces thrown by Benny at red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.

2. The total number of bologna pieces thrown by Benny at all balloons is 58. 
   The number of bologna pieces thrown at yellow balloons is 3y. 
   So, we can write the equation: 40 + 3y = 58.

In addition, Sophia decided to buy 2 onions and 1 more potato. how many onions and potatoes in total did Sophia buy at the market?","To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to first determine how many she bought initially and then add the additional items she purchased.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide the number of items Rose bought by 4 to find out how many Sophia bought initially.

Initial onions bought by Sophia = 12 / 4 = 3
Initial potatoes bought by Sophia = 4 / 4 = 1

Now, we know Sophia initially bought 3 onions and 1 potato. In addition, she decided to buy 2 more onions and 1 more potato.

Total onions bought by Sophia = 3 (initial) + 2 (additional) = 5
Total potatoes bought by Sophia = 1 (initial) + 1 (additional) = 2

Total items bought by Sophia = 5 (onions) + 2 (potatoes) = 7

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles at the same point. If the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 0.006 times of one million gallons on the third day, calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point.","To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to calculate the amount of water on each day and add them together.

1. Initial amount of water: 
   0.004 times of one million gallons = 0.004 * 1,000,000 = 4000 gallons

2. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles:
   2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons

3. On the third day, the amount of water increases by 0.006 times of one million gallons:
   0.006 * 1,000,000 = 6000 gallons
   Total amount of water on the third day = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons

1. Sophia had $100 initially.
2. She gave 1/5 of her money to Jack. To find out how much she gave, we need to calculate 1/5 of $100:
   1/5 * $100 = $20
3. So, Sophia gave $20 to Jack.
4. After receiving the money, Jack had $120.
5. To find out how much Jack had before Sophia gave him $20, we need to subtract $20 from $120:
   $120 - $20 = $100

Therefore, Jack had $100 before Sophia gave him 1/5 of her money.

In June, a fraction of the employees' contracts expired. The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $168000. Calculate the fraction of employees that did not expire by the end of June.","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May.

In May, they hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
The total amount paid to each employee in May = $15 * 40 = $600
Total amount paid to 40 employees in May = $600 * 40 = $24000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June.

Let's assume that x fraction of the employees' contracts expired. This means (1 - x) fraction of the employees did not expire.
Total number of employees who did not expire = 40 * (1 - x)
Total amount paid to these employees in June = $15 * 40 * (1 - x) = $600 * (1 - x)
Total amount paid to all employees in June = $600 * (40 - 40x)

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.

Total amount paid in May + Total amount paid in June = $168000
$24000 + $600 * (40 - 40x) = $168000

Step 4: Solve for x.

$24000 + $600 * (40 - 40x) = $168000
$600 * (40 - 40x) = $144000
40 - 40x = 240
-40x = 200
x = -5/20
x = -1/4
But x cannot be a fraction less than zero, as it is a fraction of employees that did not expire. 
We are looking for a fraction of employees that did not expire, so we can calculate (1 - x).
(1 - (-1/4)) = 5/4

Therefore, {5/4}."
638,"The distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is roughly 1955 kilometers. Bernice has been driving for 4 days, covering a distance of 325 kilometers each day. How many kilometers does she have left to drive?","To find out how many kilometers Bernice has left to drive, we need to calculate the total distance she has covered and subtract it from the total distance.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Bernice has covered in 4 days.
Distance covered per day = 325 kilometers
Total days = 4
Total distance covered = Distance covered per day * Total days
Total distance covered = 325 * 4
Total distance covered = 1300 kilometers

Step 2: Subtract the total distance covered from the total distance to find the remaining distance.
Total distance = 1955 kilometers
Remaining distance = Total distance - Total distance covered
Remaining distance = 1955 - 1300
Remaining distance = 655 kilometers

Therefore, Bernice has {655} kilometers left to drive."

How much will each individual razor cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?","To find the cost of each individual razor after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors:
   Since each pack costs $4.50, 2 packs will cost 2 * $4.50 = $9.00.

2. Since they are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will get 8 razors for the price of 4 packs. 
   The cost of 4 packs is 4 * $4.50 = $18.00.

3. Since Heather gets 8 razors for the price of 4 packs, the cost per pack is $18.00 / 4 = $4.50.
   But she only bought 2 packs. So, the total cost of 8 razors is $18.00.

4. Apply the $2.50 coupon to the total cost:
   The total cost after the coupon is $18.00 - $2.50 = $15.50.

5. Calculate the cost per individual razor:
   Since Heather gets 8 razors for $15.50, the cost per individual razor is $15.50 / 8 = $1.93875.

6. Convert the cost to cents:
   $1.93875 = 193.875 cents.

So, the cost of each individual razor after the discount is {193.875}."

On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes. If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","To find out the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the information given:

1. Monday and Tuesday:
   - Watched a 1-hour episode each night: 2 hours
   - Played computer games for 30 minutes each night: 2 * 30 minutes = 1 hour
   - Total time spent on Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (games) = 3 hours

2. Wednesday:
   - We need to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched. Let's call this number 'x'. 
   - Since he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, the total time spent on Wednesday is 0.5x hours.

3. Thursday:
   - Watched a 1-hour episode: 1 hour
   - Watched a 30-minute show: 0.5 hours
   - Total time spent on Thursday: 1.5 hours

4. Friday:
   - Watched two 1-hour episodes: 2 hours
   - Total time spent on Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent on all days: 
3 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 0.5x hours (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 6.5 + 0.5x hours

We are given that Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all. So, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
6.5 + 0.5x = 7

Now, let's solve for x:
0.5x = 7 - 6.5
0.5x = 0.5
x = 0.5 / 0.5
x = 1

So, Frankie watched 1 30-minute episode on Wednesday.

If a small t-shirt is 3 square feet of fabric, a medium one is 4 square feet, and a large one is 6 square feet, and she used 8 medium and 6 large shirts, how many small shirts did she use to make the quilt?","To find the number of small shirts used, we need to first calculate the total area of fabric used for the medium and large shirts. 

1. Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
2. Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet
3. Total area of medium and large shirts: 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 68 square feet

Now, we know the total area of the quilt is 101 square feet. To find the area used by small shirts, we subtract the area used by medium and large shirts from the total area:

4. Area used by small shirts: 101 square feet - 68 square feet = 33 square feet

Since each small shirt is 3 square feet, we divide the area used by small shirts by the area of a single small shirt:

1. Calculate John's total earnings for the week:
   John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours. 
   Total earnings = 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.

2. Calculate John's expenses:
   - Gas: 50 dollars
   - Bank deposit: 100 dollars
   Total expenses so far = 50 + 100 = 150 dollars.

3. Calculate the remaining money after expenses:

906,"Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 70:110. If their total age now is 1620, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 70:110. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 10. This gives us a simplified ratio of 7:11.

2. Let's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a constant.

3. We know that the total age of Darrell and Allen now is 1620. So, we can write an equation:

   7x + 11x = 1620
   18x = 1620

4. To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 18:

   x = 1620 / 18
   x = 90

5. Now that we know x, we can find Allen's age now by substituting x into the expression for Allen's age (11x):

   Allen's age now = 11x
   = 11 * 90
   = 990

6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

   Allen's age 10 years from now = 990 + 10
   = 1000

So, the final answer is {1000}."

After redeeming all her coupons and giving each student their apple juice lunch, the teacher still have 842 bottles, how many bottles of apple juice does the each coupon be redeemed for?","To find out how many bottles of apple juice each coupon is redeemed for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of bottles given to the students:
   Each student gets 2 bottles, and there are 29 students. 
   Total bottles given = 2 * 29 = 58 bottles.

2. The teacher still has 842 bottles after redeeming all the coupons. 
   This means the total number of bottles initially available is 842 + 58 = 900 bottles.

3. Since the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon is redeemed for a certain number of bottles, let's call this number 'x'. 
   The total number of bottles is the sum of the bottles given to the students and the bottles remaining after redeeming all the coupons.
   Total bottles = bottles given to students + bottles remaining + (number of coupons * number of bottles per coupon)
   900 = 58 + 842 + (9 * x)
   900 = 900 + 9x
   9x = 0
   x = 0

However, this result doesn't make sense because the teacher cannot redeem a coupon for 0 bottles. Let's re-evaluate our calculation:

4. The total number of bottles initially available is 900. 
   The teacher gives 58 bottles to the students, leaving 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.
   Since the teacher has 9 coupons, and the total number of bottles is 900, the number of bottles redeemed from the coupons is 900 - 842 = 58 bottles.

2328,Last night Rick killed ten wolves and some cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals did Rick kill?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Yesterday, Rick killed 10 wolves and some cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars as C. The total number of animals yesterday is 10 (wolves) + C (cougars).

2. Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. If the number of cougars is C, then the number of wolves is 3C. He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed C - 3 cougars today.

3. The total number of animals today is 3C (wolves) + (C - 3) (cougars).

4. To find the total number of animals killed, we need to add the total number of animals from yesterday and today. 

   Total = (10 + C) (yesterday) + (3C + C - 3) (today)
   Total = 10 + C + 4C - 3
   Total = 7 + 5C

5. We are not given the exact number of cougars (C) killed, but we can still express the total number of animals killed in terms of C.

However, since we are asked to put the concise form of the final answer, we need to find the minimum number of animals Rick killed. 

To do that, let's consider the minimum number of cougars Rick could have killed. Since he killed three fewer cougars today than yesterday, the minimum number of cougars he could have killed yesterday is 3. If he killed 3 cougars yesterday, then he killed 3 - 3 = 0 cougars today.

Now, let's find the minimum number of wolves he could have killed today. Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, and he killed 0 cougars today, he killed 3 * 0 = 0 wolves today.

However, we know that is not possible since he killed 10 wolves yesterday. So let's try the next possible number of cougars he could have killed yesterday. If he killed 4 cougars yesterday, then he killed 4 - 3 = 1 cougar today.

Since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, and he killed 1 cougar today, he killed 3 * 1 = 3 wolves today.

Now, let's find the total number of animals he killed. Yesterday, he killed 10 wolves and 4 cougars, so the total number of animals he killed yesterday is 10 + 4 = 14. Today, he killed 3 wolves and 1 cougar, so the total number of animals he killed today is 3 + 1 = 4.

The total number of animals he killed is 14 + 4 = 18.

So the answer is {18}."

1. Calculate the number of lenses in two boxes:
   2 boxes * 90 lenses per box = 180 lenses

2. Calculate the total cost of two boxes with a 10% discount:
   Original price per box = $100.00
   Discount = 10% of $100.00 = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00
   Discounted price per box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
   Total cost for two boxes = 2 * $90.00 = $180.00

3. Calculate the cost of each pair of lenses:
   Since each pair of lenses is used for one day, we need to divide the total cost by the number of days the lenses can be used, which is 45 days for one box. However, Pete has purchased two boxes, so the total number of days is 90 days.
   Cost per day = Total cost / Total number of days = $180.00 / 90 days = $2.00 per day
   Since a pair of lenses is used for one day, the cost per pair is $2.00.

So, the cost of each pair of lenses is { $2.00 }."

Considering that she doesn't eat eggs on any other occasion, how many dozens of eggs will she consume in 4 weeks?","To calculate the total number of eggs Claire consumes in 4 weeks, we need to break it down into two parts: the eggs from her daily omelet and the eggs from her Sunday cake.

1. Eggs from her daily omelet:
   - She makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, in a week, she consumes 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.
   - In 4 weeks, she will consume 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

2. Eggs from her Sunday cake:
   - She bakes a cake every Sunday, which requires 4 eggs.
   - In 4 weeks, she will bake a cake 4 times (once a week for 4 weeks).
   - So, in 4 weeks, she will consume 4 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 16 eggs.

3. Total eggs consumed in 4 weeks:
   - Eggs from her daily omelet: 84 eggs
   - Eggs from her Sunday cake: 16 eggs
   - Total eggs consumed: 84 eggs + 16 eggs = 100 eggs

4. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
   - 1 dozen = 12 eggs
   - Total eggs consumed: 100 eggs
   - Number of dozens: 100 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 8.33 dozen

6. We know that the total number of female students is 1875. 
   Therefore, the total number of female students can be represented as the sum of female students over 16 and under 16: 3T/8 + T/4 = 1875.

7. Now, let's simplify the equation and solve for 'T':
   3T/8 + T/4 = 1875
   To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8.
   (3T + 2T)/8 = 1875
   5T/8 = 1875
   Multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate the fraction:
   5T = 15000
   Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for 'T':
   T = 3000

So, the total number of students is {3000}."
2002,"The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 10000 feet.  Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 4000 feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. If holding the gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?","To find the distance outside the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we need to determine how far she can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Since she can throw the javelin 4000 feet without the gemstone, she can throw it 3 * 4000 = 12000 feet with the gemstone.

The dragon's flames reach 10000 feet. To find the distance outside the dragon's flames that Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we need to subtract the distance of the dragon's flames from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone.

Distance = 12000 - 10000 = 2000 feet

So, Polly can stand 2000 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

890,"If one person can paint half a house in 10 days, how many hours would it take for 10 people to paint a whole house?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. One person can paint half a house in 10 days. 
   - This means one person can paint half a house in 10 * 24 = 240 hours (assuming a 24-hour day).

2. Since one person can paint half a house in 240 hours, 
   - one person can paint a whole house in 240 * 2 = 480 hours.

3. Now, if 10 people are painting a whole house, 
   - they can paint a whole house in 480 / 10 = 48 hours.

Therefore, {48}."
1733,"John drove for three hours at 60 miles per hour, then he realized he had left something very important at home and turned around and went back. He tried to get home within four hours, but was stuck in traffic for the first two hours. For the next half hour, he drove at 30 miles per hour before being able to drive the rest of the time faster than he had ever done before. If he's 45 miles from home in four hours, how fast is he going the rest of the time?","To find the speed at which John drove the rest of the time, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. John drove for three hours at 60 miles per hour. 
   Distance = Speed * Time = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

2. Since he turned around and went back, he traveled the same distance of 180 miles back home. 
   Total distance traveled so far = 180 + 180 = 360 miles.

3. He was stuck in traffic for the first two hours. 
   Distance traveled in the first two hours = Speed * Time = 60 * 2 = 120 miles.

4. He drove at 30 miles per hour for the next half hour. 
   Distance traveled in the next half hour = Speed * Time = 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.

5. Total distance traveled so far = 360 + 120 + 15 = 495 miles.

6. He has 4 hours in total, and he has already used 3 + 2 + 0.5 = 5.5 hours. 
   Time left = 4 - 5.5 = -1.5 hours. However, since time cannot be negative, this means he has already exceeded his 4-hour limit. This is a contradiction, but we can continue to solve the problem to find the speed at which he drove the rest of the time.

7. He is 45 miles from home in four hours. 
   Since he has already exceeded his 4-hour limit, we will assume that he is 45 miles from home at the end of the 4 hours. 

8. Total distance traveled in 4 hours = 495 + 45 = 540 miles.

9. Distance traveled in the last 1.5 hours = 540 - 495 = 45 miles.

10. Speed = Distance / Time = 45 / 1.5 = 30 miles per hour.

However, this is the speed at which he drove for the last half hour, not the rest of the time. Since he drove faster than he had ever done before, we will assume that he drove at a constant speed for the rest of the time.

11. Speed = Distance / Time = 45 / 1 = 45 miles per hour.

343,"Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones.  It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call. After work, he would enjoy 2-hour movive at home.  How many calls does he deal with during his 5 day work week?","To find out how many calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many minutes Tim spends at work each day. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 6 hours by 60 minutes.

   6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes

2. Since it takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with a call, we divide the total minutes he spends at work by the time it takes to deal with a call.

   360 minutes / 15 minutes/call = 24 calls per day

3. To find out how many calls Tim deals with in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of calls he deals with per day by 5.

   24 calls/day * 5 days = 120 calls

So, Tim deals with {120} calls during his 5-day work week."
1509,"A teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk to write math equations on a chalkboard for his students. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use 20% of the chalk each day. Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than some inches. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, it takes 1 more day to recycle the chalk, what's the length of the chack that the teacher will recycle?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 20% of it each day. 

2. On Monday, he uses 45% of the chalk. To find out how much chalk is left, we need to find 45% of 5 inches and subtract it from 5 inches.

   45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches
   Chalk left after Monday = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches

3. After Monday, the teacher goes back to using 20% of the chalk each day. It takes 1 more day to recycle the chalk, which means the teacher uses 20% of the chalk on Tuesday and then the chalk is recycled.

4. To find out how much chalk is used on Tuesday, we need to find 20% of the chalk left after Monday.

   Chalk left after Monday = 2.75 inches
   Chalk used on Tuesday = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches

5. The chalk is recycled when it is smaller than some inches. We know that the chalk is recycled after Tuesday, so the chalk left after Tuesday must be smaller than that inch.

   Chalk left after Tuesday = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.2 inches

   Since the chalk is recycled when it is smaller than some inches, the chalk will be recycled when it is smaller than 2.2 inches.

Therefore, {2.2}."
902,"A rancher is purchasing food for his equines. He gets a mix of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Sugar cubes are an occasional indulgence, so he only gets two boxes, each weighing 1 pound, for all the horses. He only needs enough carrots to feed the horses while they are still fresh, so he gets four bags, each weighing 12 pounds. Hay is the primary food source for his horses, so he gets forty-two bales, each weighing 75 pounds. Oats are a necessary addition to the hay, so he gets twenty sacks, each weighing 65 pounds. If his ranch vehicle can transport 2250 pounds per trip, how many trips does the rancher need to make to move all the food?","To find the total number of trips the rancher needs to make, we need to calculate the total weight of all the food and then divide it by the weight his ranch vehicle can transport per trip.

1. Calculate the total weight of sugar cubes:
   2 boxes * 1 pound per box = 2 pounds

2. Calculate the total weight of carrots:
   4 bags * 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds

3. Calculate the total weight of hay:
   42 bales * 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds

4. Calculate the total weight of oats:
   20 sacks * 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds

5. Calculate the total weight of all the food:
   2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) = 3400 pounds

6. Calculate the number of trips needed:
   Total weight of food / weight per trip = 3400 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1.51 trips

Since the rancher can't make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make {2} trips to move all the food."
1069,"Mark is planning a surprise party for his wife and is considering two venues. The first venue charges a flat fee not including food, which Mark estimates will cost an additional $5 per person. The second venue charges $25 per person, with food included in the price. If Mark has 10 guests to attend the party to make the cost equal to the first venue, how much is the flat fee for the first venue?","To find the flat fee for the first venue, we need to set up an equation that makes the costs of both venues equal.

Let's denote the flat fee for the first venue as F and the number of guests as G. We are given that G = 10.

The cost for the first venue is F + (5 * G), since it charges a flat fee plus an additional $5 per person for food.

The cost for the second venue is 25 * G, since it charges $25 per person and includes food in the price.

Since we want the costs to be equal, we can set up the following equation:

F + (5 * G) = 25 * G

Substitute G = 10 into the equation:

F + (5 * 10) = 25 * 10

F + 50 = 250

Subtract 50 from both sides:

F = 200

Therefore, the flat fee for the first venue is {200}."
2079,"Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Bill also makes 20 chocolate milkshakes a day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?","To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type and add them together.

1. Rolls:
   Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long. 
   So, the total length of rolls in inches is 300 * 4 = 1200 inches.
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length to feet by dividing by 12:
   1200 / 12 = 100 feet.

2. Chocolate croissants:
   Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
   So, the total length of croissants in inches is 120 * 6 = 720 inches.
   Converting this to feet:
   720 / 12 = 60 feet.

3. Baguettes:
   Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long.
   So, the total length of baguettes is 60 * 2 = 120 feet.

4. Chocolate milkshakes:
   The length of the chocolate milkshakes is not relevant to the total length of the baked goods, as they are not being put end to end with the other baked goods.

Now, let's add up the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes:
100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

So, the total length of the baked goods when put end to end is {280}."

How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 days?","To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to calculate the total minutes he used and subtract that from his total plan minutes.

1. Calculate the total minutes Jason used for calls with his boss:
   Since Jason has a 15.5-minute call with his boss every day and there are 30 days in the month, we multiply the daily minutes by the number of days:
   15.5 minutes/day * 30 days = 465 minutes

2. Add the extra minutes Jason used for calls with other people:
   Jason used 300 extra minutes for calls with other people.

3. Calculate the total minutes Jason used:
   Total minutes used = minutes used for boss calls + extra minutes
   Total minutes used = 465 minutes + 300 minutes
   Total minutes used = 765 minutes

4. Subtract the total minutes used from Jason's total plan minutes:

He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?,"To find the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine which type of wood is the cheapest and how many sticks he can make from it.

1. A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and yields 400 sticks. 
2. A 2 x 4 piece of wood is not mentioned as a price, but we know a 2 x 8 costs $6. Since a 2 x 8 is twice as long as a 2 x 4, we can assume the price of a 2 x 4 is half the price of a 2 x 8, which is $3.
3. With $24, Frederick can buy 24 / 3 = 8 2 x 4 pieces of wood.

How much money does Derrick make in June if he sells all the doughnuts?","To find the total amount of money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts Derrick makes in a day:
   Since he makes 10 dozen doughnuts, and 1 dozen = 12, 
   10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

2. Calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day:
   Since he sells each doughnut for $2, 
   120 doughnuts per day * $2 per doughnut = $240 per day.

3. Calculate the discount Derrick gives:
   He gives a 20% discount on the price of each doughnut. 
   To find the discount amount, we multiply the price by the discount percentage:
   $2 * 0.20 = $0.40 discount per doughnut.

4. Calculate the new price of each doughnut after the discount:
   The original price is $2, and the discount is $0.40, 
   so the new price is $2 - $0.40 = $1.60 per doughnut.

5. Calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in a day after the discount:
   Since he sells 120 doughnuts per day at $1.60 each, 
   120 * $1.60 = $192 per day.

6. Calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June:

Increase in price = 5% of $1050 = 0.05 x $1050 = $52.50
Price after Year 2 = $1050 + $52.50 = $1102.50

Year 3:
Original price for this year = $1102.50
Increase in price = 5% of $1102.50 = 0.05 x $1102.50 = $55.13

Step 1: Find the distance James swam before stopping.
James swims 70% of the 30-mile lake.
Distance swum = 0.7 * 30 miles = 21 miles.

Step 2: Find the time it took James to swim the first 21 miles.

Step 6: Find the time it took James to swim the remaining 9 miles.
Time = Distance / Speed = 9 miles / 1.5 mph = 6 hours.

Step 7: Find the total time it took James to get across the lake.
Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time = 7 hours + 3.5 hours + 6 hours = 16.5 hours.

1313,"On a certain day, the total cost of inflating 15 helium balloons was $750. Three days later, the cost of inflating each balloon was increased by $15. How much did Bentley pay to fill 150 balloons if he went to fill them after the price increase?","To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. The initial cost of inflating 15 helium balloons was $750. We need to find the cost of inflating one balloon initially. 

   Cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
   Cost per balloon = $750 / 15
   Cost per balloon = $50

2. Three days later, the cost of inflating each balloon was increased by $15. So, the new cost per balloon is:

   New cost per balloon = Initial cost per balloon + Increase
   New cost per balloon = $50 + $15
   New cost per balloon = $65

3. Now, we need to find the total cost of inflating 150 balloons at the new cost per balloon.

   Total cost = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
   Total cost = $65 * 150
   Total cost = $9750

So, Bentley paid $9750 to fill 150 balloons after the price increase.

87,Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. She decorates each plant with six pebbles. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?,"To find the total amount of water Crista needs, we need to calculate the water required for each type of plant and then add them up.

1. 4 plants need half a cup of water:
   - 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

2. 8 plants need 1 cup of water:
   - 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

3. The rest of the plants (20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants) need a quarter of a cup of water:
   - 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Now, let's add up the water required for all the plants:
- 2 cups (for 4 plants) + 8 cups (for 8 plants) + 2 cups (for 8 plants) = 12 cups

So, Crista needs {12} cups of water every day for her plants."

She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $1500 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $800 to assist her. If Erika now only needs an extra $500 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?","To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, let's break down the information given.

1. The original price of the laptop is $6000.
2. The price is reduced by $2000 if she trades in her old laptop, making the new price $6000 - $2000 = $4000.
3. Erika needs an extra $500 to buy the laptop, so she currently has $4000 - $500 = $3500.
4. Erika has been paid $1500 for her part-time job and her mom has given her $800.
5. So, in total, Erika has $1500 + $800 = $2300 from her job and her mom.
6. Since Erika now has $3500 and she has $2300 from her job and her mom, the amount of money she has in her purse is $3500 - $2300 = $1200.

1. Elise writes the alphabet once: There are 26 letters in the alphabet, so she writes 26 letters.
2. She writes half of the alphabet once: Half of the alphabet is 26 / 2 = 13 letters. So, she writes 13 letters this time.
3. She re-writes everything she has already written: This means she re-writes the 26 letters from the first step and the 13 letters from the second step. So, she re-writes 26 + 13 = 39 letters.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet. How tall is the shortest tree?,"To find the height of the shortest tree, let's break down the information given:

1. The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.
2. The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined.
   Let's denote the height of the shortest tree as 'x'. 
   The height of the second tree is 'x + 5' (since it's 5 feet more than the shortest tree).
   The combined height of the two trees is 'x + (x + 5)' = '2x + 5'.
   Since the tallest tree's height is twice the combined height of the two trees, we can write the equation: 34 = 2(2x + 5).
3. Solve the equation: 
   34 = 2(2x + 5)
   34 = 4x + 10
   Subtract 10 from both sides: 24 = 4x
   Divide both sides by 4: 6 = x

So, the height of the shortest tree is 6 feet. {6}"

If each pan holds 12 cupcakes, and each pan must contain only one type of cupcakes (either vanilla or chocolate), how many pans worth of cupcakes should she bake to use up all her sprinkles while maintaining an equal number of vanilla and chocolate cupcakes?","To find out how many pans Mary should bake, we need to determine how many cupcakes she needs to bake in total and then divide that number by 12, since each pan holds 12 cupcakes.

First, let's calculate the total number of cupcakes Mary can decorate with her sprinkles. Since each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes and she has 6 jars, she can decorate 6 * 8 = 48 cupcakes.

Since Mary wants an equal number of vanilla and chocolate cupcakes, she will need to bake half of the total number of cupcakes as vanilla and half as chocolate. So, she will need to bake 48 / 2 = 24 cupcakes of each type.

Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes and each pan must contain only one type of cupcakes, Mary will need to bake 24 / 12 = 2 pans of vanilla cupcakes and 2 pans of chocolate cupcakes.

He needed to take another test of  80 questions tomorrow. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?","To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed and subtract that from the total number of questions he had to complete.

First, let's find out how many questions Mark completed in each test.

For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. 

Since 8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions per 8 hours, Mark can complete 40 questions in 8 hours. However, he had 75 questions to complete. So, he completed 75 - 40 = 35 questions in the first test.

For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

Since 6 hours * 5 questions per hour = 30 questions per 6 hours, Mark can complete 30 questions in 6 hours. However, he had 100 questions to complete. So, he completed 100 - 30 = 70 questions in the second test.

Now, let's find out how many questions Mark can complete in 8 hours for the third test. We already know that Mark can complete 40 questions in 8 hours.

So, for the third test, Mark can complete 40 questions in 8 hours. 

Now, let's find the number of questions Mark left incomplete. 

Mark had 80 questions to complete in the third test and can complete 40 questions in 8 hours. So, he will complete 40 questions in 8 hours and will have 80 - 40 = 40 questions left incomplete.

How much money does he spend in total on ties?","To find the total amount spent on ties, we need to calculate the cost of the red ties and add it to the cost of the blue ties.

1. First, we find the number of blue ties purchased. Since each blue tie costs $40 and John spends $200 on blue ties, the number of blue ties can be found by dividing the total amount spent by the cost of each blue tie:
   Number of blue ties = Total amount spent on blue ties / Cost of each blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
   Number of blue ties = 5

2. Since John purchases two times the quantity of red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5
   Number of red ties = 10

3. The cost of each red tie is 1.5 times the cost of each blue tie, which is $40. So, the cost of each red tie is:
   Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * Cost of each blue tie
   Cost of each red tie = 1.5 * $40
   Cost of each red tie = $60

4. Now, we can find the total amount spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:
   Total amount spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
   Total amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60
   Total amount spent on red ties = $600

5. Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
   Total amount spent on ties = Total amount spent on blue ties + Total amount spent on red ties
   Total amount spent on ties = $200 + $600

Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and buy one popcorn and a soda at regular price. What's the regular price of popcorn if you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2?,"To find the regular price of popcorn, let's analyze the situation:

1. If you buy a super ticket for $20 and add $1 for popcorn and soda, you pay a total of $21.
2. If you buy a regular ticket for $12 and add the regular price of popcorn and soda, you pay a total of $12 + regular price of popcorn + regular price of soda.
3. Since you saved $2 by buying the regular ticket, the total cost for the regular ticket option is $21 - $2 = $19.
4. Now we can equate the total cost of the regular ticket option to the total cost of the super ticket option: 
   $12 + regular price of popcorn + regular price of soda = $19
5. Since the cost of the soda is the same in both options, we can subtract $12 from both sides of the equation to get:
   regular price of popcorn + regular price of soda = $7
6. We also know that the total cost of the super ticket option is $21, and we added $1 for popcorn and soda, so the regular price of popcorn and soda together is $21 - $1 = $20. However, we know that the regular price of popcorn and soda together is $7. So, we can equate the two:
   $20 = $7 + $1 (we added $1 to the super ticket option, not the regular price of popcorn and soda)
   Since we know that the regular price of popcorn and soda together is $7, and we added $1 to the super ticket option, we can equate the regular price of popcorn and soda to $7 and the $1 to the super ticket option:
   regular price of popcorn + regular price of soda = $7
   $1 = $1 (this is not the answer we are looking for, we are looking for the regular price of popcorn)
7. Let's try to find the regular price of popcorn and soda together by using the super ticket option:
   $21 = $20 (super ticket) + $1 (popcorn and soda)
   We know that the regular price of popcorn and soda together is $7, but we also know that we added $1 to the super ticket option, so we can equate the two:
   $20 = $7 + $1 (we added $1 to the super ticket option, not the regular price of popcorn and soda)
   Since we know that the regular price of popcorn and soda together is $7, and we added $1 to the super ticket option, we can equate the regular price of popcorn and soda to $7 and the $1 to the super ticket option:
   regular price of popcorn + regular price of soda = $7
   $1 = $1 (this is not the answer we are looking for, we are looking for the regular price of popcorn)

Given that the price of gingerbread is $6 per box and apple pie is $15 per box, can you calculate the total amount Sunny raised over the weekend?","To find the total amount Sunny raised over the weekend, we need to calculate the total amount from gingerbread and apple pie sales separately and then add them together.

1. Gingerbread sales:
   - On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 gingerbread boxes.
   - On Sunday, he sold 5 more gingerbread boxes than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 gingerbread boxes.
   - Total gingerbread boxes sold = 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes.

2386,"An apple orchard sells apples in bags of 100. The orchard sold a total of 200,000 apples one day. How much did an orchard earn for selling this at $5 per bag?","To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

1. The orchard sold a total of 200,000 apples.
2. Each bag contains 100 apples.
3. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag: 200,000 / 100 = 2,000 bags.
4. The price per bag is $5.
5. To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag: 2,000 * $5 = $10,000.

So, the orchard earned {10,000}."
832,"If potatoes make hash browns, how many hash browns can you make out of 96 potatoes?","To determine the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes, we need to consider the following steps:

1. The number of hash browns that can be made from one potato is not fixed, as it depends on the size and desired thickness of the hash browns. However, for the sake of calculation, let's assume that one large potato can make about 4-6 hash browns, depending on how they are cut and shredded.

2. Since we're dealing with a large quantity of potatoes, let's assume an average yield of 5 hash browns per potato for simplicity.

3. Now, we can calculate the total number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes by multiplying the number of potatoes by the average yield per potato:

96 potatoes * 5 hash browns/potato = 480 hash browns

Therefore, {480} hash browns can be made out of 96 potatoes."

She also decides to buy three packs of cookies at $1.50 each pack. How much change does Carly get back if she gives one fifty-dollar bill?","To find out how much change Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered and subtract that from the $50 bill.

1. Calculate the cost of hamburgers:
   5 hamburgers at $4 each = 5 * $4 = $20

2. Calculate the cost of potato fries:
   10 packs at $0.30 each = 10 * $0.30 = $3

3. Calculate the cost of fruit drinks:
   5 cans at $2 each = 5 * $2 = $10

4. Calculate the cost of cookies:
   3 packs at $1.50 each = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

5. Calculate the total cost:
   Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 + $4.50 = $37.50

6. Calculate the change:
   Change = $50 - $37.50 = $12.50

So, Carly gets back {12.50}."

If he originally had $120, how much money does he have left?","To find out how much money Howard has left, we need to calculate the total amount he spent at the arcade and subtract it from the original amount.

1. On Monday, Howard spent $6.
2. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as Monday, which is 2 * $6 = $12.
3. On Wednesday, he spent 3 times as much as Tuesday, which is 3 * $12 = $36.
4. The total amount he spent at the arcade is $6 + $12 + $36 = $54.

So, Howard has {66} dollars left."
867,"Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1.5-foot by 1.5-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, 6 more green squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?","To find the total area of Brittany's comforter, we need to find the number of each color square and multiply it by the area of each square (1.5 feet by 1.5 feet).

1. The number of red squares is 14.
2. The number of blue squares is 4 more than red squares, so it's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
3. The number of green squares is 6 more than blue squares, so it's 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
4. The number of white squares is 12 fewer than green squares, so it's 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's calculate the total area of each color square and add them together:
- Red squares: 14 * (1.5 * 1.5) = 14 * 2.25 = 31.5 square feet
- Blue squares: 18 * (1.5 * 1.5) = 18 * 2.25 = 40.5 square feet
- Green squares: 24 * (1.5 * 1.5) = 24 * 2.25 = 54 square feet
- White squares: 12 * (1.5 * 1.5) = 12 * 2.25 = 27 square feet

Adding the total area of each color square together, we get:
31.5 + 40.5 + 54 + 27 = 153 square feet

So, Brittany's comforter is {153} square feet."

If a particular job required 2.25 hours of work and parts worth $60, what was the total amount billed by Patty?","To find the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing, we need to calculate the labor cost, add the service fee, and then add the cost of parts.

1. Labor cost: 
   The labor cost is $35 per hour. Since the job required 2.25 hours of work, we multiply 2.25 hours by $35 per hour.
   Labor cost = 2.25 hours * $35/hour = $78.75

2. Add the service fee:
   The service fee is $40. We add this to the labor cost.
   Total so far = Labor cost + Service fee = $78.75 + $40 = $118.75

3. Add the cost of parts:
   The cost of parts is $60. We add this to the total so far.
   Total amount billed = Total so far + Cost of parts = $118.75 + $60 = $178.75

Therefore, the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing is {178.75}."

While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. On top of that, Mark is considering hiring a DJ for the party, which will cost an additional $100. How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation.

Let's denote the number of guests as 'x'.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus the cost of food for each guest, which is $5x. So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x.

For the second venue, the total cost is the cost per guest, which is $25x, since food is already included.

We also need to add the cost of hiring a DJ, which is $100, to both costs.

So, the total cost for the first venue is 200 + 5x + 100, and the total cost for the second venue is 25x + 100.

Now, we set the two costs equal to each other:

200 + 5x + 100 = 25x + 100

Subtract 100 from both sides:

200 = 25x

Subtract 200 from both sides:

0 = 25x - 200

Add 200 to both sides:

200 = 25x

Divide both sides by 25:

8 = x

Therefore, {8}"

If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much will their gas be, after the cashback rewards? Now, consider that this person also has a coupon for a free car wash worth $10, but the car wash machine is broken and they can't use it. Also, they find a lucky penny on the ground, but it doesn't change the price of the gas.","To find the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the gas without the cashback rewards:
   10 gallons * $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

2. Calculate the total cashback rewards:
   10 gallons * $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

3. Subtract the cashback rewards from the total cost of the gas:
   $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

Now, let's consider the other factors:

4. The person has a coupon for a free car wash worth $10, but they can't use it. This means they won't get any benefit from the coupon.

5. They find a lucky penny on the ground, but it doesn't change the price of the gas. This is a negligible amount and won't affect the total cost.

So, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, without considering the car wash coupon or the lucky penny, is { $28.00 }."
1392,"Garrett is popping popcorn for a snack. As the pan of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds of cooking, then three times that amount in the next 30 seconds. The kernels increase to four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds, but in the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, some kernels that popped also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","To find the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has, we need to calculate the number of kernels that popped in each 30-second interval and add them together.

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels popped three times the initial amount, so 3 * 20 = 60 kernels popped.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the kernels popped four times the initial amount, so 4 * 20 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the kernels popped half the rate of the past 30 seconds, so 0.5 * 80 = 40 kernels popped.

Now, let's add the kernels that popped in each interval together: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels.

Since some kernels popped from residual heat after Garrett took the pan off the heat, we need to add those to the total. However, the problem doesn't specify how many kernels popped from residual heat, so we can't add a specific number to the total.

Since we can't add a specific number of kernels that popped from residual heat, we can't give a specific answer. However, we can give an answer in the form of an inequality. The total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has is at least 200 (the kernels that popped in the 30-second intervals) and possibly more (the kernels that popped from residual heat)."

1. We know that a gallon jar costs $5.5. 
2. We also know that a gallon jar costs $2.5 more than a half-gallon jar. 
   So, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5.5 - $2.5 = $3.
3. Cecelia bought 10-gallon jars. Since the cost of a gallon jar is $5.5, 
   the total cost of 10-gallon jars is 10 * $5.5 = $55.
4. Cecelia also bought 16 half-gallon jars. Since the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3, 
   the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars is 16 * $3 = $48.
5. To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we add the cost of 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

At check out, Marcus shows his loyalty card that gives him some percentage off of his purchase.  Marcus' total bill is $45, what's the discount of his purchase?","To find the discount, we need to calculate the total cost of the items first.

1. Cost of croissants: 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
2. Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
3. Cost of mini quiches: 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
4. Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

Total cost of items: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

Since Marcus' total bill is $45, we need to find the discount he received.

Discount = Total cost of items - Total bill
Discount = $50.00 - $45.00
Discount = $5.00

Since the question asks for the discount as a percentage, we need to find the percentage of the total bill that the discount represents.

Discount percentage = (Discount / Total bill) * 100
Discount percentage = ($5.00 / $45.00) * 100
Discount percentage ≈ 11.11%

So, the discount Marcus received is approximately 11.11%.

Martha, on the other hand, has managed to collect 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. However, there is a twist. The school has decided to deduct 10% of each student's points due to a minor misconduct. After this deduction, how many more points does the class need to collect to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points for the trip?","To find out how many more points the class needs to collect, we need to first calculate the points of each student after the deduction.

1. Adam has 50 points. After deducting 10%, he has 50 - (10% of 50) = 50 - 5 = 45 points.

2. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. 
   30% of Adam's points = 0.3 * 50 = 15 points.
   So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.
   After deducting 10%, she has 65 - (10% of 65) = 65 - 6.5 = 58.5 points.

3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. 
   So, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
   After deducting 10%, he has 35 - (10% of 35) = 35 - 3.5 = 31.5 points.

4. Martha has 3 times more points than Tom. 
   So, Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points.
   After deducting 10%, she has 105 - (10% of 105) = 105 - 10.5 = 94.5 points.

Now, let's add up the points of all the students after the deduction:
45 (45 + 58.5 + 31.5 + 94.5) = 229.5 points.

How much is the milk per gallon?","Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk, but 2/5 of it was expired. 
   To find the amount of expired milk, we multiply 4000 by 2/5:
   4000 * (2/5) = 1600 gallons of expired milk.

2. Since 1600 gallons were expired, the amount of milk that was not expired is:
   4000 - 1600 = 2400 gallons.

3. Mr. Marcellus returned the expired milk and got a refund of $5600. This refund is for the 1600 gallons of expired milk.

How much money was he refunded?","To find the amount of money Mr. Marcellus was refunded, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk: 
   Total amount = Number of gallons * Price per gallon
   Total amount = 4000 * $3.5
   Total amount = $14,000

2. Determine the amount of expired milk: 
   Amount of expired milk = 2/5 * Total amount of milk
   Amount of expired milk = 2/5 * 4000
   Amount of expired milk = 2 * 800
   Amount of expired milk = 1600 gallons

3. Calculate the refund amount: 
   Since Mr. Marcellus paid $3.5 for each gallon, we multiply the amount of expired milk by the price per gallon to find the refund amount.
   Refund amount = Amount of expired milk * Price per gallon

1. Let's assume the cost of each additional phone is x.
2. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the main phone costs 2x.
3. We know the main phone plan costs $20, so we can set up an equation: 2x = $20.
4. Solving for x, we get x = $20 / 2 = $10.
5. Since there are 4 additional phones, the cost of the additional phones is 4x = 4 * $10 = $40.

1. There are 20 students in total, and they are split into two equal groups of boys and girls. 
   So, the number of boys = 20 / 2 = 10
   The number of girls = 20 / 2 = 10

1. Monday and Tuesday: 2 nights * 100 minutes per night = 200 minutes
2. Thursday: 100 minutes + 50 minutes = 150 minutes
3. Friday: 2 nights * 100 minutes per night = 200 minutes

Total minutes watched so far: 200 + 150 + 200 = 550 minutes

Since Frankie watched a total of 700 minutes, the remaining minutes watched on Wednesday are: 700 - 550 = 150 minutes

We know that on Wednesday, Frankie watched a few episodes of a 50-minute show. Let's assume he watched x episodes of 50 minutes each. Then, the total minutes watched on Wednesday would be 50x.

Since we know that the total minutes watched on Wednesday is 150, we can set up the equation: 50x = 150
