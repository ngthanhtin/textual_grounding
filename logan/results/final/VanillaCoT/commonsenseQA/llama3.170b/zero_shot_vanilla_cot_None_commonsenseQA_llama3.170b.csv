7b95825a19d6930d6aed35c7c57a2d82,"James couldn't get comfortable.  There was too much dirt.  He needed to clean out what?
A) ground
B) subway
C) bank
D) bed
E) street","To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. James couldn't get comfortable: This suggests that James is in a situation where he is trying to rest or relax, but something is preventing him from doing so.

2. There was too much dirt: The presence of dirt implies that the environment James is in is not clean.

Considering these two points, we can infer that James is likely in a place where he would normally expect to be comfortable and clean, but the presence of dirt is disrupting this.

Now, let's examine the options:

A) ground: While the ground can be dirty, it's not typically a place where one would expect to be comfortable in the sense of resting or sleeping.

B) subway: A subway can be dirty, but it's not typically a place where one would be trying to get comfortable in the sense of resting or sleeping.

C) bank: A bank is not typically associated with dirt or comfort in the sense of resting or sleeping.

D) bed: A bed is a place where one would normally expect to be comfortable and clean. The presence of dirt in a bed would be disruptive to one's comfort.

E) street: A street can be dirty, but it's not typically a place where one would be trying to get comfortable in the sense of resting or sleeping.

Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is:

e56c56c3cfe50ba0c787c2bd67255be8,"She asked her little boy why, he replied that he didn't know and it was just what?
A) case
B) reason
C) how
D) because
E) answer","To find the correct answer, let's break down the sentence and the options provided.

The sentence is: ""She asked her little boy why, he replied that he didn't know and it was just what?""

We're looking for a word that completes the sentence in a logical and grammatically correct way.

- A) ""case"" doesn't seem to fit well here.
- B) ""reason"" could potentially fit, but it doesn't sound like the most natural completion.
- C) ""how"" doesn't make sense in this context.
- D) ""because"" could work, but it's a bit of an odd construction.
- E) ""answer"" sounds like the most natural completion, especially in the context of someone being asked a question and responding with a lack of knowledge.

However, there's a common idiomatic expression that fits perfectly here: ""just because."" It's a common way for someone, especially a child, to respond when they don't have a specific reason for something.

Given the options, the closest fit to this expression is D) ""because,"" which would make the sentence: ""She asked her little boy why, he replied that he didn't know and it was just because.""

So, the answer is {D}."

A) cape canaveral florida
B) nasa
C) battleship
D) ocean
E) trapeze","To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The performer was ready to put on a show: This indicates that the person is in the entertainment industry, likely in a field that involves performing in front of an audience.

2. Stepped onto the launch platform: The term ""launch platform"" can be associated with various contexts, but given the performer's role, it's unlikely to be related to space exploration or military contexts.

3. Considering the options provided:
   - A) Cape Canaveral, Florida: This is a location associated with space exploration, which doesn't fit the performer context.
   - B) NASA: Similar to option A, this is related to space exploration, not a performer's job.
   - C) Battleship: This is a military context, which also doesn't fit the performer's role.
   - D) Ocean: This is too broad and doesn't directly relate to a performer's job or a launch platform.

E) unprotected","To answer this question, let's consider the typical roles and purposes of a guard. 

1. A guard is usually assigned to protect or watch over something or someone.
2. Options A (""man post"") and B (""attack"") don't seem to be the correct answers, as ""man post"" is more of an action or instruction, and ""attack"" is the opposite of what a guard typically does.
3. Option C (""intimidation"") could be a possible answer, but it's not the primary purpose of a guard.
4. Option D (""prisoner"") is a strong candidate, as guards are often assigned to watch over prisoners in correctional facilities.

E) suburbs","To find a place with no neighbors, we need to consider locations that are isolated or remote. Let's evaluate each option:

A) Housing estate - This is a residential area with multiple houses, so it's likely to have neighbors.
B) Neighborhood - By definition, a neighborhood is a community of people living in close proximity, so it's not suitable for someone who wants no neighbors.
C) Mars - While Mars is a remote planet, it's not currently possible for humans to live there without extensive technological advancements and infrastructure development. However, it's an interesting option to consider in the future.
D) Woods - A remote area in the woods could provide the isolation and solitude someone might be looking for, with minimal chance of having neighbors nearby.
E) Suburbs - Suburbs are typically residential areas on the outskirts of cities, with houses and people living in close proximity, so it's unlikely to find a place with no neighbors.

A) feelings of guilt
B) prison sentence
C) terrible
D) encouragement
E) die","To approach this question, let's consider the consequences of such actions in a societal and legal context.

1. **Feelings of guilt (A)**: While it's possible that someone who starts killing people might experience feelings of guilt, this isn't a universal reaction, especially for individuals who might have psychological conditions that prevent them from feeling remorse. However, it's a plausible outcome for many.

2. **Prison sentence (B)**: In most legal systems around the world, taking someone's life is considered a serious crime, typically resulting in severe penalties, including long prison sentences or even capital punishment in some jurisdictions. This is a very likely outcome.

3. **Terrible (C)**: This option is vague. While the act of killing itself is widely considered terrible, the question seems to be asking about the consequences or reactions one would receive. Thus, this option doesn't directly address the question.

4. **Encouragement (D)**: In the vast majority of societies, killing people is not only against the law but also morally condemned. Encouragement for such actions would be extremely rare and not a societal norm.

5. **Die (E)**: While it's possible that someone who kills others might face capital punishment or be killed in the act, this option is less universally applicable as a direct consequence compared to imprisonment, especially considering the question's phrasing.

Considering these points, the most universally applicable and direct consequence of starting to kill people would be a **prison sentence**. This outcome is not only legally mandated in most jurisdictions but also reflects the societal condemnation of such actions.

A) strong feelings
B) herpes

1. **Strong feelings (A)**: Kissing can indeed evoke strong emotions, but this isn't necessarily a direct result of kissing ""too long.""
2. **Herpes (B)**: Herpes can be transmitted through kissing, but the length of the kiss isn't the primary factor; rather, it's the presence of the virus in the person's saliva.
3. **Shortness of breath (C)**: Prolonged kissing, especially if it's intense or passionate, can lead to a lack of oxygen. This is because the couple might forget to breathe properly or take breaks to catch their breath.
4. **Excitement (D)** and **arousal (E)**: Like strong feelings, excitement and arousal are common responses to kissing, but they aren't necessarily caused by the length of the kiss.

Considering these points, the most direct consequence of kissing ""too long"" would be **shortness of breath** due to the lack of oxygen.

A) london
B) apartment building
C) city
D) falling down
E) town","To answer this question, let's consider the options provided and think about where there is likely to be a variety of flats to choose from.

First, we can eliminate ""D) falling down"" as it doesn't make sense in the context of the question. It's not a location, but rather a state of being.

Next, we can consider ""B) apartment building"". While an apartment building may have multiple flats, it's not necessarily a location where you would find a variety of flats to choose from. It's a specific building, not a broader area.

Now, let's think about ""A) London"", ""C) city"", and ""E) town"". All three of these options could potentially have a variety of flats to choose from. However, ""A) London"" is a specific city, whereas ""C) city"" and ""E) town"" are more general terms.

D) germs
E) spittle","To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the action**: The action described is spitting a lot without noticing. This implies an excessive production or accumulation of a substance that is being expelled through spitting.

2. **Consider the options**:
   - A) **Phlegm**: This is a thick, viscous substance produced by the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. It's more commonly associated with coughing up rather than spitting.
   - B) **Saliva and mouth**: While saliva is indeed something you can spit, the question seems to imply an excessive or unusual condition, which doesn't quite fit with just normal saliva.
   - C) **Disease**: This is too broad and not directly related to the act of spitting itself. Diseases can cause excessive spitting, but it's not a direct answer to what you might have extra of.
   - D) **Germs**: While spitting can expel germs, the question seems to ask about the substance being spat, not the potential contaminants within it.
   - E) **Spittle**: This is another word for saliva or the substance produced in the mouth, but it's more directly related to the act of spitting.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on the information and the context of the question, the most fitting answer is **{E) spittle}**, as it directly refers to the substance being spat. However, it's worth noting that in common usage, spittle and saliva are often used interchangeably, so **{B) saliva and mouth}** could also be considered a correct answer in a broader sense."

A) cloud
B) snow storm
C) billow
D) air
E) snowstorm","To determine where a snowflake forms, let's consider the process of snowflake formation. 

1. Snowflakes are made of ice crystals, which require cold temperatures to form.
2. Clouds are collections of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air, and they can be cold enough for ice crystals to form.
3. Within clouds, water vapor in the air can freeze onto tiny particles, such as dust or pollen, creating small, transparent ice crystals.
4. As the ice crystals move upward within the cloud, they are carried into supercooled water droplets, which freeze onto the crystals, forming larger, more complex ice crystals.
5. This process of accumulation and freezing continues, eventually forming a snowflake.

Considering the options provided:

- A) cloud: This is the correct location where snowflakes form.
- B) snow storm: A snowstorm is a weather phenomenon that occurs when snow falls, but it's not the location where snowflakes form.
- C) billow: A billow is a wave or swell, often referring to a cloud or a wave on the ocean, but it's not a specific location where snowflakes form.
- D) air: While snowflakes do form in the air, this answer is too general, as clouds are a more specific location within the air where snowflakes form.
- E) snowstorm: This is the same as option B, and it's not the correct location where snowflakes form.

1. **Context**: A funeral is a solemn occasion where people gather to pay their respects to the deceased and offer condolences to the family and friends. It's a time for mourning, reflection, and showing respect.

2. **Options analysis**:
   - **A) straightforward**: This attitude might be too casual for a funeral, as it doesn't necessarily convey respect or solemnity.
   - **B) serious**: This is a more appropriate attitude for a funeral, as it shows respect and acknowledges the gravity of the occasion.

2. **Considering the options**:

A) mushroom
B) falling down
C) sweating
D) exhaustion
E) getting tired","To determine what could suddenly stop someone when he or she is running, let's consider the options:

A) mushroom - A mushroom is an object that wouldn't typically cause someone to stop running suddenly. It's not directly related to the physical act of running.

B) falling down - Falling down is a possible reason for someone to stop running, but it's more of an action that happens as a result of another cause, rather than the cause itself.

C) sweating - Sweating is a natural bodily function that occurs during physical activity, including running. While excessive sweating might be uncomfortable, it's unlikely to suddenly stop someone from running.

D) exhaustion - Exhaustion is a state of extreme physical or mental tiredness. It's a plausible reason for someone to stop running suddenly, as the body may not be able to continue the physical activity.

E) getting tired - Getting tired is similar to exhaustion, but it's a more general term. While getting tired can cause someone to slow down or stop running, it's not as sudden or extreme as exhaustion.

A) go to jail
B) cry
C) find god
D) guilty conscience
E) problems","To answer this question, let's think about the consequences of committing murder and how it might impact someone's life and opportunities.

1. **Go to jail (A)**: Committing murder can indeed lead to imprisonment, but the question asks what it could ""prevent"" someone from doing. Going to jail is a consequence, not something that is prevented.

2. **Cry (B)**: Committing murder is unlikely to prevent someone from crying. Emotions like sadness, guilt, or remorse might still lead to crying.

3. **Find God (C)**: While committing murder might complicate someone's spiritual journey or relationship with their faith, it's not a definitive barrier to finding God or spirituality.

4. **Guilty conscience (D)**: Committing murder could indeed lead to a guilty conscience, but the question asks what it could prevent. A guilty conscience is a consequence, not something prevented.

5. **Problems (E)**: This option is vague, but committing murder could lead to numerous problems, both legally and personally. However, like the other options, it doesn't directly answer what committing murder could prevent someone from doing.

Considering the options and the aim to find what committing murder could prevent someone from doing, none directly fit the bill as they all describe consequences rather than things prevented. However, if we're looking for the closest fit based on the typical understanding of prevention in the context of life opportunities or personal growth, we might lean towards **{C} find God**, as it's the only option that could imply a form of personal or spiritual growth that might be hindered by such an action. But this interpretation is a bit of a stretch given the phrasing of the question and the options provided.

Given the direct interpretation of the question and the options, none perfectly fit what committing murder could prevent someone from doing in a straightforward manner."

A) reasonable
B) more money
C) not go to work
D) return to work
E) union","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the question and the options provided.

The question asks about the type of demands unions need to make to go off strike. This implies that the unions are currently on strike and are looking to resolve the issue and return to work.

Option A, ""reasonable,"" suggests that the demands should be fair and acceptable to both parties. This is a plausible answer, as reasonable demands are more likely to be met, allowing the strike to end.

Option B, ""more money,"" is a specific demand, but it may not be the only or most important issue. While salary is often a factor in labor disputes, it's not the only consideration.

Option C, ""not go to work,"" is the opposite of what the question is asking. The unions are already on strike, and this option doesn't provide a solution to end the strike.

Option D, ""return to work,"" is not a demand, but rather the desired outcome of the negotiations.

Option E, ""union,"" is not relevant to the question, as it's a noun referring to the organization, not a type of demand.

Considering these options, the most appropriate answer is A) ""reasonable,"" as it suggests that the demands should be fair and acceptable to both parties, allowing the strike to end.

A) surprise
B) fight
C) annoyance
D) might scare
E) irritated","To determine the correct answer, let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. **Repetition of a surprising show**: If someone experiences a surprising show over and over, the initial surprise will likely wear off.

2. **Emotional response to repetition**: Typically, when something surprising or unusual happens repeatedly, the initial surprise can give way to other emotions.

3. **Possible emotional outcomes**: The repetition could lead to a range of emotions, but common outcomes include frustration, annoyance, or irritation due to the inability to anticipate or prepare for the surprises.

4. **Assessing the options**:
   - A) **Surprise**: While the initial reaction might be surprise, repeated exposure would likely diminish this feeling.
   - B) **Fight**: This option seems unrelated to the emotional response to repeated surprises.
   - C) **Annoyance**: This is a plausible outcome as repeated surprises can be frustrating.
   - D) **Might scare**: Fear is not the most likely outcome unless the surprises are threatening or dangerous, which is not specified.
   - E) **Irritated**: Similar to annoyance, irritation is a reasonable response to repeated, unanticipated events.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the context, both **C) annoyance** and **E) irritated** are strong candidates. However, since the question asks for a single best answer and ""irritated"" more directly conveys a negative emotional response to repeated surprises, the best answer is **{E}**."

D) cast shadow
E) vase","To solve this, let's think about the scenario step by step:

1. The flower grew tall to compete for sunlight. This means it's trying to get more sunlight than its neighbors, possibly because sunlight is limited.

2. If one flower is growing tall to get sunlight, its neighbor might also be trying to get sunlight. However, since the first flower is already growing tall, the neighbor's options are limited.

3. Looking at the options provided:
   - A) blossom: This is a possible action for the neighbor flower, but it doesn't directly relate to competing for sunlight.
   - B) park: This doesn't make sense in the context of a flower competing for sunlight.
   - C) open: This could mean opening its petals, but again, it's not directly related to competing for sunlight.
   - D) cast shadow: If the neighbor flower also grows tall, it could cast a shadow on the first flower, which would be a way of competing for sunlight.
   - E) vase: This is unrelated to the scenario of competing for sunlight.

Considering the options, the most logical action for the neighbor flower to take in competing for sunlight would be to grow tall as well, which would allow it to cast a shadow on the first flower. However, ""grow tall"" is not an option provided. The closest option related to this scenario would be casting a shadow, which implies the neighbor flower is also competing for sunlight.

A) envy
B) jealousy
C) education
D) fear
E) excitement","To answer this question, let's consider the emotions and reactions that someone might experience when seeing new presents at a birthday party.

1. **Envy (A)**: Envy is the feeling of discontent or resentment towards someone else's possessions or circumstances. Seeing new presents might trigger envy in someone who wishes they had those gifts.

2. **Jealousy (B)**: Jealousy is similar to envy but typically involves a sense of insecurity or fear of losing something. While someone might feel jealous if they perceive the presents as a threat to their own relationships or status, it's less directly related to the presents themselves.

3. **Education (C)**: Education isn't an emotion but a process of learning. Seeing presents wouldn't directly lead to education unless the presents were educational materials or tools.

4. **Fear (D)**: Fear is an emotional response to a perceived threat. Seeing new presents at a birthday party is unlikely to evoke fear unless the presents were somehow intimidating or perceived as a threat.

5. **Excitement (E)**: Excitement is a feeling of enthusiasm or eagerness. Seeing new presents, especially if they're for oneself or if one is anticipating the reaction of the birthday person, can certainly cause excitement.

Considering these options, the most likely emotions someone might feel when seeing new presents at a birthday party are envy (if they wish they had those gifts) or excitement (if they're anticipating the reaction of the birthday person or if the presents are for them). However, excitement is generally a more positive and common response in the context of a birthday party.

1. Lettuce is grown on farms.
2. It is harvested and transported to a central location for distribution.
3. From there, it is shipped to various locations where it can be purchased by consumers.

Considering the options provided, we can rule out ""kitchen"" (A) and ""refrigerator"" (E) because they are typically found in homes, and large trucks wouldn't deliver directly to these locations. ""Salad"" (D) is a dish made from lettuce, not a location where lettuce is delivered.

A) floor
B) humane society
C) bed
D) comfortable chair
E) window sill","To determine where a cat would snuggle up with their human, let's consider the typical behavior and preferences of domestic cats.

1. **Cats prefer warmth and comfort**: Cats are known for seeking out warm and cozy spots to rest.
2. **Cats enjoy human interaction**: Many cats form strong bonds with their human caregivers and enjoy spending time with them.
3. **Cats like elevated positions**: Cats often prefer to be at a higher level, such as on a lap, chair, or bed, where they can observe their surroundings.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the options:

A) floor - While some cats may sleep on the floor, it's not typically a preferred spot for snuggling with humans.
B) humane society - This is not a location within a home, so it's unlikely to be a spot where a cat would snuggle with their human.
C) bed - This is a likely spot, as cats often enjoy sleeping on their human's bed and snuggling with them at night.
D) comfortable chair - This is also a possible spot, as cats may enjoy sitting on a lap or next to their human in a comfortable chair.
E) window sill - While some cats enjoy looking out windows, this spot may not be as conducive to snuggling with humans.

   - A) ""run away"" doesn't make sense in this context, as the congregation would typically move towards the church upon hearing the bell.
   - B) ""wind instrument"" is a noun and doesn't fit as an action.
   - C) ""funnel"" could metaphorically describe the action of moving into a smaller space, like the church entrance.
   - D) ""blunderbuss"" is a type of gun and doesn't fit the context.
   - E) ""associated with telephones"" is not relevant to the action of a congregation entering a church.

4. **Conclusion:** The most logical choice that fits the context and action is ""funnel,"" as it metaphorically describes the congregation moving into the church through a smaller entrance.

A) table
B) office
C) desk
D) kitchen
E) ocean","To determine where people want to have a lot of coffee, let's consider the typical settings where coffee is consumed.

1. **Table (A)**: While people do drink coffee at tables, it's not the most specific or common setting associated with high coffee consumption.
2. **Office (B)**: Offices are places where people often spend long hours working, and coffee is commonly consumed to stay alert and focused. This setting is a strong candidate.
3. **Desk (C)**: Similar to the office, desks are where people often work and might keep a cup of coffee nearby. However, ""desk"" is a bit more specific than ""office"" and might not encompass the full scope of coffee consumption in a work setting.
4. **Kitchen (D)**: Kitchens are where coffee is often brewed, but they're not necessarily where people want to have a lot of coffee. The consumption might happen elsewhere in the house after brewing.
5. **Ocean (E)**: The ocean is not typically associated with coffee consumption, as it's not a practical or common place to drink coffee.

A) murder
B) remorse
C) religious
D) retaliation
E) anguish","To solve this question, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The murderer went to church after committing a crime, which suggests they might be seeking some form of solace, forgiveness, or reflection.
2. The feeling that would most likely drive someone to church after committing a crime like murder would be a negative emotion related to regret or guilt.
3. ""Remorse"" is a feeling of deep regret and guilt for a wrong committed, which aligns with the scenario of someone going to church after killing people.
4. The other options do not fit the context as well: ""murder"" is the act itself, not a feeling; ""religious"" describes a characteristic or belief system rather than an emotional state; ""retaliation"" implies a desire to harm others further, which doesn't fit with seeking solace in church; and ""anguish"" is a state of severe mental or physical suffering, which could be a part of remorse but is not as directly related to guilt and seeking forgiveness.

A) closed room

1. Bob's only light source was a small bulb. This implies that the space is enclosed or has limited natural light, which would be the case in a confined space.

2. There were four walls. This is a characteristic of a room or an enclosed space.

3. If there was a door, Bob couldn't see it. This implies that either the door is not visible due to darkness or it is not present in a conventional sense.

1. **Context**: You are eating breakfast in bed, which implies a comfortable and possibly luxurious setting.
2. **Contrast**: Outside your window, you see a homeless person shivering, which is a stark contrast to your comfortable situation.
3. **Emotional Response**: This contrast is likely to evoke an emotional response in you. Given the situation, the most likely response would be feeling a sense of responsibility or regret for having so much while someone else has so little.
4. **Options Analysis**:
   - A) mess: This doesn't directly relate to the emotional response the situation would likely evoke.
   - B) hungry: Seeing a homeless person wouldn't typically make you feel hungrier.
   - C) feel guilty: This aligns with the expected emotional response to the situation.

2. **Dessert (B)**: This is a type of sweet food, so it's not relevant to finding a lizard.

3. **Pet shop (C)**: Many pet shops, especially those specializing in reptiles, sell captive-bred lizards that are suitable as pets. This is a convenient and responsible way to get a lizard.

1. **Context:** The question mentions ""newlyweds,"" which refers to a couple who have recently gotten married. It also mentions ""copulating their marriage,"" which is a somewhat awkward or old-fashioned way of saying they are consummating or starting their married life together.

2. **Understanding the phrase ""copulating their marriage"":** This phrase is not commonly used in modern English but suggests the beginning of a sexual relationship within the marriage.

3. **Objective:** The question states that the newlyweds ""wanted many"" of something. Given the context of starting a married life and the implication of a sexual relationship, we can infer that the desired outcome is related to the typical goals or outcomes associated with marriage and sexual relationships.

4. **Evaluating the options:**
   - **A) babies:** This is a common goal for many couples starting their married life together. Having children is often seen as a natural progression of a relationship.
   - **B) odors:** This option does not logically relate to the context of marriage, sexual relationships, or the typical goals associated with them.
   - **C) sadness:** This is not a typical goal for newlyweds or couples in general. Marriage is usually associated with happiness and the desire for a fulfilling life together.

A) back yard

C) city
D) military base
E) fashion show","To answer this question, let's consider the characteristics of an extremely large cargo plane and the requirements for its landing. 

1. Extremely large cargo planes are typically used for heavy-duty transportation, often carrying oversized or heavy cargo that cannot be accommodated by standard commercial aircraft.
2. These planes require specialized runways that can support their massive weight and accommodate their large size.
3. Given the size and weight of these planes, the runways must be specifically designed and reinforced to handle the stress and load.

Considering these factors, we can eliminate options A (back yard) and B (bowling alley) as they are not feasible locations for a runway that can accommodate an extremely large cargo plane.

Option E (fashion show) is also not relevant, as it is an event rather than a location that can have a runway.

Between options C (city) and D (military base), while some cities may have airports with runways that can accommodate large cargo planes, military bases are more likely to have the specialized runways and infrastructure needed to support the operations of extremely large cargo planes.

Therefore, the most likely location for a specialized runway that can accommodate an extremely large cargo plane is a military base.

1. Buckets are typically made of plastic, metal, or other materials that can withstand various environmental conditions.
2. They are often used for cleaning, gardening, or other tasks that may involve water or other liquids.
3. Buckets can be bulky and take up space.

Considering these factors, let's evaluate the options:

A) Utility closet: This could be a good option, but it might take up valuable space that could be used for other cleaning supplies or equipment.

B) Outside: Storing a bucket outside could expose it to the elements, which might cause damage or deterioration over time.

C) Well: This is not a suitable option, as a well is a source of water and not a storage space.

D) Garden shed: This could be a good option, especially if the bucket is used for gardening tasks. However, it might not be the most convenient location if the bucket is used for other tasks.

E) Garage: A garage is a dry, protected space that can accommodate bulky items like buckets. It's also a convenient location that's easily accessible.

1. The joke is about the first president of the United States, which is George Washington.
2. We need to find a location or object that is associated with George Washington and is something that a weasel could climb.
3. The phrase ""only our first president could get him down"" suggests that the location or object is something that George Washington is famously associated with.

Considering the options:

A) Washington DC - This is a city, not an object or location that a weasel could climb.
B) Ladder - This is a plausible option, but it's not specifically associated with George Washington.
C) Natural History Museum - This is not associated with George Washington.
D) Cherry Tree - This is a famous story about George Washington, where he chopped down a cherry tree as a child.

1. The coach made a lineup change, which implies that something was not working well with the current lineup.
2. The team's effort was suffering, which means that the current situation was causing a negative impact on the team's performance.
3. We need to find a word that describes a state of not progressing or improving, which is affecting the team's effort.

A) go fast
B) start running
C) going too fast
D) look good
E) last several years","To answer this question, let's consider the context and the options provided.

1. The context is about taking a risk buying a used car. This implies that the buyer is aware of the potential uncertainties or problems that may come with purchasing a pre-owned vehicle.

2. The hope is that despite these risks, the car will still be able to do something desirable.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) go fast - While some people might hope their car can go fast, this isn't necessarily the primary concern when buying a used car, especially considering the context of taking a risk.

B) start running - This option seems a bit off because ""start running"" isn't a typical way to describe a car's functionality. Cars typically ""start"" or ""run,"" but ""start running"" sounds more like something you'd say about a person.

C) going too fast - This option doesn't make sense in the context of hoping for a positive outcome. Going too fast is generally considered a negative or risky behavior.

D) look good - While some people might care about the car's appearance, this option doesn't directly address the functionality or reliability concerns that come with buying a used car.

E) last several years - This option aligns with the context of taking a risk buying a used car. The hope is that despite the potential risks, the car will still be reliable and last for several years.

1. The pencil sharpener is broken in the classroom, so the student needs to find an alternative place to sharpen their pencil.
2. The teacher is recommending a location, so it's likely to be within the school or easily accessible.
3. Option A (home) is unlikely, as it's not a convenient or immediate solution.
4. Option B (library) might have a pencil sharpener, but it's not the most obvious choice, and the teacher might not recommend leaving the classroom for this purpose.
5. Option C (stationery store) is outside the school and not a practical solution.
6. Option D (cabinet) is a plausible choice, as classrooms often have storage cabinets that might contain a spare pencil sharpener.
7. Option E (desk drawer) is also possible, but it's less likely that a pencil sharpener would be stored in a desk drawer.

2. Visiting friends who are a certain way might trigger this fear.
3. Let's examine the options:
   - A) sick person: This option is a strong candidate because visiting a sick person would directly expose the man to illness, triggering his fear.
   - B) hospital: While a hospital is a place where sick people are, the question specifically mentions visiting friends, not places.
   - C) elderly person: Being elderly doesn't necessarily mean the person is sick, so this option is less directly related to the fear of illness.
   - D) graveyard: A graveyard is a place for the deceased, not directly related to the fear of illness in the context of visiting friends.
   - E) doctor's office: Similar to a hospital, a doctor's office is a place, not a description of a friend's condition.

The key phrase here is ""reception area."" A reception area is typically a space where people wait to be attended to, such as in a hotel, office, or hospital.

Now, let's consider the options:

A) motel - While you might wait in a motel's reception area, the question asks what you're waiting alongside, not where you are.
B) chair - This is a plausible option, as you would often be waiting alongside or sitting in a chair in a reception area.
C) hospital - Similar to option A, you might wait in a hospital's reception area, but that's not what you're waiting alongside.
D) people - This is also a possible answer, as you would often be waiting alongside other people in a reception area.

A) Digesting: Having food while already digesting can put extra strain on the digestive system, but it's not necessarily the worst time.

B) Not hungry: Eating when not hungry can lead to overeating and poor digestion, as the body doesn't need the extra energy.

C) Gas: Having food when experiencing gas can worsen the discomfort, but it's not a direct result of the timing of eating.

E) universe","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The question asks about the first place someone leaving the planet ends up.
2. When someone or something leaves a planet, it initially enters the space surrounding the planet.
3. This surrounding space is not the galaxy, as the galaxy is a massive collection of stars, gas, and dust that contains multiple planets and other celestial objects.
4. It's also not the universe, as the universe is the vast expanse of all existence, encompassing countless galaxies.
5. Paying debts is unrelated to the physical location of someone leaving a planet.
6. Orbit is a path that an object follows as it revolves around a celestial body, but it's not the first place someone ends up when leaving a planet.
7. Outer space is the general term for the vast, almost vacuum-like space outside the Earth's atmosphere, which is the first place someone would enter when leaving the planet.

A) accidental
B) detestable
C) effusive
D) enabled
E) apathetic","To determine how James might act toward his plastic surgeon, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **James noticed a change in his body**: Specifically, he noticed that his penis was bigger. This change could be due to various reasons, but in this context, it seems to be related to a medical or surgical intervention, possibly a procedure done by the plastic surgeon.

2. **James' reaction to the change**: The question implies that James is reacting to this change, and we need to determine the nature of this reaction.

3. **Possible reactions**: 
   - **Accidental (A)**: This term doesn't describe a reaction or behavior but rather an unintended event. It doesn't fit the context of how James might act toward his surgeon.
   - **Detestable (B)**: This implies a strong negative reaction, which could be possible if James was unhappy with the outcome. However, the fact that his penis was bigger might not necessarily lead to a detestable reaction unless there were complications or the change was unwanted.
   - **Effusive (C)**: This means expressing enthusiastic or excessive praise. If James was pleased with the outcome of the surgery, he might act effusively toward his surgeon, thanking them and expressing satisfaction with the results.
   - **Enabled (D)**: This term refers to the act of giving someone the authority or means to do something. It doesn't describe a reaction or behavior toward someone else.
   - **Apathetic (E)**: This implies a lack of interest or concern. While James might feel this way if the change was minor or not significant to him, the fact that the question asks how he might act toward his surgeon suggests there is some level of engagement or reaction.

Considering these points, the most likely reaction if James was pleased with the outcome of the surgery would be to act **effusively** toward his plastic surgeon, expressing gratitude and satisfaction.

A) horror
B) anxiety and fear
C) rejection
D) increased workload
E) being employed","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the context**: Applying for a job is a significant event in a person's life. It involves putting oneself out there, showcasing skills and experience, and hoping to secure a position.

2. **Emotional response**: When people apply for jobs, they often experience a range of emotions. These emotions can stem from uncertainty about the outcome, the pressure to present themselves in the best possible light, and the fear of not meeting expectations.

3. **Common emotions**: The most common emotions people experience when applying for a job include anxiety (about the application process, the interview, and the outcome) and fear (of rejection, not being good enough, or not getting the job).

4. **Eliminating options**: 
   - Horror (A) is an extreme emotion that might not be typical for most people.
   - Rejection (C) is an outcome, not an emotion experienced during the application process.
   - Increased workload (D) might be a concern after getting the job, not during the application process.
   - Being employed (E) is the desired outcome, not an emotion.

A) ground
B) bathroom
C) forest
D) countryside
E) rural area","To determine the likely location of the pond, let's consider the given information:

1. There is a pond: This suggests a natural or semi-natural environment.
2. There are trees around it: This further supports the idea of a natural environment, as trees are typically found outdoors.

Considering these points, we can eliminate options that are unlikely to have a natural environment:

- B) bathroom: This is an indoor location and is highly unlikely to have a pond or trees.
- A) ground: While a pond is on the ground, this option is too vague and doesn't provide any additional information about the surroundings.

Now, let's consider the remaining options:

- C) forest: A forest is a natural environment with many trees, which fits the given description. However, it's not the only possible location.
- D) countryside: The countryside is a rural area with a natural environment, which could include a pond and trees. This option seems plausible.
- E) rural area: Similar to the countryside, a rural area is a natural environment that could include a pond and trees.

Both C, D, and E are plausible options, but considering the presence of a pond and trees, a rural area or countryside is more likely to have a pond as a standalone feature, whereas a forest might have a more complex ecosystem with multiple water bodies. Between D and E, they are quite similar, but 'rural area' is a slightly broader term.

A) library
B) transit
C) bus station
D) army barracks
E) locker room","To solve this question, let's think about the context in which James would need to carry a duffel bag because he doesn't have a vehicle of his own.

1. A library (A) is a place where people go to study, read, or research. While James might carry a bag to a library, the lack of a vehicle isn't directly related to the need for a duffel bag in this context.

2. Transit (B) refers to the system or means of transporting people or goods from one place to another. This could involve buses, trains, or other forms of public transportation. Not having a vehicle and needing a bag to carry things while using transit makes sense.

3. A bus station (C) is a place where buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. While James might carry a duffel bag at a bus station, the question seems to be looking for a broader answer related to the method of transportation rather than a specific location.

4. Army barracks (D) are buildings where soldiers live. While soldiers often use duffel bags, the context of not having a vehicle doesn't necessarily apply in the same way as it would for someone using public transportation.

5. A locker room (E) is a room where people change clothes and store their belongings, often found in schools, gyms, or sports facilities. Not having a vehicle isn't directly related to the need for a duffel bag in this context.

Considering these options, the most logical answer is related to James using public transportation because he doesn't have a vehicle of his own.

E) become distracted","When contemplating alone for a long time, several outcomes are possible. Let's evaluate each option:

A) daydream - While daydreaming can occur when one is alone, it's not necessarily a direct result of contemplation, which involves focused thinking.

B) headache - Prolonged mental effort can sometimes lead to physical discomfort, including headaches, but this isn't a guaranteed outcome of contemplation.

C) get ideas - Contemplation often involves deep thinking and reflection, which can indeed lead to the generation of new ideas and insights.

D) sleep - Although being alone for a long time might lead to drowsiness, especially if one is tired, contemplation itself is more likely to stimulate the mind than induce sleep.

E) become distracted - While distractions are possible, especially if the environment isn't conducive to focus, the act of contemplation is about maintaining concentration on a subject or issue.

Given these considerations, the most likely positive outcome of contemplating alone for a long time is generating new ideas or insights.

B) tunnel - A tunnel would provide a covered space, keeping a person dry from the rain.

C) synagogue - A synagogue is a building, which would provide shelter from the rain.

D) fairy tale - A fairy tale is a story, not a physical location, so it wouldn't provide any protection from the rain.

2. He is using binoculars, which suggests he is at a distance from the birds and wants a closer view without disturbing them.
3. The location is described as being ""on vacation,"" which means David is likely in a natural or scenic area rather than an urban environment.

Considering these points, we can evaluate the options:

A) Sky: This is unlikely, as David would not be able to watch nesting birds from the sky.
B) Vacation: This is not a physical location, but rather the context in which David is watching the birds.
C) Forest: This is a plausible location, as forests are common habitats for birds and would provide opportunities for David to observe nesting birds.
D) Countryside: This is also a possible location, as the countryside can include a variety of natural habitats, including forests, fields, and woods, where birds might nest.

A) thinking
B) effort
C) laugh
D) force
E) medium","To solve this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The context is about a couple having trouble communicating.
2. The phrase ""it seemed every conversation"" suggests that the issue is recurring and not just a one-time problem.
3. The word to fill in the blank should describe the quality or characteristic of the effort required for these conversations.

Considering the options:

- A) thinking: While thinking is involved in conversations, it doesn't quite fit the context of ""great"" as an adjective to describe the effort.
- B) effort: This option suggests that the conversations require a lot of work or exertion, which aligns with the idea of the couple having trouble communicating.
- C) laugh: This option is unlikely because the context implies difficulty, not amusement.

E) office building","To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the key feature**: The key feature mentioned in the question is a ""stoop"" on the ground floor.

2. **Understand what a stoop is**: A stoop is a small staircase or a short flight of steps leading up to the entrance of a building, typically found in urban areas.

3. **Associate the feature with a residence type**: The question asks about a type of residence. So, we're looking for a residential building that commonly features a stoop.

4. **Evaluate the options**:
   - A) **Brownstone**: A brownstone is a type of residential building that originated in the Northeastern United States, particularly in New York City. It is known for its distinctive brownstone facade and often features a stoop leading up to the entrance.
   - B) **Hotel**: Hotels are commercial establishments that provide lodging, and they do not typically have stoops as part of their design.

A) breathlessness
B) increased heart rate
C) falling down
D) muscle bulk
E) calluses","To answer this question, let's consider the physiological effects of running on the body.

1. Running requires increased oxygen supply to the muscles. To meet this demand, the body needs to take in more oxygen and expel more carbon dioxide. This results in an increase in breathing rate, which can lead to a feeling of breathlessness.

2. Running also increases the body's energy demands. To supply the muscles with the necessary energy, the heart needs to pump more blood, resulting in an increased heart rate. However, this is not the only consequence of running.

3. Falling down is not an unavoidable physiological consequence of running. While it's possible to trip or fall while running, it's not a direct result of the physical activity itself.

4. Muscle bulk is not an immediate consequence of running. While regular running can lead to muscle growth and increased endurance over time, it's not an unavoidable physiological consequence of a single run.

5. Calluses are not a direct physiological consequence of running. While repeated friction from running shoes can cause calluses to form over time, this is not an immediate or unavoidable consequence of running.

Considering these points, the most likely answer is A) breathlessness, as it's a direct and immediate consequence of running.
