    C --> C3[Wins the auction]
Answer_Reasoning: There are <B2>3 other bidders</B2> who each make one bid before <C3>Carmen wins</C3>.  Since <C2>Carmen bids after each of them</C2>, this means she makes 3 bids. Including her acceptance of the <C1>opening bid of $200</C1>, she makes a total of 4 bids. Because the bids rise by <B1>$50 each time</B1>, her winning bid will be $200 + (3 * $50) = $350. The answer is $350.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Fact_Diagram:

    D --> D1[5 seconds/potato]

Answer_Reasoning: Billy has to prepare <B1>60 potatoes</B1>. It takes him <C1>1.5 minutes</C1> to peel each potato. Cutting each potato takes <D1>5 seconds</D1>, which is equal to 5/60 = 0.0833 minutes. So, it takes 1.5 + 0.0833 = 1.5833 minutes to prep one potato. Therefore, it will take Billy 1.5833 x 60 =  95 minutes to prep all the potatoes.

Answer_Reasoning: James bought <B1>10</B1> CDs at a discounted price.  Let's calculate the price he paid per CD:  <C1>$15</C1> x (<C2>40</C2>/100) = $6 discount, meaning he paid $15 - $6 = $9 per CD. Therefore, he spent $9 x <B1>10</B1> = $90 on CDs.  Since he sold <B2>5</B2> CDs for <C3>$40</C3>, he lost $90 - $40 = $50. The answer is $50.

Answer_Reasoning: First find the total area of the bedroom: <B1>18 feet</B1> * <B2>12 feet</B2> = 216 square feet.  The removal costs <C1>$4</C1> per square foot so that's 216 * $4 = $864.

The new carpet costs <E1>$12</E1> per square foot plus <E2>$2</E2> per square foot for padding for a total of $12 + $2 = $14 per square foot. So, Michael will pay 216 * $14 = $3024 for the new carpet.  Altogether, Michael will pay $864 + $7344 + $3024 = $11232 to replace his carpet.

Answer_Reasoning: Pat needs to leave <D2>1.5 feet</D2> between each plant, plus the plant is <D1>12 inches</D1> (or 1 foot) wide, meaning each plant needs 2.5 feet of space. Pat's <B{Flower Bed}> is <B1>111 feet long</B1> / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4. This means Pat can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

So, the total area of the room is 80 sq ft + 80 sq ft + 40 sq ft + 40 sq ft = 240 sq ft.  Tony will need 240 sq ft / <B1>20 sq ft/gallon</B1> = 12 gallons of paint. The total cost will be 12 gallons x <B2>$12/gallon</B2> = $144.

Then after <D2>1 hour</D2>, he increases the 6-pound weight by <D1>50%</D1>, so he adds 6 * 0.5 = 3 pounds. Therefore, he now uses a 6 + 3 = 9-pound weight.

Answer_Reasoning: Mike has <C1>1/3 * <B1>600</B1> = 200</C1> movies in series. That means <D1>2/3 * <B1>600</B1> = 400</D1> movies are not in a series.

    C --> C2[Week 2: Half of Week 1]
    C --> C3[Week 3: 3 times Week 1]
    C --> C4[Week 4: ?]

Answer_Reasoning: Boris produces <B1>50,000</B1> bars a month.  We know the production for weeks 1, 2, and 3. To find the amount produced in week 4, we can subtract the production of weeks 1-3 from the total monthly production.
We need to figure out the production for weeks 2 and 3 first.
<C2>Week 2 production is half that of week 1</C2>, which is <C1>8,000</C1>/2 = 4,000 bars.
<C3>Week 3 production is three times that of week 1</C3>, which is 3 * <C1>8,000</C1> = 24,000 bars.
Total production for weeks 1-3 is <C1>8,000</C1> + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
Therefore, week 4 production is <B1>50,000</B1> - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Answer_Reasoning: First calculate the volume of the jar: <B1>6 inches x 6 inches</B1> x <B2>15 inches</B2> = 540 cubic inches.  Then account for the <C2>80% packing efficiency</C2>: 540 cubic inches * 0.8 = 432 cubic inches of jelly beans.  Then divide the usable volume by the volume per jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans: 432 cubic inches / <C1>0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean</C1> = 2880 jelly beans.  Finally multiply by the <C3>proportion of red jelly beans</C3> to find how many he should guess: 2880 jelly beans * 0.3 = 864 red jelly beans.  His guess should be 864 red jelly beans.

So, the picture frames cost $24 * 44 = $1056. <D1>Two</D1> seniors are receiving pins that cost <D2>$5</D2> each for a total of 2*5 = $10.  <E1>1/4 of the seniors are officers</E1>, so that is 44/4 = 11 officers. Since officer cords cost <E2>$12 each</E2>, the cords will cost 11*12 = $132.  In total, the senior gifts will cost 1056 + 10 + 132 = $1298.

Answer Reasoning: Colby's parents give him <B1>$150</B1> each month to spend at the movies. Since it's Friday, a movie ticket will cost <C1A>$10</C1A>. He also wants to buy popcorn for <D1A>$8</D1A> and candy for <D2A>$2</D2A>. In total, he will spend <C1A>$10</C1A> + <D1A>$8</D1A> + <D2A>$2</D2A> = $20 at the movies tonight.  This leaves him with <B1>$150</B1> - $20 = $130 for the rest of the month to see movies. Assuming he only goes to the movies on Fridays, he can see 130 / <C1A>$10</C1A> = 13 movies. However, since it's already the last Friday of the month, he can only see 1 more movie this month.

Answer_Reasoning: Sasha bought <B1>ten</B1> 2 x 4 x 10 boards for <B2>$10</B2> each, meaning she paid $10 * 10 = $100 for those boards. She also purchased <C1>five</C1> 4 x 4 x 10 boards for <C2>$16</C2> each, costing her $16 * 5 = $80. In total, she initially spent $100 + $80 = $180 on lumber.

From selling all the 2x4s, she'd make $15 * 10 = $150, and from the 4x4s, she'd make $24 * 5 = $120. Therefore, Sasha earns $150 + $120 = $270 from selling all her lumber.

    A --> C[Third Set]
    C --> C1[Half the balls retrieved in the second set]
    A --> D[First Set]
    D --> D1[Four more balls than the second set]

Answer_Reasoning: Let's break down the problem.  We know from <B>Total Balls <B1>19</B1></B> that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total.  Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the second set as 'x'.  <C> In the third set <C1>he retrieved half as many as in the second set</C1></C>, which means he retrieved x/2 balls in the third set.  <D>In the first set, <D1>Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set</D1></D>, meaning he retrieved x + 4 balls in the first set. 

Therefore the total number of balls retrieved can be represented as: x + 4 + x + x/2 = 19. Combining like terms, we get 2.5x + 4 = 19. Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 2.5x = 15. Dividing both sides by 2.5 gives us x = 6.  Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Since the first set had 4 more balls than the second, he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

Answer_Reasoning: Mr. Tan needs to pay <E>3% of <C>$400 000</C></E> = $12 000 for the transfer fees. He also needs to pay <G>5% of <C>$400 000</C> = $20 000 for the brokerage fee. In total, he paid $12 000 + $20 000 + <I>$250 000</I> = $282 000 for the fees and the remaining loan amount. His net proceeds from selling the house is <C>$400 000</C> - $282 000 = $118 000. The answer is $118 000.

Answer_Reasoning: The hotel costs <B2>20%</B2> more than normal, so each night costs 1 + 0.2 = 1.2 times the normal price. So, each night costs $<B1>1500</B1> * 1.2 = $1800. The total cost of the hotel for <D1>3 days</D1> was $1800 * 3 = $5400.  The plane tickets cost $<C1>5000</C1> for each of them so the total cost is 2 * $5000 = $10000.

On the second day, he planted <F><D>20</D> + 10 = 30 White Oak trees</F> and <G>40 + (1/4 * 40) = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees</G>. He planted a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day. Altogether, Mr. Julius planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees in the two days.

After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","```mermaid

Instead of paying for the <C>24-hour stay</C> at <F>1600 pesos</F>, he opts for the <B>12-hour stay</B> at <E>1000 pesos</E> and pays extra for the remaining 5 hours. The additional 5 hours would cost him 5 * <G>70 pesos/hour</G> = 350 pesos. Therefore, his total cost is <E>1000 pesos</E> + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos. He would save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

134,"Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Each pound is 16 ounces.  Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","Fact_Diagram:

    A --> C[Boxes]
    B --> B1[200 crayons]
    B --> B2[1 ounce per crayon]
    C --> C1[8 ounce weight per box]
    C --> C2[8 crayons per box]
    D[Units]
    D --> D1[16 ounces per pound]
Answer_Reasoning: Nik has <B1>200</B1> crayons and puts <C2>8</C2> in each box, so he uses <B1>200</B1>/<C2>8</C2> = 25 boxes.  Each crayon weighs <B2>1 ounce</B2> and he has <B1>200</B1> crayons, for a total crayon weight of <B2>1</B2> * <B1>200</B1> = 200 ounces.  Each box weighs <C1>8 ounces</C1> and he has 25 boxes, for a total box weight of 25 * <C1>8</C1> = 200 ounces.  The total weight of the crayons and boxes is 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.  Since there are <D1>16 ounces</D1> in a pound, the total weight in pounds is 400 ounces / <D1>16</D1> ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

135,Roger goes to the store to buy some coffee. He decides to buy a week's worth of coffee and he uses 1 pound of coffee per day. The normal brand of coffee he buys cost $5 per pound.  He had to buy a more expensive brand that cost 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He also decided to buy himself a donut for $2. How much did everything cost?,"Fact_Diagram:

    B --> D[Expensive Coffee]
    D --> D1[20% more expensive than normal coffee]
    A --> E[Donut]
    E --> E1[$2]

Answer_Reasoning: Roger drinks <B1>1 pound</B1> of coffee every day for <B2>7 days</B2> a week, meaning he buys <B1>1</B1>*<B2>7</B2> = 7 pounds of coffee. The expensive coffee cost <C1>$5</C1> * .2 = $1 more per pound than the normal coffee.  This means the expensive coffee cost <C1>$5</C1> + $1 = $6 per pound. So, he pays <D1>$6</D1> * 7 = $42 for the coffee. Adding the price of the donut, he pays $42 + <E1>$2</E1> = $44 in total.

Answer_Reasoning: Artemis and her father planted <E2>4</E2> sunflowers which used <E2>4</E2> * <E1>3</E1> = 12 pounds of soil. They also planted <F2>10</F2> carnations which used <F2>10</F2> * <F1>1.5</F1> = 15 pounds of soil. That means they used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations.  They started with a <B1>30</B1> pound bag of soil, leaving them with <B1>30</B1> - 27 = 3 pounds of soil for roses. Since each rose needs <D1>1</D1> pound of soil, they can plant 3 / <D1>1</D1> = 3 roses.

141,"A bus has a capacity of 200 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Before its first stop, it had 20 people. If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","Fact_Diagram:

    D --> H[20 people]
    E --> I[40 people entered]
    F --> J[3/4 of first stop entered]

Answer_Reasoning: At the start, the bus had <H>20 people</H>. After the first stop, it had <H>20</H> + <I>40</I> = 60 people. At the second stop, <J>3/4 of the 40 people who entered at the first stop</J>, which is (3/4) * <I>40</I> = 30 people, entered the bus. The total number of people on the bus after the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90. The number of passengers then <K>doubled at the third station</K>, so there were 90*2 = 180 people. Therefore, to reach the <B>200 people capacity</B>, the bus requires <B>200</B> - 180 = 20 more people.

Answer_Reasoning: Kayla invited a total of <B1>25</B1> + <B2>7</B2> + <B3>13</B3> = 45 guests to her party. However, <B4>4</B4> guests cannot come, so <B>45</B> - <B4>4</B4> = 41 guests will attend the party. The base cost of the party covers 20 guests, so Kayla needs to pay for an additional <B>41</B> - 20 = 21 guests. The cost for these additional guests is 21 x <C2>$6</C2> = $126. Therefore, the total cost of the party is <C1>$125</C1> + $126 = $251.
