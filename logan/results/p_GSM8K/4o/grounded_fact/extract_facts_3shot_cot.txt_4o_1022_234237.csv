225,"Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","```
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to focus on the conditions that allow Donny to drink the water. The key information includes the temperature requirement for Donny to drink water, the temperature of the first mug, and the mixing process that results in drinkable water. The essential facts are the minimum temperature requirement of 40 degrees, the known temperature of the first mug at 33 degrees, and the fact that after mixing 4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second, the water becomes drinkable.

### Key Facts:
<fact1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</fact1>
<fact2>One mug is 33 degrees</fact2>
<fact3>pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact3>
<fact4>one ounce from the other bottle</fact4>
<fact5>he is now able to drink the water</fact5>

### Reformatted Question:
Donny can only drink water if it's <fact1>at least 40 degrees</fact1>. He has two mugs of water. <fact2>One mug is 33 degrees</fact2>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he <fact3>pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact3> into his water bottle and <fact4>one ounce from the other bottle</fact4>, <fact5>he is now able to drink the water</fact5>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?
```
### Final Answer Reasoning
<fact1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</fact1>. He mixes water by <fact3>pouring 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact3> and <fact4>one ounce from the other bottle</fact4>. After this mixing, <fact5>he is now able to drink the water</fact5>, indicating that the resulting mixture is at least 40 degrees. To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we set up the equation for the final temperature of the mixture: 

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * x degrees) / 5 ounces = 40 degrees.

Solving for x gives:

132 + x = 200

x = 68

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be {68} degrees."
98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"```
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine how much John pays annually for driving, we need to focus on the distance he travels, the cost per mile, and the additional monthly bonus. The key elements include the round-trip distance, the number of workdays per week and per year, the cost per mile, and the monthly bonus. These details are essential for calculating the total annual cost.

### Key Facts:
<fact1>His work is 30 miles away</fact1>
<fact2>he has to go there and back each day</fact2>
<fact3>He goes to work 5 days a week</fact3>
<fact4>for 50 weeks a year</fact4>
<fact5>charged $2 per mile driven</fact5>
<fact6>$150 bonus per month</fact6>

```
### Final Answer Reasoning
John's daily commute involves a round trip of <fact1>30 miles</fact1> each way, totaling <fact2>60 miles per day</fact2>. He commutes <fact3>5 days a week</fact3> for <fact4>50 weeks a year</fact4>, resulting in 250 commuting days annually. This means he travels 15,000 miles per year (60 miles/day * 250 days). At a rate of <fact5>$2 per mile driven</fact5>, the cost for mileage is $30,000 annually (15,000 miles * $2/mile). Additionally, John pays a <fact6>$150 bonus per month</fact6>, totaling $1,800 annually (12 months * $150/month). Therefore, the total annual cost for driving is $31,800 ($30,000 for mileage + $1,800 for bonuses). The answer is {31800}."
