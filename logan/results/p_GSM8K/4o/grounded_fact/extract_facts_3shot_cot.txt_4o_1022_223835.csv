225,"Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Reasoning Process:
To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to understand the conditions under which Donny can drink the water. The key condition is that the water must be at least 40 degrees. We know that Donny pours 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, and the resulting mixture is drinkable. This implies that the combined temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees. Therefore, we need to calculate the minimum temperature of the second mug that would result in a mixture of at least 40 degrees.

Key Facts:
<fact1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</fact1>
<fact2>One mug is 33 degrees</fact2>
<fact3>pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact3>
<fact4>one ounce from the other bottle</fact4>
<fact5>he is now able to drink the water</fact5>"
98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"Reasoning Process:
To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total distance he travels annually and the cost associated with it. The key components include the distance to work, the frequency of his trips, the cost per mile, and the monthly bonus he gives to his driver. The distance to work is 30 miles one way, making it 60 miles for a round trip. He travels this distance 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year. The cost per mile is $2, and he gives a $150 bonus each month, which needs to be accounted for over 12 months.

Key Facts:
<fact1>His work is 30 miles away</fact1>
<fact2>he has to go there and back each day</fact2>
<fact3>He goes to work 5 days a week</fact3>
<fact4>for 50 weeks a year</fact4>
<fact5>He gets charged $2 per mile driven</fact5>
<fact6>he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month</fact6>"
202,"Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  Her parents gave her $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for \""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.\""  She scooped up 2 pounds.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.  How much money does Sally have left?","Reasoning Process:
To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and subtract it from the $10 her parents gave her. The key components of this calculation include the cost of the taffy, the seashells, and the magnets. The taffy deal is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off,"" which means the second pound costs $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is $4.50. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost $0.25 each, totaling $1.00 for 4 magnets. Adding these amounts gives the total expenditure, which is then subtracted from the initial $10 to find the remaining money.

Key Facts:
<fact1>Her parents gave her $10</fact1>
<fact2>taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""</fact2>
<fact3>She scooped up 2 pounds</fact3>
<fact4>seashells for $1.50</fact4>
<fact5>4 magnets that were $0.25 each</fact5>"
107,"Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?","Reasoning Process:
To determine how much money Shawnda made, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire. Each bicycle has 2 tires, each tricycle has 3 tires, and a unicycle has 1 tire. The number of people and the type of cycles they brought will help us calculate the total number of tires. The cost per tire is given as 25 cents, which needs to be converted to dollars for the final answer.

Key Facts:
<fact1>Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate</fact1>
<fact2>5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated</fact2>
<fact3>3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated</fact3>
<fact4>one person actually came by on a unicycle</fact4>"
