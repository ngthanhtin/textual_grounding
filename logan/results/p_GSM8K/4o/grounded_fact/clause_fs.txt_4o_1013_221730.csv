She accepts the opening bid of $200 and continues bidding until she wins. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins. How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Carmen goes to an auction to win an antique desk</fact1>. <fact2>The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time</fact2> <fact3>and 3 other people each bid once</fact3>. <fact4>She accepts the opening bid of $200</fact4> <fact5>and continues bidding until she wins</fact5>. <fact6>Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people</fact6> <fact7>and eventually wins</fact7>. <fact8>How much money, in dollars, does the desk cost her</fact8>?

Answer_Reasoning: The opening bid is <fact4>$200</fact4>. Each of the 3 other people bids once, so there are 3 bids, each increasing the price by <fact2>$50</fact2>. Therefore, the total increase from these bids is 3 x $50 = $150. Carmen bids after each of these 3 bids, so she makes 3 additional bids. Each of her bids also increases the price by <fact2>$50</fact2>. Therefore, the total increase from her bids is 3 x $50 = $150. The final cost of the desk is the opening bid plus the total increase from all bids: $200 + $150 + $150 = $500.

He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month.  How many games does Steve have after 3 years?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Steve loves playing video games</fact1>. <fact2>His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday</fact2>. <fact3>For the third year he buys 4 games a month</fact3> <fact4>as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money</fact4>. <fact5>He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year</fact5>. <fact6>He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year</fact6>, <fact7>and then the second year he starts buying 2 games a month</fact7>. <fact8>How many games does Steve have after 3 years</fact8>?

Answer_Reasoning: Initially, Steve receives <fact2>5 games for his birthday</fact2>. In the first year, he buys <fact6>1 game per month</fact6>, so he buys 1 x 12 = 12 games. He also receives <fact5>5 games for Christmas</fact5>. Therefore, in the first year, he has 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games. In the second year, he buys <fact7>2 games per month</fact7>, so he buys 2 x 12 = 24 games. He also receives <fact5>5 games for Christmas</fact5>. Therefore, in the second year, he has 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games. In the third year, he buys <fact3>4 games a month</fact3>, so he buys 4 x 12 = 48 games. He also receives <fact5>5 games for Christmas</fact5>. Therefore, in the third year, he has 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

2,"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes</fact1> <fact2>in preparation for making potato salad</fact2> <fact3>for his big family reunion barbecue</fact3>. <fact4>It's a big event</fact4>, <fact5>so he has 60 potatoes to get through</fact5>. <fact6>It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato</fact6>, <fact7>but only about 5 seconds to cut it up</fact7>. <fact8>The potatoes are roughly the same size</fact8>, <fact9>so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one</fact9>. <fact10>How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes</fact10>?

Answer_Reasoning: Billy has <fact5>60 potatoes</fact5> to prepare. It takes him <fact6>a minute and a half</fact6> (which is 90 seconds) to peel each potato and <fact7>5 seconds</fact7> to cut each one. Therefore, it takes him 90 + 5 = 95 seconds to peel and cut one potato. For all 60 potatoes, it will take him 60 x 95 = 5700 seconds. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60, resulting in 5700/60 = 95 minutes. Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.

3,James gets 10 new CDs.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  How much money was he out?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>James gets 10 new CDs</fact1>. <fact2>He decides he doesn't like 5 of them</fact2> <fact3>and sells them for 40</fact3>. <fact4>Each CD cost $15</fact4>. <fact5>He gets them for 40% off</fact5>. <fact6>How much money was he out</fact6>?

Answer_Reasoning: James bought <fact1>10 CDs</fact1> at <fact4>$15 each</fact4>, so the total cost before discount is 10 x 15 = $150. He received a <fact5>40% discount</fact5>, so he paid 60% of the total cost. Therefore, he paid 150 x 0.6 = $90 for the CDs. He sold <fact2>5 CDs</fact2> <fact3>for $40</fact3>. Thus, the money he was out is the amount he paid minus the amount he received from selling, which is 90 - 40 = $50.

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are <fact1>18 seats in each row</fact1> and <fact5>4 rows</fact5>, so there are 18 x 4 = 72 seats in total. According to <fact2>, one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so 72 / 4 = 18 seats were occupied by administrators. This leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats. According to <fact3>, one-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so 54 / 3 = 18 seats were occupied by parents. According to <fact4>, the rest of the seats were occupied by the students, so 54 - 18 = 36 seats were occupied by students. Therefore, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact3>, on average, each dog needs to walk 3 miles per day. Since there are <fact1>4 dogs</fact1>, the total miles they need to walk per day is 4 x 3 = 12 miles. The first dog walks <fact2>1 mile</fact2>, the second dog walks <fact5>4 miles</fact5>, and the third dog walks <fact6>3 miles</fact6>. Therefore, the total miles walked by the first three dogs is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed: 12 - 8 = 4 miles. Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the area of the bedroom using <fact2>18 feet by 12 feet</fact2>, which is 18 x 12 = 216 square feet. 

Next, calculate the cost to remove the old carpet using <fact3>$4 per square foot</fact3>:  
216 x $4 = $864.

Then, calculate the cost to install the new carpet using <fact4>$34 per square foot</fact4>:

If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, <fact3>and more apples from the average trees</fact3>. <fact4>Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4> <fact5>and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact5>. <fact6>She doesn't take any from the average trees</fact6>. <fact7>While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard</fact7>, <fact8>her sister comes outside to help her</fact8>. <fact9>If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples</fact9>, <fact10>how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees</fact10>?

Answer_Reasoning: Joanne gathers <fact1>30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1> and <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, which is 30/2 = 15 apples. So, from the tallest and shortest trees, Joanne gathers 30 + 15 = 45 apples. Her sister gathers <fact4>twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact4>, which is 2 x 30 = 60 apples, and <fact5>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact5>, which is 3 x 15 = 45 apples. Therefore, her sister gathers 60 + 45 = 105 apples. Together, they gather <fact9>a combined total of 500 apples</fact9>. So, the apples gathered from the average trees by Joanne are 500 - (45 + 105) = 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

Answer_Reasoning: First, convert the width of each flower from inches to feet: <fact4>12 inches</fact4> = 1 foot. Therefore, each flower plus the space between them takes up 1 + <fact5>1.5</fact5> = 2.5 feet. To find out how many flowers are needed to fill the flower bed, divide the length of the flower bed by the space each flower occupies: <fact1>111 feet</fact1> / 2.5 feet = 44.4. Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, she needs 45 flowers. Pat already owns <fact3>17 flowers</fact3>, so she needs to buy 45 - 17 = 28 more flowers. Each flower costs <fact6>$6</fact6>, so Pat will spend 28 x $6 = $168 at the store.

Answer_Reasoning: To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to determine the total time he spent on vacation. From <fact4>, John spent 6 hours boating. From <fact5>, he spent half of 6 hours swimming, which is 3 hours. From <fact6> and <fact7>, he watched 3 shows that were 2 hours each, totaling 6 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours. According to <fact3>, these activities account for 30% of his time. Therefore, 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. To find the total time, we calculate 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours.

Answer_Reasoning: The teacher starts with a <fact1>5-inch piece of chalk</fact1>. By the end of Monday, he has used <fact10>45%</fact10> of the chalk, which is 0.45 x 5 = 2.25 inches. Therefore, he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk remaining. The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than <fact4>2 inches</fact4>. This means he can use up to 0.75 inches more before recycling. If he uses <fact11>20%</fact11> of the chalk each day, he uses 0.20 x 5 = 1 inch per day. Therefore, he can use the chalk for 0.75/1 = 0.75 days before it needs to be recycled. Since he cannot use a fraction of a day, he has 0 full days left before he has to recycle the chalk.

How much farther does the winner run than the loser?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Blake and Kelly are having a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes</fact1>. <fact2>They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long</fact2>. <fact3>Kelly runs back and forth once</fact3>, <fact4>and then decides that she doesn't want to run next to Blake</fact4>, <fact5>so she starts to run to the 40-yard line and back</fact5>. <fact6>She does this 34 times</fact6>. <fact7>Blake runs back and forth 15 times</fact7>. <fact8>How much farther does the winner run than the loser</fact8>?

Answer_Reasoning: Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 2 x <fact2>100 yards</fact2> = 200 yards. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 2 x 40 = 80 yards. She does this <fact6>34 times</fact6>, so she runs 34 x 80 = 2720 yards. Adding the initial 200 yards, Kelly runs a total of 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

Blake runs back and forth <fact7>15 times</fact7>, which is 15 x 2 x <fact2>100 yards</fact2> = 3000 yards.

The difference in distance is 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

19,A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12. Tony is painting a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. How much will it cost to paint the room?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</fact1> <fact2>and cost $12</fact2>. <fact3>Tony is painting a room with four walls</fact3>. <fact4>The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet</fact4>. <fact5>The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet</fact5>. <fact6>How much will it cost to paint the room</fact6>?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the area of the north and south walls. Each wall is <fact4>10 x 8</fact4> = 80 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is 80 x 2 = 160 square feet. Next, calculate the area of the east and west walls. Each wall is <fact5>5 x 8</fact5> = 40 square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is 40 x 2 = 80 square feet. The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. Since <fact1>a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet</fact1>, the number of gallons needed is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons. The cost for the paint is 12 gallons x <fact2>$12</fact2> per gallon = $144. Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is $144.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long.  They play for 4 hours.  One of them is significantly better than him and can play for 1.5 times as long.  How much money is used?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>A new arcade opens up</fact1> <fact2>and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends</fact2>. <fact3>Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes</fact3>. <fact4>Two of his friends are significantly worse than him</fact4> <fact5>and can only play half as long</fact5>. <fact6>They play for 4 hours</fact6>. <fact7>One of them is significantly better than him</fact7> <fact8>and can play for 1.5 times as long</fact8>. <fact9>How much money is used</fact9>?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate how long each person can play. Jack can play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. According to <fact3>, Jack uses 1 quarter for every 20 minutes, so he uses 240/20 = 12 quarters. 

For the two friends who are worse than Jack (<fact4> and <fact5>), they can only play half as long as Jack. Therefore, they play for 240/2 = 120 minutes each. Each of these friends uses 120/20 = 6 quarters. Since there are two friends, they use 6 x 2 = 12 quarters in total.

The friend who is better than Jack (<fact7> and <fact8>) can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. Therefore, this friend plays for 240 x 1.5 = 360 minutes. This friend uses 360/20 = 18 quarters.

Adding up all the quarters used: Jack uses 12 quarters, the two worse friends use 12 quarters, and the better friend uses 18 quarters. In total, they use 12 + 12 + 18 = 42 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total money used is 42 x $0.25 = $10.50.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact2>, Mike has 600 movies. From <fact4>, a third of the movies are in series, so 600/3 = 200 movies are in series. This means the remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies. According to <fact3>, 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so 0.4 x 400 = 160 older movies. The cost to replace these older movies is 160 x $5 = $800. The remaining non-series, non-older movies are 400 - 160 = 240 movies, and the cost to replace these at the normal price is 240 x $10 = $2400. From <fact5>, the cost to replace the series movies is 200 x $6 = $1200. Therefore, the total cost to replace all the movies is $800 + $2400 + $1200 = $4400.

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. On the first day, Wanda filled <fact2>1/4</fact2> of the tank's capacity. Therefore, she pumped 18000 x 1/4 = 4500 gallons.

2. Ms. B pumped <fact3>3/4</fact3> as much water as Wanda on the first day. Therefore, she pumped 4500 x 3/4 = 3375 gallons.

3. On the second day, Wanda pumped <fact4>2/3</fact4> of the amount she pumped on the first day. Therefore, she pumped 4500 x 2/3 = 3000 gallons.

Answer_Reasoning: To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to account for the total percentage lost over the time period described. 

First, for the first 5 hours, the power bank was losing <fact5>9%</fact5> per hour. Therefore, in 5 hours, it lost 5 x 9% = 45%.

Then, for the next <fact8>3 hours</fact8>, the power bank was losing <fact7>7%</fact7> per hour. Therefore, in 3 hours, it lost 3 x 7% = 21%.

The total percentage lost over the 8 hours is 45% + 21% = 66%.

If they already own 15 tables, how many new tables do they need?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>A charity group decides to do a yard sale</fact1>. <fact2>10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each</fact2>. <fact3>They can fit 2 boxes worth of stuff per table</fact3>. <fact4>They also have 10 boxes of stuff already</fact4>. <fact5>If they already own 15 tables</fact5>, <fact6>how many new tables do they need</fact6>?

Answer_Reasoning: The total number of boxes donated by the people is <fact2>10 people</fact2> x 5 boxes = 50 boxes. Adding the boxes they already have, the total number of boxes is 50 + <fact4>10</fact4> = 60 boxes. Since <fact3>2 boxes fit per table</fact3>, they need 60/2 = 30 tables to accommodate all the boxes. They already own <fact5>15 tables</fact5>, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact5>, Jim collected 27 seashells. From <fact6>, we know that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. From <fact7>, Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells. The total number of seashells collected by all three is 27 (Jim) + 22 (Carlos) + 11 (Carrey) = 60 seashells. According to <fact4>, they divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the transfer fees: <fact1>3%</fact1> of <fact3>$400,000</fact3> is 0.03 x 400,000 = $12,000. Next, calculate the brokerage fee: <fact2>5%</fact2> of <fact3>$400,000</fact3> is 0.05 x 400,000 = $20,000. The total fees paid are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000. Mr. Tan also paid <fact4>$250,000</fact4> for the remaining loan amount. Therefore, the total deductions from the selling price are $32,000 + $250,000 = $282,000.

Answer_Reasoning: Tobias howls for <fact5>20 seconds</fact5>. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds (<fact3>twice as long as Tobias</fact3>). Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds (<fact4>as long as the other two wolves combined</fact4>).

Answer_Reasoning: The shirt has a price of <fact2>$25</fact2>, and with a <fact3>30% off sale</fact3>, the discount is 25 x 0.30 = $7.50. Therefore, the sale price of the shirt is 25 - 7.50 = $17.50. The shorts cost <fact4>$35</fact4>. The total cost for both items is 17.50 + 35 = $52.50. Joe has <fact1>$50</fact1>, so he cannot afford both items. However, if we assume he only buys the shirt, he will spend $17.50, leaving him with 50 - 17.50 = $32.50.

Answer_Reasoning: Sheila initially charged <fact1>$85.00</fact1> on her credit card. She returned an item costing <fact6>$15.00</fact6>, so the balance is reduced by $15.00, making it $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00. 

She then bought a frying pan with a 20% discount on <fact3>$20.00</fact3>, which is $20.00 x 20% = $4.00 discount. The frying pan costs $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00. 

She also bought a set of towels with a 10% discount on <fact4>$30.00</fact4>, which is $30.00 x 10% = $3.00 discount. The towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

71,"Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish, so he went to the pet store. He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish. When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Bob started with 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange, and 4 were white. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Bob decided he wanted to get some more fish</fact1>, <fact2>so he went to the pet store</fact2>. <fact3>He had a sales assistant at the pet shop dip out 17 fish out of a mixed tank of both white and orange fish</fact3>. <fact4>When he got them home and added them to his pond</fact4>, <fact5>he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact5>. <fact6>Bob started with 7 fish in his pond</fact6>. <fact7>3 were orange</fact7>, <fact8>and 4 were white</fact8>. <fact9>How many white fish did Bob buy at the store</fact9>?

Answer_Reasoning: Bob started with <fact6>7 fish in his pond</fact6>, consisting of <fact7>3 orange</fact7> and <fact8>4 white</fact8> fish. After buying <fact3>17 fish</fact3> from the store, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let W be the number of white fish he bought, and O be the number of orange fish he bought. 

The total number of white fish after the purchase is 4 + W, and the total number of orange fish is 3 + O. According to <fact5>, the total number of orange fish is twice the total number of white fish: 

3 + O = 2(4 + W).

We also know from <fact3> that the total number of fish bought is 17:

W + O = 17.

Now, we solve these equations:

1. 3 + O = 2(4 + W) 
   => 3 + O = 8 + 2W 
   => O = 5 + 2W.

2. W + O = 17 
   => W + (5 + 2W) = 17 
   => 3W + 5 = 17 
   => 3W = 12 
   => W = 4.

Therefore, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys</fact1>. <fact2>5 workers are available to work on the order</fact2>. <fact3>They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift</fact3>, <fact4>and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order</fact4>. <fact5>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact5>, <fact6>and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact6>. <fact7>How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce</fact7>?

Answer_Reasoning: The total number of toys needed is <fact1>400</fact1>. By the end of the shift, <fact4>20 toys are still needed</fact4>, so they produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys during the shift. The total hours worked by all workers is <fact2>5 workers</fact2> x <fact3>10 hours</fact3> = 50 hours. 

The first 2 workers produce <fact5>6 toys per hour</fact5>, so together they produce 2 x 6 = 12 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, they produce 12 x 10 = 120 toys. 

The next 2 workers produce <fact6>4 toys per hour</fact6>, so together they produce 2 x 4 = 8 toys per hour. Over 10 hours, they produce 8 x 10 = 80 toys. 

So, the first four workers produce 120 + 80 = 200 toys in total. 

The fifth worker must have produced the remaining 380 - 200 = 180 toys. 

Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Tim enters a competition</fact1> <fact2>and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar</fact2>. <fact3>He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches</fact3>. <fact4>He also knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing</fact4>. <fact5>He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red</fact5>. <fact6>The jar has a square base</fact6> <fact7>and is 6 inches by 6 inches</fact7> <fact8>and 15 inches tall</fact8>. <fact9>The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900</fact9>. <fact10>How far off was his guess</fact10>?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the volume of the jar using <fact6>the square base</fact6> and <fact7>dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches</fact7> and <fact8>15 inches tall</fact8>. The volume is 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches. Considering <fact4>80% packing efficiency</fact4>, the effective volume for jelly beans is 540 x 0.8 = 432 cubic inches. Given <fact3>each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches</fact3>, the total number of jelly beans is 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans. According to <fact5>Tim's estimate that 30% of the jelly beans are red</fact5>, he guessed 2880 x 0.3 = 864 red jelly beans. The true number of red jelly beans is <fact9>900</fact9>.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact3>, the tattered jeans cost $28. From <fact4>, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. Cole saved a total of $6 as per <fact6>. From <fact7>, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6/3 = $2. Therefore, he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans as per <fact8>. The jogger jeans originally cost $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28, so the jogger jeans originally cost $28 - $22 = $6 less than the tattered jeans. However, the question asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which is not applicable since they cost less. Therefore, the jogger jeans do not cost more than the tattered jeans.

Answer_Reasoning: 
- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1-hour episodes each night, totaling 2 hours (<fact3>).
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, totaling 1.5 hours (<fact4>).
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours (<fact5>).
- Adding these, the total time spent watching TV from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday, is 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.
- According to <fact6>, Frankie watched 7 hours of TV in all.
- Therefore, the time spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.
- Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes long (<fact2>), Frankie watched 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours per episode = 3 episodes on Wednesday.

In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Every day, Wendi gives each of her chickens their feed in three separate meals</fact1>. <fact2>She feeds each of the chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact2>, <fact3>containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy</fact3>. <fact4>In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed</fact4>. <fact5>In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed</fact5>. <fact6>How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day</fact6> <fact7>if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens</fact7>?

Answer_Reasoning: Wendi has <fact7>20 chickens</fact7>, and she feeds each chicken <fact2>three cups of mixed chicken feed</fact2> per day. Therefore, she needs a total of 20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed per day for all her chickens. She gives them <fact4>15 cups of feed in the morning</fact4> and <fact5>25 cups of feed in the afternoon</fact5>, totaling 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. To find out how many cups of feed she needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the total cups already given from the total needed: 60 - 40 = 20 cups.

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework</fact1>. <fact2>If the normal teacher comes in</fact2>, <fact3>there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension</fact3>. <fact4>There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher</fact4> <fact5>who won't collect the homework</fact5>. <fact6>Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension</fact6>, <fact7>there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment</fact7> <fact8>and get a personal extension</fact8>. <fact9>What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow</fact9>?

Answer_Reasoning: To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the complementary probabilities of the events that would allow him not to turn it in. 

1. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance of an extension, so there's a 60% chance that there won't be an extension. 
2. There's a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework, so there's a 50% chance that the normal teacher will come in.
3. If the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension, meaning there's an 80% chance he won't get a personal extension.

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the probability that the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, and Marcus doesn't get a personal extension. This is calculated as follows:

- Probability that the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension: 0.50 (probability normal teacher comes in) * 0.60 (probability no class extension) = 0.30.
- Probability that Marcus doesn't get a personal extension: 0.80.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 0.30 * 0.80 = 0.24 or 24%.

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons</fact1>. <fact2>Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons</fact2>. <fact3>A small sticker is worth one small button</fact3>. <fact4>A large button is worth three small stickers</fact4>. <fact5>Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers</fact5> <fact6>and 40 large stickers</fact6>. <fact7>She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons</fact7> <fact8>and trades the rest of them for small buttons</fact8>. <fact9>She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons</fact9>. <fact10>How many buttons does she have by the end</fact10>?

Answer_Reasoning: Lorraine starts with <fact6>40 large stickers</fact6>. She trades <fact7>50%</fact7> of them, which is 40 x 0.5 = 20 large stickers, for large buttons. According to <fact2>, each large sticker is worth a large button, so she gets 20 large buttons. She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. According to <fact2>, each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons from the remaining large stickers.

Lorraine starts with <fact5>30 small stickers</fact5>. She trades <fact9>90%</fact9> of them, which is 30 x 0.9 = 27 small stickers, for large buttons. According to <fact4>, a large button is worth three small stickers, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons from the small stickers.

In total, Lorraine has 20 (from large stickers) + 9 (from small stickers) = 29 large buttons. She also has 60 small buttons from the large stickers. Therefore, Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons by the end.

Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.  1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.  How much will be spent on the senior gifts?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>44 seniors need to receive awards</fact1>. <fact2>2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5</fact2>. <fact3>Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20</fact3>. <fact4>Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo for an additional 20% cost per frame</fact4>. <fact5>1/4 of the seniors are officers</fact5> <fact6>and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each</fact6>. <fact7>How much will be spent on the senior gifts</fact7>?

Answer_Reasoning: 
1. Calculate the cost of the pins: <fact2>2 seniors will receive pins at $5 each</fact2>, so the total cost for pins is 2 x $5 = $10.
2. Calculate the cost of the picture frames: <fact1>44 seniors</fact1> each receive a picture frame costing <fact3>$20</fact3>. The total cost for the frames is 44 x $20 = $880.
3. Calculate the etching cost for the frames: The etching adds <fact4>20%</fact4> to the cost of each frame. The additional cost per frame is 20% of $20, which is $4. Therefore, the total etching cost is 44 x $4 = $176.
4. Calculate the cost of the cords: <fact5>1/4 of the seniors are officers</fact5>, so 44/4 = 11 officers. Each officer receives a cord costing <fact6>$12</fact6>, so the total cost for the cords is 11 x $12 = $132.
5. Add all the costs together to find the total amount spent on the senior gifts: $10 (pins) + $880 (frames) + $176 (etching) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

Answer_Reasoning: To determine the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar. According to <fact6>, it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit, which costs 2 x <fact2>$6</fact2> = $12. According to <fact7>, it takes 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, which costs 1.5 x <fact3>$8</fact3> = $12. According to <fact8>, it takes 2 pounds of honey, which costs 2 x <fact4>$10</fact4> = $20. Therefore, the total cost to make one jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44. According to <fact5>, each jar is sold for $50, so the profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6. To find the profit for 10 jars, we multiply the profit per jar by 10: $6 x 10 = $60.

Therefore, he has 50 + 100 = 150 trees before any are chopped down or die. He chops down <fact4>2 trees a year</fact4> for 10 years, so he chops down 2 x 10 = 20 trees. This leaves him with 150 - 20 = 130 trees. After 10 years, <fact3>30% of the trees die</fact3>. 30% of 130 is 0.3 x 130 = 39 trees. Therefore, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total number of eggs hidden by Cole: <fact1>3 dozen</fact1> = 3 x 12 = 36 eggs. Lamar finds <fact2>5 eggs</fact2>. Stacy finds <fact4>twice as many as Lamar</fact4>, so Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs. Charlie finds <fact5>2 less than Stacy</fact5>, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei finds <fact3>half as many as Charlie</fact3>, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs. The total number of eggs found is 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. From <fact3>, we know that 11 students need size extra-small.
2. According to <fact6>, twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small.
3. From <fact2>, four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.
4. According to <fact4>, half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.
5. From <fact5>, six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

Answer_Reasoning: Colby has already spent money on <fact2>5 movies on a Friday or Saturday</fact2> and <fact3>8 movies on other days</fact3>. The cost for the Friday or Saturday movies is 5 x <fact6>$10</fact6> = $50. The cost for the other movies is 8 x <fact7>$7</fact7> = $56. He also spent money on <fact4>2 tubs of popcorn</fact4> and <fact5>four boxes of candy</fact5>. The cost for the popcorn is 2 x <fact8>$8</fact8> = $16, and the cost for the candy is 4 x <fact9>$2</fact9> = $8. 

Adding these expenses gives a total of $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130. Colby has <fact14>$150</fact14> to spend, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar</fact1>. <fact2>She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</fact2> <fact3>and the same amount of salt as sugar</fact3>. <fact4>She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time</fact4>. <fact5>She uses twice as much oil as salt</fact5> <fact6>and twice as much salt as zest</fact6>. <fact7>How many ounces of oil does she use</fact7>?

Answer_Reasoning: Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as \( z \). According to <fact2>, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \). From <fact6>, the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so the amount of salt is \( 2z \). According to <fact3>, the amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so the amount of sugar is also \( 2z \). From <fact5>, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the amount of oil is \( 2 \times 2z = 4z \).

The total amount of all ingredients is given by <fact4> as 10 ounces. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ z + z + 2z + 2z + 4z = 10 \]
\[ 10z = 10 \]
\[ z = 1 \]

Thus, the amount of oil, which is \( 4z \), is \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) ounces.

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers. They plant <fact6>4 sunflowers</fact6>, and each sunflower needs <fact4>3 pounds</fact4> of soil. So, the total soil for sunflowers is 4 x 3 = 12 pounds. Next, calculate the total soil used for the carnations. They plant <fact7>10 carnations</fact7>, and each carnation needs <fact5>1.5 pounds</fact5> of soil. So, the total soil for carnations is 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds. The total soil used for both sunflowers and carnations is 12 + 15 = 27 pounds. They have a <fact2>30-pound bag of soil</fact2>, so the remaining soil for roses is 30 - 27 = 3 pounds.

Answer_Reasoning: Initially, there were <fact4>20 people</fact4> on the bus. After the first stop, <fact2>40 people entered</fact2>, so there were 20 + 40 = 60 people on the bus. At the second station, <fact3>3/4 of the 40 people</fact3> entered, which is 40 x 3/4 = 30 people. So, there were 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus after the second station. According to <fact5>, the number of passengers doubled at the third station, so there were 90 x 2 = 180 people on the bus.

Answer_Reasoning: From <fact4>, we know Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. According to <fact8>, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. From <fact7>, Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.

Answer_Reasoning: Sasha has <fact5>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</fact5> that cost her <fact6>$10 each</fact6>, so the total cost for these boards is 10 x $10 = $100. She also has <fact7>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</fact7> that cost her <fact8>$16 each</fact8>, so the total cost for these boards is 5 x $16 = $80. The total cost for all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.

The prices for lumber have gone up <fact3>50%</fact3>, so the selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15. The selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24.

If she sells all the boards, she will receive 10 x $15 = $150 for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards and 5 x $24 = $120 for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards. The total revenue from selling all the boards is $150 + $120 = $270.

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact3>, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. From <fact4>, half of them were Trekking bikes, so 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes were sold. From <fact5>, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so 300 x 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes were sold. According to <fact6>, the rest were MTB bikes, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes were sold. From <fact9>, each Trekking bike is $450, so Marcel earned 150 x $450 = $67,500 from Trekking bikes. From <fact8>, each BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, so each BMX bike is $500/2 = $250. Therefore, Marcel earned 45 x $250 = $11,250 from BMX bikes. From <fact7>, each MTB bike is $500, so Marcel earned 105 x $500 = $52,500 from MTB bikes. Adding these amounts together, Marcel earned $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

One apple costs $0.5 and one banana costs twice as much. What would be the price for such a crate of fruit?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>A certain company is in the business of selling fresh fruit</fact1>. <fact2>The price for such a crate depends on the price of its individual fruits</fact2>. <fact3>One crate of such fruit consists of 5 bananas</fact3>, <fact4>12 apples</fact4>, <fact5>and 7 oranges</fact5>. <fact6>Oranges are the most expensive</fact6> <fact7>and cost three times as much as a banana per piece</fact7>. <fact8>One apple costs $0.5</fact8> <fact9>and one banana costs twice as much</fact9>. <fact10>What would be the price for such a crate of fruit</fact10>?

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact9>, one banana costs twice as much as an apple. Since <fact8>one apple costs $0.5</fact8>, one banana costs 2 x $0.5 = $1. Therefore, the cost of 5 bananas is 5 x $1 = $5 (<fact3>5 bananas</fact3>).

According to <fact7>, one orange costs three times as much as a banana. Since one banana costs $1, one orange costs 3 x $1 = $3. Therefore, the cost of 7 oranges is 7 x $3 = $21 (<fact5>7 oranges</fact5>).

The cost of 12 apples is 12 x $0.5 = $6 (<fact4>12 apples</fact4>).

Adding these costs together gives the total price for the crate: $5 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $21 (oranges) = $32.

Answer_Reasoning: Sally initially had <fact6>25 red balloons</fact6>, <fact7>7 green balloons</fact7>, and <fact8>12 yellow balloons</fact8>. 

- Due to the gust of wind, <fact9>40% of the red balloons burst</fact9>, which is 25 x 0.40 = 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.
- She accidentally released <fact11>half of the yellow balloons</fact11>, which is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.
- She found <fact2>8 blue balloons</fact2> and added <fact3>75% of them</fact3> to her clutch, which is 8 x 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student</fact1>. <fact2>Each class is 40 minutes long</fact2>. <fact3>He goes to class for 5 days a week</fact3>. <fact4>He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time</fact4>. <fact5>How many hours a week does he spend learning</fact5>, <fact6>if John has to take 2 extra classes a day</fact6>?

Answer_Reasoning: First, calculate the total number of classes John attends each day. Normally, he has <fact1>6 periods</fact1> and <fact6>2 extra classes</fact6>, so he attends 6 + 2 = 8 classes per day. Each class is <fact2>40 minutes long</fact2>, so he spends 8 x 40 = 320 minutes per day in class. Over <fact3>5 days a week</fact3>, he spends 320 x 5 = 1600 minutes in class. 

Next, calculate the extra learning time on the weekend. He spends <fact4>1/16 of his weekly minutes</fact4> each on Saturday and Sunday. The total weekly minutes spent in class is 1600, so 1/16 of 1600 is 1600/16 = 100 minutes. Therefore, he spends 100 minutes on Saturday and 100 minutes on Sunday, totaling 200 minutes for the weekend.

Adding the weekday and weekend learning times, John spends 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes learning each week. To convert this into hours, divide by 60: 1800/60 = 30 hours.

If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester</fact1>. <fact2>Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class</fact2>. <fact3>Mr. Bert allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester</fact3>. <fact4>If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests</fact4>, <fact5>what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93</fact5>?

Answer_Reasoning: To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test, we first need to calculate the total score required for an average of 93 after removing the lowest score. Since there are six tests and the lowest score is removed, the average is calculated over five tests. Therefore, the total score needed for an average of 93 is 93 x 5 = 465.

Brinley's current scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71, which will be removed. The sum of the remaining scores is 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.

To achieve a total of 465, Brinley needs a score on the sixth test such that 367 + sixth score = 465. Solving for the sixth score gives us 465 - 367 = 98.

Answer_Reasoning: 

1. On the first day, the nurses ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages (<fact1>50</fact1> x <fact6>1</fact6> = 50 bandages) and used 38 bandages (<fact5>38</fact5> bandages).

2. On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages (<fact4>10 fewer bandages compared to the first day</fact4>).

3. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages (<fact1>50</fact1> x <fact2>2</fact2> = 100 bandages), and used half a pack, which is 50/2 = 25 bandages (<fact3>half a pack</fact3>).

4. At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left (<fact7>78 bandages left</fact7>).

5. To find out how many bandages they started with on the first day, we calculate the total bandages used over the three days and the total bandages ordered:

   - Total bandages used: 38 (first day) + 28 (second day) + 25 (third day) = 91 bandages.
   - Total bandages ordered: 50 (first day) + 100 (third day) = 150 bandages.

6. The total bandages they had at the end of the third day is the initial bandages plus the ordered bandages minus the used bandages:

   Initial bandages + 150 (ordered) - 91 (used) = 78 (left).

7. Solving for the initial bandages:

   Initial bandages = 78 + 91 - 150 = 19.

Therefore, they started with 19 bandages on the first day.

Answer_Reasoning: The base price of the truck is <fact2>$30,000</fact2>. The king cab upgrade costs an extra <fact10>$7,500</fact10>. The cost of the leather seats is one-third of the king cab upgrade, which is <fact10>$7,500</fact10> / 3 = $2,500. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, which is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The upgraded exterior light package costs <fact13>$1,500</fact13>.

Answer_Reasoning: First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile. So, Tim lives <fact4>2 miles</fact4> x 5280 = 10560 feet from the school. Steve lives <fact5>3 miles</fact5> x 5280 = 15840 feet from the school.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home. Tim's speed is <fact7>264 feet per minute</fact7>, so it takes him 10560/<fact7>264</fact7> = 40 minutes to get home. Steve's speed is <fact6>440 feet per minute</fact6>, so it takes him 15840/<fact6>440</fact6> = 36 minutes to get home.

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The winner, Steve, will be waiting at his house for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.

The first scene has <fact7>twice the number of lines compared to the song</fact7>, so it has 54 x 2 = 108 lines. Sean's lines in the first scene are <fact8>a third</fact8> of 108, which is 108 x 1/3 = 36 lines. Therefore, Sean has to memorize <fact4>54</fact4> (song) + 48 (second scene) + 36 (first scene) = 138 lines in total.

168,"Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. There is also a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Russell works at a pet store</fact1> <fact2>and is distributing straw among the rodents</fact2>. <fact3>There are 10 cages of hamsters</fact3> <fact4>that are kept alone</fact4> <fact5>and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw</fact5>. <fact6>The rats are kept in 3 cages</fact6> <fact7>in equal groups</fact7> <fact8>and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw</fact8>. <fact9>There is also a pen of rabbits</fact9> <fact10>where 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits</fact10>. <fact11>No straw is used anywhere else in the store</fact11>. <fact12>If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents</fact12>, <fact13>how many rats are in each cage</fact13>?

Answer_Reasoning: 
First, calculate the total straw used for the hamsters. There are <fact3>10 cages of hamsters</fact3> and each hamster gets <fact5>5 pieces of straw</fact5>, so the total straw for hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50 pieces.

Next, calculate the straw used for the rabbits. According to <fact10>, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

The total straw used for hamsters and rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70 pieces.

According to <fact12>, a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed. Therefore, the straw used for the rats is 160 - 70 = 90 pieces.

Each rat is given <fact8>6 pieces of straw</fact8>. Therefore, the number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

The rats are kept in <fact6>3 cages</fact6> in <fact7>equal groups</fact7>. Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5 rats.

Answer_Reasoning: The original cost of the laptop is <fact8>$600</fact8>. With the trade-in, the price is reduced by <fact4>$200</fact4>, making the new cost $600 - $200 = $400. Erika's mom gives her <fact2>$80</fact2>, and she earns <fact7>$150</fact7> from her part-time job. Erika needs an extra <fact9>$50</fact9> to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 available. The total amount she has from her mom and job is $80 + $150 = $230.

Answer_Reasoning: Elaine initially had <fact1>20 Pokemon cards</fact1>. In the first month, she collected three times that number, so she collected 3 x 20 = 60 cards in the first month. According to <fact4>, in the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, so she collected 60 - 20 = 40 cards in the second month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 x (60 + 40) = 2 x 100 = 200 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards she has now is 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

Answer_Reasoning: 
1. The first train arrives in <fact4>10 minutes</fact4> and stays for <fact5>20 minutes</fact5>. Therefore, it leaves the station 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.
2. The second train arrives <fact6>half an hour (30 minutes)</fact6> after the first train leaves, which is 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after Paul starts waiting. It stays for <fact7>a quarter of 20 minutes</fact7>, which is 5 minutes, leaving at 60 + 5 = 65 minutes.
3. The third train arrives <fact10>an hour (60 minutes)</fact10> after the second train leaves, which is 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul starts waiting. It leaves immediately <fact11>after it arrives</fact11>.
4. The fourth train, which Paul needs to board, arrives <fact8>20 minutes</fact8> after the third train leaves, which is 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

192,A bumper car rink has 12 red cars. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. The rink also has yellow cars. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.  If the rink has 75 cars in total how many yellow cars do they have?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>A bumper car rink has 12 red cars</fact1>. <fact2>They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars</fact2>. <fact3>The rink also has yellow cars</fact3>. <fact4>They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars</fact4>. <fact5>If the rink has 75 cars in total</fact5> <fact6>how many yellow cars do they have</fact6>?

Answer_Reasoning: According to <fact1>, the rink has 12 red cars. From <fact2>, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10. Let the number of blue cars be B. From <fact4>, the number of yellow cars is 3 times the number of blue cars, so the number of yellow cars is 3B. According to <fact5>, the total number of cars is 75. Therefore, the equation for the total number of cars is:

12 (red) + 10 (green) + B (blue) + 3B (yellow) = 75.

Simplifying, we get:

22 + 4B = 75.

Subtract 22 from both sides:

4B = 53.

Divide by 4:

B = 13.25.

Since the number of cars must be a whole number, there seems to be an error in the problem setup or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

If we assume the number of blue cars is B, then the number of yellow cars is 3B. The equation should be:

12 (red) + 10 (green) + B (blue) + 3B (yellow) = 75.

Simplifying, we get:

22 + 4B = 75.

How many pets does Larry have?,"Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Larry loves taking care of animals</fact1>. <fact2>He has 3 cats</fact2>. <fact3>He has 3 times as many dogs as cats</fact3>. <fact4>He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs</fact4>. <fact5>He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has</fact5>. <fact6>He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits</fact6>. <fact7>How many pets does Larry have</fact7>?

Answer_Reasoning: Larry has <fact2>3 cats</fact2>. He has <fact3>3 times as many dogs as cats</fact3>, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs. He has <fact4>2 fewer rabbits than dogs</fact4>, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits. He has <fact6>a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits</fact6>, so he has 3 x 7 = 21 fish. He has <fact5>a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has</fact5>, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils. Adding all the pets together, Larry has 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price. The second venue charges $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife</fact1>. <fact2>The first venue charges a flat fee of $200</fact2>, <fact3>regardless of how many guests attend</fact3>. <fact4>At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price</fact4>. <fact5>The second venue charges $25 per person who attends</fact5>. <fact6>However, the first venue does not include food</fact6>, <fact7>which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends</fact7>. <fact8>How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost</fact8>?

Answer_Reasoning: To find the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation based on the costs described.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee plus the cost of food per guest. This can be expressed as:
Total cost for the first venue = <fact2>$200</fact2> + <fact7>$5</fact7> * number of guests.

For the second venue, the total cost is simply the cost per person, which is:
Total cost for the second venue = <fact5>$25</fact5> * number of guests.

We need to find the number of guests where these two costs are equal:
200 + 5 * number of guests = 25 * number of guests.

Solving for the number of guests:
200 = 25 * number of guests - 5 * number of guests,
200 = 20 * number of guests,
number of guests = 200 / 20,
number of guests = 10.

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","Reformatted_Question: <fact1>Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the court after a tennis match</fact1>. <fact2>In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second</fact2>. <fact3>He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all</fact3>. <fact4>In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set</fact4>. <fact5>How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match</fact5>?

Answer_Reasoning: Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \). According to <fact2>, in the third set, he retrieved \( x/2 \) balls. According to <fact4>, in the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls. The total number of balls retrieved is given by <fact3> as 19. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:

\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls. According to <fact4>, in the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \) balls.
