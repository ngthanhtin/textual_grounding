225,"<fact1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</fact1>. He has two mugs of water. <fact2>One mug is 33 degrees</fact2>. The other is an unknown temperature. If he <fact3>pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact3> into his water bottle and <fact4>one ounce from the other bottle</fact4>, <fact5>he is now able to drink the water</fact5>. At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug that allows Donny to drink the water, given that he can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.

Let's break down the information:

1. **Fact 1**: Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.
2. **Fact 2**: One mug is 33 degrees.
3. **Fact 3**: Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug.
4. **Fact 4**: Donny pours 1 ounce from the other mug (unknown temperature).
5. **Fact 5**: After mixing, the water is at least 40 degrees, which means Donny can drink it.

We need to find the minimum temperature of the second mug (let's call it \( T \)) that results in a mixture of at least 40 degrees.

Let's use the concept of weighted average to find the temperature of the mixture:

- The total volume of the mixture is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) ounces.
- The contribution to the temperature from the 33-degree water is \( \frac{4}{5} \times 33 \).
- The contribution to the temperature from the unknown temperature water is \( \frac{1}{5} \times T \).

The equation for the average temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 33 + \frac{1}{5} \times T \geq 40
\]

Calculate the contribution from the 33-degree water:

\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 33 = \frac{132}{5} = 26.4
\]

Substitute this into the equation:

\[
26.4 + \frac{1}{5} \times T \geq 40
\]

Subtract 26.4 from both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times T \geq 40 - 26.4
\]

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times T \geq 13.6
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 13.6 \times 5
\]

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for the mixture to be at least 40 degrees.

10,"While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. <fact1>Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees</fact1>, <fact2>half this amount from the shortest trees</fact2>, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, <fact3>her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees</fact3> and <fact4>3 times as many apples from the shortest trees</fact4>. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a <fact5>combined total of 500 apples</fact5>, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Joanne's Gathering:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples (Fact 1).
   - From the shortest trees: Half of 30 apples = 15 apples (Fact 2).
   - From the average trees: Let's denote this amount as \( x \).

2. **Sister's Gathering:**
   - From the tallest trees: Twice as many as Joanne, so 2 * 30 = 60 apples (Fact 3).
   - From the shortest trees: Three times as many as Joanne, so 3 * 15 = 45 apples (Fact 4).
   - From the average trees: 0 apples (as stated).

3. **Total Apples Gathered:**
   - Combined total: 500 apples (Fact 5).

Now, let's set up the equation for the total number of apples gathered by both sisters:

- Joanne's total: 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + \( x \) (average).
- Sister's total: 60 (tallest) + 45 (shortest).

The equation for the combined total is:
\[ 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 150 + x = 500 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 500 - 150 \]
\[ x = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.

103,"Lana is brewing cups of tea for her friends. She has <fact1>27 cups</fact1>, and she <fact2>divides these into 3 rows</fact2>. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. She then uses the <fact3>remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea</fact3>. How many cups of mint tea are in each row?","To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Cups of Tea**: Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea.

2. **Dividing into Rows**: She divides these 27 cups into 3 rows. Therefore, each row will have:
   \[
   \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
   \]

3. **Chamomile and Mint Tea**: In each row, there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups in each row as \( C \) and the number of mint tea cups as \( M \). Since they are equal, we have:
   \[
   C = M
   \]

4. **Total Chamomile and Mint Tea in Each Row**: Since each row has 9 cups, and these are equally divided between chamomile and mint tea, we have:
   \[
   C + M = 9
   \]
   Since \( C = M \), we can substitute to get:
   \[
   2M = 9
   \]
   Solving for \( M \), we find:
   \[
   M = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
   \]

5. **Remaining Cups for Cinnamon Tea**: The problem states that the remaining cups are used to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. However, since the number of cups in each row must be a whole number, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate:

   If each row has 9 cups, and these are equally divided between chamomile and mint, then each row should have 4 cups of chamomile and 4 cups of mint, leaving 1 cup per row for cinnamon tea. However, this does not match the condition of having 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

   Let's assume the problem meant to say that the remaining cups after dividing into rows are used for cinnamon tea, and the division into rows is not strictly equal for chamomile and mint.

6. **Correct Calculation**: If we assume the remaining cups are used for cinnamon tea, then:
   \[
   27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups for chamomile and mint tea}
   \]
   Dividing these 12 cups into 3 rows gives:
   \[
   \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups per row for chamomile and mint}
   \]
   Since chamomile and mint are equal, each row has:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ cups of mint tea per row}
   \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is \(\boxed{2}\).

1. **Total eggs hidden by Cole**:  
   Cole hid 3 dozen eggs.  
   1 dozen = 12 eggs, so 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs.

2. **Eggs found by Lamar**:  
   Lamar finds 5 eggs.

3. **Eggs found by Stacy**:  
   Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.  
   Stacy finds 2 × 5 = 10 eggs.

4. **Eggs found by Charlie**:  
   Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.  
   Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.

5. **Eggs found by Mei**:  
   Mei finds half as many as Charlie.  
   Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

6. **Total eggs found by all**:  
   Total eggs found = Lamar's eggs + Stacy's eggs + Charlie's eggs + Mei's eggs  
   Total eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

7. **Eggs still hidden**:  
   Eggs still hidden = Total eggs hidden - Total eggs found  
   Eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

How long did it take him to get across the lake?","To determine how long it took James to swim across the lake, we need to break down the problem into parts based on the facts provided.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - The total distance across the lake is 20 miles.
   - James swims 60% of this distance initially.
   - Distance swum initially = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken for the initial swim:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - Time taken for the initial 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - Rest time = 0.5 * 6 hours = 3 hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - Total distance = 20 miles.

     28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Understand the savings distribution:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 (fact 3).
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans (fact 4).
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The rest of the savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is:
     \[
     6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the original prices:**
   - The jogger jeans were originally priced at:
     \[
     22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The tattered jeans were originally priced at:
     \[
     28 + 4 = 32 \text{ dollars}

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he <fact4>recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches</fact4>. On Monday the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He <fact2>used up 45% of the chalk by the end of the day</fact2>. If the teacher goes back to using only 20% of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?","To solve this problem, we need to track the length of the chalk over the days and determine when it becomes smaller than 2 inches, at which point the teacher will recycle it.

1. **Initial Length of Chalk**: The piece of chalk starts at 5 inches.

2. **Usage on Monday**: On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - Chalk used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches.

3. **Daily Usage from Tuesday Onwards**: The teacher plans to use 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - 20% of 2.75 inches = 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches.

4. **Tuesday**: 
   - Chalk used on Tuesday = 0.55 inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Tuesday = 2.75 inches - 0.55 inches = 2.20 inches.

5. **Wednesday**:
   - Chalk used on Wednesday = 20% of 2.20 inches = 0.20 * 2.20 = 0.44 inches.
   - Remaining chalk after Wednesday = 2.20 inches - 0.44 inches = 1.76 inches.

At the end of Wednesday, the chalk is 1.76 inches long, which is smaller than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher will recycle the chalk after Wednesday.

Thus, the teacher can use the chalk for **2 more days** (Tuesday and Wednesday) before he has to recycle it.

If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","To determine Sasha's profit from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the selling price of each type of board and then subtract the original cost from the total selling price.

1. **Calculate the original cost of the lumber:**
   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Original cost per board = $10
     - Total original cost = 10 boards * $10/board = $100
   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - Original cost per board = $16
     - Total original cost = 5 boards * $16/board = $80
   - Total original cost for all boards = $100 + $80 = $180

2. **Calculate the selling price of the lumber:**
   - The prices for lumber have increased by 50%.
   - For the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - New price per board = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15
     - Total selling price = 10 boards * $15/board = $150
   - For the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - New price per board = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24
     - Total selling price = 5 boards * $24/board = $120
   - Total selling price for all boards = $150 + $120 = $270

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost
   - Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

How much money was he out?,"To determine how much money James was out, we need to calculate the total cost of the CDs he purchased, the discount he received, and the amount he earned from selling 5 of them.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:**
   - James bought 10 CDs.
   - Each CD costs $15.
   - Total cost before discount = 10 CDs × $15/CD = $150.

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 40%.
   - Discount amount = 40% of $150 = 0.40 × $150 = $60.

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Total cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
   - Total cost after discount = $150 - $60 = $90.

4. **Calculate the amount James earned from selling 5 CDs:**
   - He sold 5 CDs for $40.
   - Total earnings from selling 5 CDs = $40.

5. **Calculate the net amount James is out:**

His best friend Allen asked if Tim could make an <fact4>extra gallon for him that was twice as tart</fact4> as the other gallons. How many lemons will Tim need?","To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we need to break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the initial 4 gallons of lemonade:**

   - According to the recipe, 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice (fact1).
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice (fact2).
   - Therefore, for 1 gallon, Tim needs 6 lemons.
   - For 4 gallons, Tim will need:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} \times 6 \text{ lemons per gallon} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra gallon that is twice as tart:**

   - The extra gallon is twice as tart, meaning it requires twice the amount of lemon juice.
   - Normally, 1 gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice, so twice as tart would require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   - Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, 2 cups of juice would require:
     \[
     2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}

How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Initial Situation**: Julia was out of plastic spoons, so she had 0 spoons initially.

2. **Julia's Purchase**: Julia bought a new package of spoons. Let's denote the number of spoons in this package as \( x \).

3. **Husband's Contribution**: Julia's husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. So, she received 5 spoons from her husband.

4. **Usage of Spoons**: Julia used three of the spoons to sample her stew. This means she used 3 spoons from the total she had.

5. **Total Spoons for Setting the Table**: After using 3 spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons left to set the table.

Now, let's calculate the total number of spoons Julia had before using any:

- Total spoons before using any = Spoons from Julia's package + Spoons from her husband's package
- Total spoons before using any = \( x + 5 \)

After using 3 spoons, she had 12 spoons left:

- Total spoons after using 3 = Total spoons before using any - 3
- 12 = \( x + 5 - 3 \)

Simplifying the equation:

- 12 = \( x + 2 \)

To find \( x \), subtract 2 from both sides:

- \( x = 12 - 2 \)
- \( x = 10 \)

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.

73,"A toy manufacturer receives an <fact1>order for 400 toys</fact1>. 5 workers are available to work on the order. <fact2>2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour</fact2>, and <fact3>another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour</fact3>. They all work on the order during their <fact4>10-hour shift</fact4>, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer <fact5>still needs another 20 toys</fact5> to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of toys produced by all workers during their 10-hour shift and then determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour.

1. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:**

   - **First two workers:** Each produces 6 toys per hour.
     - Total for these two workers in 10 hours: 
       \[
       2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
       \]

   - **Next two workers:** Each produces 4 toys per hour.
     - Total for these two workers in 10 hours:
       \[
       2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
       \]

2. **Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:**
   \[
   120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of toys needed:**
   - The order is for 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 20 more toys are needed.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers during the shift is:
     \[
     400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - Total toys produced by all workers: 380 toys
   - Total toys produced by the first four workers: 200 toys
   - Therefore, the fifth worker produced:
     \[
     380 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 180 \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours and produced 180 toys.
   - Therefore, the number of toys per hour produced by the fifth worker is:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?","To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved:**

   According to the information given, Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week and has been saving them for the past 12 weeks.

   \[
   \text{Toothpicks saved so far} = 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
   \]

2. **Determine how many more toothpicks she needs:**

   The blueprint requires 200 toothpicks, and Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks.

   \[
   \text{Toothpicks needed} = 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more weeks it will take to collect the remaining toothpicks:**

   Melanie continues to save 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks she needs to save 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week.

   \[
   \text{Weeks needed} = \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the 200 toothpicks needed for her sculpture.

They had <fact7>78 bandages left at the end of the third day</fact7>. How many bandages did they start with on the first day?","To determine how many bandages the nurses' station started with on the first day, we need to track the usage and ordering of bandages over the three days.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38 (fact2)
   - Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50 bandages (fact3)
   - Net change in bandages: -38 (used) + 50 (ordered) = +12

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38 - 10 = 28 (fact4)
   - No bandages ordered.
   - Net change in bandages: -28

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack = 50 / 2 = 25 (fact6)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = 2 * 50 = 100 bandages (fact5)
   - Net change in bandages: -25 (used) + 100 (ordered) = +75

4. **End of Third Day:**
   - Bandages left: 78 (fact7)

Now, let's calculate the initial number of bandages:

- Let \( x \) be the number of bandages they started with.
- After the first day: \( x + 12 \)
- After the second day: \( x + 12 - 28 = x - 16 \)
- After the third day: \( x - 16 + 75 = x + 59 \)

According to fact7, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day:

\[ x + 59 = 78 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 78 - 59 \]
\[ x = 19 \]

Therefore, the nurses' station started with 19 bandages on the first day.

1. **Initial Total Pencils:**
   - There are 30 students in Marissa's class.
   - Each student started the year with 10 pencils.
   - Therefore, the total number of pencils at the start of the year is:
     \[
     30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ pencils/student} = 300 \text{ pencils}
     \]

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - According to fact3, 1/5 of the total pencils were used after two months.
   - Calculate 1/5 of 300 pencils:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of pencils remaining after two months is:
     \[
     300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils}
     \]

3. **Pencils Remaining at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, according to fact4.
   - Calculate 1/3 of the 240 remaining pencils:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils}

   - Half of the first friend's guess is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \).
   - Adding 20 to this gives \( 40 + 20 = 60 \).

3. **Third friend's guess**: According to <fact3>, the third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend's guess.
   - 25% of the first friend's guess is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
   - Adding this to the first friend's guess gives \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).

Now, we have the guesses:
- First friend: 80
- Second friend: 60
- Third friend: 100

To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

How much will it cost to paint the room?,"To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of the walls to be painted:**

   - The north and south walls are each 10 feet wide and 8 feet high. Therefore, the area of one wall is:
     \[
     10 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet}
     \]
     Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
     \[
     2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
     \]

   - The east and west walls are each 5 feet wide and 8 feet high. Therefore, the area of one wall is:
     \[
     5 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} = 40 \, \text{square feet}

If he watched <fact1>7 hours of TV in all</fact1>, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, given that he watched a total of 7 hours of TV throughout the week.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night.
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

2. **Thursday**: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total for Thursday = 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours

3. **Friday**: Frankie watched two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total for Friday = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Now, let's calculate the total hours watched from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

- Total hours from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours

According to fact1, Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV in all. Therefore, the remaining time he watched TV must have been on Wednesday.

- Total hours watched on Wednesday = Total hours watched in all - Total hours from other days

The <fact7>fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves</fact7>, and this is the train Paul will board. In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?","To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the time intervals between the arrivals and departures of the trains.

1. **First Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - First train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.
   - Stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.
   - Leaves 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul starts waiting.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - Second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at 65 + 60 = 125 minutes.
   - Leaves immediately after it arrives, so it also leaves at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 145 minutes for his train.

With everything combined, how many candles and flashlights are Brianna's family using when the lights go out?","To determine the total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using, we need to calculate each separately and then add them together.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights.**

- According to fact2, there is a flashlight for every person. Since there are 4 people living in the house (fact1), they have 4 flashlights for the people.
- Additionally, there are two flashlights for each room. With 8 rooms in the house (fact3), this means they have \(2 \times 8 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.

Total flashlights = flashlights for people + flashlights for rooms = \(4 + 16 = 20\).

**Step 2: Calculate the number of candles.**

- For half of the rooms, they have 4 small candles each (fact4). Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms. Therefore, they have \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
- For the other half of the rooms, they have 5 medium candles each (fact5). Again, for 4 rooms, they have \(5 \times 4 = 20\) medium candles.

Total candles = small candles + medium candles = \(16 + 20 = 36\).

The air conditioner <fact4>ran on low for 3 hours</fact4>, then it was <fact5>turned up to high for 4 hours</fact5>. Afterward, it was <fact6>turned off for 2 hours</fact6>. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the entire period described.

1. **Running on Low for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour on low.
   - For 3 hours, the total cooling effect is:  
     \(3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Running on High for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour on high.
   - For 4 hours, the total cooling effect is:  
     \(4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ degrees/hour} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **Turned Off for 2 Hours:**
   - Without the air conditioner, the room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - For 2 hours, the total warming effect is:  
     \(2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ degrees/hour} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:

- Total cooling effect: \(6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} = 18 \text{ degrees}\).
- Total warming effect: \(4 \text{ degrees}\).

- Net change in temperature:  
  \(18 \text{ degrees (cooling)} - 4 \text{ degrees (warming)} = 14 \text{ degrees}\).

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

If the <fact5>number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station</fact5>, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of passengers on the bus after each stop and then determine how many more people are needed to reach the bus's full capacity.

1. **Initial number of passengers:**
   - The bus departed Chengli city with 20 people.

2. **First stop:**
   - 40 people entered the bus.
   - Total passengers after the first stop = 20 (initial) + 40 = 60.

3. **Second stop:**
   - 3/4 of the number of people who entered at the first stop entered the bus.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop = 3/4 * 40 = 30.
   - Total passengers after the second stop = 60 (after first stop) + 30 = 90.

4. **Third stop:**
   - The number of passengers on the bus doubled.
   - Total passengers after the third stop = 2 * 90 = 180.

5. **Calculate remaining spaces:**
   - The bus has a capacity of 200 people.

On the second day, <fact4>Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day</fact4>, while <fact5>Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day</fact5>. How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then determine how much more water is needed to fill the tank to its full capacity.

**Day 1:**

1. **Wanda's Contribution:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
   - Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \) gallons.

2. **Ms. B's Contribution:**
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda did.
   - Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \) gallons.

**Total for Day 1:**
- Total water pumped on Day 1 = Wanda's contribution + Ms. B's contribution
- Total = 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 gallons

**Day 2:**

3. **Wanda's Contribution:**
   - On the second day, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Therefore, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \) gallons.

4. **Ms. B's Contribution:**
   - On the second day, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
   - Therefore, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \) gallons.

**Total for Day 2:**
- Total water pumped on Day 2 = Wanda's contribution + Ms. B's contribution
- Total = 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 gallons

**Total Water Pumped Over Two Days:**
- Total water pumped = Total for Day 1 + Total for Day 2
- Total = 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 gallons

**Remaining Water Needed to Fill the Tank:**
- The tank's full capacity is 18,000 gallons.
- Water remaining to fill the tank = 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons

28,"Felix notices that kids in the neighborhood are always getting things stuck in trees. Since he is an expert tree climber, he decided to start charging kids to get their stuff out. He charges based on how high he has to climb. <fact1>Every branch he has to climb up costs $.25</fact1>. <fact2>During the week he made $105</fact2>. On average, how many branches did he climb per day?","To find out how many branches Felix climbed on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week:**

   According to <fact1>, Felix charges $0.25 per branch. From <fact2>, we know he made $105 in a week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total earnings by the charge per branch:

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Charge per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = 420
   \]

2. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**

   Assuming Felix works 7 days a week, we divide the total number of branches climbed by 7 to find the average per day:

   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{7} = \frac{420}{7}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = 60
   \]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60.

She uses <fact4>twice as much oil as salt</fact4> and <fact5>twice as much salt as zest</fact5>. How many ounces of oil does she use?","To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses in her salt scrub, given the constraints and relationships between the ingredients.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
   - Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance (in ounces).
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
   - Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).
   - Let \( u \) be the amount of sugar (in ounces).

2. **Set up the relationships:**
   - From fact2: The amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, so \( z = f \).
   - From fact3: The amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, so \( s = u \).
   - From fact4: The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so \( o = 2s \).
   - From fact5: The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( s = 2z \).

3. **Express all variables in terms of \( z \):**
   - Since \( s = 2z \), we have \( u = s = 2z \).
   - Since \( o = 2s \), we have \( o = 2(2z) = 4z \).
   - We already have \( f = z \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of scrub:**
   - The total amount of scrub is the sum of all the ingredients:
     \[
     z + f + s + o + u = z + z + 2z + 4z + 2z = 10z
     \]

5. **Set the total amount equal to the jar size:**
   - We know the total amount of scrub is 10 ounces (from fact1), so:
     \[
     10z = 10
     \]

6. **Solve for \( z \):**
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[

163,Julia's boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on <fact1>two liters of water for every ten feet</fact1> she rowed back towards shore. It <fact2>took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet</fact2>. The <fact3>shore was 64 seconds away</fact3>. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water the boat takes on by the time Julia reaches the shore. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total time it takes Julia to reach the shore:**
   - According to fact3, the shore is 64 seconds away.

2. **Determine how far Julia rows in 64 seconds:**
   - From fact2, we know it takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - To find out how far she rows in 64 seconds, we can set up a proportion:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{20 \times 64}{16} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine how much water the boat takes on per distance rowed:**
   - From fact1, the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - Since Julia rows 80 feet to reach the shore, we need to calculate how much water is taken on in that distance.
   - For every 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. Therefore, for 80 feet:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has taken on a total of 16 liters of water.

When he got them home and added them to his pond, he found that he now had <fact4>twice as many orange fish as white fish</fact4>. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store:**
   - Bob bought a total of 17 fish from the store. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).
   - Therefore, we have the equation: 
     \[
     x + y = 17
     \]

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the fish from the store, Bob has a total of \( 3 + x \) orange fish and \( 4 + y \) white fish.

4. **Condition Given:**
   - Bob found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     3 + x = 2(4 + y)
     \]

5. **Solving the Equations:**
   - From the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \), we can expand and simplify:
     \[
     3 + x = 8 + 2y
     \]
     \[
     x = 8 + 2y - 3
     \]
     \[
     x = 5 + 2y
     \]

6. **Substitute into the First Equation:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 + 2y \) into \( x + y = 17 \):
     \[
     5 + 2y + y = 17
     \]
     \[
     5 + 3y = 17
     \]
     \[
     3y = 12
     \]
     \[
     y = 4
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Bob bought 4 white fish from the store.

How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?","To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set based on the given facts.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

From the facts:
1. In the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).
2. In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
3. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve this equation, first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 2(4) = 2(19)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
4x + x + 8 = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we know \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?","To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine his total expenses and subtract them from his total income.

1. **Determine the total number of clients:**
   - Current clients: 3
   - Potential clients: 5
   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies:**
   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients × 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
   - Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients × 1 pack/client = 8 packs

3. **Calculate the cost of bleach:**
   - Cost per bottle of bleach = $2
   - Total cost for bleach = 16 bottles × $2/bottle = $32

4. **Calculate the cost of cloths:**
   - Cost per pack of cloths = $5
   - Total cost for cloths = 8 packs × $5/pack = $40

5. **Calculate total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths = $32 + $40 = $72

6. **Calculate profit:**
   - Total income = $92
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

How many petals in total are on the flowers in the vase?","To find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase, we need to calculate the number of petals for each group of flowers Rose picked, account for the flowers she dropped, and then sum the remaining petals.

1. **Initial Petal Count:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each:  
     \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - She picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:  
     \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - She picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each:  
     \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - She picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:

Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <fact3>20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension</fact3>. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the different scenarios in which he might not have to turn it in.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. This means there is a 50% chance that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework due to the substitute teacher.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - If the normal teacher comes in (which has a 50% chance), there is a 40% chance that she will give everyone an extension. This means there is a 60% chance that she will not give an extension.
   - If no extension is given to the whole class, there is still a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Probability of having to turn in homework with a substitute teacher:**
  - Since the substitute teacher won't collect the homework, the probability is 0%.

- **Probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher:**
  - The probability that the normal teacher comes in is 50%.
  - The probability that the normal teacher does not give an extension to the whole class is 60%.
  - The probability that Marcus does not get a personal extension is 80% (since there is a 20% chance he can convince the teacher).

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework with the normal teacher is:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24 \text{ or } 24\% \]

Finally, the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the two scenarios where he has to turn it in:
- Substitute teacher scenario: 0%
- Normal teacher scenario: 24%

Therefore, the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is 24%.

He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?","To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay using both pricing options and then find the difference.

1. **Calculate the total duration of Cameron's stay:**
   - Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.
   - From 5 pm to 5 am is 12 hours.
   - From 5 am to 10 am is an additional 5 hours.
   - Total stay duration = 12 hours + 5 hours = 17 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost using the 12-hour stay option with additional hours:**
   - The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
   - For the additional 5 hours, the cost is 70 pesos per hour.
   - Additional cost = 5 hours × 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.
   - Total cost for 17 hours using this option = 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

3. **Calculate the cost using the 24-hour stay option:**
   - The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

4. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 17-hour stay using the 12-hour option
   - Savings = 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = 250 pesos.

How many slices of pizza were left?,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza were left after Bryce and his friends ate their portions.

1. **Determine the total number of pizzas and slices:**
   - Bryce and his four friends each ordered their own pizza, so there are 5 pizzas in total.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices (from fact1).
   - Total slices = 5 pizzas × 12 slices/pizza = 60 slices.

2. **Calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   - Bryce and two friends (3 people in total) ate 2/3 of their pizzas (from fact2).
   - Each of these 3 people had 1 pizza, so they ate 2/3 of 12 slices each.
   - Slices eaten by each of these 3 people = 2/3 × 12 = 8 slices.
   - Total slices eaten by Bryce and two friends = 3 people × 8 slices/person = 24 slices.

3. **Calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends:**
   - The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas (from fact3).
   - Each of these 2 people had 1 pizza, so they ate 3/4 of 12 slices each.
   - Slices eaten by each of these 2 people = 3/4 × 12 = 9 slices.

3. **Calculate the time difference for Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne (fact1).
   - Since Wayne's travel time is 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

4. **Calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave:**
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to account for her 16-minute travel time and the 5-minute head start.
   - Therefore, Bernadette should leave \(16 + 5 = 21\) minutes before Wayne.

The <fact3>third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child</fact3>. And the <fact4>fourth child is three inches taller than the third child</fact4>. How tall is the fourth child, in inches?","To find the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the height of each child step by step, starting from the first child.

1. **First Child:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   - Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the height in inches is:
     \[
     6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Second Child:**
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
   - Therefore, the height of the second child is:
     \[
     72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Third Child:**
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   - Therefore, the height of the third child is:
     \[
     74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.
   - Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:

How much did Aleksandra need to pay for the dinner she ordered?","To determine how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item she ordered and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the Bagel:**
   - According to fact1, the bagel costs $4.

2. **Cost of the Soup:**
   - According to fact2, the soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
   - First, calculate 25% of the bagel's cost: 
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5
     \]

3. **Cost of the Cake:**
   - According to fact3, the cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Therefore, the cost of the cake is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2
     \]

After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, <fact5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat</fact5>. How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of kernels that pop during each time interval and then sum them up.

1. **First 30 seconds:**
   - According to fact1, twenty kernels pop in the first 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels popped = 20

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - According to fact2, three times the amount of the first 30 seconds pop in the next 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels popped = 3 * 20 = 60

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - According to fact3, four times the initial popping rate occurs in the next 30 seconds.
   - Number of kernels popped = 4 * 20 = 80

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - According to fact4, the popping slows down to half the rate of the past 30 seconds.
   - The rate in the past 30 seconds was 80 kernels.
   - Number of kernels popped = 0.5 * 80 = 40

5. **Residual heat:**
   - According to fact5, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from the residual heat.
   - Number of kernels popped = 0.25 * 40 = 10

Now, we sum up all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20
- Next 30 seconds: 60
- Next 30 seconds: 80
- Final 30 seconds: 40
- Residual heat: 10

Total number of kernels popped = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys <fact1>two 1-pound boxes of them</fact1> for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys <fact2>four 12-pound bags</fact2>. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys <fact3>forty-two 75-pound bales</fact3>. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys <fact4>twenty 65-pound sacks</fact4>. If his <fact5>truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time</fact5>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then sum them up.

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - The farmer buys two 1-pound boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 boxes × 1 pound/box = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - The farmer buys four 12-pound bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = 4 bags × 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - The farmer buys forty-two 75-pound bales.
   - Total weight of hay = 42 bales × 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - The farmer buys twenty 65-pound sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = 20 sacks × 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight of all the feed:

- Total weight = Weight of sugar cubes + Weight of carrots + Weight of hay + Weight of oats
- Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds = 4500 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number, since a partial trip still requires a full trip.

- Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
- Number of trips = 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips.

Since 4500 pounds is exactly twice the truck's capacity, the farmer will need exactly 2 trips.
