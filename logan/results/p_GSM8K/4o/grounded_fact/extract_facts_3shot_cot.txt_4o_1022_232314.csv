225,"Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","```
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to focus on the conditions that allow Donny to drink the water. The key information includes the temperature requirement for Donny to drink water, the temperature of the first mug, and the fact that after mixing water from both mugs, the water is drinkable. These details are essential to calculate the minimum temperature of the second bottle.

### Key Facts:
<fact1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</fact1>
<fact2>One mug is 33 degrees</fact2>
<fact3>he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact3>
<fact4>one ounce from the other bottle</fact4>
<fact5>he is now able to drink the water</fact5>

### Reformatted Question:

At least how many degrees is the second bottle?

#### Final Answer Reasoning
To find the minimum temperature of the second bottle, we need to ensure that the mixed water reaches at least 40 degrees, as <fact1>Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees</fact1>. He mixes <fact3>4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug</fact3> with <fact4>one ounce from the other bottle</fact4>. The total volume of the mixed water is 5 ounces. The equation for the final temperature (T) of the mixture is:

(4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * X degrees) / 5 ounces = 40 degrees

Solving for X, we have:

(132 + X) / 5 = 40

132 + X = 200

X = 68

Therefore, the minimum temperature of the second bottle must be {68} degrees.

98,John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"```
### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to focus on the distance he travels, the cost per mile, and any additional charges. The key elements include the distance to work, the frequency of his trips, the cost per mile, and the monthly bonus he gives to his driver. These components will allow us to calculate the total annual cost.

### Key Facts:
<fact1>His work is 30 miles away</fact1>
<fact2>he has to go there and back each day</fact2>
<fact3>He goes to work 5 days a week</fact3>
<fact4>for 50 weeks a year</fact4>
<fact5>He gets charged $2 per mile driven</fact5>
<fact6>he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month</fact6>

### Fact Extraction Reasoning:
To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total distance he travels annually and the associated costs. <fact1>His work is 30 miles away</fact1>, and <fact2>he has to go there and back each day</fact2>, making it a 60-mile round trip. He travels this distance <fact3>5 days a week</fact3> for <fact4>50 weeks a year</fact4>, resulting in a total of 15,000 miles per year (60 miles/day * 5 days/week * 50 weeks/year). At a rate of <fact5>$2 per mile driven</fact5>, the cost for the miles driven is $30,000 (15,000 miles * $2/mile). Additionally, he gives his driver a <fact6>$150 bonus per month</fact6>, totaling $1,800 annually (12 months * $150/month). Therefore, the total annual cost is $31,800 ($30,000 for mileage + $1,800 for bonuses).

### Key Facts:
<fact1>His work is 30 miles away</fact1>
