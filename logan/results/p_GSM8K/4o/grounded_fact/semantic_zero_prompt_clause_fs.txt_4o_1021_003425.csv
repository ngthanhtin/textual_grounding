225,"Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?","Reformatted Question:
<person>Donny</person> has two <object1>mugs of water</object1>. One <object2>mug</object2> is <number1>33 degrees</number1>. The other is an <object3>unknown temperature</object3>. If he pours <number2>4 ounces</number2> of water from the <number1>33-degree mug</number1> into his <object4>water bottle</object4> and <number3>one ounce</number3> from the <object3>other bottle</object3>, he is now able to drink the water. <person>Donny</person> can only drink water if it's at least <number4>40 degrees</number4>. At least how many degrees is the <object3>second bottle</object3>?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Donny</person> mixes <number2>4 ounces</number2> of <number1>33-degree</number1> water with <number3>one ounce</number3> of water from the <object3>unknown temperature</object3> bottle. The resulting mixture must be at least <number4>40 degrees</number4> for <person>Donny</person> to drink it. 

To find the minimum temperature of the <object3>second bottle</object3>, we can set up an equation for the average temperature of the mixture:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times x)}{5} \geq 40
\]

where \(x\) is the temperature of the <object3>second bottle</object3>.

Solving for \(x\):

\[
\frac{132 + x}{5} \geq 40
\]

\[
132 + x \geq 200
\]

\[
x \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the temperature of the <object3>second bottle</object3> must be at least <number5>68 degrees</number5>.

He gets charged $2 per mile driven and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?,"Reformatted Question:
<person>John</person> hires a driving service to get him to work each day. He goes to work <number1>5 days a week</number1> for <number2>50 weeks a year</number2>. His work is <number3>30 miles</number3> away and he has to go there and back each day. He gets charged <number4>$2 per mile</number4> driven and he also gives his driver a <number5>$150 bonus per month</number5>. How much does he pay a year for driving?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>John</person> travels to work <number1>5 days a week</number1> for <number2>50 weeks a year</number2>, which means he travels a total of \(5 \times 50 = 250\) days a year. Each day, he travels <number3>30 miles</number3> to work and 30 miles back, totaling \(30 \times 2 = 60\) miles per day. Therefore, he travels \(60 \times 250 = 15,000\) miles a year. At a rate of <number4>$2 per mile</number4>, the cost for the miles driven is \(15,000 \times 2 = 30,000\) dollars. Additionally, he gives his driver a <number5>$150 bonus per month</number5>, which totals \(150 \times 12 = 1,800\) dollars a year. Adding these amounts together, the total cost per year is \(30,000 + 1,800 = 31,800\) dollars.

<person>Sally</person> went to the seashore for vacation. At the trinket shop, <object1>taffy</object1> was on sale for ""<concept>Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off</concept>."" She scooped up <number1>2 pounds</number1>. She also bought a <object2>mixed bag of seashells</object2> for <number2>$1.50</number2> and <number3>4 magnets</number3> that were <number4>$0.25 each</number4>. Her <person>parents</person> gave her <number5>$10</number5> to buy whatever she wanted. How much money does <person>Sally</person> have left?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Sally</person> bought <number1>2 pounds</number1> of <object1>taffy</object1>. According to the <concept>sale</concept>, the first pound costs $3, and the second pound is half off, costing $1.50. Therefore, the total cost for the <object1>taffy</object1> is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50. She also bought a <object2>mixed bag of seashells</object2> for <number2>$1.50</number2> and <number3>4 magnets</number3> at <number4>$0.25 each</number4>, which totals 4 x $0.25 = $1.00. Adding these costs together, the total amount spent is $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00. Her <person>parents</person> gave her <number5>$10</number5>, so the amount of money <person>Sally</person> has left is $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

How many <object>dollars</object> did she make that day?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Shawnda</person> charges <number5>25 cents</number5> per <object>tire</object>. On the first day, <number1>5 people</number1> on bicycles came by, and each bicycle has <number2>2 tires</number2>, so that's a total of \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires. <number3>3 people</number3> came by on tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires. Finally, <number4>one person</number4> came by on a unicycle, which has 1 tire. The total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires. At <number5>25 cents</number5> per tire, the total earnings in cents are \(20 \times 25 = 500\) cents. Converting this to <object>dollars</object>, she made \(500 \div 100 = 5\) dollars.

10,"Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While Joanne is gathering apples from her family's orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?","Reformatted Question:
<person1>Joanne</person1> gathers <number1>30 apples</number1> from the tallest trees, <number2>half this amount</number2> from the shortest trees, and <concept1>more apples from the average trees</concept1>. <person2>Her sister</person2> gathers <number3>twice as many apples</number3> from the tallest trees and <number4>3 times as many apples</number4> from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. While <person1>Joanne</person1> is gathering apples from her family's orchard, <person2>her sister</person2> comes outside to help her. If the <person1>sisters</person1> have gathered a <number5>combined total of 500 apples</number5>, how many apples did <person1>Joanne</person1> gather from the <concept1>average trees</concept1>?

Answer Reasoning:
<person1>Joanne</person1> gathers <number1>30 apples</number1> from the tallest trees. She gathers <number2>half this amount</number2> from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples. Let <number6>x</number6> be the number of apples <person1>Joanne</person1> gathers from the <concept1>average trees</concept1>.

<person2>Her sister</person2> gathers <number3>twice as many apples</number3> from the tallest trees, which is 60 apples, and <number4>3 times as many apples</number4> from the shortest trees, which is 45 apples. She doesn't gather any from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is <number5>500 apples</number5>.

The equation for the total apples gathered is:
30 (tallest by Joanne) + 15 (shortest by Joanne) + x (average by Joanne) + 60 (tallest by sister) + 45 (shortest by sister) = 500

This simplifies to:
150 + x = 500

Solving for x gives:
x = 500 - 150
x = 350

Therefore, <person1>Joanne</person1> gathered <number6>350 apples</number6> from the <concept1>average trees</concept1>.

134,"Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Each pound is 16 ounces.  Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes. If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, if each box weighs 8 ounces?","Reformatted Question:
Each <object1>crayon</object1> weighs <number1>1 ounce</number1>. Each <concept1>pound</concept1> is <number2>16 ounces</number2>. <person>Nik</person> has <number3>200 crayons</number3>. He wants to separate them into <number4>groups of 8</number4> and put them into <object2>boxes</object2>. If he puts all of his <object1>crayons</object1> into <object2>boxes</object2>, what is the <concept2>total weight</concept2>, in <concept1>pounds</concept1>, of the <object1>crayons</object1> and the <object2>boxes</object2>, if each <object2>box</object2> weighs <number5>8 ounces</number5>?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total weight of the <object1>crayons</object1>. Since each <object1>crayon</object1> weighs <number1>1 ounce</number1> and <person>Nik</person> has <number3>200 crayons</number3>, the total weight of the <object1>crayons</object1> is <number3>200 ounces</number3>.

Next, determine how many <object2>boxes</object2> are needed. Since <person>Nik</person> wants to separate the <object1>crayons</object1> into <number4>groups of 8</number4>, he will need \( \frac{200}{8} = 25 \) <object2>boxes</object2>.

Calculate the total weight of the <object2>boxes</object2>. Each <object2>box</object2> weighs <number5>8 ounces</number5>, so the total weight of the <object2>boxes</object2> is \( 25 \times 8 = 200 \) ounces.

Now, find the <concept2>total weight</concept2> of the <object1>crayons</object1> and the <object2>boxes</object2> in ounces: \( 200 + 200 = 400 \) ounces.

Finally, convert the <concept2>total weight</concept2> from ounces to <concept1>pounds</concept1>. Since each <concept1>pound</concept1> is <number2>16 ounces</number2>, the <concept2>total weight</concept2> in <concept1>pounds</concept1> is \( \frac{400}{16} = 25 \) pounds.

The <concept>movie</concept> took <number>5 weeks</number> to finish. How much did <person>Jean</person> pay?

Answer Reasoning:
To calculate how much <person>Jean</person> paid, we first need to determine the total cost before the discount. The <object>makeup artist</object> charges <number>$250 an hour</number>, and it takes <number>6 hours</number> each day. Therefore, the daily cost is \(250 \times 6 = 1500\) dollars. Since <person>Jean</person> needs the makeup done <number>4 times a week</number>, the weekly cost is \(1500 \times 4 = 6000\) dollars. The <concept>movie</concept> took <number>5 weeks</number> to finish, so the total cost before the discount is \(6000 \times 5 = 30000\) dollars. After the <concept>movie</concept> is done, the <object>makeup artist</object> gives <person>Jean</person> a <number>10% discount</number>. The discount amount is \(30000 \times 0.10 = 3000\) dollars. Therefore, the final amount <person>Jean</person> paid is \(30000 - 3000 = 27000\) dollars.

To keep <person1>Sandra's</person1> business, how many <object2>red roses</object2> must <person2>Fred</person2> deliver by <time1>5 pm</time1>?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how many <object2>red roses</object2> <person2>Fred</person2> must deliver, we first need to find out how many <object1>white carnations</object1> were ordered. According to the information, <number2>200 pink calla lilies</number2> were ordered, which were <number3>five times the number of white carnations</number3>.

How many hours a week does he spend learning, if John has to take 2 extra classes a day?","Reformatted Question:
There are <number1>6 periods</number1> in the day for a normal student. Each class is <time1>40 minutes</time1> long. He goes to class for <time2>5 days a week</time2>. He then spends <number2>1/16</number2> of his weekly minutes each on <time3>Saturday</time3> and <time4>Sunday</time4> as extra learning time. How many <concept>hours a week</concept> does <person>John</person> spend learning, if <person>John</person> has to take <number3>2 extra classes a day</number3>?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total minutes spent in class during the weekdays. With <number1>6 periods</number1> a day and <time1>40 minutes</time1> per class, that's \(6 \times 40 = 240\) minutes per day. Over <time2>5 days a week</time2>, this amounts to \(240 \times 5 = 1200\) minutes.

<person>John</person> takes <number3>2 extra classes a day</number3>, adding \(2 \times 40 = 80\) minutes per day. Over <time2>5 days a week</time2>, this adds \(80 \times 5 = 400\) minutes.

The total minutes spent in class during the weekdays is \(1200 + 400 = 1600\) minutes.

<person>John</person> spends <number2>1/16</number2> of his weekly minutes each on <time3>Saturday</time3> and <time4>Sunday</time4>. The total weekly minutes spent in class is 1600, so \(1/16\) of 1600 is \(1600 / 16 = 100\) minutes per day on the weekend. Over two days, this is \(100 \times 2 = 200\) minutes.

The total weekly learning time is \(1600 + 200 = 1800\) minutes.

To convert minutes to <concept>hours</concept>, divide by 60: \(1800 / 60 = 30\) hours.

Answer Reasoning:
To find out how many <object>checks</object> <person>Buford</person> writes per <time5>year</time5>, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes for each category and sum them up. 

1. For the gas bill, he writes a check every <time1>month</time1>, which is 12 checks per <time5>year</time5>.
2. For the pest and lawn service, he writes a check <time2>quarterly</time2>, which is 4 checks per <time5>year</time5>.
3. For the electric bill, he writes a check <time3>once per month</time3>, which is 12 checks per <time5>year</time5>.
4. For the church, he writes a check <time4>twice per month</time4>, which is 24 checks per <time5>year</time5>.

<person1>Cole</person1> hid <number1>3 dozen eggs</number1> in the <location>yard</location> for the Easter egg hunt. <person2>Lamar</person2> finds <number2>5 eggs</number2>. <person3>Mei</person3> finds half as many as <person4>Charlie</person4>. <person5>Stacy</person5> finds twice as many as <person2>Lamar</person2>. <person4>Charlie</person4> finds <number3>2 less</number3> than <person5>Stacy</person5>. How many <object>eggs</object> are still hidden in the <location>yard</location>?

Answer Reasoning:
<number1>3 dozen eggs</number1> means <number1>36 eggs</number1> were hidden by <person1>Cole</person1>. <person2>Lamar</person2> finds <number2>5 eggs</number2>. <person5>Stacy</person5> finds twice as many as <person2>Lamar</person2>, which is 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. <person4>Charlie</person4> finds <number3>2 less</number3> than <person5>Stacy</person5>, which is 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. <person3>Mei</person3> finds half as many as <person4>Charlie</person4>, which is 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Total eggs found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

<number1>36 eggs</number1> were hidden, so the number of <object>eggs</object> still hidden in the <location>yard</location> is 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. How many slices of cheese did he use?,"Reformatted Question:
<person>Carl</person>'s favorite food is <object1>cheese</object1>. <person>He</person> ate a <object2>sandwich</object2> every day this week for lunch and used <number1>2 slices of cheese</number1> on each <object2>sandwich</object2>. <person>He</person> made a big dish of <object3>macaroni and cheese</object3> to last him several dinners for the week and used <number2>8 slices of cheese</number2> in it. <person>He</person> ate <object4>cheese and egg omelets</object4> for breakfast <number3>3 days</number3> in the week using <number4>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</number4>. How many <object1>slices of cheese</object1> did <person>he</person> use?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Carl</person> used <number1>2 slices of cheese</number1> per <object2>sandwich</object2> and ate one every day for a week, which is 7 days. Therefore, he used \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices of cheese for <object2>sandwiches</object2>. For the <object3>macaroni and cheese</object3>, he used <number2>8 slices of cheese</number2>. For the <object4>cheese and egg omelets</object4>, he used <number4>one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich</number4>, which means he used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices per omelet. He made omelets for <number3>3 days</number3>, so he used \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices of cheese for the omelets. Adding these up, the total number of <object1>slices of cheese</object1> used is \(14 + 8 + 9 = 31\).

Initially, <person>Maria</person> had <number>1</number> water balloon. She invited <number>4</number> friends, making a total of <number>5</number> people. Her mom gave each of them <number>3</number> more balloons, so each person had <number>1 + 3 = 4</number> balloons initially. <person>Maria</person> gave each of her <number>4</number> friends <number>2</number> balloons, so she gave away <number>4 * 2 = 8</number> balloons.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take him to get across the lake?","Reformatted Question:
<person>James</person> loves to go swimming and has to swim across a <number>20-mile</number> lake. He swims <number>60%</number> of the distance. He can swim at a pace of <number>2 miles per hour</number>. After that, he stops on an island and rests for <number>half as long as the swimming time</number>. He then finishes the remaining distance while going <number>half the speed</number>. How long did it take him to get across the lake?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>James</person> needs to swim across a <number>20-mile</number> lake. He swims <number>60%</number> of the distance first, which is \(0.6 \times 20 = 12\) miles. At a pace of <number>2 miles per hour</number>, it takes him \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) hours to swim this distance. 

After swimming, he rests for <number>half as long as the swimming time</number>, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.

The remaining distance is \(20 - 12 = 8\) miles. He swims this distance at <number>half the speed</number>, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour. It takes him \( \frac{8}{1} = 8 \) hours to swim the remaining distance.

The total time taken is the sum of the time for the first swim, the rest, and the second swim: \(6 + 3 + 8 = 17\) hours.

The three boys picked up and carried all of the balls in one trip. <person1>Jordan</person1> carried twice as many balls as <person2>Jason</person2>, and <person2>Jason</person2> carried twice as many balls as <person3>Jeffrey</person3>. After the practice time was over, he asked <person1>Jordan</person1>, <person2>Jason</person2>, and <person3>Jeffrey</person3> to pick up the balls and carry them over to the bag. <person4>Coach</person4> brought one bag filled with <object>basketballs</object> to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began. If <person2>Jason</person2> had picked up and carried <number>2 balls</number>, what is the total number of balls that the <person4>coach</person4> brought to practice?

Answer Reasoning:
Given that <person2>Jason</person2> carried <number>2 balls</number>, we know that <person3>Jeffrey</person3> carried half as many balls as <person2>Jason</person2>. Therefore, <person3>Jeffrey</person3> carried 1 ball. Since <person1>Jordan</person1> carried twice as many balls as <person2>Jason</person2>, <person1>Jordan</person1> carried 4 balls. Adding up the balls carried by <person1>Jordan</person1>, <person2>Jason</person2>, and <person3>Jeffrey</person3>, we have 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 balls. Therefore, the total number of balls that the <person4>coach</person4> brought to practice is 7.

166,"Mr. Robles' first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?","Reformatted Question:
<person>Mr. Robles</person>' first monkey eats <number1>10 bananas each day</number1>. <person>Mr. Robles</person> buys <number2>315 bananas</number2>, which is enough to feed his <number3>three monkeys</number3> for a <time>week</time>. The second monkey eats <number4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</number4> and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day. How many bananas does the <person>third monkey</person> eat each day?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total number of bananas needed per day for all three monkeys. Since <person>Mr. Robles</person> buys <number2>315 bananas</number2> for a <time>week</time>, this means he buys enough for 7 days. Therefore, the monkeys eat <number2>315 bananas</number2> / 7 days = <number5>45 bananas per day</number5>.

The first monkey eats <number1>10 bananas each day</number1>. The second monkey eats <number4>4 more bananas than the first monkey</number4>, which is <number1>10 bananas</number1> + <number4>4 bananas</number4> = <number6>14 bananas</number6>.

The total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys per day is <number1>10 bananas</number1> + <number6>14 bananas</number6> = <number7>24 bananas</number7>.

The <person>third monkey</person> eats the rest of the bananas, which is <number5>45 bananas per day</number5> - <number7>24 bananas</number7> = <number8>21 bananas</number8>.

<person>Tom</person> decides to give his wife an <concept>anniversary getaway</concept>. The <object1>hotel</object1> is <number1>20%</number1> more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend. The <object2>normal price</object2> is <number2>$1500 per day</number2>. The <object3>plane tickets</object3> cost <number3>$5000 each</number3>. If they are there for <number4>3 days</number4> how much did the <concept>trip</concept> cost?

Answer Reasoning:
To calculate the total cost of the <concept>trip</concept>, we need to consider both the <object1>hotel</object1> and the <object3>plane tickets</object3>.

1. Calculate the increased <object1>hotel</object1> cost per day:
   - The <object2>normal price</object2> is <number2>$1500 per day</number2>.
   - The <object1>hotel</object1> is <number1>20%</number1> more expensive, so the increase is \(1500 \times 0.20 = 300\).
   - The new price per day is \(1500 + 300 = 1800\).

2. Calculate the total <object1>hotel</object1> cost for <number4>3 days</number4>:
   - \(1800 \times 3 = 5400\).

3. Calculate the total cost of the <object3>plane tickets</object3>:
   - Each ticket costs <number3>$5000</number3>, and there are two tickets (one for <person>Tom</person> and one for his wife), so the total is \(5000 \times 2 = 10000\).

4. Add the total <object1>hotel</object1> cost and the total <object3>plane tickets</object3> cost to find the total <concept>trip</concept> cost:
   - \(5400 + 10000 = 15400\).

If they plant <number>4 sunflowers</number> and <number>10 carnations</number>, how many <object1>roses</object1> can they plant?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Artemis</person> and her father have a <number>30-pound bag of soil</number>. They plant <number>4 sunflowers</number>, and each <object2>sunflower</object2> needs <number>3 pounds</number> of soil, so they use \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds of soil for the sunflowers. They also plant <number>10 carnations</number>, and each <object3>carnation</object3> needs <number>1.5 pounds</number> of soil, so they use \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds of soil for the carnations. In total, they use \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations. This leaves them with \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds of soil. Each <object1>rose</object1> needs <number>1 pound</number> of soil, so they can plant \(3 \div 1 = 3\) roses.

How many <number>dollars</number> did each pack of <concept>strawberry gum</concept> cost?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Suzie</person> bought <number>four packs of gum</number> in total and paid <number>$7</number>. She bought <number>two packs</number> of <concept>strawberry gum</concept>, paid <number>$2</number> for a pack of <concept>grape gum</concept>, and paid <number>half as much</number> for a small pack of <concept>green apple gum</concept>. 

First, calculate the cost of the <concept>green apple gum</concept> pack. Since it is half the price of the <concept>grape gum</concept> pack, it costs <number>$1</number>.

Now, calculate the total cost of the <concept>strawberry gum</concept> packs:
Total cost of <concept>grape gum</concept> and <concept>green apple gum</concept> = <number>$2</number> + <number>$1</number> = <number>$3</number>.

The remaining amount for the <concept>strawberry gum</concept> is <number>$7</number> - <number>$3</number> = <number>$4</number>.

Since there are <number>two packs</number> of <concept>strawberry gum</concept>, each pack costs <number>$4</number> / <number>2</number> = <number>$2</number>.

If <person2>Tim</person2> can ride his skateboard at <number4>264 feet per minute</number4>, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how long the winner will wait, we need to calculate the time it takes for both <person1>Steve</person1> and <person2>Tim</person2> to reach their homes from <location>school</location>.

1. Convert the distances from miles to feet:
   - <number1>2 miles</number1> = 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet
   - <number2>3 miles</number2> = 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet

2. Calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home:
   - <person2>Tim</person2> takes 10560 feet / <number4>264 feet per minute</number4> = 40 minutes
   - <person1>Steve</person1> takes 15840 feet / <number3>440 feet per minute</number3> = 36 minutes

3. Determine who arrives first and how long they wait:
   - <person1>Steve</person1> arrives in 36 minutes, while <person2>Tim</person2> arrives in 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, <person1>Steve</person1> will wait 40 - 36 = 4 minutes for <person2>Tim</person2>.

<person>James</person> buys a new <object1>wardrobe</object1>. He buys <number1>10 suits</number1> and <number2>10 dress pants</number2>. The <object2>suits</object2> cost <number3>$750 each</number3> and the <object3>dress pants</object3> cost <number4>1/5 that cost</number4>. He also buys <number5>3 dress shirts per suit</number5>. The <object4>dress shirts</object4> were <number6>$60 each</number6>. How much did <object1>everything</object1> cost?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>James</person> buys <number1>10 suits</number1> at <number3>$750 each</number3>, which costs him 10 * 750 = $7,500. The <object3>dress pants</object3> cost <number4>1/5</number4> of the <object2>suits</object2>, so each pair of pants costs 750 / 5 = $150. For <number2>10 dress pants</number2>, the cost is 10 * 150 = $1,500. He buys <number5>3 dress shirts per suit</number5>, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts. The <object4>dress shirts</object4> cost <number6>$60 each</number6>, so the total cost for the shirts is 30 * 60 = $1,800.

<person>John</person> drives to his <person>friend's house</person>. He drives at a speed of <number>70 mph</number>. He had to take a detour that added <number>10 miles</number> to his trip. After he gets there he takes a route home that is <number>240 miles</number> but he goes <number>80 mph</number>. The <location>friend's house</location> is <number>200 miles</number> away. How long did the trip take?

Answer Reasoning:
To calculate the total time for the trip, we need to consider both the trip to the friend's house and the return trip. 

1. The distance to the friend's house is <number>200 miles</number> plus an additional <number>10 miles</number> due to the detour, making it a total of 210 miles. The speed for this part of the trip is <number>70 mph</number>. The time taken for this part is calculated as distance divided by speed: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours.

2. The return trip is <number>240 miles</number> at a speed of <number>80 mph</number>. The time taken for this part is 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Adding both parts of the trip together, the total time is 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

Answer Reasoning:
To find the <concept>average number of Junebugs</concept> <person>Rita</person> removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of <object>Junebugs</object> removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days.

On <time3>Monday</time3>, she removed <number2>39 Junebugs</number2>. On <time1>Tuesday</time1> and <time2>Wednesday</time2>, she removed <number1>twice as many Junebugs</number1> as on <time3>Monday</time3>, which is 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. On <time4>Thursday</time4>, she removed <number3>48</number3> Junebugs, and on <time5>Friday</time5>, she removed <number4>57</number4> Junebugs.

The total number of Junebugs removed is:
39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday) + 78 (Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

The <concept>average number of Junebugs</concept> removed per day is the total number divided by the number of days:
300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs per day.

183,"There are 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. Among those that are not indoor plants, two-thirds of them are outdoor plants while the rest are flowering plants. One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. What percent of the plants are flowering plants?","Reformatted Question:
There are <number1>100 plants</number1> in <person>Mrs. Smith's</person> garden. Among those that are not <concept1>indoor plants</concept1>, <number2>two-thirds</number2> of them are <concept2>outdoor plants</concept2> while the rest are <concept3>flowering plants</concept3>. <number3>One-fourth</number3> of her plants are <concept1>indoor plants</concept1>. What percent of the plants are <concept3>flowering plants</concept3>?

Answer Reasoning:
First, we need to determine how many of the <number1>100 plants</number1> are <concept1>indoor plants</concept1>. Since <number3>one-fourth</number3> of the plants are <concept1>indoor plants</concept1>, that means there are \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \) <concept1>indoor plants</concept1>.

This leaves \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) plants that are not <concept1>indoor plants</concept1>. Among these 75 plants, <number2>two-thirds</number2> are <concept2>outdoor plants</concept2>. Therefore, the number of <concept2>outdoor plants</concept2> is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \).

The remaining plants that are not <concept2>outdoor plants</concept2> are <concept3>flowering plants</concept3>. So, the number of <concept3>flowering plants</concept3> is \( 75 - 50 = 25 \).

To find the percentage of the total plants that are <concept3>flowering plants</concept3>, we calculate \( \frac{25}{100} \times 100\% = 25\% \).

If Millie sells all of the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?","Reformatted Question:
<person>Millie</person> decides to open a lemonade stand. Each <object>pitcher</object> holds <number1>12 cups</number1> of lemonade. She spends <number2>$18</number2> to buy enough supplies to make <number3>3 pitchers</number3> of lemonade. She sells each <object>cup of lemonade</object> for <number4>$1</number4>. She sells an average of <number5>4 cups</number5> per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If <person>Millie</person> sells all of the lemonade, how much <concept>profit</concept> will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Millie</person> makes <number3>3 pitchers</number3> of lemonade, and each <object>pitcher</object> holds <number1>12 cups</number1>. Therefore, she has a total of 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each <object>cup of lemonade</object> for <number4>$1</number4>, so if she sells all 36 cups, she will earn 36 x $1 = $36 in revenue. She spends <number2>$18</number2> on supplies, so her total profit is $36 - $18 = $18. She sells an average of <number5>4 cups</number5> per hour, so it takes her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade. Therefore, her <concept>profit</concept> per hour is $18 / 9 = $2.

There are <number1>3 classes</number1>. Each <concept1>class</concept1> in a <concept2>school</concept2> has <number2>20 students</number2>. The <concept3>first class</concept3> has <number3>15 girls</number3>. The <concept4>second class</concept4> has <number4>12 girls</number4>. The <concept2>school</concept2> as a whole is <number5>50% boys</number5> and <number6>50% girls</number6>. How many <concept5>boys</concept5> are in the <concept6>third class</concept6>?

Answer Reasoning:
The total number of students in the <concept2>school</concept2> is calculated by multiplying the number of students per <concept1>class</concept1> by the number of classes: <number2>20 students</number2> per <concept1>class</concept1> times <number1>3 classes</number1> equals <number7>60 students</number7> in total.

Since the <concept2>school</concept2> is <number5>50% boys</number5> and <number6>50% girls</number6>, there are <number8>30 boys</number8> and <number9>30 girls</number9> in the <concept2>school</concept2>.

The <concept3>first class</concept3> has <number3>15 girls</number3>, so it has <number10>5 boys</number10> (since <number2>20 students</number2> minus <number3>15 girls</number3> equals <number10>5 boys</number10>).

The <concept4>second class</concept4> has <number4>12 girls</number4>, so it has <number11>8 boys</number11> (since <number2>20 students</number2> minus <number4>12 girls</number4> equals <number11>8 boys</number11>).

To find the number of <concept5>boys</concept5> in the <concept6>third class</concept6>, we subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys in the school: <number8>30 boys</number8> minus <number10>5 boys</number10> minus <number11>8 boys</number11> equals <number12>17 boys</number12>.

How much more revenue did the <person>mechanic</person> earn on the day with higher revenue?

Answer Reasoning:
To find out how much more revenue the <person>mechanic</person> earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the revenue for both <time1>Friday</time1> and <time2>Thursday</time2>.

On <time1>Friday</time1>, the <person>mechanic</person> repaired <number1>12 car tires</number1>. The revenue from car tires is calculated as follows:
Revenue on <time1>Friday</time1> = <number1>12 car tires</number1> × <number3>$40</number3> = $480.

On <time2>Thursday</time2>, the <person>mechanic</person> repaired <number4>6 truck tires</number4> and <number5>4 car tires</number5>. The revenue from truck tires is:
Revenue from truck tires = <number4>6 truck tires</number4> × <number2>$60</number2> = $360.
The revenue from car tires is:
Revenue from car tires = <number5>4 car tires</number5> × <number3>$40</number3> = $160.
Total revenue on <time2>Thursday</time2> = $360 + $160 = $520.

The day with higher revenue is <time2>Thursday</time2> with $520. The difference in revenue between <time2>Thursday</time2> and <time1>Friday</time1> is:
$520 - $480 = $40.

Of the <person>people</person> who receive interviews, <number>20%</number> receive a job offer. How many <person>people</person> accept the position?

Answer Reasoning:
First, we need to determine how many <person>people</person> receive interviews. Since <number>30%</number> of the <person>people</person> who apply receive interviews, that means <number>30%</number> of <number>100</number> is <number>30</number> <person>people</person>.

Next, we calculate how many of these <person>people</person> receive a job offer. Since <number>20%</number> of the <person>people</person> who receive interviews get a job offer, <number>20%</number> of <number>30</number> is <number>6</number> <person>people</person>.

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how many times <person>Sara</person> must mow the lawn, we first calculate the total cost of the <object1>jacket</object1> and <number1>2 pairs of shoes</number1>. The <object1>jacket</object1> costs <number2>$30</number2> and each pair of shoes costs <number3>$20</number3>, so the total cost for the shoes is <number3>$20</number3> x <number1>2</number1> = $40. Therefore, the total cost for both the <object1>jacket</object1> and shoes is <number2>$30</number2> + $40 = $70.

<person>Sara</person> already had <number7>$10</number7> saved. She earned <number6>$5</number6> each time she babysat, and she babysat <number5>4 times</number5>, so she earned <number6>$5</number6> x <number5>4</number5> = $20 from babysitting. Adding this to her savings, she has $10 + $20 = $30.

To afford the <object1>jacket</object1> and shoes, she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more. Her parents pay her <number4>$4</number4> each time she mows the lawn. Therefore, she needs to mow the lawn $40 / $4 = 10 times to earn the remaining $40.

What is the <concept>likelihood, expressed as a percentage</concept>, that <person3>Ellen's friend</person3> gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can?

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, there are <number1>3 shaken sodas</number1> and 9 unshaken sodas in the <object1>case of 12 sodas</object1>. <person2>Ellen's brother</person2> took <number2>1 of the shaken sodas</number2> and <number3>2 of the unshaken sodas</number3>. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 7 unshaken sodas. Then, <person1>Ellen</person1> took <number4>1 unshaken soda</number4> for herself, leaving 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas. Therefore, there are 8 sodas left in total. The probability that <person3>Ellen's friend</person3> gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas, which is 2/8. Converting this fraction to a percentage, we get 25%.

Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than <number2>2 inches</number2>. The teacher likes to conserve chalk, so he tries to only use <number3>20%</number3> of the chalk each day. On <time1>Monday</time1> the teacher used a new piece of chalk. His students need extra help that day, so he ended up writing more than usual. He used up <number4>45%</number4> of the chalk by the end of the day. If the teacher goes back to using only <number3>20%</number3> of the chalk each day, how many days does he have before he has to recycle this piece?

Answer Reasoning:
The teacher starts with a <number1>5-inch</number1> piece of chalk. By the end of <time1>Monday</time1>, he has used <number4>45%</number4> of it, which means he has used 2.25 inches (45% of 5 inches). Therefore, he has 2.75 inches of chalk remaining (5 inches - 2.25 inches). The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than <number2>2 inches</number2>, so he can use 0.75 inches more before recycling (2.75 inches - 2 inches). If he uses <number3>20%</number3> of the original 5-inch piece each day, he uses 1 inch per day (20% of 5 inches). Therefore, he can use the chalk for 0.75 days before it needs to be recycled. Since he cannot use a fraction of a day, he has 0 full days left before he has to recycle the chalk.

She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?","Reformatted Question:
Since <person>Sasha</person> has leftover lumber, she decides to sell them. She notices that prices for lumber have gone up <number>50%</number> in the last few months after she bought some lumber. She has leftover <number1>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</number1> that cost her <number2>$10 each</number2>. She also has <number3>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</number3> she bought for <number4>$16 each</number4>. If she sells them all, how much <concept>profit</concept> does she make?

Answer Reasoning:
To calculate the <concept>profit</concept> <person>Sasha</person> makes, we first need to determine the selling price of the lumber after the <number>50%</number> increase. 

1. For the <number1>ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards</number1>:
   - Original cost per board: <number2>$10</number2>
   - Selling price per board after 50% increase: $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15
   - Total selling price for ten boards: 10 boards * $15 = $150
   - Total cost for ten boards: 10 boards * $10 = $100

2. For the <number3>five 4 x 4 x 10 boards</number3>:
   - Original cost per board: <number4>$16</number4>
   - Selling price per board after 50% increase: $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24
   - Total selling price for five boards: 5 boards * $24 = $120
   - Total cost for five boards: 5 boards * $16 = $80

3. Total selling price for all boards: $150 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270
4. Total cost for all boards: $100 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180

5. <concept>Profit</concept> = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90

Answer Reasoning:
<person>James</person> bought <number1>10 new CDs</number1> at a cost of <number4>$15</number4> each. The total cost before the discount is 10 CDs * $15 = $150. He received a <number5>40% off</number5> discount, so he paid 60% of the total cost. Therefore, the amount he paid is $150 * 0.60 = $90. 

<person>James</person> sold <number2>5 of them</number2> for <number3>$40</number3>. Therefore, the money he recouped from selling the CDs is $40. 

The total amount of <concept>money</concept> <person>James</person> was out is the amount he paid minus the amount he recouped: $90 - $40 = $50.

<person>Russell</person> works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the <concept>rodents</concept>. There are <number1>10 cages</number1> of <concept>hamsters</concept> that are kept alone and each hamster is given <number2>5 pieces of straw</number2>. The <concept>rats</concept> are kept in <number3>3 cages</number3> in equal groups and each rat is given <number4>6 pieces of straw</number4>. There is also a pen of <concept>rabbits</concept> where <number5>20 pieces of straw</number5> are distributed among the rabbits. No straw is used anywhere else in the store. If <number6>160 pieces of straw</number6> have been distributed among the small rodents, how many <concept>rats</concept> are in each cage?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total straw used for the <concept>hamsters</concept>. There are <number1>10 cages</number1> with each hamster receiving <number2>5 pieces of straw</number2>, so the total straw for hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

Next, consider the <concept>rabbits</concept>. They receive <number5>20 pieces of straw</number5>.

The total straw used for both <concept>hamsters</concept> and <concept>rabbits</concept> is \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.

Since <number6>160 pieces of straw</number6> are distributed in total, the straw used for the <concept>rats</concept> is \(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces.

The <concept>rats</concept> are kept in <number3>3 cages</number3>, and each rat receives <number4>6 pieces of straw</number4>. Let \(x\) be the number of rats in each cage. The total straw for rats is \(3 \times x \times 6 = 90\).

Solving for \(x\), we have:
\[ 18x = 90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 <concept>rats</concept> in each cage.

<person>Mark</person> is trying to choose between two <concept>venues</concept> for a surprise party for his wife. The <concept>first venue</concept> charges a <concept>flat fee</concept> of <number>$200</number>, regardless of how many guests attend. At the <concept>second venue</concept>, food for each guest is already included in the price. The <concept>second venue</concept> charges <number>$25 per person</number> who attends. However, the <concept>first venue</concept> does not include food, which <person>Mark</person> estimates will cost <number>$5 for each person</number> who attends. How many <concept>guests</concept> are necessary for the two <concept>venues</concept> to be equal in cost?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine the number of <concept>guests</concept> needed for the costs of the two <concept>venues</concept> to be equal, we need to set up an equation based on the costs. 

The cost for the <concept>first venue</concept> is a <concept>flat fee</concept> of <number>$200</number> plus <number>$5 per person</number> for food. Therefore, the total cost for the <concept>first venue</concept> is \(200 + 5x\), where \(x\) is the number of <concept>guests</concept>.

The cost for the <concept>second venue</concept> is <number>$25 per person</number>, so the total cost is \(25x\).

To find when the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, <number>10 guests</number> are necessary for the two <concept>venues</concept> to be equal in cost.

Answer Reasoning:
To calculate the total calories in the omelet, we need to consider the calories from each ingredient. 

- The omelet contains <number1>6 eggs</number1>, and each egg is <number3>75 calories</number3>. Therefore, the total calories from eggs are \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.
- The omelet contains <number2>2 oz of cheese</number2>, and cheese is <number4>120 calories per ounce</number4>. Therefore, the total calories from cheese are \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.
- The omelet contains an <concept>equal amount of ham</concept> as cheese, which is <number2>2 oz</number2>. Ham is <number5>40 calories per ounce</number5>. Therefore, the total calories from ham are \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Based on these average numbers, how many <object>telephone calls</object> would <person>Jason</person> need to make to sell <number5>15 cars</number5> and earn his bonus?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Jason</person> needs to sell <number5>15 cars</number5>. According to the averages, for every <number1>two customers</number1> that come into the dealership, <number2>one</number2> buys a car. This means he needs <number6>30 customers</number6> to come into the dealership to sell <number5>15 cars</number5> (since 15 x 2 = 30). 

To get <number6>30 customers</number6> into the dealership, and knowing that for every <number3>25 telephone calls</number3>, <number4>one person</number4> comes in, <person>Jason</person> needs to make <number7>750 telephone calls</number7> (since 30 x 25 = 750).

How much will it cost to fill the pool?","Reformatted Question:
<person>Mr. Smith</person> measured and found the <object>pool</object> is <number1>14 feet wide</number1>, <number2>25 feet long</number2>, and <number3>4 feet deep</number3>. The <object>pool company</object> instructed them to measure to find the <concept>volume of the pool</concept>, then to multiply it by <number4>5.9</number4> to calculate how many <concept>gallons of water</concept> they need. The <person>Smith family</person> is getting ready for summer and needs to have their <object>swimming pool</object> filled. The cost for the <object>pool company</object> to come and fill the <object>pool</object> is <number5>$0.10 per gallon</number5>. How much will it cost to fill the <object>pool</object>?

Answer Reasoning:
To find the cost to fill the <object>pool</object>, we first need to calculate the <concept>volume of the pool</concept>. The <concept>volume</concept> is calculated by multiplying the <number1>width</number1>, <number2>length</number2>, and <number3>depth</number3> of the <object>pool</object>. So, the <concept>volume</concept> is \(14 \times 25 \times 4 = 1400\) cubic feet. 

Next, we convert the <concept>volume</concept> in cubic feet to <concept>gallons</concept> by multiplying by <number4>5.9</number4>. Therefore, the number of <concept>gallons</concept> needed is \(1400 \times 5.9 = 8260\) gallons.

Finally, we calculate the cost by multiplying the number of <concept>gallons</concept> by the cost per gallon, which is <number5>$0.10</number5>. Thus, the cost to fill the <object>pool</object> is \(8260 \times 0.10 = 826\) dollars.

Answer Reasoning:
To calculate <person>Mr. Tan's</person> <concept5>net proceeds</concept5> from selling the house, we need to subtract all the costs from the <number3>selling price</number3> of <number3>$400,000</number3>.

1. Calculate the <concept1>transfer fees</concept1>: 
   - <number1>3%</number1> of <number3>$400,000</number3> is \(0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000\).

2. Calculate the <concept3>brokerage fee</concept3>: 
   - <number2>5%</number2> of <number3>$400,000</number3> is \(0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000\).

3. Add the <concept1>transfer fees</concept1> and <concept3>brokerage fee</concept3> to the <number4>remaining loan amount</number4>:
   - Total costs = \(12,000 + 20,000 + 250,000 = 282,000\).

4. Subtract the total costs from the <number3>selling price</number3> to find the <concept5>net proceeds</concept5>:
   - Net proceeds = \(400,000 - 282,000 = 118,000\).

On the <time3>third race</time3>, <person>he</person> lost <number3>1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</number3>. How much did <person>he</person> lose on average that day?

Answer Reasoning:
In the <time2>first race</time2>, <person>Johnny's dad</person> lost <number2>$5</number2>. In the <time1>second race</time1>, <person>he</person> won <number1>$1 more than twice the amount he previously lost</number1>. Since he lost <number2>$5</number2> in the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. Therefore, he won $11 in the second race. In the <time3>third race</time3>, <person>he</person> lost <number3>1.5 times as much as he won in the second race</number3>, which is 1.5 times $11, equaling $16.50. 

To find the average loss, we calculate the total loss and divide by the number of races. The total loss is $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) - $11 (second race win) = $10.50. The average loss over the three races is $10.50 / 3 = $3.50.

The fee to rent the theater is <number5>$125</number5> for a party of <number6>20</number6>, plus <number7>$6</number7> for each additional guest. How much will the party cost?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Kayla</person> invited a total of <number1>25 classmates</number1> + <number2>7 girls in her dance class</number2> + <number3>13 family members</number3> = <number8>45 people</number8>. Since <number4>4 people</number4> said they could not come, the total number of attendees is <number8>45 people</number8> - <number4>4 people</number4> = <number9>41 people</number9>.

The base fee for the theater is <number5>$125</number5> for a party of <number6>20</number6>. Since there are <number9>41 people</number9> attending, there are <number10>41 - 20 = 21 additional guests</number10>.

How much does <person>Daniel</person> have to spend on all the items he wants to buy?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total cost of each type of item before the discount:
- The cost of <number1>five</number1> <object1>notebooks</object1> is <number1>5</number1> * <number6>$1.50</number6> = $7.50.
- The cost of <number2>two</number2> <object2>pens</object2> is <number2>2</number2> * <number7>$0.25</number7> = $0.50.
- The cost of <number3>one</number3> <object3>calculator</object3> is <number3>1</number3> * <number8>$12</number8> = $12.00.
- The cost of <number4>one</number4> <object4>geometry set</object4> is <number4>1</number4> * <number9>$10</number9> = $10.00.

Next, sum these costs to find the total cost before the discount:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

Now, apply the <number5>10%</number5> discount:
The discount amount is <number5>10%</number5> of $30.00, which is $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the amount <person>Daniel</person> has to spend:
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, the <location>hotel</location> had <number1>100 guests</number1>. <number2>24 guests</number2> checked out early, reducing the number of guests to 100 - 24 = 76. <number3>15 guests</number3> opted for a late checkout, so they were still in the hotel until later. In the afternoon, <number5>twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout</number5>, which means 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in.

He has <number5>$24</number5> to buy wood for sticks. What is the most <object>popsicle sticks</object> he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Frederick</person> wants to maximize the number of <object>popsicle sticks</object> he can make with <number5>$24</number5>. The cost of a <object1>2 x 4</object1> is <number1>$4</number1> and it yields <number3>200 sticks</number3>. The cost of a <object2>2 x 8</object2> is <number2>$6</number2> and it yields <number4>400 sticks</number4>. To find the most cost-effective option, we calculate the cost per stick for each type of wood:

- For <object1>2 x 4</object1>: <number1>$4</number1> / <number3>200 sticks</number3> = $0.02 per stick.
- For <object2>2 x 8</object2>: <number2>$6</number2> / <number4>400 sticks</number4> = $0.015 per stick.

The <object2>2 x 8</object2> is cheaper per stick. With <number5>$24</number5>, <person>Frederick</person> can buy:

- <number5>$24</number5> / <number2>$6</number2> = 4 pieces of <object2>2 x 8</object2>.

This results in 4 * <number4>400 sticks</number4> = 1600 sticks.

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, <person>Tom</person> has <number2>50 trees</number2>. Over <time>10 years</time>, he plants <number1>10 trees a year</number1>, which adds up to 100 trees (10 trees/year * 10 years). Therefore, the total number of trees before any die or are chopped down is 150 trees (50 initial + 100 planted).

Every year, <person>Tom</person> chops down <number4>2 trees a year</number4>, which over <time>10 years</time> amounts to 20 trees (2 trees/year * 10 years). So, the number of trees after chopping is 130 trees (150 - 20).

After <time>10 years</time>, <number3>30%</number3> of the trees die. 30% of 130 trees is 39 trees (0.30 * 130). Therefore, the number of trees left after the die-off is 91 trees (130 - 39).

<person>Tom</person> has <number>4 bedrooms</number> in his house. The <object1>living room</object1> is <number>5 times bigger</number> than <object2>one bedroom</object2>. The <object3>rest of the house</object3> is <number>1000 square feet</number>. The <object2>bedrooms</object2> measure <number>20 by 12 feet</number> each. What is the <concept>total area</concept>, in square feet, of the house?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the area of one <object2>bedroom</object2>. Each bedroom measures <number>20 by 12 feet</number>, so the area of one bedroom is 20 * 12 = <number>240 square feet</number>. Since there are <number>4 bedrooms</number>, the total area of all bedrooms is 4 * 240 = <number>960 square feet</number>.

Next, calculate the area of the <object1>living room</object1>. The living room is <number>5 times bigger</number> than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = <number>1200 square feet</number>.

The <object3>rest of the house</object3> is <number>1000 square feet</number>.

Finally, add the areas of the bedrooms, living room, and the rest of the house to find the <concept>total area</concept> of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = <number>3160 square feet</number>.

First, we need to determine how many points <person2>Julie</person2> scored in the first game. Since <person2>Julie</person2> scored <number4>4 fewer points</number4> than <person1>Sasha</person1> in the first game, and <person1>Sasha</person1> scored <number2>14 points</number2>, <person2>Julie</person2> scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points in the first game.

He gets a <number3>20% discount</number3> on them. He also buys a <object4>finale firework</object4> that costs <number4>$150</number4>. How much did he spend in total?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Tim</person> buys a <object2>package of fireworks</object2> worth <number1>$400</number1>. The second <object3>pack</object3> is worth <number2>twice that much</number2>, which is <number2>$800</number2>. The total cost of these two packs before the discount is <number1>$400</number1> + <number2>$800</number2> = <number5>$1200</number5>.

How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?","Reformatted Question:
A toy manufacturer receives an order for <number1>400 toys</number1>. <number2>5 workers</number2> are available to work on the order. They all work on the order during their <time>10-hour shift</time>, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another <number3>20 toys</number3> to be able to ship the order. <number4>2 of the workers</number4> produce <number5>6 toys an hour</number5>, and another <number6>2 workers</number6> produce <number7>4 toys an hour</number7>. How many toys per hour does the <number8>fifth worker</number8> produce?

Answer Reasoning:
The total number of toys needed is <number1>400 toys</number1>. By the end of the <time>10-hour shift</time>, <number3>20 toys</number3> are still needed, meaning <number1>400 toys</number1> - <number3>20 toys</number3> = 380 toys were produced during the shift.

<number2>5 workers</number2> worked for <time>10 hours</time>, so the total worker-hours is 5 workers * 10 hours = 50 worker-hours.

<number4>2 of the workers</number4> produce <number5>6 toys an hour</number5>, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 workers * 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 120 toys.

<number6>2 workers</number6> produce <number7>4 toys an hour</number7>, so in 10 hours, they produce 2 workers * 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 80 toys.

The total number of toys produced by the 4 workers is 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

Since 380 toys were produced in total, the <number8>fifth worker</number8> must have produced 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

Therefore, the <number8>fifth worker</number8> produces 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

They had <number6>78 bandages</number6> left at the end of the <time1>third day</time1>. How many <object2>bandages</object2> did they start with on the <time3>first day</time3>?

Answer Reasoning:
To find out how many <object2>bandages</object2> the <object1>nurses' station</object1> started with on the <time3>first day</time3>, we need to calculate the total number of <object2>bandages</object2> used and ordered over the three days and compare it to the <number6>78 bandages</number6> left at the end of the <time1>third day</time1>.

1. On the <time3>first day</time3>, they used <number4>38 bandages</number4> and ordered <number5>one bulk pack</number5> of <object2>bandages</object2> (which is <object3>50 bandages</object3>).

2. On the <time2>second day</time2>, they used <number3>ten fewer bandages</number3> than the <time3>first day</time3>, which is \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.

3. On the <time1>third day</time1>, they ordered <number1>two bulk packs</number1> of <object2>bandages</object2> (which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages) and used <number2>half a pack</number2> (which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages).

Now, let's calculate the total number of <object2>bandages</object2> used over the three days:
- Total used = \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\) bandages.

Next, calculate the total number of <object2>bandages</object2> ordered:
- Total ordered = \(50 + 100 = 150\) bandages.

Finally, calculate the initial number of <object2>bandages</object2> they started with:
- Initial = Total used + Remaining - Total ordered
- Initial = \(91 + 78 - 150 = 19\).

Therefore, the <object1>nurses' station</object1> started with <number>19 bandages</number> on the <time3>first day</time3>.

How many <object>pencils</object> were left?

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, each of the <number4>30 students</number4> had <number1>10 pencils</number1>, so the total number of pencils at the start was 30 students * 10 pencils = <number5>300 pencils</number5>.

After <time1>two months</time1>, <number2>1/5</number2> of the <number5>300 pencils</number5> were used. This means 300 * 1/5 = <number6>60 pencils</number6> were used, leaving 300 - 60 = <number7>240 pencils</number7>.

At the end of the year, only <number3>1/3</number3> of the <number7>240 pencils</number7> were left. Therefore, the number of pencils left is 240 * 1/3 = <number8>80 pencils</number8>.

How much did <person>Marcel</person> earn from selling bicycles during that month?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Marcel</person> sold a total of <number1>300</number1> bikes. Half of them were <object3>Trekking bikes</object3>, which means he sold <number5>150</number5> Trekking bikes. <number2>15%</number2> of the bikes were <object2>BMX bikes</object2>, so he sold <number6>45</number6> BMX bikes (15% of 300). The rest were <object1>MTB bikes</object1>, which means he sold <number7>105</number7> MTB bikes (300 - 150 - 45).

The price of one <object1>MTB</object1> is <number3>$500</number3>, so the total earnings from MTB bikes is <number8>$52,500</number8> (105 * 500). The price of one <object2>BMX</object2> is half the price of an MTB, which is <number9>$250</number9> (500 / 2), so the total earnings from BMX bikes is <number10>$11,250</number10> (45 * 250). The price of one <object3>Trekking bike</object3> is <number4>$450</number4>, so the total earnings from Trekking bikes is <number11>$67,500</number11> (150 * 450).

Adding these amounts gives the total earnings: <number8>$52,500</number8> + <number10>$11,250</number10> + <number11>$67,500</number11> = <number12>$131,250</number12>.

<person>Boris</person> produces <number3>8,000 bars of chocolate the first week</number3>. In the <time1>second week</time1>, he produces <number1>half as much as the first week</number1>, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars. In the <time2>third week</time2>, he produces <number2>three times as much as the first week</number2>, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars. The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. Since he produces <number>50,000 bars of chocolate each month</number>, the production for the <time3>fourth week</time3> is 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

<person>Sean</person> is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for <number1>two scenes</number1> and the lyrics to <number2>one solo song</number2>. His solo song has <number3>54 lines</number3> in the lyrics. The <number4>second scene</number4> has <number5>six more lines</number5> than the song, and <number6>four-fifths</number6> of them are his. The <number7>first scene</number7> has <number8>twice the number of lines</number8> compared to the song, but only <number9>a third</number9> of them are his lines. How many lines does <person>Sean</person> have to memorize?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Sean</person> has to memorize lines from <number1>two scenes</number1> and <number2>one solo song</number2>. The solo song has <number3>54 lines</number3>. 

For the <number4>second scene</number4>, it has <number5>six more lines</number5> than the song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines. <number6>Four-fifths</number6> of these lines are his, so he has to memorize \(60 \times \frac{4}{5} = 48\) lines from the second scene.

For the <number7>first scene</number7>, it has <number8>twice the number of lines</number8> compared to the song, so it has \(54 \times 2 = 108\) lines. <number9>A third</number9> of these lines are his, so he has to memorize \(108 \times \frac{1}{3} = 36\) lines from the first scene.

Adding up all the lines <person>Sean</person> has to memorize: \(54\) (song) + \(48\) (second scene) + \(36\) (first scene) = \(138\) lines.

If she has <number5>110 books</number5>, how many <object1>bookcases</object1> does she need to hold all of them?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how many <object1>bookcases</object1> Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Each <object3>middle shelf</object3> can hold <number4>10 books</number4>, and there are <number3>2 middle shelves</number3>, so they can hold a total of 20 books. The <object2>bottom shelf</object2> can hold <number1>twice as many books</number1> as a <object3>middle shelf</object3>, which is 20 books. The <object4>top shelf</object4> can hold <number2>5 fewer books</number2> than the <object2>bottom shelf</object2>, which is 15 books. Therefore, one bookcase can hold a total of 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books. Elly has <number5>110 books</number5>, so she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases to hold all of them.

How much money would <person>he</person> spend on the <object2>meat</object2> and <object3>cheese</object3> to make enough <object1>sandwiches</object1> to serve <number5>20 people</number5>?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how much <person>Tyson</person> would spend on <object2>meat</object2> and <object3>cheese</object3>, we first need to calculate how many <object1>muffaletta sandwiches</object1> are needed to serve <number5>20 people</number5>. Since each <object1>sandwich</object1> serves <number2>4 people</number2>, <number6>5 sandwiches</number6> are needed (20 people / 4 people per sandwich).

Each <object1>sandwich</object1> requires <number1>1 pound</number1> of <object2>meat</object2> and <number1>1 pound</number1> of <object3>cheese</object3>. Therefore, for <number6>5 sandwiches</number6>, <number7>5 pounds</number7> of <object2>meat</object2> and <number7>5 pounds</number7> of <object3>cheese</object3> are needed.

The cost for <object2>meat</object2> is <number3>$7.00 per pound</number3>, so the total cost for <number7>5 pounds</number7> of <object2>meat</object2> is <number8>$35.00</number8> (5 pounds * $7.00 per pound).

The cost for <object3>cheese</object3> is <number4>$3.00 per pound</number4>, so the total cost for <number7>5 pounds</number7> of <object3>cheese</object3> is <number9>$15.00</number9> (5 pounds * $3.00 per pound).

Adding the costs of <object2>meat</object2> and <object3>cheese</object3> gives a total of <number10>$50.00</number10> ($35.00 + $15.00).

Each flowering plant costs <number5>$6</number5> at the store. How much money will <person>Pat</person> spend at the store to fill up her <object1>flower bed</object1>?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how much money <person>Pat</person> will spend, we first need to calculate how many additional plants she needs to buy. The <object1>flower bed</object1> is <number1>111 feet long</number1>. Each plant takes up <number3>12 inches</number3> (which is 1 foot) and needs <number4>1.5 feet</number4> of space between them. Therefore, each plant requires 2.5 feet of space in total.

The number of plants that can fit in the <object1>flower bed</object1> is calculated by dividing the total length of the <object1>flower bed</object1> by the space each plant requires: 111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4. Since <person>Pat</person> cannot plant a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants.

<person>Pat</person> already owns <number2>17 flowers</number2>, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 additional plants.

Each plant costs <number5>$6</number5>, so the total cost is 27 plants * $6 per plant = $162.

Answer Reasoning:
To calculate the total cost of the <concept>senior gifts</concept>, we need to consider the cost of <object1>pins</object1>, <object2>picture frames</object2>, and <object3>cords</object3>.

1. Calculate the cost of <object1>pins</object1> for <number2>2 seniors</number2>:
   - Cost of pins = <number2>2</number2> seniors * <number3>$5</number3> = $10

2. Calculate the cost of <object2>picture frames</object2> for <number1>44 seniors</number1>:
   - Base cost of picture frames = <number1>44</number1> seniors * <number4>$20</number4> = $880
   - Additional etching cost = <number5>20%</number5> of $880 = 0.20 * $880 = $176
   - Total cost for picture frames = $880 + $176 = $1056

The <location1>north and south walls</location1> are <number3>10 x 8 feet</number3>. The <location2>east and west walls</location2> are <number4>5 x 8 feet</number4>. How much will it cost to paint the <object2>room</object2>?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total area of the <object3>walls</object3> that <person>Tony</person> needs to paint. The <location1>north and south walls</location1> each have an area of <number3>10 x 8 feet</number3>, which is 80 square feet per wall. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is 160 square feet. The <location2>east and west walls</location2> each have an area of <number4>5 x 8 feet</number4>, which is 40 square feet per wall. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is 80 square feet. Therefore, the total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Next, determine how many gallons of <object1>paint</object1> are needed. Since each gallon covers <number1>20 square feet</number1>, the number of gallons required is 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

Finally, calculate the total cost. Each gallon costs <number2>$12</number2>, so the total cost is 12 gallons x $12 = $144.

The school auditorium has <number4>4 rows</number4> of seats. How many <concept3>students</concept3> were there in the school auditorium?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium by multiplying the number of seats per row by the number of rows: <number1>18 seats</number1> per row * <number4>4 rows</number4> = 72 seats.

Next, determine the number of seats occupied by the <concept1>administrators</concept1>: <number2>One-fourth</number2> of 72 seats = 72 / 4 = 18 seats.

Subtract the seats occupied by the <concept1>administrators</concept1> from the total seats to find the remaining seats: 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Calculate the number of seats occupied by the <concept2>parents</concept2>: <number3>One-third</number3> of the remaining 54 seats = 54 / 3 = 18 seats.

Subtract the seats occupied by the <concept2>parents</concept2> from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by the <concept3>students</concept3>: 54 - 18 = 36 seats.

Therefore, the number of <concept3>students</concept3> in the school auditorium is 36.

<person>Kim</person> sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from <time1>2:15 to 2:38 am</time1>. Also, that day she woke up <time2>5 minutes earlier than usual</time2> to go to the bathroom. She usually goes to sleep at <time3>10 p.m.</time3> and wakes up at <time4>6 a.m.</time4>. How many <concept>minutes</concept> did she sleep on her bed that day?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Kim</person> usually sleeps from <time3>10 p.m.</time3> to <time4>6 a.m.</time4>, which is a total of 8 hours or 480 minutes. On this particular day, she woke up <time2>5 minutes earlier than usual</time2>, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. This means she lost 5 minutes of sleep. Additionally, she was sleepwalking from <time1>2:15 to 2:38 am</time1>, which is a period of 23 minutes. During this time, she was not sleeping on her bed. Therefore, the total time she was not sleeping on her bed is 5 minutes (waking up early) + 23 minutes (sleepwalking) = 28 minutes. Subtracting this from the usual 480 minutes of sleep, she slept on her bed for 480 - 28 = 452 minutes.

<person1>Zoey</person1> and <person2>Sydney</person2> are having a <concept>watermelon seed spitting contest</concept>. They each get one watermelon. <person1>Zoey's</person1> has <number1>40 seeds</number1> and she spits each one <number2>10 feet</number2>. Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. <person2>Sydney's</person2> has <number3>35 seeds</number3> she spits each one <number4>12 feet</number4>. What is the <concept>average total distance spat</concept>?

Answer Reasoning:
To find the <concept>average total distance spat</concept>, we first need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds. 

<person1>Zoey</person1> spat <number1>40 seeds</number1> each <number2>10 feet</number2>, so her total distance is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

<person2>Sydney</person2> spat <number3>35 seeds</number3> each <number4>12 feet</number4>, so her total distance is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

The <concept>average total distance spat</concept> is the sum of their total distances divided by 2. 

Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

Answer Reasoning:
To find the <concept>total cost</concept> of <person>Bill's</person> new <object>truck</object>, we start with the <concept>base price</concept> of <number>$30,000</number>. The <concept>king cab upgrade</concept> costs an additional <number>$7,500</number>. The <concept>leather seats</concept> cost <concept>one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade</concept>, which is <number>$2,500</number> (since $7,500 / 3 = $2,500). The <concept>running boards</concept> are <concept>$500 less than the leather seats</concept>, so they cost <number>$2,000</number> (since $2,500 - $500 = $2,000). The <concept>upgraded exterior light package</concept> costs <number>$1,500</number>. 

Adding these costs together gives us the <concept>total cost</concept>:
- Base price: <number>$30,000</number>
- King cab upgrade: <number>$7,500</number>
- Leather seats: <number>$2,500</number>
- Running boards: <number>$2,000</number>
- Upgraded exterior light package: <number>$1,500</number>

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, <person>Maria</person>'s <object>power bank</object> was losing <number1>9%</number1> of its capacity each hour. This continued for <time1>5 hours</time1>.

If each <object2>pizza</object2> costs <number5>$15</number5>, how many <object3>dollars</object3> will <person2>Maddy</person2> spend?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total number of people at the game. There are <number2>12 team members</number2>, and each brings <number1>2 guests</number1>, so the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\). Adding the <number2>12 team members</number2> and <number3>3 coaches</number3>, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, determine how many <object2>pizzas</object2> are needed. Since each <object2>pizza</object2> serves <number4>3 people</number4>, the number of <object2>pizzas</object2> required is \(\lceil \frac{39}{3} \rceil = 13\).

- For the <object4>medium t-shirts</object4>, each is <number3>4 square feet</number3>, and she uses <number5>8 medium shirts</number5>. So, the total fabric from medium shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.
- For the <object1>large t-shirts</object1>, each is <number1>6 square feet</number1>, and she uses <number6>6 large shirts</number6>. So, the total fabric from large shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Adding these amounts together gives the total square feet of the <object3>quilt</object3>: \(33 + 32 + 36 = 101\) square feet.

What's the total amount of money <person1>he</person1> will spend if each <object3>pepper</object3> costs <number6>15$</number6>?

Answer Reasoning:
To find the total amount of money <person1>Dillon</person1> will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit and vegetable he is buying. 

1. Each <object3>pepper</object3> costs <number6>15$</number6>.
2. A <object2>watermelon</object2> costs <number5>three times</number5> what each <object3>pepper</object3> costs, so a <object2>watermelon</object2> costs 3 * <number6>15$</number6> = 45$.
3. An <object1>orange</object1> costs <number1>5 less</number1> than a <object2>watermelon</object2>, so an <object1>orange</object1> costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$.

Now, calculate the total cost:
- <number2>4 watermelons</number2> cost 4 * 45$ = 180$.
- <number3>20 peppers</number3> cost 20 * 15$ = 300$.
- <number4>10 oranges</number4> cost 10 * 40$ = 400$.

The total amount of money <person1>Dillon</person1> will spend is 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$.

What would be the price for such a <object2>crate</object2> of fruit?

Answer Reasoning:
To find the price of the <object2>crate</object2>, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit in the crate. 

1. The cost of one <object4>apple</object4> is <number5>$0.5</number5>. Therefore, the cost for <number2>12 apples</number2> is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

2. One <object5>banana</object5> costs <number6>twice as much</number6> as an apple, so it costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar. Therefore, the cost for <number1>5 bananas</number1> is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

3. One <object3>orange</object3> costs <number4>three times as much as a banana</number4>, so it costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars. Therefore, the cost for <number3>7 oranges</number3> is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total price for the <object2>crate</object2> of fruit: \(6 + 5 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

They gathered all their <object1>seashells</object1> and divided them equally between themselves. Before gathering, <person2>Jim</person2> collected <number1>27 seashells</number1>, which was <number2>5 more</number2> than what <person1>Carlos</person1> collected. <person1>Carlos</person1> collected <number3>twice as many</number3> as <person3>Carrey</person3>. How many did each person get?

Answer Reasoning:
First, we know that <person2>Jim</person2> collected <number1>27 seashells</number1>, which was <number2>5 more</number2> than what <person1>Carlos</person1> collected. Therefore, <person1>Carlos</person1> collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells. Since <person1>Carlos</person1> collected <number3>twice as many</number3> as <person3>Carrey</person3>, <person3>Carrey</person3> collected \(22 / 2 = 11\) seashells. 

Now, we add up all the seashells collected: 
- <person1>Carlos</person1>: 22 seashells
- <person2>Jim</person2>: 27 seashells
- <person3>Carrey</person3>: 11 seashells

The total number of seashells is \(22 + 27 + 11 = 60\). Since they divided them equally, each person got \(60 / 3 = 20\) seashells.

Altogether, how many <object>shirts</object> did <person>Krissa</person> order?

Answer Reasoning:
To find out how many <object>shirts</object> <person>Krissa</person> ordered, we need to determine the number of students needing each size and sum them up.

1. Let the number of size small students be \( S \).
2. According to <number5>, twice as many students need size small as extra small, so \( S = 2 \times 11 = 22 \).
3. According to <number1>, four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so the number of size medium students is \( S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18 \).
4. According to <number3>, half as many students need size large as size medium, so the number of size large students is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
5. According to <number4>, six more students need size extra-large than large, so the number of size extra-large students is \( 9 + 6 = 15 \).

Now, we sum up all the students needing shirts:
- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of <object>shirts</object> ordered = \( 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 \).

With everything combined, how many <object1>candles</object1> and <object2>flashlights</object2> are <person>Brianna's</person> family using when the lights go out?

Answer Reasoning:
To find the total number of <object1>candles</object1> and <object2>flashlights</object2> used by <person>Brianna's</person> family, we need to calculate each separately and then sum them up.

First, calculate the total number of <object1>candles</object1>:
- There are <number1>8 rooms</number1>, so half of them is 4 rooms.
- For these 4 rooms, there are <number3>4 small candles</number3> each, totaling 4 rooms * 4 candles = 16 small candles.
- For the other 4 rooms, there are <number4>5 medium candles</number4> each, totaling 4 rooms * 5 candles = 20 medium candles.
- Total <object1>candles</object1> = 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Next, calculate the total number of <object2>flashlights</object2>:
- There is a <object2>flashlight</object2> for every <number2>person</number2>, so 4 people * 1 flashlight = 4 flashlights.
- There are <number5>two</number5> <object2>flashlights</object2> for each <number1>room</number1>, so 8 rooms * 2 flashlights = 16 flashlights.
- Total <object2>flashlights</object2> = 4 flashlights (for people) + 16 flashlights (for rooms) = 20 flashlights.

Finally, add the total <object1>candles</object1> and <object2>flashlights</object2>:
- Total = 36 candles + 20 flashlights = 56.

When <person1>Tobias</person1> howls, each howl lasts for a total of <number3>20 seconds</number3>. What is the <number4>combined length of time, in minutes</number4>, of the three wolves' howls?

Answer Reasoning:
<person1>Tobias</person1> howls for <number3>20 seconds</number3>. <person2>Chikote</person2> howls for <number1>twice as long</number1> as <person1>Tobias</person1>, which means <person2>Chikote</person2> howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds. <person3>Igneous</person3> howls for <number2>as long as the other two wolves combined</number2>, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds. The <number4>combined length of time</number4> of the three wolves' howls is \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60, resulting in \(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

How many pets does <person>Larry</person> have?

Answer Reasoning:
To find out how many pets <person>Larry</person> has, we need to calculate the number of each type of pet he owns:

1. <number1>Larry has 3 cats</number1>.
2. <number2>He has 3 times as many dogs as cats</number2>, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
3. <number3>He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs</number3>, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. <number5>He has three times the number of fish as rabbits</number5>, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
5. <number4>He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish</number4>, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, we add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47.

If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, calculate the <number5>total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces</number5> on the bus.

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, the bus had <number4>20 people</number4>. At the first stop, <number2>40 people</number2> entered, making the total number of people on the bus 20 + 40 = 60. At the second station, <number3>3/4</number3> of the 40 people entered, which is 30 people. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes 60 + 30 = 90. At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, so the total number of people on the bus becomes 90 * 2 = 180. The bus has a capacity of <number1>200 people</number1>, so the remaining spaces are 200 - 180 = 20. Therefore, the <number5>total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces</number5> on the bus is 20.

Answer Reasoning:
The <object1>tank</object1> has a capacity of <number5>18000 gallons</number5>. On the first day, <person1>Wanda</person1> filled <number1>1/4</number1> of the <object1>tank's capacity</object1>, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons. <person2>Ms. B</person2> pumped <number2>3/4</number2> as much water as <person1>Wanda</person1>, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

On the second day, <person1>Wanda</person1> pumped <number3>2/3</number3> of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons. <person2>Ms. B</person2> pumped <number4>1/3</number4> of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons. Therefore, on the second day, a total of \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons were pumped into the <object1>tank</object1>.

The total amount of water pumped over the two days is \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons. Therefore, the amount of water remaining to fill the <object1>tank</object1> is \( 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \) gallons.

How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?,"Reformatted Question:
<person>Mike</person> decides he wants to replace his <object1>movie collection</object1> with digital versions. He has <number1>600 movies</number1>. <number2>40%</number2> of the remaining movies that are not in series are <concept1>older movies</concept1> which are <number3>$5</number3>. <number4>A third</number4> of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only <number5>$6</number5> of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together. How much does replacing the movies cost if a <concept2>normal movie</concept2> costs <number6>$10</number6>?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Mike</person> has a total of <number1>600 movies</number1>. <number4>A third</number4> of these movies are in series, which means <number7>200 movies</number7> are in series (600 * 1/3 = 200). The cost of replacing these series movies is <number5>$6</number5> per movie, so the total cost for series movies is 200 * 6 = <number8>$1200</number8>.

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = <number9>400 movies</number9>. <number2>40%</number2> of these remaining movies are <concept1>older movies</concept1> costing <number3>$5</number3> each. Therefore, the number of older movies is 400 * 0.4 = <number10>160 movies</number10>. The cost for these older movies is 160 * 5 = <number11>$800</number11>.

The rest of the movies are normal movies, which is 400 - 160 = <number12>240 movies</number12>. The cost for these normal movies is 240 * <number6>$10</number6> = <number13>$2400</number13>.

Adding up all the costs: <number8>$1200</number8> (series movies) + <number11>$800</number11> (older movies) + <number13>$2400</number13> (normal movies) = <number14>$4400</number14>.

How many <object>meatballs</object> were in the sub sandwiches that remained?

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, <person>Sidney</person> ordered <number1>3 less than ten</number1> meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches. Each sandwich contains <number2>4 meatballs</number2>, so the total number of meatballs in the initial order is 7 * 4 = 28 meatballs. <person>Mark</person> ate <number3>4</number3> of these sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = 16 meatballs. After <person>Mark</person> ate the sandwiches, <person>Sidney</person> had 28 - 16 = 12 meatballs left. Then, <person>Sidney</person> ordered another <number4>three</number4> sub sandwiches, adding 3 * 4 = 12 more meatballs.

Answer Reasoning:
The total cost of the <object>laptop</object> is <number4>$600</number4>. With the trade-in, the price is reduced by <number2>$200</number2>, making the effective cost <number6>$400</number6> (<number4>$600</number4> - <number2>$200</number2>). <person>Erika</person> has received <number1>$80</number1> from her mom and <number3>$150</number3> from her part-time job, totaling <number7>$230</number7> (<number1>$80</number1> + <number3>$150</number3>).

The <object>potatoes</object> are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. How long will it take <person>Billy</person> to finish prepping the <object>potatoes</object>?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how long it will take <person>Billy</person> to finish prepping the <object>potatoes</object>, we need to calculate the total time for peeling and cutting all <number>60 potatoes</number>. 

First, we convert <time1>a minute and a half</time1> to seconds: 1.5 minutes is 90 seconds. So, peeling one potato takes 90 seconds. Cutting one potato takes <time2>5 seconds</time2>. Therefore, the total time to peel and cut one potato is 90 + 5 = 95 seconds.

Now, we calculate the total time for <number>60 potatoes</number>: 60 potatoes * 95 seconds per potato = 5700 seconds.

Finally, we convert 5700 seconds into minutes: 5700 seconds ÷ 60 seconds per minute = 95 minutes.

<person>Martha</person> needs to make one of each item: a <object2>hat</object2>, <object3>scarf</object3>, <object4>sweater</object4>, <object5>pair of mittens</object5>, and <object6>pair of socks</object6> for each of her <number1>3 grandchildren</number1>. The total skeins of wool needed for one grandchild are calculated as follows: 

- <object2>Hat</object2>: <number2>2 skeins</number2>
- <object3>Scarf</object3>: <number3>4 skeins</number3>
- <object4>Sweater</object4>: <number4>12 skeins</number4>
- <object5>Pair of mittens</object5>: <number5>1 skein</number5>
- <object6>Pair of socks</object6>: <number6>2 skeins</number6>

Total for one grandchild = <number2>2</number2> + <number3>4</number3> + <number4>12</number4> + <number5>1</number5> + <number6>2</number6> = 21 skeins.

Since there are <number1>3 grandchildren</number1>, the total skeins needed are 21 skeins per grandchild multiplied by 3 grandchildren, which equals 63 skeins.

<person>Debra</person> is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees <number1>30 bees</number1> leave the hive in the first <time1>6 hours</time1>, and then she sees <number2>1/2 that many bees</number2> return in the next <time2>6 hours</time2>. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the <time3>last 6 hours</time3>.

How many bees did <person>Debra</person> see return to the hive in the <time3>last 6 hours</time3> of the day?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Debra</person> initially sees <number1>30 bees</number1> leave the hive in the first <time1>6 hours</time1>. In the next <time2>6 hours</time2>, <number2>1/2 that many bees</number2> return, which is 15 bees. This means that 15 bees have not yet returned. In the <time3>last 6 hours</time3>, every bee that left before and hadn't already returned comes back. Therefore, the remaining 15 bees return in the <time3>last 6 hours</time3>. Additionally, <number3>two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive</number3> (which is 60 bees) leave in the <time3>third 6 hours</time3>, but this does not affect the number of bees returning in the <time3>last 6 hours</time3>. Thus, the number of bees that <person>Debra</person> sees return to the hive in the <time3>last 6 hours</time3> is 15.

<person>John</person> decides to do several activities while out on vacation. He spent <number1>40%</number1> of his time <concept>sightseeing</concept>. He spent <number2>30%</number2> of the time with the following events. He spends <time1>6 hours</time1> boating and half that time swimming. He also watched <number3>3</number3> different shows which were <time2>2 hours</time2> each. How much time did he spend <concept>sightseeing</concept>?

Answer Reasoning:
To find out how much time <person>John</person> spent <concept>sightseeing</concept>, we need to determine the total time he spent on vacation. We know he spent <number2>30%</number2> of his time on specific activities: <time1>6 hours</time1> boating, half of that time swimming (which is 3 hours), and watching <number3>3</number3> shows that were <time2>2 hours</time2> each (totaling 6 hours). Therefore, the total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours. Since this represents <number2>30%</number2> of his total vacation time, we can calculate the total time by dividing 15 hours by 0.3, which gives us 50 hours. <person>John</person> spent <number1>40%</number1> of this total time <concept>sightseeing</concept>, so 0.4 * 50 = 20 hours.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?,"Reformatted Question:
<person>Tim</person> enters a competition and has to try and guess the <concept>number of red jelly beans</concept> in a jar. He knows that a <object1>jelly bean</object1> is <number1>0.15 cubic inches</number1>. He also knows that they get about <number2>80% efficiency</number2> in packing. He estimates <number3>30%</number3> of the jelly beans are red. The <object2>jar</object2> has a <concept1>square base</concept1> and is <number4>6 inches by 6 inches</number4> and <number5>15 inches tall</number5>. The <concept>true number of red jelly beans</concept> in the container is <number6>900</number6>. How far off was his guess?

Answer Reasoning:
To find out how far off <person>Tim</person>'s guess was, we need to calculate his estimated number of red jelly beans. First, we calculate the volume of the <object2>jar</object2> using its dimensions: <number4>6 inches by 6 inches</number4> and <number5>15 inches tall</number5>. The volume is \(6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540\) cubic inches. 

Considering the <number2>80% efficiency</number2> in packing, the effective volume for the jelly beans is \(540 \times 0.8 = 432\) cubic inches. Given that each <object1>jelly bean</object1> is <number1>0.15 cubic inches</number1>, the total number of jelly beans is \(432 / 0.15 = 2880\).

<person>Tim</person> estimates that <number3>30%</number3> of the jelly beans are red, so his estimated number of red jelly beans is \(2880 \times 0.3 = 864\).

The <concept>true number of red jelly beans</concept> is <number6>900</number6>. Therefore, the difference between his estimate and the true number is \(900 - 864 = 36\).

If he has <number4>two bags</number4> of glass chips, how many <number5>inches long</number5> can he make his <object1>mosaic</object1>?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Milo</person> has <number4>two bags</number4> of glass chips, and each bag holds <number1>72 chips</number1>. Therefore, he has a total of \(2 \times 72 = 144\) glass chips. <person>Milo</person> wants his <object1>mosaic</object1> to be <number2>three inches tall</number2>. It takes <number3>twelve glass chips</number3> to make every square inch of the <object1>mosaic</object1>. 

To find out how many square inches he can cover, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch: 
\[
\frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
\]

Since the <object1>mosaic</object1> is <number2>three inches tall</number2>, we can find the length by dividing the total square inches by the height:
\[
\frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches tall}} = 4 \text{ inches long}

<person>Michael</person> is replacing the carpet in his <location>bedroom</location>. His <location>bedroom</location> measures <number1>18 feet</number1> by <number2>12 feet</number2>. His contractor charges <number3>$4 per square foot</number3> to remove the old carpet, and <number4>$34 per square foot</number4> to install the new carpet. The new carpet he's chosen costs <number5>$12 per square foot</number5>, plus <number6>$2 per square foot</number6> for padding underneath. How much will it cost <person>Michael</person> to replace the carpet?

Answer Reasoning:
First, we calculate the area of <person>Michael</person>'s <location>bedroom</location> by multiplying the dimensions: <number1>18 feet</number1> by <number2>12 feet</number2>, which equals 216 square feet.

Next, we calculate the cost to remove the old carpet: 216 square feet times <number3>$4 per square foot</number3> equals $864.

Then, we calculate the cost to install the new carpet: 216 square feet times <number4>$34 per square foot</number4> equals $7,344.

The cost of the new carpet itself is 216 square feet times <number5>$12 per square foot</number5>, which equals $2,592.

The cost for the padding is 216 square feet times <number6>$2 per square foot</number6>, which equals $432.

Finally, we add all these costs together: $864 (removal) + $7,344 (installation) + $2,592 (carpet) + $432 (padding) = $11,232.

Answer Reasoning:
To determine the <concept>profit</concept> <person>Tim</person> makes from selling <number8>10 jars</number8>, we first need to calculate the cost of making one <object4>jar</object4>.

- The cost of <number5>2 pounds</number5> of <object1>passion fruit</object1> is <number1>$6 per pound</number1> x <number5>2 pounds</number5> = $12.
- The cost of <number6>1.5 pounds</number6> of <object2>jackfruit</object2> is <number2>$8 per pound</number2> x <number6>1.5 pounds</number6> = $12.
- The cost of <number7>2 pounds</number7> of <object3>honey</object3> is <number3>$10 per pound</number3> x <number7>2 pounds</number7> = $20.

The total cost to make one <object4>jar</object4> is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

<person>Tim</person> sells each <object4>jar</object4> for <number4>$50</number4>, so the profit per <object4>jar</object4> is $50 - $44 = $6.

One of them is significantly better than him and can play for <number4>1.5 times as long</number4>. How much <concept>money</concept> is used?

Answer Reasoning:
<person1>Jack</person1> can play for <time1>20 minutes</time1> with <number2>1 quarter</number2>. Therefore, in <time2>4 hours</time2> (which is 240 minutes), <person1>Jack</person1> will use \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.

Two of his friends can only play <number3>half as long</number3> as <person1>Jack</person1>, so they can play for \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per quarter. In <time2>4 hours</time2> (240 minutes), each of these two friends will use \( \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) quarters.

The friend who is significantly better can play for <number4>1.5 times as long</number4> as <person1>Jack</person1>, so they can play for \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes per quarter. In <time2>4 hours</time2> (240 minutes), this friend will use \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters.

Adding up all the quarters used: 
- <person1>Jack</person1> uses 12 quarters.
- Each of the two friends who are worse uses 24 quarters, totaling \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) quarters.
- The friend who is better uses 8 quarters.

The total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 \).

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total <concept>money</concept> used is \( 68 \times 0.25 = 17 \) dollars.

<person1>Wayne</person1> and <person2>Bernadette</person2> are movie stars heading to the premiere of their latest film. <person1>Wayne</person1> is staying at a hotel close to the premiere theater, and <person2>Bernadette</person2> is staying at her high-rise apartment in the same city. <person2>Bernadette</person2> wants to arrive <time1>5 minutes</time1> before <person1>Wayne</person1>. The drive from <person2>Bernadette</person2>'s apartment takes <number1>four times</number1> as long as the drive from <person1>Wayne</person1>'s hotel. If it takes <person1>Wayne</person1> <time2>four minutes</time2> to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should <person2>Bernadette</person2> leave than <person1>Wayne</person1> to get to the theater first?

Answer Reasoning:
<person1>Wayne</person1> takes <time2>four minutes</time2> to reach the theater. Since the drive from <person2>Bernadette</person2>'s apartment takes <number1>four times</number1> as long, it will take her \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes to reach the theater. <person2>Bernadette</person2> wants to arrive <time1>5 minutes</time1> before <person1>Wayne</person1>. Therefore, she needs to leave \(16 + 5 = 21\) minutes before <person1>Wayne</person1> to arrive at the theater first.

<person>Aleksandra</person> went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some <object1>soup</object1>, a <object2>bagel</object2>, and a <object3>piece of cake</object3>. The <object3>cake</object3> is only half of the price of the <object2>bagel</object2>. The <object2>bagel</object2> cost <number1>$4</number1>, and the <object1>soup</object1> <number2>25% more</number2>. How much did <person>Aleksandra</person> need to pay for the dinner she ordered?

Answer Reasoning:
The <object2>bagel</object2> costs <number1>$4</number1>. The <object3>piece of cake</object3> is half the price of the <object2>bagel</object2>, so it costs $2. The <object1>soup</object1> costs <number2>25% more</number2> than the <object2>bagel</object2>. Therefore, the cost of the <object1>soup</object1> is $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5.

They will install additional items for an extra <number9>$15.00</number9> per item. How much will this cost her?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Angela</person> needs to install <number1>6 mirrors</number1>, <number2>2 chandeliers</number2>, and <number3>20 pictures</number3>. The <concept>interior design firm</concept> offers a package for <number4>$129.00</number4> that includes <number5>4 mirrors</number5>, <number7>1 chandelier</number7>, and <number8>10 pictures</number8>. 

First, calculate the number of additional items <person>Angela</person> needs installed:
- Mirrors: <number1>6 mirrors</number1> - <number5>4 mirrors</number5> = 2 additional mirrors
- Chandeliers: <number2>2 chandeliers</number2> - <number7>1 chandelier</number7> = 1 additional chandelier
- Pictures: <number3>20 pictures</number3> - <number8>10 pictures</number8> = 10 additional pictures

Total additional items = 2 mirrors + 1 chandelier + 10 pictures = 13 additional items

The cost for additional items is <number9>$15.00</number9> per item. Therefore, the cost for 13 additional items is 13 * <number9>$15.00</number9> = $195.00.

The total cost is the package cost plus the cost for additional items: <number4>$129.00</number4> + $195.00 = $324.00.

How many pieces of popcorn does <person>Garrett</person> have to eat?

Answer Reasoning:
In the first <time2>30 seconds</time2>, <number3>twenty</number3> kernels pop. In the next <time2>30 seconds</time2>, <number4>three times that amount</number4> pop, which is <number4>60</number4> kernels. In the final <time2>30 seconds</time2>, the popping rate is <number2>half the rate</number2> of the previous <time2>30 seconds</time2>, so <number6>30</number6> kernels pop. After <person>Garrett</person> takes the pan off the heat, <number5>a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds</number5> pop, which is <number7>7.5</number7> kernels, but since we can't have half a kernel, we round to <number8>8</number8> kernels. Adding these together, <number3>20</number3> + <number4>60</number4> + <number6>30</number6> + <number8>8</number8> gives a total of <number9>118</number9> pieces of popcorn.

33,"A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?","Reformatted Question:

If his <object5>farm truck</object5> can carry <number5>2250 pounds</number5> at a time, how many trips does the <person>farmer</person> need to transport all the feed?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how many trips the <person>farmer</person> needs to make, we first calculate the total weight of all the feed. The <number1>two 1-pound boxes</number1> of <object4>sugar cubes</object4> weigh 2 pounds. The <number2>twenty 65-pound sacks</number2> of <object2>oats</object2> weigh 1300 pounds (20 x 65). The <number3>forty-two 75-pound bales</number3> of <object1>hay</object1> weigh 3150 pounds (42 x 75). The <number4>four 12-pound bags</number4> of <object3>carrots</object3> weigh 48 pounds (4 x 12). Adding these together, the total weight is 4500 pounds (2 + 1300 + 3150 + 48).

The <object5>farm truck</object5> can carry <number5>2250 pounds</number5> at a time. To find the number of trips, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 4500 / 2250 = 2. Therefore, the <person>farmer</person> needs to make 2 trips.

How much is the <object>boat</object> worth after the <time>three years</time>?

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, the <object>boat</object> was purchased for <number>$9000</number>. In the <time>first year</time>, it depreciated by <number>30%</number>, so the value of the <object>boat</object> after the <time>first year</time> is calculated as follows: 

Value after first year = <number>$9000</number> - (<number>30%</number> of <number>$9000</number>) = <number>$9000</number> - <number>$2700</number> = <number>$6300</number>.

In the <time>second year</time>, it depreciated another <number>30%</number>, so the value of the <object>boat</object> after the <time>second year</time> is:

Value after second year = <number>$6300</number> - (<number>30%</number> of <number>$6300</number>) = <number>$6300</number> - <number>$1890</number> = <number>$4410</number>.

In the <time>third year</time>, it depreciated <number>20%</number>, so the value of the <object>boat</object> after the <time>third year</time> is:

Value after third year = <number>$4410</number> - (<number>20%</number> of <number>$4410</number>) = <number>$4410</number> - <number>$882</number> = <number>$3528</number>.

The shockingly loud sound startled <person>Sally</person>, and she accidentally released <number7>half</number7> of the yellow balloons. What <number>number of balloons</number> did she finally carry into the school?

Answer Reasoning:
Initially, <person>Sally</person> had <number3>25 red balloons</number3>, <number4>7 green balloons</number4>, and <number5>12 yellow balloons</number5>. 

- <number6>40%</number6> of the <number3>25 red balloons</number3> burst, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 red balloons. Therefore, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.
- She accidentally released <number7>half</number7> of the <number5>12 yellow balloons</number5>, which is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons. Therefore, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Next, <person>Sally</person> found <number1>8 blue balloons</number1> and added <number2>75%</number2> of them to her clutch. This is 0.75 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, the total number of balloons she carried into the school is the sum of the remaining balloons:

- 7 green balloons
- 6 yellow balloons
- 6 blue balloons

Total = 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.

What is the weight of <person1>Harry</person1>, in kg?

Answer Reasoning:
First, we need to determine the weight of <person3>Carl</person3>. We know that <person3>Carl's</person3> weight is <number2>16 kg</number2> more than <person4>Martin's</person4> weight, which is <number4>55 kg</number4>. Therefore, <person3>Carl's</person3> weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.

Next, we calculate <person2>Christian's</person2> weight. <person2>Christian's</person2> weight is <number3>8 kg</number3> more than <person3>Carl's</person3> weight, which is 71 kg. Therefore, <person2>Christian's</person2> weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.

Finally, we find the weight of <person1>Harry</person1>. <person1>Harry</person1> is <number1>5 kg</number1> less than <person2>Christian's</person2> weight, which is 79 kg. Therefore, <person1>Harry's</person1> weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

How much does he still owe, if the <object2>base burrito</object2> is <number8>$6.50</number8>?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total cost of the burrito and additions. The <object2>base burrito</object2> costs <number8>$6.50</number8>. Adding <object3>extra meat</object3> costs <number2>$2.00</number2>, <object4>extra cheese</object4> costs <number3>$1.00</number3>, <object5>avocado</object5> costs <number4>$1.00</number4>, and <number5>2</number5> <object6>sauces</object6> cost <number6>$0.25</number6> each, totaling $0.50. The upgrade for <object7>chips</object7> and a <object8>drink</object8> costs <number7>$3.00</number7>.

Total cost = <number8>$6.50</number8> + <number2>$2.00</number2> + <number3>$1.00</number3> + <number4>$1.00</number4> + $0.50 + <number7>$3.00</number7> = $14.00.

She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?","Reformatted Question:
<person>Tanya</person> makes a <object>salt scrub</object> from <object1>salt</object1>, <object2>oil</object2>, <object3>fragrance</object3>, <object4>citrus zest</object4>, and <object5>sugar</object5>. She uses the <concept1>same amount of citrus zest as fragrance</concept1> and the <concept2>same amount of salt as sugar</concept2>. She makes enough to fill a <number1>10-ounce jar</number1> each time. She uses <concept3>twice as much oil as salt</concept3> and <concept4>twice as much salt as zest</concept4>. How many <object2>ounces of oil</object2> does she use?

Answer Reasoning:
To solve this, we need to determine the amount of each ingredient Tanya uses. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as \( x \). According to <concept2>, the amount of salt and sugar is the same, so let this be \( y \). According to <concept4>, the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, so \( y = 2x \). According to <concept3>, the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so the oil is \( 2y \).

The total amount of the scrub is <number1>10 ounces</number1>, so we have the equation:
\[ x + x + y + y + 2y = 10 \]
\[ 2x + 4y = 10 \]

Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the equation:
\[ 2x + 4(2x) = 10 \]
\[ 2x + 8x = 10 \]
\[ 10x = 10 \]
\[ x = 1 \]

Since \( y = 2x \), \( y = 2 \times 1 = 2 \).

The amount of oil, which is \( 2y \), is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, Tanya uses <number2>4 ounces</number2> of oil.

The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?,"Reformatted Question:
It takes <person>Julia</person> <time1>sixteen seconds</time1> to row <number1>twenty feet</number1>. <person>Julia's boat</person> sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The boat was taking on <number2>two liters of water</number2> for every <number3>ten feet</number3> she rowed back towards <location>shore</location>. The <location>shore</location> was <time2>64 seconds</time2> away. How much <object>water</object> had the boat taken on by the time <person>Julia</person> reached <location>shore</location>?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine how much <object>water</object> the boat had taken on, we need to calculate the distance <person>Julia</person> rowed in <time2>64 seconds</time2>. Since it takes <time1>sixteen seconds</time1> to row <number1>twenty feet</number1>, in <time2>64 seconds</time2>, she would row:

\[
\frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
\]

The boat takes on <number2>two liters of water</number2> for every <number3>ten feet</number3> rowed. Therefore, for <number4>80 feet</number4>:

\[
\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the boat had taken on <object>water</object> amounting to <number5>16 liters</number5> by the time <person>Julia</person> reached <location>shore</location>.

How many <concept>white fish</concept> did <person>Bob</person> buy at the store?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Bob</person> initially had <number2>7 fish</number2> in his pond, with <number3>3 being orange</number3> and <number4>4 being white</number4>. After buying <number1>17 fish</number1> from the <location>pet store</location>, he found that he had <concept>twice as many orange fish as white fish</concept>. Let \( x \) be the number of white fish he bought. Then, the number of orange fish he bought is \( 17 - x \).

After adding the new fish, the total number of white fish is \( 4 + x \) and the total number of orange fish is \( 3 + (17 - x) = 20 - x \).

According to the condition, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 20 - x = 2(4 + x) \]

Solving this equation:
\[ 20 - x = 8 + 2x \]
\[ 20 - 8 = 2x + x \]
\[ 12 = 3x \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, <person>Bob</person> bought <number>4 white fish</number>.

They have <number3>3 times the number of blue cars</number3> as they have green cars. If the rink has <number4>75 cars in total</number4>, how many <object1>yellow cars</object1> do they have?

Answer Reasoning:
The rink has <number1>12 red cars</number1>. They have <number2>2 fewer green cars</number2> than they have red cars, which means they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. They have <number3>3 times the number of blue cars</number3> as they have green cars, so they have 3 * 10 = 30 blue cars. Let the number of <object1>yellow cars</object1> be Y. The total number of cars is <number4>75 cars</number4>. Therefore, the equation is:

12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) + Y (yellow) = 75

Solving for Y:

52 + Y = 75
Y = 75 - 52
Y = 23

What is the <concept>difference between the final prices paid</concept> for the pomegranates on the two days?

Answer Reasoning:
First, calculate the total cost for <person1>Clara</person1> on <time1>Tuesday</time1>. She bought <number2>20 pomegranates</number2> at <number3>$20 each</number3>, so the total cost before the voucher was 20 * 20 = $400. With the <number1>$2 off</number1> voucher, the final price Clara paid was $400 - $2 = $398.

Next, calculate the total cost for <person2>Sheila</person2> on the <time2>next day</time2>. The price per pomegranate was <number4>$30 per fruit</number4>, so the total cost before the discount was 20 * 30 = $600.

What is the <concept>percentage discount</concept> obtained by <person>Mr. Roger's friend</person> from the original price?

Answer Reasoning:
First, we need to determine the price at which <person>Mr. Rogers</person> bought the <object>watch</object>. The original price of the <object>watch</object> was <number2>$2000</number2>, and <person>Mr. Rogers</person> bought it at <number3>75%</number3> of its original price. Therefore, the purchase price for <person>Mr. Rogers</person> was \(2000 \times 0.75 = 1500\).

Next, <person>Mr. Rogers</person> sold the <object>watch</object> to his friend at <number1>120%</number1> of the price he bought it. So, the selling price was \(1500 \times 1.2 = 1800\).

<person>Rory</person> is retrieving <object>tennis balls</object> from the court after a tennis match. In the <time>third set</time>, he retrieved <concept>half as many balls as in the second</concept>. He retrieved <number>19 tennis balls in all</number>. In the <time>first of three sets</time>, he had to retrieve <number>four more balls than in the second set</number>. How many <object>tennis balls</object> did he retrieve in the <time>first set</time> of the match?

Answer Reasoning:
Let the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set be \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the <time>third set</time>, <person>Rory</person> retrieved <concept>half as many balls as in the second</concept>, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
- In the <time>first set</time>, he retrieved <number>four more balls than in the second set</number>, which is \( x + 4 \).
- The total number of balls retrieved is <number>19</number>.

The equation based on these facts is:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Solving the equation:
1. Combine like terms:
   \[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
2. Multiply the entire equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
3. Combine like terms:
   \[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]
4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[ 5x = 30 \]
5. Divide by 5:
   \[ x = 6 \]

Thus, the number of tennis balls retrieved in the <time>first set</time> is \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \).

How many <concept>petals</concept> in total are on the flowers in the vase?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Rose</person> initially picks <number1>3 flowers</number1> with <number2>5 petals each</number2>, totaling 15 petals. She then picks <number3>4 flowers</number3> with <number4>6 petals each</number4>, totaling 24 petals. She adds <number5>5 flowers</number5> with <number6>4 petals each</number6>, totaling 20 petals. She drops <number7>1 of each</number7> type of flower, which means she loses 1 flower from each group: 1 flower with 5 petals, 1 flower with 6 petals, and 1 flower with 4 petals, losing a total of 15 petals (5 + 6 + 4).

111,"Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?","Reformatted Question:
<person>Marcus</person> is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. If the <concept1>normal teacher</concept1> comes in, there's a <number1>40%</number1> chance she'll give everyone an extension. There's a <number2>50%</number2> chance that tomorrow he'll have a <concept2>substitute teacher</concept2> who won't collect the homework. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a <number3>20%</number3> chance <person>Marcus</person> can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the <concept3>percentage chance</concept3> that <person>Marcus</person> will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?

Answer Reasoning:
To determine the <concept3>percentage chance</concept3> that <person>Marcus</person> will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the scenarios where he does not get an extension. 

1. If the <concept1>normal teacher</concept1> comes in, there's a <number1>40%</number1> chance of an extension, meaning a <number4>60%</number4> chance that there is no extension. 
2. If the <concept2>substitute teacher</concept2> comes in, there's a <number2>50%</number2> chance that the homework won't be collected, meaning a <number5>50%</number5> chance that it will be collected.
3. If the <concept1>normal teacher</concept1> comes in and does not give an extension, <person>Marcus</person> has a <number3>20%</number3> chance to get a personal extension, meaning an <number6>80%</number6> chance he won't get a personal extension.

Now, calculate the probability that <person>Marcus</person> will have to turn in his homework:

- Probability that the <concept1>normal teacher</concept1> comes in and Marcus has to turn in his homework:
  - Probability of normal teacher = 50% (since it's not specified, assume equal chance for normal or substitute)
  - Probability of no class extension = <number4>60%</number4>
  - Probability of no personal extension = <number6>80%</number6>
  - Combined probability = 0.5 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.24 or 24%

- Probability that the <concept2>substitute teacher</concept2> comes in and Marcus has to turn in his homework:
  - Probability of substitute teacher = 50%
  - Probability of homework being collected = <number5>50%</number5>
  - Combined probability = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%

Add these probabilities together to find the total probability that <person>Marcus</person> will have to turn in his homework:
24% + 25% = 49%

How much money would <person>Cameron</person> save?

Answer Reasoning:
<person>Cameron</person> arrives at <time1>5 pm</time1> and wants to leave at <time2>10 am the next morning</time2>. This means he will stay for a total of 17 hours. The <object>hotel</object> charges <number1>1000 pesos</number1> for a <time3>12-hour stay</time3>. For the additional 5 hours (from 5 am to 10 am), <person>Cameron</person> will pay <number3>70 pesos</number3> per hour, totaling 5 * 70 = 350 pesos. Therefore, the total cost for <person>Cameron</person> is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos. If he had chosen the <time4>24-hour stay</time4> option, he would have paid <number2>1600 pesos</number2>. Thus, by choosing the hourly addition option, <person>Cameron</person> saves 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.
