0,"In the planning of a new district in a township, it was decided to build a special community in the southeast, northwest, centered on the citizen park. These four communities are designated as cultural area, leisure area, commercial area and administrative service area. It is known that the administrative service area is southwest of the cultural area, and the cultural area is southeast of the leisure area. Based on the above statement, which of the following can be derived?
(A) Civic Park is north of the administrative service area. (B) The leisure area is southwest of the cultural area. (C) The cultural district is in the northeast of the business district. (D) The business district is southeast of the leisure area.","To solve this problem, let's go through the positional relationships specified in the statements one by one and determine the logical layout of the areas.

1. The administrative service area is southwest of the cultural area. 
   - This places the cultural area to the northeast of the administrative service area.

2. The cultural area is southeast of the leisure area.
   - This places the leisure area to the northwest of the cultural area.

Based on these statements, we can visualize the layout of the areas as follows:
- Place the leisure area at a point. The cultural area will then be southeast of it.
- The administrative service area will be southwest of the cultural area, implying it is in a more southwestern position relative to the leisure area.

3. We need to verify the correctness of each option given the above positional layout:

   (A) Civic Park is north of the administrative service area.
   - There is no information provided about the relative position of the Civic Park compared to any of these areas.

   (B) The leisure area is southwest of the cultural area.
   - This is false because, as per the problem, the leisure area is northwest of the cultural area, not southwest.

   (C) The cultural district is in the northeast of the business district.
   - There is no direct information about the position of the business district relative to the other districts given. Hence, this cannot be determined to be true.

   (D) The business district is southeast of the leisure area.
   - There is no information provided about the position of the business district. Its position relative to the leisure area isn't mentioned or implied.

Given the analysis and based on the information provided, none of the options explicitly follows or can be derived from the given premises. However, it seems there might be an oversight, as none of the options can be conclusively validated or invalidated strictly using logical deductions from the information provided. 

In a careful consideration process, if additional context were available regarding the central position (Civic Park) and its orientation, option (A) might seem most plausible if assuming logical deduced orientations within a common north-south-east-west layout. Without definitive information, however, we cannot assert any option definitively. 

The correct choice, based on deduction interpretation, might be omitted unless assuming extrapolated usual common sense from given data.

1,"The company sent three young staff members to the South for business trip. The three of them happened to be sitting in a row. At least one of the two people sitting on the right side of 24 years old was 20 years old.20 years old. At least one of the two people sitting on the left of the accountant is a salesperson, and one of the two people sitting on the right of the salesperson is also a salesperson. So what are the three young people on business?
(A) 0-year-old accountant, 20-year-old salesperson, 24-year-old salesperson. (B) 0-year-old accountant, 24-year-old salesperson, 24-year-old salesperson. (C) 4-year-old accountant, 20-year-old salesperson, 20-year-old salesperson. (D) 0-year-old accountant, 20-year-old accountant, 24-year-old salesperson.","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and use logical reasoning to deduce the correct order of the three young people on a business trip.

1. We are given that at least one of the two people sitting on the right side of the 24-year-old is 20 years old.
2. At least one of the two people sitting on the left of the accountant is a salesperson.
3. One of the two people sitting on the right of the salesperson is also a salesperson.

Let's examine each option systematically:

Option (A): 20-year-old accountant, 20-year-old salesperson, 24-year-old salesperson.

- For the first statement, it seems someone must be 20 years old on the right of the 24-year-old, which could be the case as the last person is a salesperson and 24 years old.

- For the second statement, the accountant is sitting to the left; one of the people to the left of the accountant is a salesperson, which works as the accountant (who is the first person) has two people to the right who could be salespersons.

- For the third statement, one of the two people on the right of the salesperson should also be a salesperson. This works because both the accountant in the middle and the 24-year-old salesperson on the right of the first salesperson are salespersons.

Option (B): 20-year-old accountant, 24-year-old salesperson, 24-year-old salesperson.

- The 24-year-old is in the middle, but at least one person to their right has to be 20 years old, which isn’t true here since both people are 24-year-olds.

Option (C): 24-year-old accountant, 20-year-old salesperson, 20-year-old salesperson.

- The statements aren't adhered to because the person on the right of the 24-year-old isn't a 20-year-old only one person (the 20-year-old is on the left).

Option (D): 20-year-old accountant, 20-year-old accountant, 24-year-old salesperson.

- At least one person to the right of the 24-year-old must be 20, which doesn’t apply as it stands at the end.

After examining each option, only Option (A) satisfies all the conditions provided in the question.

2,"In a traditional Chinese medicine preparation, there must be at least one kind of ginseng or codonopsis, and the following conditions must also be met? 1) If there is codonopsis, there must be atractylodes.2) Atractylodes macrocephala and ginseng can only have at most one. You must have Shouwu.4) If you have Shouwu, you must have Atractylodes. According to the above statement, which of the following can be drawn about this Chinese medicine preparation?
(A) o dangshen. (B) o Shouwu. (C)  白 术. (D)  白 术.","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions provided for the traditional Chinese medicine preparation and determine which substances must be present:

1. **Condition 1**: There must be at least one kind of ginseng or codonopsis (also known as dangshen).
   
2. **Condition 2**: If there is codonopsis, there must be atractylodes (白术).

3. **Condition 3**: Atractylodes macrocephala (白术) and ginseng can only have at most one, meaning they cannot both be present in the preparation.

4. **Condition 4**: Shouwu must be included in the preparation.

5. **Condition 5**: If you have Shouwu, you must have Atractylodes (白术).

Let's analyze the conditions:

- Condition 4 mandates the presence of Shouwu in the preparation. 

- According to Condition 5, the presence of Shouwu necessitates the presence of Atractylodes (白术).

- Since Atractylodes (白术) must be present (due to the necessity of including Shouwu), Condition 3 implies that ginseng cannot be present because both atractylodes and ginseng cannot coexist in the preparation.

- Given that ginseng cannot be present, Condition 1 requires us to include codonopsis, as we must have at least one of ginseng or codonopsis.

- Once codonopsis is included, Condition 2 also requires atractylodes (白术) to be included, which is already required by Shouwu being a part of the preparation.

From the above reasoning, the only factual information we can ascertain is that Shouwu is a definite part of the preparation (as well as Atractylodes, but the option isn't distinct from the duplicates given), while codonopsis is only required if ginseng is absent.

Therefore, with certainty, the preparation must contain Shouwu.

3,"In recent years, graduate entrance examinations have continued to heat up. Correspondingly, a variety of postgraduate counseling classes have emerged, especially English and political counseling classes are almost a must for the postgraduates. Xiaozhuang, who has just started working, also intends to take the postgraduate entrance exam, so Xiaozhuang must take English tutoring classes. Which of the following can best strengthen the above argument.
(A) If you take an English tutoring class, you can pass the graduate entrance exam. (B) Only those who intend to take the graduate entrance exam will participate in the English tutoring class. (C) Even if you take an English tutoring class, you may not be able to pass the graduate entrance exam. (D) If you do not participate in the English tutoring class, you cannot pass the graduate entrance exam.","To determine which option best strengthens the argument that Xiaozhuang, who intends to take the postgraduate entrance exam, must take English tutoring classes, we need to identify the option that most clearly links taking an English tutoring class to passing the exam or the strong necessity for it.

Let's analyze the options:

(A) If you take an English tutoring class, you can pass the graduate entrance exam.
- This implies that taking a tutoring class might help pass the exam, but it does not suggest necessity. It introduces the possibility but not a requisite condition. It doesn't strengthen the argument significantly.

(B) Only those who intend to take the graduate entrance exam will participate in the English tutoring class.
- This option discusses who participates in the class rather than strengthening the necessity of taking the class for success in the exam. It doesn't strengthen the argument about Xiaozhuang needing the class.

(C) Even if you take an English tutoring class, you may not be able to pass the graduate entrance exam.
- This option suggests that the class does not guarantee passing the exam, which actually weakens the argument by indicating that the class might not be necessary.

(D) If you do not participate in the English tutoring class, you cannot pass the graduate entrance exam.
- This option strongly suggests that the English tutoring class is essential for passing the exam. It implies that not taking the class results in an inability to pass, thereby making the class a necessity.

Based on the analysis, option (D) most effectively strengthens the argument by establishing the necessity of the English tutoring class for passing the graduate entrance exam.

4,"A unit conducted the year-end assessment and after democratic voting, five people were identified as candidates for the first prize. In the selection of five in four, the following factors need to be considered? 1) At least one person of Bingding is selected.2) If E is selected, then A and B are also selected.3) A maximum of 2 people are selected. According to the above statement, it can be concluded that who is not in the fourth?
(A) A. (B) B. (C) C. (D) Ding.","To analyze this selection problem systematically, let's go through the given conditions:

1. At least one among Bing and Ding is selected.
2. If E is selected, then A and B must also be selected.
3. At most 2 people can be selected.

Let's consider the implications of each statement:

- According to condition 3, only up to 2 people can be selected.

Analyzing condition 2 given your limit of a maximum of 2 people being selected:
- If E is selected, then A and B must also be selected. However, selecting E, A, and B would result in 3 people being selected, violating condition 3. Therefore, E cannot be selected.

With E not being selected, statement 2 no longer needs to be taken into consideration for who is in the group. Let's continue with statements 1 and 3:

- We need to select at least one person among Bing and Ding. We also know that only two people can be selected.

- Since E is not part of the selection, we have options among A, B, C, Bing, and Ding.

Since we've established that E cannot be part of the group, and we have only 2 slots:
- If we select both Bing and Ding (as allowed by statement 1), that will fill the 2 slots.
- If we select Bing, we have one more slot open for either A, B, or C, but we can't select E due to conditions.

Thus, only C cannot be part of the group because Bing and Ding both satisfy condition 1, and if neither of Bing or Ding were selected, then C cannot fill both slots and still satisfy condition 1.

Therefore the person who is not selected:

5,"Zhang Ming, Li Ying, Wang Jia and Chen Rui work in a team. They come from four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian and Shandong. Each person can only speak a dialect of their origin. Speaking of southern Fujian dialects, Shandong people have the highest educational level and can speak Central Plains Mandarin. Wang Jia has a lower education level than Fujianese. Li Ying can speak Huizhou dialect and is a colleague with his classmates from Jiangsu. Chen Rui does not understand the dialect of southern Fujian. According to the above statement, you can get which of the following?
(A) hen Rui can't speak the Central Plains Mandarin. (B) hang Ming speaks Minnan dialect. (C) i Ying is from Shandong. (D) ang Jia can speak Huizhou dialect.","To answer the question, let's break down the information provided:

1. Zhang Ming, Li Ying, Wang Jia, and Chen Rui come from Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Shandong.
2. Each person can only speak a dialect of their origin.
3. Shandong people have the highest educational level and can speak Central Plains Mandarin.
4. Wang Jia has a lower education level than the Fujianese person, implying Wang Jia is not from Shandong.
5. Li Ying can speak Huizhou dialect and is a colleague with classmates from Jiangsu.
6. Chen Rui does not understand the southern Fujian dialect.

We need to determine each person's place of origin:

- If Li Ying speaks Huizhou dialect, they are likely from Anhui, associated with the Huizhou culture.
- Since Li Ying has classmates from Jiangsu, it suggests Li Ying is not from Jiangsu, reinforcing the Anhui association.
- Chen Rui does not understand southern Fujian dialect, implying Chen Rui is not from Fujian.
- Wang Jia has a lower education level than the Fujianese person and cannot be from Shandong.

From this breakdown:

- Li Ying is likely from Anhui.
- Wang Jia is likely not from Fujian or Shandong, which leaves Jiangsu.
- Chen Rui, not understanding the southern Fujian dialect, is likely from Shandong.

This leaves Zhang Ming as the likely candidate for Fujian.

Analyzing the answer options:

(A) Chen Rui can't speak the Central Plains Mandarin. - This could be false, as Chen Rui is likely from Shandong, and Shandong people can speak Central Plains Mandarin.

(B) Zhang Ming speaks Minnan dialect. - This seems likely because it fits Zhang Ming being from Fujian.

(C) Li Ying is from Shandong. - This is incorrect because Li Ying is most likely from Anhui.

(D) Wang Jia can speak Huizhou dialect. - This is incorrect because Wang Jia is likely from Jiangsu.

Thus, the most correct answer is:

6,"The person in charge of the relevant department said that pilots will be carried out in some areas this year to prepare for the system and policy preparations for the comprehensive clean-up of ""small property houses"", and require all localities to confirm the registration and certification of rural collective land. All small-property houses are not subject to registration and are not protected by law. Therefore, this newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law. Which of the following is true will most weaken the above argument.
(A) This newly built house in Hexi Village has been tacitly approved by relevant departments. (B) This newly built house in Hexi Village is a small property house. (C) This newly built house in Hexi Village is built on rural collective land. (D) Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses.","To determine which statement most weakens the argument that the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law, let's evaluate the argument's reasoning and find a flaw.

1. **Understanding the argument:** The core argument states that all small-property houses are not registered and, thus, are not protected by law. Therefore, the newly constructed house in Hexi Village falls under this category and is not protected by law.

2. **Evaluating the options:**
   - **(A) This newly built house in Hexi Village has been tacitly approved by relevant departments.**  
     If the house has been tacitly approved by relevant departments, it suggests that there's a level of implied acceptance or registration, which could provide some legal protection and go against the premise that it is entirely unprotected. This weakens the argument significantly.
   
   - **(B) This newly built house in Hexi Village is a small property house.**  
     This statement actually strengthens the argument as it affirms the classification of the house that the argument is based upon.
   
   - **(C) This newly built house in Hexi Village is built on rural collective land.**  
     This is consistent with characteristics of small-property houses and doesn't provide a reason for legal protection, hence it does not weaken the argument.
   
   - **(D) Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses.**  
     This statement refers to other houses, not directly the subject house of the argument, and thus doesn't weaken the specific claim regarding the house in question.

3. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, option (A) provides a scenario where the house has received some level of tacit approval, which directly challenges the claim of being entirely without legal protection. Hence, it most significantly weakens the argument.

7,"There are five teams participating in the game. The audience had the following comments on the results? (1) The champion is either the Shannan team or the Jiangbei team. (2) The champion is neither Shanbei nor Jiangnan. (3) The champion is Jiangnan Team. (4) The champion is not the Shannan team. The result of the match showed that only one argument was correct, so who won the championship?
(A) hannan. (B) iangnan. (C) hanbei. (D) iangbei.","To determine which team won the championship based on the audience comments, we need to analyze each statement and determine which one could be the only correct statement according to the match results.

Let's summarize the four comments:
1. The champion is either the Shannan team or the Jiangbei team.
2. The champion is neither Shanbei nor Jiangnan.
3. The champion is Jiangnan Team.
4. The champion is not the Shannan team.

Now evaluate the possibilities:

- If statement (1) is correct (""The champion is either the Shannan team or the Jiangbei team.""):
  - Then the champion is either the Shannan team or the Jiangbei team. For this to be the only correct statement, all other statements must be false.
  - Statement (2) must be false. This implies that the champion is either Shanbei or Jiangnan, which contradicts statement (1).
  - Statement (3) must be false, meaning the champion is NOT Jiangnan.
  - Statement (4) must be false, meaning the champion IS Shannan.
  - If Shannan is the champion, then statement (1) and (4) both are true, which contradicts the condition that only one statement is correct.
  - Thus, statement (1) cannot be the only true statement.

- If statement (2) is correct (""The champion is neither Shanbei nor Jiangnan.""):
  - The champion is either Shannan, Jiangbei, or another team not explicitly mentioned.
  - For this to be the only true statement, statement (1) must be false, meaning the champion is NOT Shannan and NOT Jiangbei.
  - Statement (3) must be false, meaning the champion is NOT Jiangnan.
  - Statement (4) must be false, meaning the champion is Shannan.
  - However, if Shannan is the champion, it contradicts statement (2) itself which implies neither Shanbei nor Jiangnan can be winners.
  - Therefore, statement (2) cannot be the only true statement.

- If statement (3) is correct (""The champion is Jiangnan Team.""):
  - Then Jiangnan is the champion.
  - For this to be the only true statement:
    - Statement (1) must be false, meaning Jiangnan is neither Shannan nor Jiangbei.
    - Statement (2) must be false, meaning the champion is Shanbei OR Jiangnan.
    - Statement (4) must be false, meaning the champion IS Shannan.
  - However, if Jiangnan is the champion, statement (3) is indeed true, and others can be false.
  - This fits our condition, therefore statement (3) can be the only true statement so Jiangnan is the champion.

- If statement (4) is correct (""The champion is not the Shannan team.""):
  - Then the champion is NOT Shannan.
  - For this to be the only correct statement:
    - Statement (1) must be false, meaning the champion is NOT Jiangbei.
    - Statement (2) must be false, meaning the champion is either Shanbei OR Jiangnan.
    - Statement (3) must be false, meaning the champion is NOT Jiangnan.
  - The possibility will lead to the champion being someone but no specific team concludes, leaving only unlisted teams as possible which doesn't satisfy only one option correct.

Therefore, the only statement that can be true without a contradiction and fulfilling the condition is statement (3), that ""The champion is Jiangnan Team.""

8,"Compared with small and medium-sized cities, especially small cities and towns, large cities have higher living costs, which inevitably limits the entry of rural population. Therefore, the development of large cities alone cannot actually achieve urbanization. Which of the following is the conclusion must be assumed.
(A) Urbanization is the only way for China's development. (B) Simple development of large cities is not conducive to the promotion of urbanization. (C) To achieve urbanization, the city must fully absorb the rural population. (D) The attractiveness of large cities to the rural population in the outside world is significantly lower than that of small and medium-sized cities.","To determine the conclusion that must be assumed, let's break down the provided information in the context of the question:

- Large cities have higher living costs, which limit the entry of the rural population.
- Therefore, developing large cities alone is insufficient to achieve urbanization.

The conclusion that follows from these premises is that the development of large cities does not promote urbanization by itself. Now let's analyze the options:

(A) Urbanization is the only way for China's development.  
   - This option is unrelated to the topic at hand. The statement is more about promoting what must be assumed for urbanization, not China’s overall development approach.

(B) Simple development of large cities is not conducive to the promotion of urbanization.  
   - This option reflects the conclusion we must assume: that focusing solely on large cities does not support urbanization. This aligns with what the question stems and its conclusion.

(C) To achieve urbanization, the city must fully absorb the rural population.  
   - This statement implies that urbanization requires complete integration between rural and urban populations, which is too strong and not what must be inherently assumed for urbanization.

(D) The attractiveness of large cities to the rural population in the outside world is significantly lower than that of small and medium-sized cities.  
   - This statement ties into the reasoning but is ultimately a premise that might support the assertion rather than a conclusion in itself.

Considering the analysis, option B is the necessary conclusion that follows from the given information. It directly states that focusing solely on large cities isn’t enough for urbanization, which we must assume.

9,"Researchers recently discovered that there is an area called the thalamus pillow deep in the human brain, which is like an information desk operator, responsible for sorting out the external stimulus information and focusing human attention on the most important for behavior and survival Information. The researchers pointed out that this discovery is expected to bring new treatments for disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia caused by lack of attention. Which of the following is assumed by the above argument.
(A) Some schizophrenia are not caused by lack of attention. (B) Visual information is only transmitted through the visual cortex to obtain a neural network to transmit. (C) Researchers have developed a new technology that can directly track the communication between the nerve cortex in the visual cortex and thalamus occipital region. (D) The brain cannot process too much information in detail at the same time, and will only selectively focus on the things most relevant to the behavior.","The argument in the statement is based on the recent discovery by researchers of the thalamus pillow's role in sorting out external stimulus information, helping focus on the most crucial information for behavior and survival. This discovery is linked to potential new treatments for disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia, which are associated with a lack of attention.

To identify an assumption, we need to determine what must be true for the argument to hold. The researchers are assuming a mechanism by which the thalamus pillow sorts and selects information, and its failure would lead to disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia.

Let's evaluate the answer choices:

(A) Some schizophrenia are not caused by lack of attention: This does not directly support the argument because it pertains to different causes of schizophrenia, whereas the argument is focused on lack of attention as the cause.

(B) Visual information is only transmitted through the visual cortex to obtain a neural network to transmit: This statement is about visual information transmission specifics, and it does not directly support the role of the thalamus pillow in attention deficit disorders.

(C) Researchers have developed a new technology that can directly track the communication between the nerve cortex in the visual cortex and thalamus occipital region: While this may be relevant to tracking brain activity, it is more about the methodology rather than the base assumption that impacts the argument's validity.

(D) The brain cannot process too much information in detail at the same time, and will only selectively focus on the things most relevant to the behavior: This asserts a mechanism by which the thalamus pillow operates—by sorting and focusing on the most important information. This supports the argument that disorders like ADHD and schizophrenia could be linked to malfunctioning in this selective focus mechanism.

Thus, the assumption needed for the researchers' expectation of treatment development is closest to what option D indicates: the necessity of selective focus due to the brain's inability to process excessive information simultaneously.

10,"According to a report, in the year to March, mainland Chinese buyers became the second largest group of foreign buyers buying US real estate, with a transaction volume of US $ 9 billion, second only to Canada. This is 23% higher than the previous year ’s USD 7.3 billion transaction volume and 88% higher than the previous year ’s USD 4.8 billion transaction volume.

(A) Many Chinese people buy homes for their children to study in the US. (B) Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year. (C) There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai. (D) The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation.","To evaluate the argument against the claim that more and more wealthy Chinese are transferring their property abroad, it is important to find an alternative explanation for the observed increase in the transaction volume. The argument implies that the reason for the increase in purchases is the transfer of wealth abroad by wealthy Chinese individuals.

Let's consider each option:

(A) Many Chinese people buy homes for their children to study in the US.  
- This provides an alternative reason for purchasing property in the US that is not related to the transfer of wealth abroad. These purchases might be motivated by educational considerations rather than wealth transfer.

(B) Although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year.
- This suggests that while the total transaction amount increased, it was not necessarily due to more buyers. However, the volume doesn't directly counter the reasoning that more wealth is being transferred abroad.

(C) There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai.
- This statement refers to speculation within China and does not address or counter the claim about transferring wealth abroad.

(D) The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation.
- This suggests that the motivation for purchasing US real estate could be linked to its perceived safety and potential for appreciation, but it does not directly negate the notion of wealth transfer abroad.

The best argument against the claim that wealthy Chinese are transferring wealth abroad is option (A), as it provides an alternative motivation for buying properties that is centered around education rather than financial transfer.

11,"People often use microwave ovens to heat food. Some people think that microwave oven heating changes the molecular structure of food, producing molecules that the human body cannot recognize. These strange molecular formulas are unacceptable to the human body, and some are toxic and may even cause cancer. Therefore, people or animals who often eat microwave foods will have serious physiological changes in their bodies, which will cause serious health problems. Which of the following can best question the above view?
(A) Microwave heating will not cause more nutrient loss than other cooking methods. (B) China's microwave oven production standards are consistent with international standards and EU standards. (C) It is also common for developed countries to use microwave ovens. (D) The microwave only heats the water molecules in the food, the food does not change chemically.","To address the claim that microwave oven heating changes the molecular structure of food, it's important to focus on the core argument that the molecular composition of food becomes unrecognizable and harmful after microwaving. 

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) Microwave heating will not cause more nutrient loss than other cooking methods: This option addresses the concern of nutrient loss, not molecular structure changes. It misses the focus of the claim, which is about the creation of harmful molecules.

(B) China's microwave oven production standards are consistent with international standards and EU standards: This option speaks to the safety standards of microwave ovens, not the impact on molecular structure.

(C) It is also common for developed countries to use microwave ovens: This option states the prevalence of microwave use and implies a degree of safety through common usage but does not directly refute the claim about molecular structure changes.

(D) The microwave only heats the water molecules in the food, the food does not change chemically: This response directly counteracts the claim by emphasizing that microwaves primarily heat water molecules and that this process does not lead to chemical changes in food. It effectively argues against the premise that microwaving alters the food's molecular structure to unrecognizable or harmful compounds.

Therefore, (D) best addresses and refutes the core argument regarding molecular changes.

(C) After the founding of New China, more and more children of workers and peasants entered the university. (D) Some of the workers ’children in the statistics may be former farmers’ children.","To evaluate which option most weakens the media's claim regarding the increased proportion of cadres' children among Peking University's student body over 20 years, surpassing other classes, we examine each option:

(A) Many of the cadres counted in the past 20 years are enterprise cadres, which used to include only government officials.  
   - This statement enlarges the pool of what constitutes a ""cadre"", thereby potentially inflating the statistics of cadres' children without necessarily indicating a genuine rise in their representation relative to other classes. It questions the basis of the media's view by suggesting the category itself has changed.

(B) Compared with foreign countries, Chinese education provides workers and peasants with more opportunities for education and social mobility.  
   - This information doesn't specifically counter the claim about Peking University; it gives an international comparison that is largely irrelevant to the specific historical trend at Peking University detailed in the report.

(C) After the founding of New China, more and more children of workers and peasants entered the university.  
   - This backgrounds the general trend in educational access but does not specifically address the last 20 years or suggest any reversal or halt in the specific trend observed at Peking University.

(D) Some of the workers' children in the statistics may be former farmers’ children.  
   - This hints at some fluidity in classification but doesn't directly refute the rise in cadres’ children. It mixes categories slightly but doesn't create doubt about the numerical rise of cadres' children.

Option (A) is the most correct answer as it directly challenges the categorization method used to establish the media's claim, highlighting a possible inflation due to a widened definition of ""cadre"".

(C) Lotus leaf tea becomes a liquid food after soaking in water, and is quickly absorbed in the stomach for a short time, with higher concentration and greater irritation. (D) After taking lotus leaf products, a layer of fat isolation film is formed on the human intestinal wall, which can effectively prevent the absorption of fat;.","To determine which statement most supports the opinion that lotus leaf is a good medicine for weight loss, we need to focus on statements that show the direct impact of lotus leaf on reducing weight or preventing weight gain.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Lotus leaf promotes gastrointestinal motility and clears the body of stool. - This statement suggests improved digestion and possibly reduced bloating, but it doesn’t directly relate to the prevention of fat absorption or loss of weight.

(B) Lotus leaf tea is a food, not a medicine, which has the advantages of non-toxicity and safety. - This emphasizes safety, which is important but doesn't directly support or relate to its efficacy in weight loss.

(C) Lotus leaf tea becomes a liquid food after soaking in water and is quickly absorbed in the stomach for a short time, with higher concentration and greater irritation. - This refers to absorption and irritation, but doesn’t specifically mention weight loss or fat absorption.

(D) After taking lotus leaf products, a layer of fat isolation film is formed on the human intestinal wall, which can effectively prevent the absorption of fat. - This statement directly suggests that lotus leaf prevents the absorption of fat, which aligns with weight loss or prevention of weight gain.

Therefore, the option that directly supports the opinion of the experts regarding the use of lotus leaf for weight loss is option (D), as it highlights a mechanism by which weight gain can be prevented through reduced fat absorption.

14,"On August 3, 2003, a ""human fossil of 110,000 years ago"" was unearthed from the Zhangkoudong ancient human site in Jiuxiang, Yiliang County. The announcement of this excavation immediately attracted wide attention from the media and experts. Many experts who participated in the excavation believe that the appearance of this human tooth fossil indicates that Zhangkoudong had human activities as early as 110,000 years ago. It will rewrite the Kunming area defined by the ancient human ruins of Longtan Mountain in Chenggong County. Mankind has only 30,000 years of history. Which of the following, if true, most doubts the opinions of the above experts?
(A) Academics are inherently controversial, and everyone has the right to express their opinions;. (B) Some experts analyzed the fossil's long axis, crown shape, crown lip and tongue surface protrusion and enamel, etc. , that this fossil is not a human incisor fossil, but a deer tooth fossil;. (C) This tooth fossil was excavated in the red sand layer 20 cm below the calcium plate 110,000 years ago;. (D) Some experts used the uranium method to date the calcium plates of each layer of Zhangkou Cave, and proved that the earliest deposits of the fossil tooth were formed 300,000 years ago;.","To evaluate which statement most doubts the opinions of the experts, we must analyze each option and assess which provides the strongest challenge to the claim that the human fossil indicates human activity 110,000 years ago.

(A) Academics are inherently controversial, and everyone has the right to express their opinions. This statement does not provide any direct evidence against the expert opinion. It simply states a general fact about academia.

(B) Some experts analyzed the fossil's features and concluded it is not a human incisor fossil, but a deer tooth fossil. This statement directly questions the assessment of the fossil, suggesting it may not be a human fossil at all, thus invalidating the claim of human activity from 110,000 years ago. This directly challenges the core assumption that the fossil is of human origin.

(C) The tooth fossil was excavated in the red sand layer 20 cm below the calcium plate 110,000 years ago. This option describes the context of the fossil's discovery but does not directly challenge the claim about human activity.

(D) Some experts used the uranium method to date the calcium plates and proved that the fossil tooth deposits were formed 300,000 years ago. While this suggests an earlier formation date, it does not directly contest the identification of the fossil as a human tooth.

Among these options, (B) provides the most significant doubt regarding the identity of the fossil. If it is not a human tooth, the entire claim about human activity is undermined. Therefore, the best answer is:

15,"In the recruitment examination for the public selection of deputy chiefs in a certain department, a total of 7 people were registered as A. B, C, D, E, G and G. According to statistics, the highest academic qualifications among the 7 people are undergraduate and doctor. Among them there are 3 people who graduated with Ph. D . ; 3 women. It is known that? A. B, and C have the same educational level, while G and G have different educational levels; E, G, and G have the same gender, and A and D have different genders. The final appointment was a female doctor. Based on the above statement, which of the following can be derived?
(A) A is a male doctor;. (B) I am a female doctor;. (C) Geng is not a male doctor;. (D) Ding is a female doctor.","We have 7 people: A, B, C, D, E, G, and Geng. The highest educational qualifications among them are undergraduate and doctor. Among these, there are 3 Ph.D. graduates, 3 women, and a final appointment as a female doctor.

Let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **A, B, and C have the same educational level**: They can either all be undergraduates or all be Ph.D. graduates.

2. **G and Geng have different educational levels**: One is a Ph.D. and the other is an undergraduate.

3. **E, G, and Geng have the same gender**: Either all are men, or all are women.

4. **A and D have different genders**.

The final appointment is a female doctor, which means one of the three Ph.D. graduates is a woman.

Given that A, B, and C have the same educational level, they cannot all be Ph.D. graduates as there are only three Ph.D. holders in total, and one must be a woman.

### Analysis:

- **Ph.D. graduates**: Must come from A, B, C, D, E, G, or Geng.
- **G and Geng**: Have different educational levels, so one is a Ph.D. and the other is an undergraduate.
- **E, G, and Geng**: Share the same gender, and one is a Ph.D.

### Considering the Gender:

- **If A is male**: D must be female. But we know one Ph.D. is a woman and D might not be possible.
- **If A is female**: D is male. 

### Probable Scenarios:

1. A, B, C are undergraduates.
2. G and Geng have different education levels: one is a Ph.D. candidate.
3. Among E, G, and Geng, all are of the same gender (for simplicity, assume they are male to begin with). This implies:
   - E, G, and Geng can't all be Ph.D.s since they are the same gender. One or two of them have to be undergraduates, allowing one female Ph.D.

Given only one female Ph.D.:

- Since E, G, and Geng are the same gender, it is likely they are not female as their combination would go over the one female Ph.D.
- Geng is unlikely to be a female doctor, as she would need to be the only one while (E, G, Geng) relationship may also carry at least one male.

### Conclusion:
Based on our options:
- **C option** is ""Geng is not a male doctor"" makes sense if we deduce Geng may not fulfill the Ph.D. role needed for a female as a group.

Thus, the correct answer seems related to Geng not being sufficiently probable to lay claim to the female doctor spot.

17,"There are five stations set up from west to east along a section of the high-speed railway along the river. It is known that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and West of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station; Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station. If Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, it can be concluded that?
(A) Hu Yao is standing on the east side;. (B) Fuyi is standing in the west;. (C) Yinling is standing on the east side;. (D) Leek standing on the west side;.","To solve this problem, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step and determine the likely arrangement of the stations along the high-speed railway from west to east.

1. **Known Facts**:
   - Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station.
   - Fuyi Station is adjacent to Huyao Station.
   - Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
   - Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and is east of Haoyun Station.

2. **Inference Based on Facts**:
   - Since Fuyi is west of Huyao and adjacent to it, the order of these two must be: Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao. This implies that Haoyun is to the west, followed by Fuyi, and then Huyao.
   - Jiushang is both adjacent to Haoyun and to the east of Haoyun. This places Jiushang immediately east of Haoyun.
   - Yinling is adjacent to Jiushang. Considering Jiushang is placed immediately east of Haoyun, Yinling could initially be either before Jiushang (to the west) or after Jiushang (to the east).

3. **Constructing the Arrangement**:
   - If Jiushang is east of Haoyun and Yinling is adjacent to Jiushang, permanence can't be established with adjacent information, but since Haoyun is already surrounded by Jiushang on the east and Fuyi on the east, Yinling would logically be east of Jiushang.
   - Final station sequence becomes: Haoyun, Jiushang, Yinling, Fuyi, Huyao.

**Conclusion**:
- Given that Haoyun is the westernmost station and Huyao is the easternmost, we focus on these initial conclusions for completeness.
- According to the options:
  - (A) Huyao is to the east (this will be true).
  - Other options such as (B) Fuyi to the west, (C) Yinling to the east, and (D) Leek to the west (assuming a hypothetical unmentioned station ‘Leek’) are less definitive.

Thus, the most correct answer based on the given information is that Huyao is indeed on the east side compared to the other stations.

(A) Yinling Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and west of Haoyun Station;. (B) Haoyun Station is adjacent to Fuyi Station and west of Fuyi Station;. (C) Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and west of Haoyun Station;. (D) Yinling Station is adjacent to Fuyi Station and west of Fuyi Station;.","To solve this problem, we need to piece together the positional information given about the stations:

1. Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station.
2. Fuyi Station is west of Huyao Station, and it is adjacent to Huyao Station.
3. Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
4. Haoyun Station is to the east of Jiushang Station.

Let’s analyze these statements step by step:

First, since Fuyi Station is adjacent to Huyao Station and west of it, we have:

- ... Fuyi (F) ... Huyao (H) ...

Now, since Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station, we have:

- ... Haoyun (Ha) ... Fuyi (F) ... Huyao (H) ...

We also know from the information provided that:

- Haoyun Station is to the east of Jiushang Station.

Therefore, we can place:

- Jiushang (J) ... Haoyun (Ha) ... Fuyi (F) ... Huyao (H) ...

Finally, Jiushang is adjacent to Yinling Station suggests:

- Related to Jiushang (J) station, we can have Yinling (Y) - Jiushang (J) or Jiushang (J) - Yinling (Y)

Considering the arrangement and possibility provided:

- Yinling (Y) - Jiushang (J) ... Haoyun (Ha) ... Fuyi (F) ... Huyao (H) ...

From this arrangement, we can conclude:

(A) Yinling Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and west of Haoyun Station - This is false based on the arrangement.
(B) Haoyun Station is adjacent to Fuyi Station and west of Fuyi Station - This is correct based on the arrangement.
(C) Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and west of Haoyun Station - This is correct as per the arrangement.
(D) Yinling Station is adjacent to Fuyi Station and west of Fuyi Station - This is false based on the arrangement.

(A) Yinling is standing west of Haoyun Station. (B) Fuyi standing west of Jiushang Station. (C) Hao Yun stands west of Yinling Station. (D) Jiu Shang standing west of Fuyi Station.","To solve this problem, we need to place the stations in the correct order based on the given conditions.

1. Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, and it is adjacent to Huyao Station.
   - This condition tells us the relative order of Fuyi, Haoyun, and Huyao. Specifically, it implies that the order is Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao from west to east.

2. Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
   - This indicates that these two stations are next to each other, but does not specify the order between the two or their positions relative to the other stations.

3. Haoyun Station is adjacent to Yinling Station.
   - This means Yinling is next to Haoyun, further refining Haoyun's position among the stations.

Considering all the conditions, a potential order for the stations from west to east could be:

- Haoyun (adjacent to Yinling), then Yinling (adjacent to Jiushang and Haoyun), then Jiushang, then Fuyi (west and adjacent to Huyao), and finally Huyao.

Given this potential order, let's evaluate each option:

(A) Yinling is standing west of Haoyun Station.
   - This is false as Yinling is adjacent to and therefore east (or could be west) of Haoyun Station.

(B) Fuyi standing west of Jiushang Station.
   - In our constructed sequence, Fuyi is east of Jiushang Station, making this statement false.

(C) Hao Yun stands west of Yinling Station.
   - This statement is true. Yinling is adjacent and potentially east of Haoyun in our sequence.

(D) Jiu Shang standing west of Fuyi Station.
   - This is true as per the sequence, Jiushang is west of Fuyi.

20,"Leeds lived in the middle Jurassic about 165 million years ago. It is a huge fish in the dinosaur era. Leeds can grow up to 9 meters long within 20 years of birth, with an average life span of about 40 years. The largest body length can even reach 16.5 meters. This size is comparable to the largest whale shark in modern times, and the average lifespan of the whale shark is about 70 years, so the growth rate of Leeds is likely to exceed that of the whale shark. Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?
(A) Leeds fish and whale sharks feed on plankton and small animals in the ocean, and the growth rate cannot be significantly different. (B) Although the lifespan of the Leeds fish and the whale shark differ greatly, they all reach adulthood around the age of 20, and their body shape is basically fixed. (C) Although the lifespan of fish is different, their growth stages basically correspond to their juvenile, adult, middle-aged and elderly. (D) There is no obvious change in the growth cycle of Jurassic fish and modern fish.","To evaluate the argument that the growth rate of Leeds (a large fish from the Jurassic period) likely exceeds that of the modern whale shark, we need to examine the statements and determine which one effectively challenges the claim.

1. **Argument Summary**: The argument is based on comparing the average life spans and maximum sizes of Leeds and whale sharks. Because Leeds reach a significant size in a shorter lifespan compared to whale sharks, the argument concludes that Leeds grow faster.

2. **Option Analysis**:
   - **(A)**: States that both Leeds and whale sharks have similar diets (plankton and small animals), suggesting their growth rates cannot be significantly different. This challenges the growth rate assumption but doesn't directly address lifespan or growth timing.
   - **(B)**: Claims that despite differences in lifespan, both Leeds and whale sharks reach adulthood around 20 years of age, and their body size is essentially fixed at that point. This directly contradicts the assertion about differing growth rates, as it indicates that growth essentially ceases at a similar age for both species regardless of lifespan.
   - **(C)**: Discusses typical growth stages based on lifespan (juvenile, adult, etc.). This doesn't directly address the specific growth rate comparison between Leeds and whale sharks.
   - **(D)**: Mentions that there's no obvious change in the growth cycles between Jurassic and modern fish. This provides general insight but doesn't specifically challenge the growth rate comparison between Leeds and whale sharks.

3. **Conclusion**: Option B effectively refutes the original argument. It directly states that body size is fixed upon reaching adulthood at around the same age for both species. Thus, differences in overall lifespan don't necessarily imply differences in growth rates once length is stabilized.

21,"In 27.3 years, three canoes were continuously excavated on the Huai River beach in Xinyang County, Henan. Among them, in 2010, the first canoe was discovered under the Huaihe River beach in the Zhangzhuang Formation of Xuzhuang Village, Chengjiao Township, Xixian County, which was proved to be one of the earliest and largest canoe in China. The canoe is 9.3 meters long, 0.8 meters wide and 0.6 meters high. According to carbon-14 measurement, the materials for these canoes are exactly the same as the wood produced in tropical regions of Yunnan. This shows that in ancient times more than 3,000 years ago, the climate in Henan was very similar to the tropical climate. The climate on both sides of the middle and lower reaches of the Huaihe River is warm and humid, with tall and dense forests and a wide variety of animals and plants. Which of the following, if true, will best support the above argument?
(A) The raw materials of these canoes cannot be transported from the distant Yunnan virgin forest, they can only be obtained locally. (B) These canoes have been soaked in water for thousands of years and are very heavy. (C) The place where the Qi Zhou Qiu Jian story takes place is the Chu area, including south of Xuchang, Henan. (D) The canoe hull is pointed at both ends and is chiseled from a complete log for better preservation.","To support the argument that the climate in Henan more than 3,000 years ago was similar to a tropical climate, we need evidence that suggests the presence of wood from tropical species in that area during that time.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) The raw materials of these canoes cannot be transported from the distant Yunnan virgin forest, they can only be obtained locally.  
- This statement supports the argument because it implies that the trees used to make the canoes, which are similar to those found in tropical Yunnan, must have grown locally in Henan. Therefore, Henan must have had a climate that supported the growth of such trees, similar to a tropical climate.

(B) These canoes have been soaked in water for thousands of years and are very heavy.  
- This statement provides no information about the local climate of Henan or the origin of the wood, so it doesn't support the argument.

(C) The place where the Qi Zhou Qiu Jian story takes place is the Chu area, including south of Xuchang, Henan.  
- This statement does not give information relevant to the ancient climate or the origin of the wood, hence it doesn't support the argument either.

(D) The canoe hull is pointed at both ends and is chiseled from a complete log for better preservation.  
- This statement is related to the design and construction of the canoes rather than the climate or origin of the wood, hence it doesn't support the argument.

Therefore, the statement that best supports the argument is (A), as it directly relates to the origin of the wood and aligns with the argument that the region had a tropical climate supporting such tree growth.

22,"In a study, 51 middle school student volunteers were divided into a test group and a control group to receive the same mathematics training. During the five-day training, the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members that were considered to be related to computing power. The subsequent test results showed that the mathematics ability of the test group members was significantly higher than that of the control group members. To their surprise, the effect of this ability improvement can last at least half a year. The researchers therefore believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power. Which of the following, if true, best supports the above researchers ’views?
(A) This non-invasive stimulus is inexpensive and will not cause any pain to the human body. (B) After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations. (C) Before the experiment, the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same. (D) Subjects with microshocks in the brain are more concerned about their behavior, and their concentration is more focused during the test.","To evaluate which statement best supports the researchers' conclusion that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power, we need to focus on evidence that directly links the effect of micro-shocks to an enhancement of mathematical ability.

First, let's analyze the options:

(A) This option discusses the cost and physical sensation of the technique, but does not provide information supporting an enhancement in brain computing power. It is irrelevant to the core claim about improvement in mathematics ability.

(B) This option discusses changes in blood flow between neurons after the shock and mentions that these changes return to normal. This could imply a temporary but significant change in brain activity that leads to enhancements in computing power, although the return to normalcy could also suggest a lack of permanent effect. Primarily, this option does not directly correlate with improved math scores.

(C) This option shows that the two groups started with comparable math abilities, which underscores the differences observed post-experiment. This suggests the improvements in the test group can likely be attributed to the micro-shocks. It supports the claim that the technique was responsible for the difference in mathematics ability, by controlling for prior ability.

(D) This option suggests that the micro-shocks might lead to heightened concentration. Increased concentration could logically lead to better performance on mathematics tests, suggesting increased cognitive performance due to the technique. However, this does not directly prove an increase in brain computing power, just enhanced test-taking ability due to concentration.

Among these, option (C) provides contextual support by indicating that the initial levels of mathematical ability were the same in both groups, implying that the observed difference in post-experimental abilities is likely due to the intervention. Therefore, option C gives the most direct support to the researchers' claim that the micro-shocks were responsible for the enhanced computational ability, as it helps rule out other factors.

(C) The overall average price of residential housing in Cingcheng is the lowest. (D) The overall average price of residential housing in A City is the lowest.","To determine which judgment is wrong, we need to analyze the provided data on house prices for each type of residential housing in cities A, B, and C:

1. For villa houses: A is the highest, followed by B, then C.
2. For ordinary commercial houses: A is the highest, followed by B (which is listed twice, likely an error or oversight), implying B and C have similar or the same prices.
3. For affordable housing: B is the highest, followed by A, then C.

Given this information, let's analyze each option:

(A) The overall average price of residential housing in A City is the highest.
- For A City: Highest in villa and ordinary commercial houses, second in affordable housing. It has strong positions in higher-priced categories, suggesting A City might indeed have the highest overall average prices.

(B) The overall average price of residential housing in City B is in the middle.
- For B City: Second in villa prices, similar to or possibly second in ordinary commercial houses, and highest in affordable housing. B's distribution indicates that it may well have a middle-range average housing price.

(C) The overall average price of residential housing in C City is the lowest.
- For C City: Lowest in villa, likely lowest or tied with B in ordinary commercial houses, lowest in affordable housing. C consistently has the lowest or among the lowest prices across all categories, supporting the assertion that C is overall the lowest.

(D) The overall average price of residential housing in A City is the lowest.
- Given that A ranks highest in the villa and ordinary commercial categories and second in affordable housing, it's unlikely that A City has the lowest average price.

Thus, judgment (D) contradicts the information given about the rankings of housing prices. Therefore, the incorrect judgment is:

24,"The secret of the “age” of human male and female ancestors is hidden in the Y chromosome and mitochondria. The Y chromosome only passes from father to son, while mitochondria only pass from mother to daughter. Looking back through these two genetic materials, we can find that all men have a common male ancestor ""Y chromosome Adam"", and all women have a common female ancestor ""mitochondrial Eve"". The researchers conducted genome sequencing and comparative analysis of 69 males from nine different populations, such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and found that this male common ancestor ""Y chromosome Adam"" was formed about 156,000 to 120,000 years ago. Using the same technical analysis of mitochondria, the researchers also calculated that this female common ancestor ""mitochondrial Eve"" was formed between 148,000 and 99,000 years ago. Which of the following is most appropriate as a corollary of the above discussion?
(A) ""Y chromosome Adam"" and ""mitochondrial Eve"" were formed in the same period, and ""age"" is close, ""Y chromosome Adam"" may be earlier. (B) 5 years ago, there was only one man ""Adam"" on earth. (C) As two individuals, ""Adam"" and ""Eve"" should never meet. (D) Men and women are born together and have conceived modern humans together.","The passage discusses the genetic concept of ""Y chromosome Adam"" and ""mitochondrial Eve,"" who are the most recent common ancestors for all living men and women, respectively, via Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA. 

1. ""Y chromosome Adam"" refers to the most recent common paternal ancestor of all current men, traced through the Y chromosome.
2. ""Mitochondrial Eve"" refers to the most recent common maternal ancestor of all current humans, traced through mitochondrial DNA.

According to the passage:
- ""Y chromosome Adam"" lived approximately 156,000 to 120,000 years ago.
- ""Mitochondrial Eve"" lived between 148,000 and 99,000 years ago.

The question asks for a corollary based on this information. Let's analyze the options:

(A) ""Y chromosome Adam"" and ""mitochondrial Eve"" were formed in the same period, and ""age"" is close, ""Y chromosome Adam"" may be earlier.
   - This option states that both ancestors existed in overlapping time periods and that ""Y chromosome Adam"" might be earlier than ""mitochondrial Eve."" This is consistent with the date ranges given in the passage.

(B) 5 years ago, there was only one man ""Adam"" on earth.
   - This is incorrect because the passage suggests these ancestors lived thousands of years ago, not just 5 years ago. 

(C) As two individuals, ""Adam"" and ""Eve"" should never meet.
   - While ""Y chromosome Adam"" and ""mitochondrial Eve"" are separated by time, this option overly simplifies and misrepresents the genetic concept. It suggests that they were distinct individuals who never existed simultaneously, which is unnecessary and not supported by the passage.

(D) Men and women are born together and have conceived modern humans together.
   - While true on a general level, this does not specifically apply only to the point in question about when ""Y chromosome Adam"" and ""mitochondrial Eve"" existed, and doesn't provide a direct corollary to the specific information provided.

Option (A) is the most appropriate answer, as it directly addresses the time frames given for ""Y chromosome Adam"" and ""mitochondrial Eve"" and suggests their ages are close, with the possibility that ""Y chromosome Adam"" may have lived earlier.

25,"Research has found that insects “breathe” through the stomata system on their bodies. The stomata are connected to the trachea, and more and more layers of smaller and smaller air are attached from top to bottom, thereby bringing oxygen to the whole body. At the current level of oxygen in the atmosphere, the total length of the stomata system has reached the limit; if the total length exceeds this limit, the oxygen supply capacity will be insufficient. Therefore, it can be judged that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects. Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?
(A) Studies of invertebrates in the ocean have also found that in colder water and with higher oxygen content, the organisms there are also larger. (B) During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth ’s atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%. At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter. (C) Small locusts cannot survive in a low-oxygen environment, especially in an environment with an oxygen concentration below 15%. Adult locusts can survive in an environment with 2% oxygen. (D) Under the environment with high oxygen content and high air pressure, the tested fruit flies lived to the fifth generation and their body size increased by 20%.","To support the argument that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects, we need evidence that directly correlates higher oxygen concentrations with larger insect sizes. Let's evaluate the options:

(A) Studies of invertebrates in the ocean have also found that in colder water and with higher oxygen content, the organisms there are also larger.  
- This suggests a relationship between oxygen content and organism size, but it applies to oceanic invertebrates, not terrestrial insects specifically. While intriguing, it is not the most direct support for the argument about terrestrial insects.

(B) During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth’s atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%. At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter.  
- This directly supports the argument by providing historical proof that higher oxygen concentrations corresponded with larger insect sizes. The evidence specifically addresses insects and provides historical context.

(C) Small locusts cannot survive in a low-oxygen environment, especially in an environment with an oxygen concentration below 15%. Adult locusts can survive in an environment with 2% oxygen.  
- This statement discusses survival in low-oxygen conditions and doesn't directly support the link between oxygen concentration and insect size.

(D) Under the environment with high oxygen content and high air pressure, the tested fruit flies lived to the fifth generation, and their body size increased by 20%.  
- This option shows a direct experiment on a terrestrial insect where increased oxygen content led to an increase in size, which supports the argument.

Both options (B) and (D) provide strong support, but (D) provides experimental evidence pertaining to present conditions, which more directly supports the argument by showing the experimental correlation between increased oxygen levels and body size in insects.

1. Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.

2. Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time.

3. Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.

- We need to choose 2 girls from Fang Rufen, Guo Yanran, and He Zhilian.
- We need to choose 3 boys from Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, Song Wenkai, and Tang Xiaohua.

Let's test the implications of these constraints to see if any person must definitely be in the group:

- **Option A, Fang Rufen:** There are no constraints directly involving Fang Rufen, so we cannot immediately guarantee her selection based solely on the constraints.

- **Option B, Guo Yanran:** If Guo Yanran is chosen, Tang Xiaohua cannot be chosen, reducing male candidates to Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai. However, this alone doesn't guarantee Guo Yanran's selection since we can choose different pairs of women.

- **Option C, Song Kaiwen:** If Song Kaiwen is chosen, Peng Youwen cannot be chosen, which still leaves several other male candidates including Ren Xiangyang.

- **Option D, Ren Xiangyang:** With the constraints, Ren Xiangyang does not have any restrictions, making him qualify in all scenarios regardless of female selections. Given constraints, the selection of Ren does not conflict or limit other candidate choices.

Considering the constraints, Ren Xiangyang does not appear in any restrictions, making him a flexible choice that can fit in any combination of the three boys. Hence, Ren Xiangyang must be selected to ensure that the team complies with all given constraints.

1. **Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time**: This means if Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected.
2. **Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time**: This condition is independent of Guo Yanran's selection and needs to be managed separately.
3. **Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time**: This means if Guo Yanran is selected and thus Tang Xiaohua is not, Qiu Zhijie can be selected.

If Guo Yanran is selected, then Tang Xiaohua must not be selected due to the first requirement. This allows for Qiu Zhijie to be considered positively because his exclusion was only dependent upon Tang Xiaohua being selected (which won't happen if Guo Yanran is selected).

Therefore, the most incontrovertible selection adhering to all rules mentioned and based only on Guo Yanran’s selection is Qiu Zhijie, as the dependency is uniquely relieved by the exclusion of Tang Xiaohua.

2. Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected simultaneously.
3. Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected simultaneously.

The question provides an additional condition: if He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?

Start by examining the selection of girls. If He Zhilian is not selected, the two girls must be Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran.

Consider the selection of boys:
- Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected (due to Constraint 1).
- Remove Tang Xiaohua from the pool of boys. The remaining candidates are Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai.

Apply other constraints:
- If we select Peng Youwen, we cannot select Song Wenkai (Constraint 2).
- If we select Qiu Zhijie, we cannot select Tang Xiaohua, which is already not selected, hence the constraint is met, further confirming this scenario.

Let's find a combination using the remaining boys:
- Select Ren Xiangyang, Peng Youwen, and Qiu Zhijie. 

Since Peng Youwen is selected, Song Wenkai cannot be selected (Constraint 2). Hence Song Wenkai is not selected.

(A) The short and wide hind bone makes this primate good at jumping and preying in the bushes.  
- This option discusses physical adaptation for movement, not eye socket size or daily activity patterns.

(B) There is no strict proportional relationship between animal vision and orbital size.

34,"By analyzing the light released or absorbed by the atoms of an object, you can measure whether the object is far away from the earth or close to the earth. When the object is far away from the earth, the frequency of these lights will move to the red end (low frequency) of the spectrum, referred to as ""red shift"" ""On the contrary, it is called"" blue shift "". The unique light emitted by the atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially the electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons it releases will also become higher, so the release and absorption frequencies will be blue-shifted. Conversely, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will be red-shifted. Astronomical observations have found that most galaxies have a redshift phenomenon. Moreover, the farther the galaxy is from the earth, the greater the redshift. According to this, many scientists believe that the universe must be constantly expanding. Which of the following, if true, can best refute the views of the above scientists?
(A) In the distant universe, some blue-shifted objects were also found. (B) The earth is not in the center of the universe. (C) The stars that people can observe may be less than one percent of the real universe. (D) From the perspective of other celestial bodies in the universe, redshift is also an absolute dominant phenomenon.","To refute the view that ""the universe must be constantly expanding"" based on the redshift phenomenon observed in most galaxies, we need to find an explanation or evidence that challenges the correlation between redshift and the expanding universe.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) **In the distant universe, some blue-shifted objects were also found.**  
If blue-shifted objects were found in the distant universe, this could indicate movements toward us, suggesting that not all of the universe is expanding or moving away from us. This does suggest an exception that might refute the uniform expansion interpretation from redshift observations, but the key point here is the frequency of these occurrences.

(B) **The earth is not in the center of the universe.**  
The position of Earth within the universe doesn't directly refute the observation that most galaxies exhibit redshift, as it doesn't alter the effect of redshift itself or suggest that the universe isn't expanding.

(C) **The stars that people can observe may be less than one percent of the real universe.**  
While it's true that we may only observe a small portion of the universe, this doesn't directly refute the interpretation of those observations, specifically the general trend of redshift seen in observable galaxies.

(D) **From the perspective of other celestial bodies in the universe, redshift is also an absolute dominant phenomenon.**  
This reinforces the current view rather than refuting it, as it suggests that redshift is observed consistently throughout the universe, regardless of the perspective.

Among the options, (A) presents the best potential refutation as it introduces the possibility of contraction or other non-expansion movements in some parts of the universe, challenging the view that redshift universally indicates expansion.

(1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent; (2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department; (3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department. If the human resources department is not on the top floor, the floors that the R & D department may be on are?
(A) , 4, 6. (B) , 4, 5. (C) , 5. (D) , 6.","To determine the possible floors that the Research and Development (R&D) department could occupy, we'll analyze the constraints and deduce the possible arrangements:

1. **Constraint (1)**: The floors of the Human Resources (HR) department and the Sales department are not adjacent.  
2. **Constraint (2)**: The Finance department is on the next floor of the Planning department. This means that if the Planning department is on floor X, the Finance department will be on floor X+1.
3. **Constraint (3)**: The Administrative department is above the Planning department but below the HR department. This means if the Planning department is on floor X, the Administrative department can be on floors greater than X, and less than the floor of the HR department.
4. **Additional information**: The HR department is not on the top floor.

Given these constraints, let us explore the possible positions for each department:

Since we know that HR cannot be on the top floor (floor 6), HR has to be on floors 1-5. We also know that the Administration department has to be above Planning and below HR. At the same time, Finance has to be right above Planning.

This constraint will help us explore the possibilities:

- If Planning is on floor 1, then Finance will be on floor 2, and Administration must be above Planning but below HR. If HR is on floor 3-5, then Administration can be on floor 3-4 (but not adjacent to HR if HR is on floor 3).
- If Planning is on floor 2, then Finance will be on floor 3, and Administration must be above Planning. Thus, HR can be above floor 3, possibly on floors 4-5 (but not adjacent to Sales).
- If Planning is on floor 3, then Finance will be on floor 4, and Administration must be on a higher floor than 3.

The distribution of the Planning, Finance, and Administration floors affects where HR can go, and thus which options are feasible for R&D.

If HR is not on the top floor, R&D could potentially occupy multiple floors. Given all constraints, the most likely arrangement could have the R&D department potentially on floors that are not adjacent to HR or any constrained departments. The solution, through elimination and considering only permissible floor arrangements considering adjacent rules and hierarchy:

- **R&D can be on floors 1, 4, or 6** depending on the arrangements of HR, Planning, Finance, and Administration.

The available set of options given seems to be a typo in interpreting the problem layout, missing the positions due to the floor arrangement. Based on the analysis, we'll see:

Final Answer: {A} (Considering interpretation, R&D could be strategically placed on 1, 4, and 6 as no department-specific pair conflicts inherently.)"
38,"A company has a 6-story office building. The company's finance department, planning department, administration department, sales department, human resources department, and research and development department work here, and each department occupies one of the floors. Known? (1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent; (2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department; (3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department.

(A) The R & D department is on the fifth floor. (B) The R & D department is on the upper level of the sales department. (C) The Administration Department is not on the upper level of the Planning Department. (D) The sales department is on a certain layer above the planning department.","To solve this problem, let's use the information provided to determine the potential placement of each department in the building:

1. **Finance and Planning Departments:**
   - It is stated that the finance department is on the next floor above the planning department.
   - Since the finance department is on the third floor, the planning department must be on the second floor.

2. **Administration Department:**
   - The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
   - Thus, the administrative department must be on the third, fourth, or fifth floor, but it cannot be on the third floor because the finance department is already there. Hence, it could be on the fourth or fifth floor.

3. **Human Resources Department:**
   - The human resources department cannot be adjacent to the sales department.
   - Given this constraint, and knowing the potential floors for the administration department (fourth or fifth), the human resources department can be on the fifth or sixth floor. However, we must also account for the non-adjacency requirement with the sales department.

4. **Sales Department:**
   - There are no direct constraints except that it cannot be adjacent to the human resources department.
   - If the human resources department were on the fifth floor, the sales department could be on the fourth or sixth floor to satisfy the non-adjacency constraint. If the human resources department were on the sixth floor, the sales department could be on any floor below the fifth.

5. **Research and Development Department:**
   - No explicit constraints are provided, except to check specific conditions in the choices.

Given these deductions, let's evaluate the provided options:

(A) The R & D department is on the fifth floor.
   - This is possible if the administration is on the fourth floor and, for example, the human resources department is on the sixth floor. This would then require the sales department to be on the first floor.

(B) The R & D department is on the upper level of the sales department.
   - This is possible if the R & D department is, for example, on the fifth floor and the sales department is on the fourth floor. This isn't inconsistent with the previous analysis.

(C) The Administration Department is not on the upper level of the Planning Department.
   - This is false. The administrative department must be above the planning department, which is on the second floor.

(D) The sales department is on a certain layer above the planning department.
   - This could also be true. The sales department could indeed be on a floor above the second floor where the planning department is.

The options that are consistent with the deductions are (A) and (B). Since the question asks which may be correct, both (A) and (B) are valid. However, since one option is required, it's possible to choose one that directly satisfies potential multiple valid configurations. Given that the problem asks which of the following may be correct, option (A) is a valid possibility. Thus, the most direct selection without requiring another's relative position is (A).

39,"A company has a 6-story office building. The company's finance department, planning department, administration department, sales department, human resources department, and research and development department work here, and each department occupies one of the floors. Known? (1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent; (2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department; (3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department. Which of the following may be the two departments where the first and second tiers are located?
(A) Finance Department, Sales Department. (B) Planning Department, Sales Department. (C) R & D Department and Sales Department. (D) Sales Department, Planning Department.","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and see which department could potentially occupy the first and second floors based on these clues.

Let's translate the clues into steps:

1. **Clue 1:** The human resources department and the sales department are not on adjacent floors.
2. **Clue 2:** The finance department is on the floor immediately above the planning department.
3. **Clue 3:** The administrative department is on a floor above the planning department but below the human resources department.

To determine the possible positions for each department, let's find a consistent arrangement for all six departments:

- **Finance and Planning Departments:** According to Clue 2, these two must be consecutive with Finance immediately above Planning. Therefore, possible positions for these pairs could be (1 and 2), (2 and 3), (3 and 4), (4 and 5), or (5 and 6).

- **Administrative Department:** Based on Clue 3, this department should be above the Planning department. If Planning is on floor 1, Administrative could be on floors 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If Planning is on floor 2, Administrative could be on floors 3, 4, 5, or 6, and so on. However, Administrative also needs to be below Human Resources.

- **Non-Consecutive Human Resources and Sales Departments:** Clue 1 tells us they cannot be on consecutive floors, limiting some of their possible placements.

Let's try arranging the departments:

Assumption:  

- Planning = 1  
- Finance = 2 (since Finance is directly above Planning by Clue 2)
  
Now, following the logic:

- Administrative needs to be above Planning (1), so it can be 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  
- But Administrative needs to be below Human Resources. So, the Human Resources Department must be on either 4, 5, or 6 if Administrative is 3.
  
Given these assumptions, if Administrative is 3:
  
- Human Resources can't be on 4 (otherwise, Sales couldn't be separate by Clue 1), so Human Resources must be 5 or 6.
  
- Sales couldn't be 4 (there would be no separation), so Sales must be either 1, 3, 5, or 6.
  
These assignments allow for departments on the first and second floor as Planning and Finance given Clue 2. This is an arrangement that works with all conditions — no conditions are violated. 

Thus, the possible departments for the first and second floors are:
  
**Final Answer:** {B} Planning Department, Sales Department."
40,"All landscape rooms can see the landscape, but Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape. Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room. Which of the following is most similar to the above argument?
(A) Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person. (B) Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap. This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market. Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap. (C) Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English. (D) Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan. Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.","The argument for Li Wenbing's family can be broken down into the following logical form:  
- All landscape rooms have a certain attribute (being able to see the landscape).  
- Li Wenbing's family lacks this attribute (cannot see the landscape).  
- Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room.  

We need to find an option that follows the same reasoning pattern. Let's evaluate each of the options:

(A) Kind people will be respected by the villagers, Chenggong who is kind and charitable will be respected by the villagers, so Chenggong is a kind person.
- This argument has a different structure: It states the outcome first (being respected) based on initial attributes and concludes that the individual possesses a specific attribute. It doesn't follow the same negative reasoning as the original argument.

(B) Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap. This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market. Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap.
- This argument follows a similar pattern:  
  - All vegetables in Dongdun Market are cheap (attribute).  
  - This basket of vegetables is not from Dongdun Market (doesn't have the source attribute).  
  - Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap (lack of attribute leading to conclusion).
  This closely resembles the structure of the Li Wenbing argument.

(C) Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English.
- This is a direct assertion of a positive attribute based on a category membership and does not follow the pattern of showing lack of an attribute to conclude not being in a category.

(D) Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan. Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.
- This suggests that lack of action (not applying) implies lack of attributes (not meeting the conditions). While it follows a somewhat similar structure, it is based on action and eligibility, which is not as closely aligned in terms of logical reasoning as option B.

Final evaluation shows that option (B) closely matches the logical reasoning form of the original scenario with Li Wenbing's family.

(D) After paying attention to a healthy diet, patients with dyspepsia will generally ease the symptoms of discomfort within one month.","To refute the experimental conclusion that chili relieves indigestion, we need to identify an option that either questions the validity of the findings or provides an alternative explanation for the observed effects.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) The capsaicin contained in chili can hinder the secretion of a neurotransmitter to a certain extent.  
- This statement provides additional information about the effects of capsaicin but does not directly refute the conclusion that chili relieves indigestion.

(B) In this experiment, 5% of the experimenters' discomfort symptoms worsened.
- While this shows a small percentage experienced worsened symptoms, it doesn't provide compelling evidence against the overall conclusion since 60% still reported improvement.

(C) In another group of subjects who took the pill after meals, 55% of the subjects' symptoms were alleviated.
- This suggests that the timing of taking the chili pill might not significantly alter the outcome, which does not directly refute the claim that chili itself is effective in relieving indigestion.

(D) After paying attention to a healthy diet, patients with dyspepsia will generally ease the symptoms of discomfort within one month.
- This statement offers a plausible alternative explanation for the relief of symptoms, implying that changes in diet, rather than the chili treatment, might be responsible for the observed symptom relief. This would effectively challenge the experimental conclusion by pointing to an external factor that could explain the same outcome.

Among the options, (D) best refutes the experimental conclusion by suggesting an alternative reason for symptom alleviation, unrelated to the ingestion of chili.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology.
- This option is unrelated to the argument about habitation. It doesn't provide evidence against people living in the cave.

(B) The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue.
- If the cave was primarily used as a cemetery and funeral site, it would suggest that it wasn't used as a residential area for hundreds of people, thus refuting the argument.

(C) There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave.
- This provides information about the relative age of the cave compared to other sites but doesn't address the argument about habitation.

(D) The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago.

43,"Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada. The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground. In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques. Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago. Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
(A) The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground. (B) In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale. (C) Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface. (D) In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth.","To determine which option best supports the research findings about meteorite impacts approximately 215 million years ago, we should evaluate each option's relevance and strength in supporting the conclusion.

(A) The statement about the rock forming after the seabed accumulation layer was exposed above ground does not directly relate to supporting the claim about the meteorite impact and the presence of iridium, platinum, and marine plankton fossils from about 215 million years ago. It provides context about geological formation but doesn't strengthen the claim related to meteorite impact.

(B) The statement that species such as ammonite were extinct on a large scale in the late Paleozoic Triassic period correlates temporally with the impact period of about 215 million years ago but doesn't directly provide evidence for a meteorite impact. It adds context to potential consequences (extinctions) during this time but doesn't specifically link to the meteorites.

(C) This statement directly supports the claim that the high concentrations of iridium and platinum found in the clay layer are indicative of a meteorite origin, as these elements are peculiar to meteorites. This aligns well with the research findings and strengthens the argument for the meteorite impact theory.

(D) Mentioning many meteorite incidents in ancient times doesn't specifically lend support to the claim about this particular impact event 215 million years ago. It provides general context that meteor impacts are not unique but does not target the specific claim with evidence.

Thus, the option that best supports the research findings by providing specific evidence of meteorite-related elements (iridium and platinum) aligns with the research conclusion. The most correct answer is:

(C) None of the people living in the ""Peony Garden"" community have a doctorate. (D) All non-graduate PhD students live in the ""Peony Garden"" community.","To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze each statement and evaluate it based on the premise provided:

1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - Newly recruited researchers in 2013 include either ""introduced talent"" or fresh graduate Ph.D. students.
   - ""Introduced talent"" must have a deputy senior title or above.
   - Fresh graduate Ph.D. students have Beijing household registration and live in postdoctoral apartments.
   - ""Introduced talents"" live in the ""Peony Garden"" community.

2. **Option Analysis:**
   - **(A) None of those who live in postdoctoral apartments have deputy senior titles or above.**  
     According to the premise, fresh graduate Ph.D. students live in postdoctoral apartments and ""introduced talents"" have deputy senior titles or above and live in a different location. Thus, this statement is true since fresh graduates living in postdoctoral apartments would not be ""introduced talents"" with higher titles.
   
   - **(B) Those who have a Ph.D. have Beijing household registration.**
     The premise specifies that fresh graduate Ph.D. students have Beijing household registration, but it does not make it clear if this applies to all Ph.D. holders in the unit. So, this statement cannot be answered definitively as true.

   - **(C) None of the people living in the ""Peony Garden"" community have a doctorate.**
     The premise does not mention this explicitly. We know ""introduced talents"" live there, but it's not stated that they cannot have a doctorate. So, this statement may not be valid.

   - **(D) All non-graduate Ph.D. students live in the ""Peony Garden"" community.**
     This statement is ambiguous based on the premise because it mentions only the living situation of Ph.D. graduates and ""introduced talents"". We cannot conclude this confidently from the given information.

(D) Due to the implementation of the one-child policy for many years, China's aging problem will be more acute than many Western developed countries.","To support the idea of ​​gradually extending the retirement age, we need to look for reasons that justify or favor such a measure. The main argument for extending the retirement age revolves around alleviating the social security pressure brought about by an aging population. 

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) Many people now find a second career after going through retirement procedures. 
- This supports the idea that people are still capable and willing to work after retirement, suggesting that the retirement age could be realistically extended without adverse effects on individuals' capabilities.

(B) Respecting the elderly and loving children is a fine tradition in China for thousands of years, which should be carried forward.
- This is more about cultural traditions and does not provide a specific reason related to extending retirement age or addressing the issues of social security or aging population significantly.

(C) The employment problem of young people should be solved by economic development and transformation and upgrading.
- This option suggests that youth employment issues should be addressed through other economic solutions, indirectly supporting that extending the retirement age need not negatively impact youth employment.

(D) Due to the implementation of the one-child policy for many years, China's aging problem will be more acute than many Western developed countries.
- This directly ties into the reason for extending the retirement age: an acute aging problem exacerbating social security pressures. It supports the necessity of such a measure by highlighting the unique demographic challenges faced by China.

Among these, option (D) provides a compelling rationale for why extending the retirement age is necessary due to the acute aging issue. It most directly addresses the core argument for extending the retirement age: to alleviate strain on social security caused by a rapidly aging population.

The argument is primarily based on the increase in posts about negative topics compared to positive ones, implying a worsening social atmosphere. Let's evaluate each option:

(A) ""Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles."" - This option suggests that negative news tends to spread more widely than positive news, but it doesn't provide evidence that the actual conditions are worsening; it only addresses the nature of news dissemination.

(B) The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years. - This option provides a plausible explanation for the increase in posts about both negative and positive topics. With more internet users, there naturally would be more posts overall, potentially leading to an increase in posts on all subjects without indicating a change in the social atmosphere.

(C) In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes. - This option suggests that some of the negative posts could be motivated by profit rather than genuine social issues, which could partially undermine the argument.

48,"With the help of animal fossils and DNA retained in specimens, and using increasingly advanced cloning and genetic techniques, humans have been able to ""resurrect"" some already extinct animals, such as mammoths, dodos, dinosaurs, etc. At the same time, the scientific community also started a big discussion about whether humans should revive extinct animals. Supporters believe that reanimated animals are expected to restore the damaged ecological environment in some areas. For example, Mammoths live on the vast grasslands of Siberia, and their excrement is an excellent fertilizer to nourish the grasslands. After the mammoth became extinct, grasslands lacking fertilizer were gradually replaced by tundra. If the mammoth can be resurrected and returned to Siberia, it will help reduce the area of ​​tundra and gradually restore the grassland ecosystem. Which of the following, if true, would best refute the arguments of the above supporters?
(A) If you invest a lot of time, energy and cost to resurrect the disappeared creatures, it will inevitably contain and weaken the protection of existing endangered animals, and the result will not be worth the loss. (B) Merely cloning an individual of an extinct animal does not mean that humans have the ability to resurrect the entire population. (C) Even if the extinct animals can be resurrected in batches, the habitat suitable for their growth may have long since disappeared. If you can not give heavy organisms a suitable environment for survival, all efforts will be in vain. (D) The vast majority of these animals gradually disappeared in the course of human development. It was human activities that led to their extinction.","To refute the arguments of supporters who believe that resurrecting extinct animals will restore the damaged ecological environment, we need to undermine the feasibility or efficacy of bringing these animals back and reintroducing them into their former habitats.

Let's analyze the options:

(A) Argues that investing resources in resurrecting extinct animals will take away from the protection of existing endangered animals. This does not directly address the ecological restoration argument but rather focuses on resource allocation.

(B) Points out that cloning an individual does not mean resurrecting the entire species. While a valid limitation, it doesn't specifically counter the argument that reanimated species could restore ecosystems, unless linked to population sustainability issues.

(C) Argues that even if extinct animals can be resurrected, the suitable habitat for their survival may no longer exist, rendering efforts futile. If reintroduced animals cannot thrive in a changed environment, then the goal of ecological restoration clearly cannot be met.

(D) States that human activities led to the extinction of most animals but does not address the current feasibility of their resurrection and ecological impact.

Option C best refutes the supporters' argument. If the habitat necessary for the revived species no longer exists, these animals cannot be expected to restore the ecosystem, and the reintroduction efforts would ultimately fail.

(B) Test pregnant women and other women who have enough vitamins in their daily diet to determine whether they lack vitamins. (C) Test pregnant women and other women with insufficient vitamins in their daily diet and determine whether they are deficient in vitamins. (D) Test the daily diet of some pregnant women who lack vitamins to determine the content of vitamins.","To evaluate the conclusion that pregnant women's vitamin deficiency symptoms are due to the higher demand for vitamins by the growing baby rather than a lack of vitamins in their diet, we must consider the relationship between dietary intake and vitamin deficiency symptoms.

The argument posits that the deficiency symptoms are not from insufficient dietary intake but from increased requirements. To assess this, it's crucial to differentiate between women who consume adequate vitamins yet still show deficiency symptoms and those whose intake is genuinely insufficient.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Testing the daily diet of some pregnant women who do not lack vitamins to determine the vitamin content could show what a sufficient diet for pregnant women consists of. However, it does not directly evaluate the cause of deficiency symptoms in those who do exhibit them.

(B) Testing pregnant women and other women who have enough vitamins in their daily diet to determine whether they lack vitamins could shed light on whether pregnant women with adequate dietary intake still show deficiency symptoms. This directly addresses the argument's conclusion by assessing if increased demand, rather than intake, is the issue.

(C) Testing pregnant women and other women with insufficient vitamins in their daily diet and determining whether they are deficient in vitamins would demonstrate that diet directly influences vitamin deficiency symptoms, but it does not address if increased requirements in pregnancy are the cause despite adequate intake.

(D) Testing the daily diet of some pregnant women who lack vitamins to determine the content of vitamins focuses merely on confirming that pregnant women lack dietary vitamins, which doesn't evaluate the claim regarding increased demand causing deficiency symptoms despite adequate intake.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, option (B) provides the most direct evaluation of the conclusion by comparing those who have enough vitamins but still present deficiency symptoms, allowing us to assess if higher demand during pregnancy causes the symptoms.

50,"The education system has two aspects, one is compulsory education and the other is higher education. A reasonable education system requires everyone to have the right to compulsory education and to have access to higher education through fair competition. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn from the above conclusions?
(A) An education system that does not allow everyone to go to college is unreasonable. (B) An education system that guarantees everyone to enjoy compulsory education is reasonable. (C) An education system that does not allow everyone to enjoy the right to compulsory education is unreasonable. (D) There should be more requirements for a reasonable education system.","To solve this question, let's analyze the given statement and the options carefully:

The statement distinguishes between two types of education: 
1. Compulsory education, which everyone has the right to.
2. Higher education, which should be accessed through fair competition.

Now, let's evaluate the response options:

(A) ""An education system that does not allow everyone to go to college is unreasonable."" 
   - This option focuses on higher education. The original statement does not assert that everyone must attend college, just that access should be fair. Therefore, this option is not supported by the statement.

(B) ""An education system that guarantees everyone to enjoy compulsory education is reasonable."" 
   - This directly correlates with the statement that everyone should have the right to compulsory education. Thus, it aligns with a key component of a reasonable education system as described.

(C) ""An education system that does not allow everyone to enjoy the right to compulsory education is unreasonable.""
   - This contradicts the premise that everyone should have the right to compulsory education. Therefore, it also aligns with the premise that denying this right would be unreasonable.

(D) ""There should be more requirements for a reasonable education system.""
   - While it is possible that there could be more considerations, the statement specifically focuses on the rights to compulsory education and fair access to higher education. Thus, this option veers away from the statement's explicit focus, making it weaker.

Considering these evaluations, options (B) and (C) both adhere to the statement's description of a reasonable education system. However, option (C) frames it in a negative context of unreasonableness, echoing the right to compulsory education more strongly.

Thus, the best answer is: Final_Answer: {C}"
51,"A survey of traffic accidents has found that the incidence of traffic accidents is actually similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not. However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can indeed reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents. Which of the following is most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency?
(A) Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents. (B) The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving. (C) It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management. (D) In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.","To resolve the inconsistency between the findings of the survey of traffic accidents and the experts' belief, it's important to examine the potential reasons why the strict investigation of drunk driving has not led to a significant reduction in traffic accidents.

Let's evaluate the provided answer options:

(A) Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
- This option doesn't address why there is a discrepancy between the investigation results and the experts' beliefs. While it restates the scenario, it doesn't explain the similarity in traffic accident rates.

(B) The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
- This option suggests that despite strict investigations, drunk driving may still occur. Thus, even if strict investigations are in place, they might not be effectively preventing or stopping drunk driving, which could explain why the incidence of traffic accidents hasn't been significantly reduced.

(C) It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management.
- This option suggests an alternative method for improving traffic safety but doesn't directly address why the strict investigation hasn't resulted in a clear reduction of traffic accidents.

(D) In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.
- This option implies that while strict investigation focuses on drunk driving, other factors or violations might still contribute to accidents, which could maintain the accident rate despite efforts to control drunk driving.

Between the options, (B) is most helpful in explaining the inconsistency because it directly addresses the potential failure of strict investigations to completely eliminate the behavior they are targeting, which may still result in similar accident rates.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) Even if the Ukrainian authorities recognize the special status of the two ""Republic"" territories and Russian language, and pardon all militia armed participants and political prisoners, the conflict may still not be resolved.  
- This option aligns with the skepticism expressed by the Ukrainian observers. They seem to support the idea that these actions may not necessarily resolve the conflict. Therefore, the observers' comments do not refute this statement; they potentially agree with it.

(B) Even if the conflict is resolved, it is not necessarily because the Ukrainian authorities recognize the ""Republic"" territory and the special status of Russian.  
- The observers' comments are concerned with whether those actions are necessary or sufficient to resolve the conflict, not with the reasons for conflict resolution after it has occurred. This makes this option less relevant to their skepticism.

(C) If the conflict is to be resolved, the Ukrainian authorities must recognize the special status of the two ""Republic"" territories and the Russian language, and pardon all militia armed participants and political prisoners.  
- The observers are questioning whether these specific actions are essential to resolving the conflict. This aligns with skepticism by addressing the necessity of these actions but does not directly refute the observers' comments.

(D) As long as the Ukrainian authorities recognize the special status of the two ""Republic"" territories and the Russian language, and pardon all militia armed participants and political prisoners, the conflict can be resolved.  
- This statement posits certainty that taking these actions will resolve the conflict, which is precisely what the Ukrainian observers are questioning. Thus, their comments are best used to refute this statement since it contradicts the guaranteed success of those actions.

The skepticism of the observers suggests that option D is overly simplistic and unreliable. Therefore, the comments of Ukrainian observers are best used to refute option (D).

(D) People's satisfaction with the pursuit of material life depends only on the level of economic development in the region.","To determine which statement most questions the view that online shopping allows people to satisfy their pursuit of material life regardless of their economic development level, we need to find the option that directly undermines the claim about accessibility and satisfaction through online shopping.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) As online shopping sales increase, related taxes and fees will also increase.
- This statement talks about taxes and fees but does not question the ability of online shopping to satisfy material pursuits, nor does it directly relate to the economic development level.

(B) Even in the era when there is no Internet, people can still buy their favorite products through physical stores.
- This statement highlights how people could access products before the internet. However, it does not question the current capability of online shopping to satisfy material needs across different economic regions.

(C) The display of goods on the Internet cannot fully reflect the real situation.
- This statement criticizes the online shopping experience, suggesting that it might not satisfy material pursuits fully because what is displayed online may not match the real-world product or experience. It questions the efficacy of online shopping in meeting material satisfaction, but it does not necessarily link directly to economic development levels.

(D) People's satisfaction with the pursuit of material life depends only on the level of economic development in the region.
- This statement directly challenges the view by asserting that satisfaction with material pursuits is solely tied to the economic development of an area, suggesting that online shopping cannot overcome or replace regional economic barriers.

Option (D) most directly questions the provided view by implying that economic development, not access to online shopping, determines material satisfaction. Therefore, the most correct answer is:

(A) Unless it is a university teacher, it is impossible to have a doctorate from a prestigious school and have more than one year of research experience in an overseas research institution. (B) In recent years, college teachers have required overseas research experience. (C) Some middle school teachers also have doctorate degrees and overseas research experience. (D) Unless they are PhDs and have more than one year of overseas research experience, they cannot become university teachers.","To logically determine which statement guarantees the correctness of the statement that Wang Gang must be a university teacher because he holds a doctorate from a prestigious school and has over a year of overseas research experience, we must understand what would make Wang Gang exclusively a university teacher based on these qualifications.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Unless it is a university teacher, it is impossible to have a doctorate from a prestigious school and have more than one year of research experience in an overseas research institution.

- This option directly supports the assertion that only university teachers can possess both of these qualifications. Therefore, if someone has these qualifications, they must be a university teacher according to this statement, which directly guarantees the correctness of the original assertion.

(B) In recent years, college teachers have required overseas research experience.

- This statement indicates a requirement for college teachers but does not imply exclusivity. It does not exclude the possibility that others (besides university teachers) meet these criteria. Thus, it does not guarantee the correctness of the original assertion.

(C) Some middle school teachers also have doctorate degrees and overseas research experience.

- This statement provides an example where individuals other than university teachers possess similar qualifications. It does not support Wang Gang being exclusively a university teacher.

(D) Unless they are PhDs and have more than one year of overseas research experience, they cannot become university teachers.

- This statement means a PhD and overseas experience are prerequisites for becoming a university teacher, but it does not indicate exclusivity for university teachers having these qualifications. Others can have them too.

Considering the options, (A) is the correct choice because it establishes the exclusivity of university teachers having both a doctorates from prestigious schools and more than one year of overseas research experience, thus guaranteeing the correctness of the original assertion about Wang Gang. Therefore, the correct answer is:

55,"If Malaysia Airlines ’passenger plane did not malfunction and was not hijacked by terrorist organizations, it must have been shot down by a missile. If the passenger plane is shot down by a missile, it will be discovered by the satellite; if the satellite finds that the passenger plane is shot down by the missile, it will be announced to the media. If you want to get the conclusion that the plane was hijacked by a terrorist organization, which of the following should be added?
(A) The passenger plane was not shot down by the missile. (B) There were no reports of missiles shooting down the passenger plane, and the passenger plane did not malfunction. (C) The passenger plane did not malfunction. (D) The passenger plane malfunctioned and no missiles shot down the passenger plane.","To determine which condition should be added to conclude that the plane was hijacked by a terrorist organization, we need to evaluate the possible scenarios and their outcomes based on the given information.

1. The question states three possible causes for the incident: malfunction, hijacking by a terrorist organization, or being shot down by a missile.

2. If the plane was shot down by a missile, it would be detected by a satellite and reported to the media.

3. To conclude that the plane was hijacked by a terrorist organization, we must eliminate the other two possibilities: malfunction and being shot down by a missile.

Let's analyze the options:

(A) The passenger plane was not shot down by the missile.
- This eliminates the possibility of being shot down by a missile but does not eliminate malfunction as a cause. Therefore, it is insufficient to conclude hijacking.

(B) There were no reports of missiles shooting down the passenger plane, and the passenger plane did not malfunction.
- This eliminates both being shot down by a missile (no reports imply it's unlikely) and malfunction. If both are eliminated, the only remaining possibility is hijacking by a terrorist organization. This is a strong candidate.

(C) The passenger plane did not malfunction.
- This eliminates only malfunction but not the possibility of being shot down by a missile. Therefore, it is insufficient to conclude hijacking.

(D) The passenger plane malfunctioned and no missiles shot down the passenger plane.
- This suggests malfunction as the cause, and therefore it cannot be used to conclude hijacking.

Based on this analysis, option (B) is the most correct as it eliminates both of the other possibilities, leaving hijacking as the only conclusion.

Which of the following can best question the above research conclusions?
(A) Most of the young people who grew up in wealthier families have a negative attitude towards life. (B) In addition to emotions, the degree of specialization and work ability will directly affect the income level. (C) Most young people who are more satisfied with their lives are born in wealthier families, and all have a good professional background. (D) It should compare the occupational distribution of the respondents.","To question the research conclusion that happy people make more money, we need to identify an alternative explanation or a confounding factor that challenges the direct causal relationship between happiness and income.

Let's analyze the given options:

(A) Most of the young people who grew up in wealthier families have a negative attitude towards life.
- This doesn't directly question the correlation between happiness and income but rather suggests an exception within wealthy families, contradicting common assumptions about wealth and happiness.

(B) In addition to emotions, the degree of specialization and work ability will directly affect the income level.
- This option suggests that factors other than happiness, such as skills and work ability, also significantly influence income, which could confuse the causal link between happiness and income. However, this doesn't question the research directly; it only suggests additional contributing factors.

(C) Most young people who are more satisfied with their lives are born in wealthier families, and all have a good professional background.
- This raises the possibility that the observed link between happiness and income is not causal but rather a correlation driven by wealthier family backgrounds and good educational or professional opportunities these individuals have. If happiness correlates with wealth due to family background, the link shown in the study may be due to socioeconomic status rather than happiness itself.

(D) It should compare the occupational distribution of the respondents.
- While this consideration could provide additional insight into the data, it doesn’t directly challenge the conclusion that happiness causes higher income.

Thus, the option that offers a strong basis to question the direct causal link between happiness and income by introducing a potential confounding variable is (C), which suggests that family wealth and professional background could be the real factors influencing the observed outcomes.

(A) All the students who passed the bottom-up exam passed the review, so all the students who passed the review passed. (B) All the students who failed the bottom-up exam did not review well, so the students who did not review well did not pass. (C) All the students who have participated in the bottom-up examination have been carefully prepared. Therefore, the students who have not taken the bottom-up examination have not been carefully prepared.

""All the students in our class have passed the examination. Therefore, none of the students in our class have passed.""

The reasoning here involves an apparent contradiction. The statement starts with ""all have passed"" but concludes with ""none have passed,"" which indicates a logical contradiction. 

Let's analyze the given options to find a similar logic:

(A) ""All the students who passed the bottom-up exam passed the review, so all the students who passed the review passed."" - This doesn't contain a contradiction; it describes a logical flow without contradiction.

(B) ""All the students who failed the bottom-up exam did not review well, so the students who did not review well did not pass."" - This does not contradict itself; it follows a logically consistent pattern.

(C) ""All the students who have participated in the bottom-up examination have been carefully prepared. Therefore, the students who have not taken the bottom-up examination have not been carefully prepared."" - This is not a contradiction but a conditionally derived statement, based on the converse fallacy, but it does not mirror the direct contradiction in the original statement.

(D) ""All heroes can stand the test, so those who cannot stand the test are not heroes."" - This statement does not contain a contradiction; it establishes a conditional logic that is consistent (contraposition).

None of the options represent a direct contradiction as Teacher Zhang's statement does. However, option (C) uses a form of flawed reasoning called the converse fallacy (if A, then B; therefore if not A, then not B), which makes it the most similar in form to the mistaken reasoning pattern, albeit not a perfect match to the direct contradiction.

Therefore, the most fitting option, given the lack of a direct contradiction in the choices, would be option C.

58,"In the past five years, food prices in City W have increased by an average of 25%. At the same time, residents' food purchases accounted for only about 8% of the city's monthly household income. As a result, the average income of households in City W has increased in the past two years. Which of the following is most likely the hypothesis of the above argument?
(A) In the past five years, the living standards of families in City W have generally improved. (B) Over the past five years, the average price of other commodities in City W, except food, has risen by 25%. (C) In the past five years, the amount of food purchased by residents of W has increased by 8%. (D) In the past five years, the amount of food purchased by each household in City W has not changed.","To determine the hypothesis of the argument, we need to identify an assumption that bridges the observed trend of increasing food prices and the claim about the increase in average household income. The argument mentions that despite an increase in food prices by 25%, food purchases account for only about 8% of household income in City W. Further, there is an assumption that the average household income has increased over the past two years.

Let’s consider each option:

(A) In the past five years, the living standards of families in City W have generally improved. 
- This option could be a consequence of increased household income rather than a connecting hypothesis. It does not directly explain how increased income is related to food price or purchase trends.

(B) Over the past five years, the average price of other commodities in City W, except food, has risen by 25%.
- While this option discusses general price increases, it does not tie directly into the explained increase in household income.

(C) In the past five years, the amount of food purchased by residents of W has increased by 8%.
- This option potentially increases food expenditure but still doesn’t directly connect to the increase in overall household income.

(D) In the past five years, the amount of food purchased by each household in City W has not changed.
- This option suggests stability in spending despite food price increases. Assuming household income has generally increased, the stability in food expenditure could imply that household income is indeed rising enough to accommodate rising food prices without reducing the quantity purchased.

Considering these options, (D) provides the most logical hypothesis congruent with the argument. It ties together the stable expenditure on food despite price hikes with the increase in household income.

(D) Mass transit is being developed in the city, which will help overcome congestion.","To determine which option best questions the decision of the city government, we need to identify a potential flaw or oversight in the travel restriction plan.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) There is a large automobile production company in the city, and the order restriction will definitely affect the automobile sales of the enterprise.  
- This option discusses the impact on local businesses and does not directly address the effectiveness of the travel restriction in reducing pollution and traffic congestion.

(B) Private car owners in the city generally have two or more private cars.  
- If many car owners possess multiple vehicles, they could circumvent the odd-even restriction by using a different car each day. This would undermine the objective of reducing congestion and pollution, questioning the effectiveness of the government's decision.

(C) The owners of private cars in the city are generally wealthy, and they do not care about the fines for violations.  
- Wealthy car owners not being concerned about fines could lead to non-compliance with the restrictions. However, enforcement and penalties could be adjusted, so this does not directly question the structure or potential ineffectiveness of the plan as much as option B does.

(D) Mass transit is being developed in the city, which will help overcome congestion.  
- Although developing mass transit could help reduce congestion, this does not question the specific flaw in the travel restrictions. It merely offers an alternative solution.

Option (B) directly questions the effectiveness of the travel restrictions based on how the private car owners' behavior could undermine the initiative. Therefore, the best option that questions the decision of the city government is:

Undergraduates can also go to other schools to study for a master's degree.","To interpret the given assertion correctly, we start by restating it: ""All undergraduates who enter Beijing University for a master's degree without a test have already obtained the recommended qualifications of their schools.""

This statement implies that having the recommended qualifications from their schools is a necessary condition for undergraduates to enter Beijing University for a master's degree without a test.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) ""Undergraduates who do not have the qualifications recommended by their school cannot be exempted from going to Peking University to study for a master's degree.""  
This option essentially states the contrapositive of the original assertion: If undergraduates do not have the recommended qualifications, they cannot be exempted from taking the test for a master's degree at Beijing University. This is logically equivalent to the original assertion.

(B) ""Undergraduates who go to Nanyang University to study for a master's degree without a test may not obtain the recommended qualifications of their schools.""  
This option discusses a completely different scenario involving another university, Nanyang University, and the condition regarding qualifications is unclear. It is not equivalent to the original statement.

(C) ""Undergraduates who have obtained the qualifications recommended by their school may not necessarily be able to enter the university for a master's degree.""  
This option states that having the qualifications doesn't guarantee entry to a university for a master's degree, which might be true but isn't equivalent to the given assertion. It doesn't cover the specifics about entry without a test.

(D) ""In addition to Peking University, undergraduates can also go to other schools to study for a master's degree.""  
This option suggests that there are other pathways or schools available. It doesn't relate directly to the necessary condition of having recommended qualifications for test exemption at Beijing University.

Since option (A) is logically equivalent to the original statement, it means exactly the same thing.

61,"Compared with mineral water, pure water lacks minerals, and some of them are essential for the human body. Therefore, nutrition expert Lao Zhang suggested that those who regularly drink pure water change their habits and drink more mineral water. Which of the following can weaken Lao Zhang ’s suggestion the most?
(A) Most of the nutrients people need are not from drinking water. (B) What the human body needs is not just minerals. (C) Drinking water other than pure water and mineral water. (D) People can get essential minerals from other foods.","To address the question and determine which option most effectively weakens Lao Zhang's suggestion, we'll need to analyze the rationale behind Lao Zhang's advice and how each option relates to that rationale.

Lao Zhang suggests that people should switch from pure water to mineral water due to the lack of essential minerals in pure water. The underlying assumption here is that people need to derive essential minerals from their drinking water.

Let's examine each option:

(A) Most of the nutrients people need are not from drinking water.  
- This option suggests that the primary source of nutrients, including minerals, for people isn't water. It implies that whether water contains minerals or not, it wouldn't significantly affect people's mineral intake because they obtain nutrients primarily from other sources (such as food). This option weakens the argument by questioning the significance of water as a nutrient source.

(B) What the human body needs is not just minerals.  
- While true, this statement doesn't directly address attacking Lao Zhang's suggestion. It comments on the broader need for various nutrients, but it doesn't specifically dispute the need for minerals from drinking preparations.

(C) Drinking water other than pure water and mineral water.  
- This option suggests that people consume other types of water, potentially diluting the focus on the importance of the mineral content in mineral water. However, it doesn't directly argue against the need for minerals from one's primary drinking water source.

(D) People can get essential minerals from other foods.  
- This statement effectively weakens Lao Zhang's suggestion by indicating that people do not need to rely on drinking water for their essential minerals. If essential minerals can be satisfactorily obtained from food, the type of drinking water becomes less critical in terms of mineral content. This directly counters the suggestion to prefer mineral water solely for its mineral benefits.

Upon evaluating all options, (D) directly counters the premise of Lao Zhang's suggestion (the necessity of getting minerals from water) and effectively weakens the advice to switch from pure water to mineral water due to mineral deficiencies.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) The sales volume only partially reflects the popularity of the book.
- This statement directly addresses the core assumption of the argument. It suggests that sales volume might not fully represent how popular a book is, implying that other factors could contribute to popularity, such as reader engagement, library circulation, etc.

(B) Those who purchase technology books are often highly educated.
- This statement, while interesting, doesn't directly refute the connection between sales volume and popularity.

(C) The types of life books far exceed the types of science and technology books.
- This statement suggests that there may be more opportunities for sales in the life books category due to a greater variety, which could skew sales volume figures. However, it doesn't address the assumption that sales equal popularity.

(D) Some books sold may not be read.
- This suggests that not all sales translate to active readership, which can refute the assumption that sales equate to popularity. However, it doesn't address the main point about why life books' higher sales might not mean higher popularity in a direct and comprehensive way.

Among these options, (A) is the most comprehensive in refuting the connection between sales volume and popularity by suggesting that sales volume is not a complete measure of popularity. Therefore, the best refutation is:

However, it doesn't necessarily challenge the link between increased costs and improved medical conditions for ""each of us,"" so it's not the strongest challenge.

(B) Without increasing costs, our health conditions may also improve.  
- This option directly challenges the causal link by suggesting there might be other factors or methods for improving medical conditions that do not require increased costs. This raises a significant question about the validity of the conclusion that increased costs are responsible for improved conditions.

(C) 0% of the state's allocation to the health sector is for infrastructure construction.  
- While this might suggest potential misallocation of funds, it does not directly challenge the link between higher costs and improved medical care conditions.

(D) The cost of care for elderly chronic diseases is very large.  
- Like option (A), this option highlights where costs are directed but does not necessarily break the causal link stated in the conclusion about improved medical conditions resulting from increased costs.

Therefore, the option that most seriously questions the conclusion is (B), because it introduces the idea that medical improvements might occur independently of cost increases.

64,"Five graduate students Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, and Liu graduated from a linguistics major in a college of arts of a university in 2014, and were hired by one of the three employers, Tianshu, Tianji, and Tianxuan, and at least one of them was hired by each unit. name. Known? (1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan. Which of the following may be correct?
(A) Li and Liu were hired by the same unit. (B) Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji. (C) Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan. (D) Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine which possibility could hold true based on those conditions. Let's go through them step by step:

1. **Li was hired by Tianshu.**  
   This information is straightforward.

2. **Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.**  
   Since Li was hired by Tianshu, Zhao could not be hired by Tianshu.

3. **Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.**  
   This means that wherever Zhao goes, Liu goes as well.

4. **If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.**  
   This establishes a condition that, if Zhang is with Tianxuan, Wang must also be with Tianxuan.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) **Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.**  
   Since Li is with Tianshu and we know Liu and Zhao are together, and Zhao cannot be with Tianshu, Liu cannot be with Tianshu. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

(B) **Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.**  
   This is a possible scenario given our deductions. Since Zhao and Liu must be together and cannot be with Tianshu, they could indeed be with Tianji. Wang being with them at Tianji doesn't contradict any given conditions.

(C) **Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.**  
   Since Liu needs to be with Zhao due to condition 3, this statement contradicts condition 3 because Zhao should also be hired wherever Liu is. Hence, this option is incorrect.

(D) **Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.**  
   If Wang is the only one with Tianxuan, it suggests that Zhang is not with Tianxuan, otherwise, Zhang and Wang would both be with Tianxuan according to condition 4. But being the *only* hire at Tianxuan for Wang seems possible, given that Zhao and Liu must be together and cannot be at Tianshu or exclusively at Tianxuan. 

Considering these deductions, the strongest possibility without contradictions to the established rules is option (B).

Which of the following must be correct?
(A) Zhang and Wang were hired by the same unit. (B) Wang and Liu were hired by different units. (C) Tianshu hired at most two people. (D) Tianshu and Tianxuan employ the same number of people.","Let's analyze the information given step-by-step:

1. Li was hired by Tianshu.
   - This means that Li is definitely employed by Tianshu.

2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.
   - Since Li is with Tianshu, Zhao must be hired by either Tianji or Tianxuan.

3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.
   - This implies Liu is hired by the same employer as Zhao. Therefore, if Zhao is with Tianji, then Liu is with Tianji; if Zhao is with Tianxuan, then Liu is with Tianxuan.

4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.
   - This is a conditional statement that links Zhang's employment to Wang's. If Zhang goes to Tianxuan, Wang must also go to Tianxuan.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) Zhang and Wang were hired by the same unit.
   - According to statement 4, if Zhang is with Tianxuan, Wang is also with Tianxuan. But the statements do not provide information about what happens if Zhang is with Tianshu or Tianji. Therefore, this is not necessarily true.

(B) Wang and Liu were hired by different units.
   - We do not have direct information about this. It depends on Zhao's employer since Liu follows Zhao.

(C) Tianshu hired at most two people.
   - Li is known to be with Tianshu. We don't have constraints that prevent additional hires by Tianshu in the data given, thus this statement cannot be claimed as true.

(D) Tianshu and Tianxuan employ the same number of people.
   - There is no evidence or rule to suggest an equal number of hires by Tianshu and Tianxuan, so this cannot be certified as true.

The clues about Zhang, Wang, Zhao, and Liu don't allow us to derive any of these with certainty, except for the conditional relation between Zhang and Wang, which doesn't help pick any option definitively true based solely on the given statements.

Therefore, none of the options are definitively supported by the information presented. But reconsidering options especially in light of possibility versus certainty:

(D) Despite all, option A has a necessary component in Zhang and Wang's hiring in case of Tianxuan, but is not definitively true across all scenarios.

Known? (1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan. Which of the following is correct, you can determine the employer of each graduate?
(A) Li was hired by Tianshu. (B) Zhang was hired by Tianxuan. (C) Zhang was hired by Tianshu. (D) Liu was hired by Tianji.","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Li was hired by Tianshu.** 
   - This is given in statement (1). So, Li = Tianshu.

2. **Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.**
   - Since Li is at Tianshu, Zhao cannot be at Tianshu.

3. **Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.**
   - Zhao's unit is not Tianshu (as established from point 2), so both Liu and Zhao must be at either Tianji or Tianxuan.

4. **If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.**
   - This conditional statement indicates that Zhang and Wang are either both at Tianxuan or neither is at Tianxuan.

Now, let's try to assign positions based on this information:

- We know Li = Tianshu.
- Zhao ≠ Tianshu, and Liu = Zhao's unit, which is either Tianji or Tianxuan.
- From the information in point 4, Zhang could either be at Tianxuan or not. If Zhang = Tianxuan, then Wang = Tianxuan.

However, in the case where neither is at Tianxuan:
- They could be at different units (Zhang = Tianshu, Wang = Tianji) or vice versa (Zhang = Tianji, Wang = Tianshu), but this must still satisfy that there is at least 1 graduate at each unit. 

**Testing a scenario:**

Let's assign:
- Li = Tianshu,
- Zhao and Liu = Tianji (as they must be together and cannot be at Tianshu),
- If Zhang = Tianxuan, then Wang = Tianxuan as per point 4.

Therefore, the distribution could be:
- Tianshu: Li
- Tianxuan: Zhang, Wang
- Tianji: Zhao, Liu

This arrangement satisfies all conditions and has at least one graduate in each unit.

**Given Options:**
- (A) Li was hired by Tianshu. (True)
- (B) Zhang was hired by Tianxuan. (This option aligns with our possible configuration)
- (C) Zhang was hired by Tianshu. (This conflicts with the scenario that maintains all units filled)
- (D) Liu was hired by Tianji. (True, based on the setup)

Since multiple setups can satisfy the conditions, the question is focused on the determinability of the specific setup. We deduced that Zhang could be at Tianxuan, which is a specific verifiable assignment based on the constraints provided. Therefore, the most specific setup consistent with all conditions gives:

(1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan. If Liu was hired by Tianxuan, which of the following must be wrong?
(A) Tianxuan hired 3 people. (B) Li's employer only hired him. (C) Wang was hired by Tianxuan. (D) Zhang was hired by Tianxuan.","To address the problem, we need to piece together the information provided:

1. Li was hired by Tianshu.
2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. Thus, Zhao cannot be in Tianshu.
3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. This means if Zhao is not in Tianshu, Liu also cannot be in Tianshu.
4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan as well.

Given the case where Liu was hired by Tianxuan:

- From (3), Zhao must also be hired by Tianxuan since Liu and Zhao are in the same unit.
- In accordance with (2), since Zhao is not hired by Tianshu, our earlier decision is consistent.
- From (4), if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang must also be hired by Tianxuan. Therefore, if both Zhang and Wang were hired by Tianxuan, it implies that Tianxuan hired 4 people (Zhao, Liu, Zhang, and Wang).
- Remember that each unit hired at least one person. With Li being hired by Tianshu, there should also be individuals hired by Tianji.

Reviewing the options given:

(A) If Tianxuan hired 3 people, it can be subjective depending on whether Zhang or Wang also went to the same unit.
(B) If Li's employer only hired him, this could potentially make sense if all other students (Zhang, Zhao, Liu, Wang) were hired by other employers. Since we must have people in Tianji, it's feasible but not necessary.
(C) Wang was hired by Tianxuan. If Liu is in Tianxuan and they must be in the same team, Wang doesn't necessarily need to be there.
(D) Zhang was hired by Tianxuan. We already know if Liu is in Tianxuan and the scenario allows it, this doesn't necessarily have to be the case.

Having understood that Tianxuan hiring 4 seems necessary for it not to conflict with the rules and that (C) disrupts such balance as Liu must match with Zhao elsewhere, the statement that must be false is:

(A) Some activities organized by the community do not involve the elderly in the community. (B) Some elderly people in the community do not participate in any activities organized by the community. (C) Any activity organized by a community will involve the elderly in the community. (D) Middle-aged people in the community also participated in community-organized activities.","To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and analyze each option carefully:

1. **Understanding the Information:**
   - There are two types of community activities: health care and leisure.
   - All elderly in the community have participated in all health-related activities.
   - Some elderly have participated in all leisure-type activities.

2. **Breaking Down the Option Choices:**

   - **(A) Some activities organized by the community do not involve the elderly in the community.**
     - Based on the question, it states that all health-related activities involve all the elderly, and some leisure-related activities have all elderly. Therefore, this statement is false because all health-related activities do involve all elderly.

   - **(B) Some elderly people in the community do not participate in any activities organized by the community.**
     - This contradicts the information, as it is given that all elderly have participated in all health care activities. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

   - **(C) Any activity organized by a community will involve the elderly in the community.**
     - This is supported partially by the fact that all elderly participate in all health-related activities. However, not every leisure activity involves all elderly (only some do), so this is not necessarily true for leisure activities. The statement is not consistent with partial coverage in leisure activities.

   - **(D) Middle-aged people in the community also participated in community-organized activities.**
     - The information does not provide any details about middle-aged people, so we cannot deduce anything about the participation of middle-aged individuals solely from the information given.

3. **Conclusion:**

Given the above analysis, none of the statements **must be true** based solely on the given information. However, analyzing the statements more careful regarding what's definitely true or cannot be true — Options (B) and (A) can be easily eliminated. Option (D) lacks relevant information about middle-aged individuals. The focus is primarily on the involvement of elderly, and the premises ensure participation in healthcare. Thus option (C) would cover the inclusion where applicable which would be health-focused parameters, though it slightly stretches leisure. In a logical strict sense, none feel completely necessarily true but based on the processed facts, **C** makes most contextual sense in typical interpretations.

69,"A national academic conference held by a society receives nearly 1,000 conference papers each time. In order to ensure the quality of the conference communication papers, the academic conference organizing committee decided to select only 10% of the papers from the conference papers as conference communication papers each time. The decision of the academic conference organizing committee is most likely based on which of the following assumptions?
(A) There is always a certain percentage of paper quality in every conference paper submitted. (B) The number of conference papers received each time in the future will not change significantly. (C) 0% of conference papers do not meet the quality of conference papers. (D) The academic conference organizing committee can make accurate judgments on the quality of the paper.","To determine the most likely assumption made by the academic conference organizing committee, we need to consider the implications and reasoning behind the decision to select only 10% of the submitted papers as conference communication papers.

Option (A) ""There is always a certain percentage of paper quality in every conference paper submitted"": This assumption suggests that the committee expects a relatively consistent percentage of high-quality papers among the submissions. However, this assumption does not directly explain why only 10% are selected as it addresses more about the consistency of quality rather than the evaluation process.

Option (B) ""The number of conference papers received each time in the future will not change significantly"": This assumption is about the quantity of submissions rather than the quality. While a stable number of submissions might impact logistics and evaluation processes, it doesn't directly relate to the decision to restrict communication papers to 10% of submissions.

Option (C) ""0% of conference papers do not meet the quality of conference papers"": This suggests that every paper meets at least the baseline quality for consideration, but it doesn't explain the rationale for only selecting 10% of them as communication papers. In fact, if 0% of papers failed to meet quality standards, a higher selection percentage would be more reasonable.

Option (D) ""The academic conference organizing committee can make accurate judgments on the quality of the paper"": This is a critical assumption because the decision to select only 10% of papers implies that the committee is confident in their ability to accurately assess the quality of each submission. This would ensure that the selected papers indeed reflect the top 10% in terms of quality and relevance.

Given the goal of ensuring high-quality communication at the conference, option (D) is the most pertinent assumption. It addresses the key requirement for the committee to effectively evaluate and select the best papers to fulfill that objective.

(A) Although some people agree with his views, they do not agree with his analysis. 
- This point doesn't directly contradict the blogger's statement that 85% of posts agree with him, as it focuses on agreement with the analysis rather than the views.

(B) The blogger's other articles with higher approval ratings later proved to be wrong.
- This option suggests that previous approval does not necessarily correlate with accuracy, but it doesn't directly address the number or representativity of people agreeing in this context.

(C) Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified.
- While this implies that the objections might have more valid points, it does not directly refute the proportion of people agreeing.

(D) Most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans.
- This suggestion directly questions the representativity of the agreeing posts. If most followers are loyal fans, their agreement might not reflect the overall opinion of a larger, unbiased population. Therefore, the proportion of agreeing posts cannot be taken as a representative sample of the wider opinion.

Option D challenges the blogger's conclusion by questioning the generalization from the blogger's followers to the broader populace, making this option the best choice.

71,"In judicial trials, the so-called affirmative misjudgment refers to convicting an innocent person as guilty, referred to as misjudgment? negative misjudgment refers to convicting a guilty person as innocent, referred to as misplacement. The fundamental principle of judicial justice is ""to not let a bad person go, not to injustice a good person"".

Which of the following can most strongly support the views of the above jurists?
(A) The accuracy of handling cases in various courts has improved significantly. (B) The negative misjudgment rate of each court is basically the same. (C) Wrong judgment rather than misplacement is a reflection of the ""left"" thinking in the judiciary. (D) Most of the losses caused by misplacement are remedyable; the damage caused by the misjudgment to the victim is irreparable.","To support the jurist's view that the rate of positive misjudgments (convicting an innocent person as guilty) is a key measure of how well principles of judicial justice are implemented, we should look for an option that emphasizes the irreversible harm or the significant impact of positive misjudgments compared to negative misjudgments (acquitting a guilty person).

Let's analyze each option:

(A) The accuracy of handling cases in various courts has improved significantly.  
This option talks about overall improvements in case handling but does not specifically address the issue of positive versus negative misjudgments or their impact. Therefore, it does not strongly support the jurist's specific view.

(B) The negative misjudgment rate of each court is basically the same.  
This option discusses the rate of negative misjudgments but does not compare or relate it to the rate of positive misjudgments, nor does it address their respective impacts on justice principles. Thus, it does not strongly support the jurist's view.

(C) Wrong judgment rather than misplacement is a reflection of the ""left"" thinking in the judiciary.  
This option suggests that a specific type of misjudgment reflects a particular ideological influence but it does not directly support the notion that positive misjudgments are a more critical measure of judicial justice implementation.

(D) Most of the losses caused by misplacement are remedyable; the damage caused by the misjudgment to the victim is irreparable.  
This option directly addresses the differential impact of the two types of misjudgments. It claims that positive misjudgments cause irreparable harm, which supports the jurist's view that minimizing positive misjudgments is crucial as they inflict greater damage and, thus, should be given higher importance in assessing judicial justice.

Therefore, the option that most strongly supports the jurist's view is (D).

The argument further concludes that for a society to progress to a stage where no one is deceived, greed must be entirely eliminated in that society.

To support this argument, the correct choice needs to establish a link between societal progress and the elimination of greed. Let's analyze each option:

(A) The greater the greed, the easier it is to be deceived.

- This statement supports the idea that greed is a major factor in getting deceived, but it doesn't directly relate to how societal progress can eliminate greed.

(B) The society has improved, and the scammers will no longer exist.

- This statement suggests that societal improvement can eliminate scammers but does not address the necessity of eliminating greed for stopping deception.

(C) With the progress of society, the quality of people will generally improve, and greed will gradually be eliminated.

- This statement supports the argument well as it connects societal progression (improvement in the quality of people) with the gradual elimination of greed, thus aligning with the conclusion that no deception implies no greed.

(D) No matter in what society, scammers always exist.

- This statement contradicts the idea that societal progress can lead to a situation where no one is deceived if it implies that scammers can't be completely eradicated.

1. **Prediction I**: The first place is either A or B.
   - If this is true, it means the first place is A or B. 

2. **Prediction II**: If C is not first, then D is not first.
   - If this is true, and if C is not first, then D cannot be first. Therefore, B must be first (since A is ruled out by Prediction III).

3. **Prediction III**: A is not the first.
   - If this is true, then the first place is either B, C, or D.

Now, we need to consider the condition that only one of these predictions is correct.

- **Suppose Prediction I is true:** If only Prediction I is true, then the first place must be A or B. But this would mean Prediction III is also correct (since A is not the first), which violates the condition that only one prediction is correct. This scenario leads to a contradiction when assuming Prediction I is the only true statement.

- **Suppose Prediction II is true:** If only Prediction II is true, then C must be first because if C is not first, then D cannot be first, which implies B must be first, contradicting the condition that only Prediction II is true.

- **Suppose Prediction III is true:** If only Prediction III is true, then A cannot be first, leaving B, C, or D as possibilities for first. However, only D fits because if C were first, it wouldn't violate Prediction II, which would also be valid, contradicting the rule that only one can be true.

Therefore, if Prediction II is the only true one, then C has to be the first to avoid making other predictions true, leading to a single valid statement. This analysis suggests C should be first.

We are asked to find a similar argument structure among the answer options. Let's examine each option:

(A) It is wrong to say that Alexander is a Plato student. In fact, Alexander was a student of Aristotle, and Aristotle was a student of Plato. 
- This option presents a lineage of students, but it does not follow the structure of X causing Y, and Y causing Z. It is more about relationships and is not similar in structure.

(B) It is true that excessive fertilization is the main cause of lawn diseases and insect pests. Because excessive fertilization can cause the grass to grow madly, and the grass that grows madly has little resistance to diseases and insect pests.
- This option follows a similar structure: excessive fertilization (X) causes grass to grow madly (Y), and grass that grows madly has little resistance to diseases and insect pests (Z). However, it argues the statement as true, not as a refutation.

(C) It is wrong for people who frequently participate in strenuous exercise to cause sudden death. Because the violent cause is cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and vigorous exercise does not necessarily cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
- This option suggests that strenuous exercise (X) is not a direct cause of sudden death (Z) because it doesn't necessarily cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (Y), differing from the required pattern.

(D) It is wrong to say that inferior gasoline will not cause abnormal fuel consumption. Because inferior gasoline can cause very normal aging of engine valves, and abnormal aging of engine valves can cause abnormal fuel consumption.
- This option matches the structure: inferior gasoline (X) causes abnormal aging of engine valves (Y), and abnormal aging of engine valves causes abnormal fuel consumption (Z). This refutes the initial claim in a way that mirrors the original argument.

After evaluating all options, option (D) has the most similar argument structure to the original argument.

(D) Dortmund top scorer Lewandowski successfully transferred to Bayern Munich.","To evaluate which statement cannot be true given the conditions of the football player transfer market, let's analyze each option in detail:

1. **Option (A):** Veteran Klose broke the 15-ball World Cup goal record with 16 goals but still did not win the favor of many clubs.
   - According to the statement, players must perform well in both the World Cup and their club to be favored by many clubs. If Klose performed well in the World Cup but still wasn't favored, the implied reason must be a lack of performance at the club level. This scenario does align with the premise since both conditions (World Cup and club performance) must be met to attract attention. Thus, this option can be true.

2. **Option (B):** J. Ronaldo won the World Cup Golden Boots and performed excellently at the club, leading to being chased by many clubs and transferring to Real Madrid.
   - This aligns perfectly with the premise: J. Ronaldo performed well in both arenas and thus was favored by many clubs. This statement is likely true given the stated conditions.

3. **Option (C):** Royce failed to participate in the World Cup but performed excellently at his club and was favored by top clubs.
   - The statement explicitly says that a player must perform well both at the World Cup and at the club to be favored by many clubs. Since Royce did not participate in the World Cup, he does not meet both criteria, making it impossible for him to be favored as per the given criteria. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

4. **Option (D):** Dortmund top scorer Lewandowski successfully transferred to Bayern Munich.
   - While this statement is plausible, nothing in the statement prescribes conditions solely about club performance or mentions specific transfers. Without World Cup performance information, this does not directly negate the premises, as the main point is about being chased by many clubs, which is absent in this statement.

Therefore, the statement that cannot be true given the premises is Option C, as it violates the requirement for excellent performance in both the World Cup and club settings to be favored.

""Daejeon is The returnee who has obtained a master's degree in the UK has not yet found a job. Which of the following conclusions can be made based on the above discussion?
(A) Datian has real talent and basic social skills, but the positioning is not accurate. (B) Datian either does not have real talent, or lacks basic social skills, or fails to accurately locate in the career selection process. (C) Datian does not possess real knowledge and basic social skills, but the positioning is accurate. (D) Datian does not have real knowledge and basic social skills, and does not have an accurate positioning.","To address the problem, we first need to understand what is stated in the discussion:

1. The statement asserts that a returnee with an overseas degree who possesses real knowledge, basic social skills, and accurate career positioning cannot be a ""sea waiter"" - someone struggling to find a job.

2. Datian is a returnee with a master's degree from the UK who has not yet found a job.

Based on the first statement, if someone is struggling to find a job (a ""sea waiter""), it must mean that they lack at least one of the three qualities: real knowledge, basic social skills, or accurate career positioning.

Now, considering Datian's situation, since he is described as a ""sea waiter,"" we can conclude that Datian either:

- Does not have real knowledge,
- Lacks basic social skills,
- Or has not accurately positioned himself in the career selection process.

This reasoning aligns with option (B): Datian either does not have real talent, or lacks basic social skills, or fails to accurately locate in the career selection process.

Options (A), (C), and (D) do not support this conclusion as well as option (B). Therefore, the most correct answer is:

77,"Some college teachers have overseas doctorates, so some overseas doctors have a high level. Which of the following can guarantee the correctness of the above statement?
(A) All college teachers have a very high level. (B) Not all college teachers have a high level. (C) Some college teachers have a very high level. (D) All high-level teachers have overseas doctorate degrees.","To evaluate the given statement ""Some college teachers have overseas doctorates, so some overseas doctors have a high level,"" let's analyze what each option implies and if it can guarantee the statement's correctness.

1. **(A) All college teachers have a very high level.**
   - This statement suggests that every college teacher, regardless of their degree origin, is of a very high level. However, it doesn't directly link overseas doctorates specifically to having a high level, so it doesn't guarantee the correctness of the original statement.

2. **(B) Not all college teachers have a high level.**
   - This indicates variability in the level of college teachers, which doesn't help in ensuring that those with overseas doctorates are of a high level. Again, it's insufficient to confirm the original statement.

3. **(C) Some college teachers have a very high level.**
   - This directly aligns with the conclusion that some overseas doctorate holders, who are college teachers, possess a high level. If some college teachers (who are part of the group of overseas doctorates) have a very high level, it implies that some overseas doctorate holders have a high level, aligning with the statement's conclusion.

4. **(D) All high-level teachers have overseas doctorate degrees.**
   - This statement specifies that being high-level is exclusive to those with overseas doctorates, but it doesn't address variability or guarantee that the statement ""some college teachers have overseas doctorates, so some overseas doctors have a high level"" is inherently correct since it could mean that only high-level individuals have overseas doctorates, not some.

Thus, the option that logically supports and strengthens the original statement by directly confirming that there are college teachers (some of whom are overseas doctorate holders) who have a high level is (C).

78,"There are only two secondary schools in Nankou Township. The results of the first middle school students are generally better than those of the second middle school. Since Li Ming from Nankou Town has the best grades in the first year of college, he must have graduated from Nankou Town No.1 Middle School. Which of the following is most similar to the question-making argument?
(A) If the parent has a good education for the child, the child's performance in the school is generally better. Because Wang Zheng's performance in the school is not good, his parents must be poorly educated. (B) If the child recites the poem for 1 hour every day, it will be exported into chapters. Guo Na recites the poems for less than an hour every day, so she cannot export to chapters. (C) If people know how to make money, they can generally accumulate more wealth. Therefore, Mr. Peng's wealth comes from his resourcefulness. (D) Northerners are usually taller than southerners. Marin is the highest in the class, so he must be a northerner.","To determine which argument is most similar to the original argument, we should identify the structure of the original argument:

1. Generalization: The students at Nankou Town No.1 Middle School generally perform better than those at the second middle school.
2. Specific instance: Li Ming, a student from Nankou Town, has the best grades in college.
3. Conclusion: Li Ming must have graduated from Nankou Town No.1 Middle School based on the generalization.

This reasoning follows a pattern of using a generalization to make a conclusion about a specific case based on the premise that the specific case fits within the general trend.

Let's analyze the options to identify which follows a similar pattern:

(A) If the parent has a good education for the child, the child's performance in the school is generally better. Because Wang Zheng's performance in the school is not good, his parents must be poorly educated.
- This argument uses a generalization about parental education and student performance to draw a conclusion about a specific student's parents, but it does so by using the inverse of the generalization. This differs slightly from the structure we're looking for.

(B) If the child recites the poem for 1 hour every day, it will be exported into chapters. Guo Na recites the poems for less than an hour every day, so she cannot export to chapters.
- This argument uses a general statement about the outcome of reciting poems for an hour to draw a conclusion about a case that does not fit the premise. It does not follow the same structure because it does not take a positive generalization and apply it to a positive specific instance.

(C) If people know how to make money, they can generally accumulate more wealth. Therefore, Mr. Peng's wealth comes from his resourcefulness.
- This argument uses a generalization to claim a specific cause for a result, but it does not parallel the original argument that bases an institutional origin on performance.

(D) Northerners are usually taller than southerners. Marin is the highest in the class, so he must be a northerner.
- This argument exactly parallels the original argument by using a generalization about height based on geographic origin to conclude the specific geographic origin of Marin based on their height. It follows the pattern of generalization leading to a specific conclusion just as the original argument does.

Therefore, the argument that is most similar in structure to the original is option D.

79,"There are more and more Chinese computer software that can correct vocabulary, grammar and punctuation are used incorrectly. Even if journalists do not have a good Chinese language foundation, they will not hinder writing. Therefore, schools that train journalists do not need to pay attention to the improvement of students 'Chinese ability, but should pay attention to the training of journalists' other qualities. Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the above arguments and suggestions?
(A) Avoiding errors in vocabulary, grammar, and punctuation does not necessarily ensure the language quality of the manuscript. (B) Journalism courses have always emphasized and required students to be proficient in using computers and familiar with various software. (C) The more effective the Chinese software is, the more likely it is to be pirated. (D) Opening a new course at the School of Journalism requires a complicated process of argumentation and approval.","To determine which statement would most weaken the argument that schools should not focus on improving the Chinese language abilities of journalism students, we must look at the underlying logic of the argument provided in the question. The question suggests that the availability of software that corrects vocabulary, grammar, and punctuation diminishes the necessity for journalists to have a strong foundation in the Chinese language. Thus, the schools should focus on other qualities.

Let's analyze each option to find one that undermines this argument:

(A) Avoiding errors in vocabulary, grammar, and punctuation does not necessarily ensure the language quality of the manuscript.  
This option directly challenges the argument's assumption that software is sufficient for maintaining language quality. If the language quality involves more than just avoiding basic errors, then students still need a good foundation in Chinese, which would weaken the argument.

(B) Journalism courses have always emphasized and required students to be proficient in using computers and familiar with various software.  
This option does not directly address the need for a strong Chinese language foundation. It merely states that proficiency in software is already emphasized in journalism courses, which does not affect the argument about whether Chinese language skills are important.

(C) The more effective the Chinese software is, the more likely it is to be pirated.  
This option speaks to intellectual property issues, not to the language skills of students. It doesn't weaken the suggestion that language improvement through traditional methods can be ignored.

(D) Opening a new course at the School of Journalism requires a complicated process of argumentation and approval.  
This option discusses logistical challenges in opening new courses but does not address the core argument about the necessity of improving language skills.

Among these options, (A) most effectively questions the premise that software corrections ensure high-quality journalism, thus undermining the suggestion that focus on language skills can be abandoned.

80,"It is generally believed that left-handers are more prone to operating accidents than right-handers. This is a misunderstanding. In fact, most housework accidents range from fires, burns, and small finger cuts to right-handers. Which of the following most appropriately summarizes the loopholes in the above argument?
(A) Make a substantive distinction between two types of phenomena that have no substantive difference. (B) Make an analogy between two types of objects that are not comparable. (C) The proportion of housework accidents in the whole operation accidents is not considered. (D) Not taking into account the proportion of left-handers among all people.","To analyze the argument presented, let's break it down:

1. **Claim**: It is generally believed that left-handers are more prone to operating accidents than right-handers. 
2. **Counterclaim**: This is a misunderstanding because most housework accidents (which range from fires, burns, to small finger cuts) happen to right-handers.

**Key Point**: The counterclaim is focusing specifically on housework accidents involving right-handers, but the original claim is about operating accidents in general.

**Loophole**: The argument doesn't account for the fact that the original claim is about all operating accidents, not just housework accidents. In order to accurately address the claim that left-handers are more prone to operating accidents, the argument should consider the overall proportion of left-handers in all types of operating accidents, not just those occurring during housework.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) **Make a substantive distinction between two types of phenomena that have no substantive difference**.  
- The argument is not necessarily making an irrelevant distinction; it's failing to address the broader category of operating accidents.

(B) **Make an analogy between two types of objects that are not comparable**.  
- The argument doesn't really use an analogy, so this choice doesn't fit.

(C) **The proportion of housework accidents in the whole operation accidents is not considered**.  
- This suggests that the argument fails to consider how representative housework accidents are of all operating accidents, which is close but not quite the central oversight.

(D) **Not taking into account the proportion of left-handers among all people**.  
- This selection points out that the argument does not mention the general population proportion of left-handers, which could affect the frequency of accidents among left-handers.

While (C) highlights the oversight of not considering all types of operating accidents, (D) more accurately identifies the problem with failing to compare the population proportion, thus providing a more comprehensive critique of the argument's failure to properly address the initial belief about left-handers.

81,"The raw material of cement is very cheap, like limestone and mud everywhere can be used as raw material of cement. However, the price of cement will be influenced by the price of oil, because it takes a lot of energy to convert raw materials from Pakistan to cement in high-temperature furnaces. Based on the above conclusions, which of the following conclusions is most likely to be drawn?
(A) Petroleum is one of the raw materials contained in cement. (B) Petroleum is the energy source of some high-temperature furnaces for making cement. (C) The price of cement falls as the price of oil rises. (D) The higher the price of cement, the higher the price of limestone.","To tackle this question, let's break down the given information:

1. Cement is made from cheap raw materials like limestone and mud.
2. The price of cement is influenced by the price of oil.
3. High-temperature furnaces, which are necessary to convert raw materials into cement, require a lot of energy.

Now let's evaluate each of the options based on the information provided:

(A) Petroleum is one of the raw materials contained in cement.
- This is incorrect. The raw materials for cement are limestone and mud, not petroleum.

(B) Petroleum is the energy source of some high-temperature furnaces for making cement.
- The statement suggests that petroleum (or oil) is related to energy usage, which is tied to the operation of high-temperature furnaces. This option is plausible because the price of cement is affected by the price of oil, presumably due to energy costs associated with production.

(C) The price of cement falls as the price of oil rises.
- This is the opposite of what we would expect; if oil is the energy source for the furnaces, then the price of cement would likely rise as the price of oil rises due to increased production costs.

(D) The higher the price of cement, the higher the price of limestone.
- Although limestone is a raw material for cement, the passage does not relate limestone prices to cement prices. Rather, the oil price influences cement price, likely related to energy/production costs.

Based on the analysis, option (B) is the logical conclusion since the energy source (likely oil) for the furnaces affects the price of cement. Therefore, the answer is:

82,"Ms. Zheng? Hengyuan ’s GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate over the past decade is higher than that of Yiyang, so Hengyuan ’s economic prospects are better than Yiyang. Mr. Hu? I disagree with you. Although the GDP growth rate of Hengyuan City is higher than that of the Yiyang market, the GDP of Yiyang City is larger. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the controversial focus of Ms. Zheng and Mr. Hu?
(A) Is the GDP of Yiyang City greater than that of Hengyuan City? (B) Is the GDP growth rate of Hengyuan City really higher than that of Angyang City? (C) A city's GDP has a large value, is the economic outlook necessarily good? (D) A city's GDP growth rate is high, is the economic outlook necessarily good?","To determine the focus of the controversy between Ms. Zheng and Mr. Hu, let's analyze their arguments:

1. **Ms. Zheng's Argument**: She states that Hengyuan's GDP growth rate is higher than that of Yiyang, therefore implying that Hengyuan's economic prospects are better.

2. **Mr. Hu's Argument**: He disagrees, pointing out that although Hengyuan's GDP growth rate is higher, the overall GDP of Yiyang is larger.

The controversy here lies in what each person considers to be a better indicator of a city's economic prospects. Ms. Zheng seems to focus on the GDP growth rate as a key indicator of future economic prospects, while Mr. Hu emphasizes the current size of the GDP as being important.

Considering the available answer options:

- (A) ""Is the GDP of Yiyang City greater than that of Hengyuan City?"" - This fact is already agreed upon by Mr. Hu and does not directly relate to the core disagreement about economic prospects.
  
- (B) ""Is the GDP growth rate of Hengyuan City really higher than that of Angyang City?"" - This is not the focus of their disagreement, as both seem to agree on the growth rate comparison.
  
- (C) ""A city's GDP has a large value, is the economic outlook necessarily good?"" - This seems to align partly with Mr. Hu's perspective, but not directly with the focus of Ms. Zheng's argument.
  
- (D) ""A city's GDP growth rate is high, is the economic outlook necessarily good?"" - This option directly addresses the aspect of Ms. Zheng's argument where the growth rate is linked to economic prospects, while Mr. Hu challenges the sufficiency of this correlation as predictive of economic outlook.

The contentious issue is essentially around whether the growth rate or the absolute GDP better indicates economic prospects, making option (D) the best summary of their disagreement.

(A) Eating large amounts of beef jerky is not conducive to arterial health. (B) Arterial health is not equal to physical health. (C) Meat contains substances harmful to the human body. (D) People who like to eat beef jerky often like to eat other foods that are harmful to arterial health.","To evaluate the given argument, we need to analyze its structure. The primary claim is that people can consume beef jerky without health concerns about arterial hardening based on clinical trials indicating that additives in most brands of beef jerky do not cause arterial hardening in occasional consumers.

Now, we need to determine which statement, if true, would most weaken the argument:

(A) Eating large amounts of beef jerky is not conducive to arterial health: This choice suggests that consuming beef jerky in large quantities could affect arterial health. However, the argument specifically addresses occasional consumption, so while this choice may highlight a limitation, it doesn't directly attack the primary claim about occasional consumption.

(B) Arterial health is not equal to physical health: This option points out that the argument only considers arterial health, not overall health. This does highlight a limitation of the argument's scope but doesn't directly challenge the claim regarding arterial health.

(C) Meat contains substances harmful to the human body: This statement generalizes about meat, not specifically beef jerky or its additives. It doesn't directly weaken the claim about beef jerky additives and their effects on arterial health in occasional consumers.

(D) People who like to eat beef jerky often like to eat other foods that are harmful to arterial health: This option introduces the idea that individuals who consume beef jerky might also consume other harmful foods, affecting their arterial health. If true, this indirect influence could confound the results regarding the safety of eating beef jerky. This offers an alternative explanation for the health observations and thus undermines the claim by introducing a possibility of confounding factors in the clinical trial results.

Among these options, the one that most directly challenges the argument's conclusion about people being able to eat beef jerky without worrying about arterial health effects is:

The Peace Foundation concluded that as long as the S Institute kept its promise not to use Peace Foundation funds for weapons research, then weapons research would not benefit from those funds. However, the Peace Foundation has failed to consider the possibility that by funding non-weapon-related research, the S Institute might reallocate other funds towards weapons research. This would mean that the Peace Foundation's funding indirectly supports weapons research by freeing up other funds that the S Institute could then divert to such projects.

This is precisely what option (C) addresses: Ignored this possibility? the funding of the Peace Foundation enabled S Research to have all the ability to switch other funds to weapons research.

Option (C) points out that the S Institute could use the Peace Foundation’s funding to cover non-weapons projects, allowing funds from other sources to be redirected towards weapons research, which is a reasonable loophole to highlight.

Therefore, the most appropriate summary of the loophole in the Peace Foundation's conclusion is captured by option (C).

(A) The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines. (B) Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility. (C) The above-mentioned advertisers who refused to renew their contracts mainly promoted household goods. (D) The advertising cost of the purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change.","To evaluate the given argument and assess which option does not weaken it, we need to understand the core claim. The argument suggests that some advertisers prioritize ethical responsibility over economic benefits, as evidenced by their refusal to renew contracts with the magazine once it started publishing violent and pornographic content.

Let's examine each option to determine its impact on weakening the argument:

(A) The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines.
- This option suggests that Purgatory magazine's content was not as extreme relative to others. It could indicate that advertisers had economic reasons to leave since similar magazines might have been equally successful and more acceptable. This option potentially weakens the argument because it questions the ethical stance by showing alternative economic motivations.

(B) Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.
- This implies that departing advertisers might have left due to concerns about credibility rather than ethical issues. If low credibility harms the image of the advertisers, their departure may still be financially motivated, which weakens the argument about prioritizing ethics.

(C) The above-mentioned advertisers who refused to renew their contracts mainly promoted household goods.
- This option suggests that advertisers selling household goods might not want to be associated with violent and pornographic content due to brand alignment, which could be viewed as a business decision rather than an ethical one. This weakens the argument.

(D) The advertising cost of the purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change.
- This option indicates that the increased cost of advertising might have been a significant factor in the advertisers' decision not to renew. However, it does not address the content or ethics directly. Instead, it provides an economic rationale for switching, which could weaken the original ethical argument.

The option that least weakens the argument is (C), as it still allows room for ethical considerations to be a factor due to brand alignment issues. Meanwhile, the other options offer specific financial or practical reasons that can overshadow ethical motivations.

The argument hinges on the notion that advertisers chose to discontinue their contracts with ""Inferno"" due to ethical considerations rather than purely economic factors.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) The cost and selling price of ""Inferno"" are lower than that of ""Harbour"".

This option gives information about pricing but doesn’t directly address the ethical considerations involved in the decision to stop advertising with ""Inferno"". It doesn't strengthen the argument related to ethical responsibility.

(B) The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.

If advertisers maintained their economic benefits despite switching, it could imply that they switched for reasons beyond profit, like ethical considerations. This somewhat supports the argument but doesn't establish ethical responsibility as the primary motive.

(C) Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.

This supports the claim that switching might not be economically disadvantageous, but it doesn’t directly relate to advertisers making decisions based on ethics. It is more about reader preferences rather than advertiser responsibility.

(D) Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to ""Inferno"" magazine.

This option weakens the argument by showing that there are advertisers willing to associate with ""Inferno"", which suggests that not all advertisers share the same ethical concerns. It does not contribute to strengthening the original argument.

Thus, the option that most directly supports the notion that advertisers considered ethical responsibilities (while maintaining their economic benefits) by refusing to advertise with ""Inferno"" would be (B). It suggests that advertisers were not solely motivated by financial concerns, as they did not experience negative economic impacts after switching, thereby highlighting ethical considerations in their decision-making process.

(A) Last year, H ’s financial investment to protect the equatorial rainforest was significantly lower than in previous years. (B) The area of ​​the equatorial rainforest in country G, which is adjacent to country H, has not decreased. (C) Last year's dry season in Country H saw unusually large and continuous rainfall. (D) The cost of rainforest protection in country H only accounts for a small percentage of annual fiscal expenditure.","To determine which option most weakens the government's conclusion that their efforts to protect the equatorial rainforest have achieved remarkable results, we need to identify an alternative explanation for the decreased rate of deforestation.

The government's claim is that their spending on stopping deforestation and forest fires directly led to the reduction in the loss of rainforest area. Therefore, any alternative explanation weakening this claim would undermine the connection between the government's efforts and the outcome.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) Last year, H’s financial investment to protect the equatorial rainforest was significantly lower than in previous years.
- This suggests that the reduced rate of deforestation was not due to increased financial efforts by the government, thus weakening the conclusion. However, it does not provide an alternative reason for the reduced loss.

(B) The area of ​​the equatorial rainforest in country G, which is adjacent to country H, has not decreased.
- This statement doesn't directly relate to the efforts of country H and doesn't suggest an alternative reason for the change in country H itself, so it doesn't weaken the conclusion.

(C) Last year's dry season in Country H saw unusually large and continuous rainfall.
- This provides an alternative explanation for the reduced deforestation rates, namely that the weather conditions naturally prevented deforestation and forest fires. This significantly weakens the government's claim that their actions were the primary reason for the reduction.

(D) The cost of rainforest protection in country H only accounts for a small percentage of annual fiscal expenditure.
- While this might suggest limited prioritization, it doesn't directly provide an alternative reason for the reduced rate of deforestation. It doesn't necessarily weaken the conclusion that the efforts had remarkable results.

Thus, the option that most weakens the government's conclusion is (C), as it offers an alternative explanation through natural weather conditions rather than governmental action.

88,"According to a psychological theory, to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with those around him. However, the great painters in the world often spend most of their time in loneliness and have no intimate relationships. Therefore, the above argument of this psychological theory is untenable. Which of the following is most likely assumed by the above argument?
(A) The psychological theory is to reveal the relationship between inner experience and artistic achievement. (B) People with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness. (C) Loneliness is necessary for great painting artists. (D) Artists who have achieved great achievements cannot be unhappy.","To analyze the argument provided in the question, let's break it down step by step:

1. The psychological theory states that to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with those around them.
2. However, the argument presents a counterexample with great painters, who often spend most of their time in loneliness and without intimate relationships, suggesting that they can still be happy or fulfilled despite contradicting the psychological theory.
3. Therefore, the argument concludes that the psychological theory is untenable based on the existence of these great painters who lack intimate relationships.

Now, let's evaluate the assumptions that could potentially support this argument:

- Option (A) suggests that the psychological theory is related to the relationship between inner experience and artistic achievement. This does not directly relate to the argument's premises or conclusion about happiness and intimate relationships, so this is unlikely to be the assumption.
  
- Option (B) states that people with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness. This idea could support the argument as it highlights the contrast between needing intimate relationships to be happy (as per the psychological theory) and the chosen lifestyle of great painters. However, it's more about the practical timeline division rather than directly addressing happiness or painting achievement.
  
- Option (C) asserts that loneliness is necessary for great painting artists. This directly supports the argument against the psychological theory by suggesting that the same loneliness that purportedly contradicts happiness is actually essential for artistic greatness, which implies happiness can be achieved through this means.
  
- Option (D) posits that artists who have achieved great achievements cannot be unhappy. If true, this would contradict the psychological theory as it suggests that happiness can be derived from achievement, even in the absence of intimate relationships.

Based on this analysis, Option (C) is the assumption that most directly supports the argument presented. It suggests a necessary relationship between loneliness and achievement in painting, thus countering the psychological theory's requirement for intimate relationships to achieve happiness.

90,"Mr. Chen is going to hold a gathering of friends and family. He came forward and invited his father's brother-in-law, his brother-in-law's father, his brother's mother-in-law, his brother-in-law's brother. How many guests did Mr. Chen come forward to invite?
(A) No guest invited. (B)  guest. (C)  guests. (D)  guests.","Let's analyze each person that Mr. Chen is said to have invited:

1. **Father's Brother-in-law**: This could be Mr. Chen's maternal uncle (his mother's brother or husband to his mother's sister), or his father's sister's husband. 
   
2. **Brother-in-law's Father**: This is the father of Mr. Chen's sibling's spouse or Mr. Chen's own spouse's brother's father. In any case, this is Mr. Chen's sibling's father-in-law.

3. **Brother's Mother-in-law**: This is the mother of Mr. Chen's brother's wife.

4. **Brother-in-law's Brother**: This could be the brother of Mr. Chen's sibling's spouse, or in some family structures, could be referring to Mr. Chen's own brother, but here it is likely another brother-in-law not yet mentioned.

Now, let's deduce whether these are distinct individuals:

- If Mr. Chen's father's brother-in-law is his mother's brother, this person would be distinct from any of the others.
  
- Mr. Chen's brother-in-law's father could potentially be the same person as Mr. Chen's father's brother-in-law if Mr. Chen's sibling married their cousin.

- Mr. Chen's brother's mother-in-law is likely distinct because it's referring to the mother of the husband or wife of Mr. Chen's brother.

- Mr. Chen's brother-in-law's brother is likely a distinct person unless there are overlapping roles, which isn't common.

Analyzing the potential overlaps:

- The father's brother-in-law could be both the brother-in-law's father if Mr. Chen's sibling married a cousin.
- The brother's mother-in-law could potentially overlap only if there were some uncommon complexities in relationships.

It appears there might be overlaps in family roles, but with the given names and roles not explicitly named, more commonly, these roles would be distinct individuals.

Thus, listing these distinct likely guests: 

1. Father's brother-in-law
2. Brother-in-law's father
3. Brother's mother-in-law
4. Brother-in-law's brother

Assuming these are typically distinct roles, Mr. Chen would likely be inviting 4 guests in total if overlap and dual roles were not intended.

Therefore, the answer is:

91,"Crimes involving the use of firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other types of crimes. However, most crimes involving the use of firearms did not result in homicides. Therefore, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses. The logic loophole in the above argument is most similar to the following one?
(A) Obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease than people with normal weight. However, obese people make up a very small percentage of our population. Therefore, in our country, there is no need for the medical and health community to emphasize the risk of heart disease. (B) Unchecked sex is more likely to be infected with AIDS than checkpoint. However, among people with unchecked sex, only a small percentage of people are infected with AIDS. Therefore, there is no need to emphasize the harm of unchecked sex in the propaganda of AIDS prevention. (C) The prevailing view is that smoking is more likely to cause lung cancer than not smoking. However, in some countries, the proportion of people with lung cancer who have a history of smoking is not higher than the proportion of the total population who have a history of smoking. Therefore, the above popular opinion is likely to be a prejudice. (D) High-income people are more capable of enjoying life than low-income people. But there are many high-income earners who claim to be unhappy. Therefore, those who pursue a happy life need not pay attention to the level of income.","To find the argument with the most similar logical flaw, we need to analyze the logic in the original argument:

1. The argument states that crimes involving firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other crimes.
2. It then claims that most firearm-related crimes do not result in homicide.
3. Therefore, it concludes that firearm crimes should not be distinguished as serious offenses in the law.

The logical flaw here is the assumption that because the majority of a particular subset (firearm crimes leading to homicide) is not extreme (homicide), the subset itself does not warrant special consideration or classification (serious criminal offense).

Now, let’s analyze each answer option and find a similar pattern:

(A) Obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease than people with normal weight. However, obese people make up a very small percentage of our population. Therefore, there is no need for the medical and health community to emphasize the risk of heart disease.

- This argument focuses on the small percentage of obese people rather than on whether obesity increases the likelihood of heart disease. It’s somewhat different from the firearm argument which emphasizes the non-severe results of most firearm crimes, rather than the subset's reduced numbers.

(B) Unchecked sex is more likely to be infected with AIDS than checked sex. However, among people with unchecked sex, only a small percentage become infected with AIDS. Therefore, there is no need to emphasize the harm of unchecked sex in AIDS prevention propaganda.

- This is similar to the original firearm argument because it states that although unchecked sex is more likely to lead to AIDS (like firearm crimes are more likely to lead to murder), since only a small percentage of people engaged in unchecked sex get AIDS, unchecked sex needs no special emphasis (similar to not distinguishing firearm crimes as serious).

(C) The view that smoking is likely to cause lung cancer is questioned because some countries have similar proportions of smokers and lung cancer patients. This challenges the initial claim rather than dismissing the characteristic based on frequency.

(D) The argument about income ties into happiness, and though it addresses correlation (high income could imply more capability for happiness), it talks about individual self-reports of unhappiness, which is not closely aligned with the original argument's logical structure that dismisses severity due to frequency.

The option (B) reflects the flaw most similarly. It dismisses a present risk because the majority do not encounter the worst outcome. Thus, it mirrors the firearm argument's dismissal of heightened risk due to the infrequency of the worst outcome.

92,"Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si. After learning that Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin, Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin. The following assumptions can make the above inference hold, except.
(A) Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's. (B) Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. (C) Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's. (D) Li Si's bonus is as high as Wang Wu's.","To analyze the problem, we need to address the relationships between the bonuses of the different individuals based on the given statements:

1. Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si.
   - This implies: Zhang Shan > Li Si

2. Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin.
   - This implies: Wang Wu > Miao Xiaoqin

3. Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin.
   - This implies: Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin

Given these statements, we are to determine which assumption, if not true, will still make the original inferences hold.

Let's evaluate each assumption:

(A) Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's.
   - Assumption: Wang Wu > Li Si
   - This doesn't directly impact Zhang Shan's bonus being higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.

(B) Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
   - Assumption: Li Si > Miao Xiaoqin
   - If this is true, it supports Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin, given Zhang Shan > Li Si. If false, Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin isn't necessarily affected as Wang Wu > Miao Xiaoqin, which doesn't connect them directly.

(C) Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
   - Assumption: Li Si > Wang Wu
   - If false, Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin still holds true directly based on Zhang Shan's comparison to Miao Xiaoqin through Wang Wu.

(D) Li Si's bonus is as high as Wang Wu's.
   - Assumption: Li Si = Wang Wu
   - If false, Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin still holds and does not directly affect the outcome.

Analyzing these assumptions, (B) seems to be critical, because having Li Si's bonus higher than Miao Xiaoqin supports the chain of Zhang Shan > Li Si. If we remove this assumption, it's challenging to conclude Zhang Shan > Miao Xiaoqin solely from the known inequalities.

Thus, among these options, disregarding Li Si's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's (B) may disrupt the logical inference made, but it importantly doesn’t disrupt the inference of Zhang Shan being higher than Miao Xiaoqin due to other stated conditions. Therefore, with the given conditions not directly affirming these relationships strongly enough, assumptions related to these individuals' rankings maintain context, except for possibly C, which has no direct bearing:

93,"A laboratory has three types of robots, A. B, and C. Type A can recognize colors, type B can recognize shapes, and type C can neither recognize colors nor shapes. The laboratory experimented with robots 1 and 2 with red balls, blue balls, red squares, and blue squares, and ordered them to pick up the red balls, but number 1 picked up the red squares, and number 2 picked up the blue balls. Based on the above experiment, which of the following must be true?
(A) Both No.1 and No.2 are type C. (B) Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type. (C) No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B. (D) No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.","To solve this problem, let's analyze the actions taken by robots 1 and 2 based on their capabilities and the experiment's setup.

1. **Type A Robots**: These can recognize colors.
2. **Type B Robots**: These can recognize shapes.
3. **Type C Robots**: These can neither recognize colors nor shapes.

The experiment involved instructions to pick up red balls. Here's what happened:
- **Robot 1** picked up red squares instead of red balls.
- **Robot 2** picked up blue balls instead of red balls.

Let's break down each scenario:

- **For Robot 1 (picked up red squares)**:
  - If Robot 1 were type A, it would identify the color red but couldn't distinguish between a ball and a square, hence could mistakenly pick red squares if it went solely by color. This scenario is incorrect as it still should have picked red balls being able to recognize color.
  - If Robot 1 were type B, it would recognize shapes but not colors, which doesn't explain why it picked red and not blue shapes. It's unlikely that Robot 1 is type B since it acted based on color.
  - If Robot 1 were type C, it would randomly pick items because it can recognize neither colors nor shapes. Hence picking red squares could be possible due to randomness.

- **For Robot 2 (picked up blue balls)**:
  - If Robot 2 were type A, it recognized color but not shapes. Picking blue over red indicates it didn't act based on color, hence can't be type A.
  - If Robot 2 were type B, it recognized the shape of a ball but not the correct color, explaining why it picked blue balls. This indicates it focused on shape only.
  - If Robot 2 were type C, it would randomly pick items, similar to the analysis for Robot 1.

Considering the observations:
- Robot 1 randomly picked up red squares, aligning with it being a type C that can't distinguish color or shape.
- Robot 2 picked blue balls focusing on shape, indicating it measures objects by shape (thus likely type B).

Based on these breakdowns, we can identify:
- **Robot 1 is likely type C (due to random pick)**
- **Robot 2 is likely type B (as it focuses on shape)**

Therefore, the statements align with option **(D) No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A**.

94,"Statistics show that in car accidents, the proportion of cars with airbags is higher than that of cars without airbags. Therefore, installing an airbag in a car does not make the car owner safer. Which of the following most appropriately points out the loophole of the above argument?
(A) Assume without explanation? Any car equipped with airbags may experience a car accident. (B) Ignore this possibility? Owners without airbags pay more attention to driving cautiously. (C) Improper assumption? In any car accident, the airbag will automatically open. (D) Improperly equate the possibility of a car accident with the seriousness of the car owner ’s injury in the accident.","To evaluate the argument, we need to analyze the relationship between the presence of airbags and the safety of car owners. The argument claims that because a higher proportion of cars with airbags are involved in accidents, airbags do not make cars safer. 

Let's consider each option to identify the loophole:

(A) This option suggests that having an airbag doesn't inherently cause a car accident, which is correct but does not directly address the argument's logic.

(B) This option introduces the possibility that drivers of cars without airbags may drive more cautiously, potentially leading to fewer accidents. However, this is speculative and does not necessarily undermine the argument.

(C) This option discusses the assumption that airbags automatically deploy in accidents. While this could be relevant in assessing the effectiveness of airbags when they do not deploy, it does not directly address the connection between airbag presence and accident likelihood.

(D) This option points out the argument's flaw: it equates the presence of airbags during accidents with the conclusion that airbags do not improve safety. The crucial aspect here is distinguishing between the occurrence of accidents and the resulting severity of injuries. Airbags aim to reduce injury severity, not necessarily prevent accidents.

Option (D) correctly identifies the improper equivalence between accident occurrence and injury seriousness, highlighting the main flaw in the original argument.

95,"Some good goods are not cheap. Therefore, not all good goods are good goods. "". An analogy with which of the following inferences shows that the above inferences are not true?
(A) People in Hunan don't like chili. Therefore, some people who love chili are not Hunanese. (B) Some people are not selfish. Therefore, people are not all selfish. (C) A good motivation does not necessarily have a good effect. Therefore, good effects do not necessarily result from good motivation. (D) Some southerners are not Cantonese. Therefore, not all Cantonese are Southerners.","To determine which analogy shows that the inference ""Some good goods are not cheap. Therefore, not all good goods are good goods"" is not true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided in the options and compare them with the structure of the statement given.

The original statement: ""Some good goods are not cheap. Therefore, not all good goods are good goods.""

This statement seems to have a contradiction in its form, as ""good goods"" in predicate logic would consistently refer to the same category unless clearly distinguished otherwise. Here, 'good goods' changes context as it is repeated, which can cause confusion or a false conclusion.

Let's examine each option:

(A) ""People in Hunan don't like chili. Therefore, some people who love chili are not Hunanese.""
- The first premise seems inaccurate or not universally applicable. This is an incorrect inference due to potential generalization about people.

(B) ""Some people are not selfish. Therefore, people are not all selfish.""
- This is a logically valid inference. If some are not selfish, not all are selfish. The conclusion appropriately follows from the premise without contradiction.

(C) ""A good motivation does not necessarily have a good effect. Therefore, good effects do not necessarily result from good motivation.""
- This statement makes an improper inference based on the lack of necessity implied in the first part, reflecting a common fallacy regarding causation, similar to the structure in the original statement. Although good motivation doesn't guarantee good effects, this does not automatically imply the reverse (good effects not arising from good motivations).

(D) ""Some southerners are not Cantonese. Therefore, not all Cantonese are Southerners.""
- This is a logically sound inference. 'Some southerners are not Cantonese' does not imply any negation about Cantonese being Southerners. The conclusion follows correctly as a matter of possibility but doesn't entertain a fallacy like the original statement.

Option C draws on an incorrect causal assumption reflecting the misinterpretation similar to the original incorrect inference of the good goods statement.

96,"A school classifies students' academic performance into four grades of excellent, good, middle and poor by grade level. In a school year, the top 10% of the total score of each exam is excellent; the latter 30% is poor, and the rest are good and medium. In the previous school year, more students with excellent grades in the second grade were more than those with excellent grades in the first grade. If the above determination is true, which of the following must be true?
(A) Students with poor grades in the second grade are less than those with poor grades in the first grade. (B) There are more students with poor grades in the second grade than those with poor grades in the first grade. (C) There are more students with good grades in the second grade than those with good grades in the first grade. (D) The students with good grades in the second grade are less than those with good grades in the first grade.","To tackle this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Academic performance is classified into four grades: excellent, good, middle, and poor.
2. The top 10% of the total score in each exam is classified as excellent.
3. The bottom 30% is classified as poor.
4. The remaining 60% is classified as good and medium.

The key point mentioned is that more students with excellent grades in the second grade were more than those with excellent grades in the first grade. This implies that a higher number of students in the second grade fell into the top 10% of scores.

Now, let’s evaluate the options given:

- **Option (A):** Students with poor grades in the second grade are less than those with poor grades in the first grade.
   
   The distribution rule for poor grades applies to both grades independently, i.e., each grade will have 30% classified as poor. Thus, without knowledge of the total number of students in each grade, we cannot infer about the comparative number of poor students.

- **Option (B):** There are more students with poor grades in the second grade than those with poor grades in the first grade.
   
   Similar logic applies as in Option A. The 30% rule for poor grades is separate for both grades. Without knowing the total number of students, this cannot be determined.

- **Option (C):** There are more students with good grades in the second grade than those with good grades in the first grade.
   
   Since the excellent and poor percentages remain consistent (10% excellent, 30% poor), the middle 60% includes both good and medium. An increase in the proportion of excellent students could indicate a higher performance overall, potentially impacting the good category, but this is not necessary from the information given.

- **Option (D):** The students with good grades in the second grade are less than those with good grades in the first grade.
   
   Similar to option (C), without additional information regarding how students shift between the ""excellent,"" ""good,"" and ""medium"" categories, this cannot be confirmed.

Given the constraints above, the only definitive comparison we have (based on the information that more students in the second grade were excellent than in the first grade) does not allow us to make a necessary inference regarding the number of students with poor or good grades between the two grades.

Conclusively, none of the options provided must be true based on the information given. Therefore, there is no obligation for any specific pattern in the ""poor"" or ""good"" categories based solely on the distribution increase in the ""excellent"" category. Thus, none of the options (A, B, C, or D) is necessarily true.

97,"There are 90 patients, all suffering from refractory disease T, who have taken the same conventional drugs. These patients were divided into two groups of equal numbers. The first group took W, an experimental drug used to treat T, and the second group took placebo without W. Statistics after 10 years show that 44 deaths occurred in both groups. Therefore, this test drug is ineffective. Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the above argument?
(A) Among the patients who died above, the average year of death of the second group was two years earlier than the first group. (B) Among the patients who died, the average life span of the second group was two years shorter than that of the first group. (C) Among the above living patients, the second group is more severely ill than the first group. (D) Among the above living patients, the second group is older than the first group.","To assess which statement weakens the argument that the experimental drug W is ineffective, let's analyze each option:

The argument's conclusion is based on the observation that an equal number of deaths (44) occurred in both the experimental drug W group and the placebo group over a period of 10 years. The implicit assumption is that the drug had no beneficial effect on survival compared to the placebo, thus labeling it ineffective.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Among the patients who died above, the average year of death of the second group was two years earlier than the first group.
- This suggests that, although the number of deaths was the same, those in the placebo group died earlier than those in the drug W group. This implies that the drug W might have extended the lifespan, which weakens the claim that it is ineffective.

(B) Among the patients who died, the average life span of the second group was two years shorter than that of the first group.
- Similar to option A, this indicates that those in the placebo group lived shorter lives than those in the drug W group, suggesting the drug may have had a positive impact on longevity. Therefore, it weakens the argument that drug W is ineffective.

(C) Among the above living patients, the second group is more severely ill than the first group.
- This doesn't directly address the effectiveness of the drug W in terms of mortality or life extension; it concerns the severity of illness rather than survival outcomes.

(D) Among the above living patients, the second group is older than the first group.
- This does not relate directly to the effectiveness of drug W in terms of survival rate or lifespan, as it focuses on age rather than the progress of the disease or the mortality effect.

Between options A and B, both suggest that those taking drug W might have lived longer, thus weakening the argument that the drug is ineffective. However, both options effectively convey the same concept when presented with numerical data in terms of either year of death or lifespan.

Therefore, both are equally effective in weakening the argument, but since the question only allows for one selection, each choice presents the same effect. Thus, the appropriate choice is:

Kobayashi is most likely to understand the rules of swimming as?
(A) You cannot enter the deep pool unless you have a deep water certificate. (B) Only those who hold a deep water certificate need not wear a swimming cap. (C) If you have a deep water certificate, you can enter the deep pool. (D) Those who are allowed to enter the swimming pool may not be allowed to enter the deep pool.","To solve this problem, let's break down the situation and the information provided in the scenario:

1. The pool regulations include:
   - Those who do not wear swimming caps are not allowed to enter the swimming pool.
   - Only those with a deep water certificate can enter the deep pool.

2. Kobayashi was refused entry to the deep pool due to not wearing a swimming cap, despite having a deep water certificate.

Kobayashi's understanding of the rules likely centers on the relation between having a deep water certificate and entering the deep pool, since he had an issue with wearing a swimming cap.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) You cannot enter the deep pool unless you have a deep water certificate.
   - This is true but does not address the cap requirement, which is the reason for Kobayashi's refusal.

(B) Only those who hold a deep water certificate need not wear a swimming cap.
   - This statement is incorrect based on the information. The rules specify that everyone must wear a cap to enter the pool, regardless of having a certificate.

(C) If you have a deep water certificate, you can enter the deep pool.
   - This is what Kobayashi seemed to assume: having a certificate allows entry. However, it ignores the requirement of wearing a cap.

(D) Those who are allowed to enter the swimming pool may not be allowed to enter the deep pool.
   - This statement makes a distinction that aligns more closely with the scenario: the requirement to wear a cap to enter the general swimming pool exists alongside needing a certificate for the deep pool. Kobayashi misunderstood, thinking his certificate exempted him from wearing a cap.

Therefore, given the context, option (C) reflects Kobayashi's likely misunderstanding, focusing only on having the certificate without considering the cap requirement. However, this doesn't fully address the misunderstanding about the cap.

Option (D) complements the overall setup, acknowledging that entrance requirements to different areas of the pool can vary (if interpreted to mean entry rules differ). Still, neither option truly captures the misunderstanding fully in terms of context provided.

Given these options, Kobayashi's misunderstanding when denied entry was assuming his certificate alone sufficed without addressing the cap requirement. Therefore, the most reasonable is option:

(A) Seawater pollution causes more damage to crocodiles than seals. (B) Despite the sharp decrease in the number of crocodiles and the increase in the number of seals, there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles. (C) Before the number of seals increased, the number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased. (D) Crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals.","To weaken the argument that seals are responsible for the reduction in crocodile numbers, we need to provide an alternative explanation for the decline in crocodile numbers, particularly one that doesn't involve seals directly causing harm to crocodiles.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Seawater pollution causes more damage to crocodiles than seals. 
- This option suggests an alternative cause for the crocodile decline that has nothing to do with seals. If pollution is harming crocodiles more than seals, it could explain the decline without implicating seals as the cause. However, it doesn't directly address the potential impact seals might have indirectly.

(B) Despite the sharp decrease in the number of crocodiles and the increase in the number of seals, there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles.
- This statement doesn’t offer an alternative cause for the decline in crocodile numbers. It provides a comparison of populations but doesn't weaken the argument that seals could influence crocodile numbers.

(C) Before the number of seals increased, the number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased. 
- This option indicates that the decline of crocodiles started before the rise in seal numbers, suggesting that seals are not the causative factor in the initial decline. It effectively weakens the premise that seals caused the crocodile reduction.

(D) Crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals.
- This suggests competition for food, which could indeed impact crocodile numbers, but it doesn't directly weaken the claim that seals rarely prey on crocodiles.

The option that most directly weakens the argument by proposing an alternative timeline for the decline is option (C). It demonstrates that the decline began before the increase in seals, undermining the causal link.

1. **Condition 1**: There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of all three departments. This means one assistant is managing all departments, while the rest manage either one or two.

2. **Condition 2**: F and G are not in charge of the same department. This implies that if F is in department X, G cannot be managing department X, and vice versa.

Let's analyze the options:

- **Option A**: Some assistants to the general manager are in charge of two departments. Given that only one assistant manages all three departments, and there are six assistants who need to manage three departments, it is inevitable that at least one of the remaining assistants manages two departments to satisfy the departmental needs. Therefore, this seems plausible.

- **Option B**: Any department is in charge of F or G. There is no rule specifying that F or G must be part of a department. They could be in completely different departments, or one of them might even manage all departments. This doesn't address the necessity.

- **Option C**: M and P are in charge of only one department. There are no premises specifically connecting M and P to a number of departments they must manage. They could manage any number of departments between one and two without a contradiction.

- **Option D**: No department is in charge of F, M, and P. This statement cannot be evaluated solely based on the given information, as it would require a constraint directly between F, M, and P that is not provided.

1. There is only one assistant general manager in charge of all three departments simultaneously.
2. F and G cannot be in charge of the same department.
3. H and I cannot be in charge of the same department.

We need to determine what must be true if F and M are not in charge of the same department.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios under the given conditions:

- F cannot be in the same department as G (condition 2).
- H cannot be in the same department as I (condition 3).
- An unspecified assistant is in charge of all three departments (condition 1).

Suppose F is in department A, then:

- G must be in a different department from F, say department B.
- Because F and M are not in the same department, M must be in department C.
  
Now, we have:

- F: Department A
- G: Department B
- M: Department C

Since F can only be in one department, this does not affect H and I directly concerning departments A, B, or C.

Now, let's find pairings:

- If F is alone in Department A initially, then let's say H can be with F.
- I cannot be with H (condition 3), so I might be positioned with G in Department B.
- This logically leads P to align with M in Department C for balance in numbers as all assistants must be in at least one department.

Re-evaluating options against these hypothetical department assignments:

A. F and H are in charge of the same department - Possible based on our assumption, but not a must.
B. F and I are in charge of the same department - Not necessarily true as F can be with someone else (like H).
C. I and P are in charge of the same department - Not necessarily, I can be with G.
D. M and G are in charge of the same department - No direct rule violations and offers equilibrium in numbers under original assumption.

However, Assistant M, who must be one of the assistants involved across three departments (considering balance and positioning:

- Alone scenario M cannot be allowed across, else I, and P are alternatives based on their placements - department C involves M's accompaniment.

After distribution:

Given these observations and logic, the not guaranteed but supported under these scenarios (with distribution of departments) is option (D): M and G are in the same department without conflict in given conditions.

Hence, based on these evaluations, and understanding person placement logic without breaking critical rules, the most likely to be true based on analysis:

103,"Ancient Greek philosophers said that life without reflection is worthless. Which of the following options is the closest to the meaning of this maxim?
(A) Only after introspection can life be of value. (B) To be valuable in life, we must reflect on it from time to time. (C) I'm confused for a lifetime. (D) People should live to understand.","To interpret the maxim by the ancient Greek philosophers that ""life without reflection is worthless,"" we need to understand the significance of reflection in life as implied in this statement. Reflection here refers to the act of introspection, examination of one's own thoughts, feelings, and actions.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Only after introspection can life be of value.
- This option suggests that introspection is a prerequisite for life to have value, which aligns closely with the idea that without reflection, life is considered worthless.

(B) To be valuable in life, we must reflect on it from time to time.
- This option states that reflection should be a regular practice to add value to life. It captures the spirit of the maxim but implies a somewhat different emphasis—it suggests periodic reflection than an absolute necessity.

(C) I'm confused for a lifetime.
- This option doesn't relate to the maxim. It refers to living with confusion, which lacks the concept of reflection.

(D) People should live to understand.
- This option implies that understanding life is a goal, which can involve introspection. However, it is broader and lacks the direct emphasis on reflection as necessary for life’s worth.

The maxim directly suggests that reflection is essential for life to have worth, which is closest to the idea presented in option (A). Although (B) is similar, it doesn't convey the necessity as strongly as (A) does.

(A) The computer can have the learning function like a human. (B) Computer programs cannot simulate human initiative and creativity. (C) In the future society, it is difficult to say whether people control computers or control computers. (D) People can compile computer programs that simulate human initiative and creativity.","The reasoning in the question stem suggests that computers, because they are controlled by pre-programmed programs, cannot possess the initiative and creativity intrinsic to human behavior. To strongly support this reasoning, the supplement should reinforce the idea that computers lack these human-like qualities.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) The computer can have the learning function like a human.
- This option suggests that computers could emulate some human abilities, potentially weakening the argument rather than supporting it.

(B) Computer programs cannot simulate human initiative and creativity.
- This directly supports the reasoning by emphasizing that, despite programming capabilities, computers are unable to replicate the initiative and creativity unique to humans.

(C) In the future society, it is difficult to say whether people control computers or control computers.
- This option introduces ambiguity about the future relationship between humans and computers but does not directly address the current argument about initiative and creativity.

(D) People can compile computer programs that simulate human initiative and creativity.
- This option suggests the possibility of simulating human-like qualities in computers, which opposes the argument by implying that programming can bridge the gap between computer abilities and human qualities.

Option (B) most strongly supports the reasoning in the question stem by directly reinforcing the idea that computers, constrained by programming, cannot truly emulate human initiative and creativity.

(A) As an ornamental plant, French tarragon is more popular than Russian tarragon. (B) The flower of Russian tarragon may not have fragrance. (C) The plant grown from tarragon seeds is not French tarragon. (D) Apart from Russian tarragon and French tarragon, there are no other types of tarragon.","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Blooming and Seed Production**: We are informed that plants must bloom to produce seeds. This implies that only blooming plants, like the Russian tarragon, can produce seeds.

2. **Russian Tarragon**: Russian tarragon blooms but does not have the unique flavor that French tarragon does, which makes it less desirable as a condiment.

3. **French Tarragon**: French tarragon does not bloom, which implies it cannot produce seeds. It has a unique flavor that makes it an ideal condiment.

Now, let's evaluate each of the answer choices:

(A) ""As an ornamental plant, French tarragon is more popular than Russian tarragon."" - The passage does not provide any information about the popularity of French or Russian tarragon as ornamental plants. Therefore, we cannot deduce this conclusion.

(B) ""The flower of Russian tarragon may not have fragrance."" - The passage does not provide direct information about the fragrance of Russian tarragon's flower. While it mentions a lack of unique flavor in the leaves, it does not specify anything about the flower's fragrance.

(C) ""The plant grown from tarragon seeds is not French tarragon."" - Since French tarragon does not bloom, it cannot produce seeds. Therefore, any plant grown from tarragon seeds cannot be French tarragon. This conclusion directly aligns with the given information.

(D) ""Apart from Russian tarragon and French tarragon, there are no other types of tarragon."" - The passage specifically discusses only Russian and French tarragon but does not claim that these are the only existing types of tarragon. Thus, this conclusion cannot be logically deduced.

(B) Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity. (C) All technical backbones study hard. Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone. Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person. (D) Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by the society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by the society.","To determine which reasoning clearly shows that the argument is invalid, let's first analyze the argument's structure:

Argument: 
- All people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC) are Chinese.
- Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the PRC.
- Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.

The argument uses a logical construct similar to:
- All X are Y.
- Z is not X.
- Therefore, Z is not Y.

This is a type of fallacious reasoning known as denying the antecedent. Let's compare this with each of the provided options:

(A) All successful people have to eat in clothes. I am not a successful person now, so I don’t have to eat in clothes.
   - Structure: All X are Y. I am not X. Therefore, I am not Y.
   - It follows the same fallacious structure as the original argument.

(B) Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.
   - Structure: All X have Y. Z has Y, so Z is X.
   - This is an example of incorrect reasoning (affirming the consequent) but not directly related to the argument's structure.

(C) All technical backbones study hard. Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone. Therefore, Xiao Zhang is a hard-working person.
   - Structure: All X are Y. Z is X. Therefore, Z is Y.
   - This follows a valid logical reasoning (modus ponens), which does not match the argument's invalid structure.

(D) Criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and violations should be condemned by society, so all criminal behaviors should be condemned by society.
   - Structure: All X are Y. Z should be Y, so all X should be Z.
   - This does not match the fallacious reasoning of the original argument.

Option (A) parallels the original argument's reasoning, denying the antecedent, and clearly demonstrates the flaw in the argument regarding jurisdiction and nationality.

(C) There is a similar group of patients with prostate tumors awaiting surgery. They did not take lycopene capsules, and their tumors did not shrink. (D) Lycopene exists not only in tomatoes, but also in fruits such as watermelons and grapes.","In order to support the doctor's conclusion that lycopene has the effect of reducing prostate tumors, we need evidence indicating that lycopene is the factor responsible for the tumor reduction.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) The age of prostate cancer patients taking lycopene is between 45-65 years old.
- This gives demographic information but doesn't relate to the effect of lycopene on tumor reduction.

(B) A few of the prostate cancer patients taking lycopene are in serious condition.
- This doesn't provide information about the effect of lycopene on the tumor; it only discusses the condition of some patients.

(C) There is a similar group of patients with prostate tumors awaiting surgery. They did not take lycopene capsules, and their tumors did not shrink.
- This provides a comparison group, which is crucial in determining the effect of a treatment. The lack of tumor reduction in the control group (those not taking lycopene) supports the conclusion that lycopene might be the cause of tumor reduction in the test group.

(D) Lycopene exists not only in tomatoes, but also in fruits such as watermelons and grapes.
- This fact about the presence of lycopene in other fruits does not support the conclusion about its effect on tumor reduction.

Considering these evaluations, option (C) provides the best support for the doctor's conclusion because it presents a comparison group that highlights the observed effect is potentially due to the lycopene treatment.

1. **Rule 1:** If valve No.1 is opened, then valve No.2 must be opened and valve No.5 must be closed.
   - From this rule, once valve No.1 is open, valve No.2 needs to be open and valve No.5 must be closed. Thus, valve No.2 is already one of the options we need to open from the provided choices. Valve No.5 will remain closed due to this rule.

2. **Rule 2:** If valve No.2 or valve No.5 is opened, valve No.4 must be closed.
   - Since valve No.2 is open (as established from rule 1), valve No.4 must be closed.

3. **Rule 3:** Valve No.3 and valve No.4 cannot be closed at the same time.
   - According to rule 3, since valve No.4 must be closed (due to rule 2), valve No.3 must be open to comply with this rule.

From the above deductions, when valve No.1 is opened, the valves that need to be open are:
- Valve No.2 (based on rule 1)
- Valve No.3 (based on rule 3 because valve No.4 is closed)

Therefore, the correct answer, based on the deduction above, is:

(D) Why was the economic situation of the United Kingdom, which used to regulate Hong Kong, bad during this period?","To refute the reasoning that ""one country, two systems"" caused Hong Kong's economic recession, we need to question the claim of causality between the implementation of ""one country, two systems"" and the economic downturn in Hong Kong.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) If two things happen at the same time or one after another, can we be sure that there is a causal relationship between them? 
- This question directly addresses the assumption of a causal relationship based solely on the timing of events. It challenges the idea that just because ""one country, two systems"" and the economic recession happened sequentially, one must have caused the other.

(B) Why did Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States also experience economic recession during this period?
- This question could suggest that the recession might have been part of a broader economic trend affecting multiple regions, thereby weakening the causal link between ""one country, two systems"" and Hong Kong's recession.

(C) Why the economy of mainland China is booming.
- This question might imply a comparison or contrast with China's economy, but it doesn't directly address the causal link between Hong Kong's policy change and its recession.

(D) Why was the economic situation of the United Kingdom, which used to regulate Hong Kong, bad during this period?
- This question might provide historical context or suggest external influence but doesn't directly challenge the assumed causality between ""one country, two systems"" and the recession.

The most relevant question for refuting the reasoning is (A) because it directly questions the assumption of causality between the two events merely based on their chronological occurrence.

(C) Some institutional factors should be designed to restrict the behavior of government officials. (D) The management of government officials should mainly depend on raising their awareness of self-discipline.","The passage discusses the duality of human nature, particularly emphasizing self-interest and the concept of ""rational economic men,"" suggesting that individuals, regardless of their status or education, are influenced by their self-interest in their actions. Let's examine each option:

(A) When a person provides a role or service to society, it is impossible not to consider his own economic interests.
- This statement aligns with the passage's idea of people acting out of self-interest, making it an implied meaning.

(B) Once they have public power, some people are very likely to use ""power rent-seeking"" and engage in power and money transactions.
- This statement suggests that individuals might exploit their power for personal gain, fitting within the discussion of self-interest and duality in human nature.

(C) Some institutional factors should be designed to restrict the behavior of government officials.
- This statement implies the need for external controls or checks to manage self-interested behavior and prevent abuse of power. This aligns with the passage's notion of self-interest and does not contradict any implied meanings.

(D) The management of government officials should mainly depend on raising their awareness of self-discipline.
- This statement focuses on self-regulation and personal awareness as the primary method of managing behavior. It contradicts the earlier discussion of self-interest and the tendency for actions to change with the environment, suggesting that external factors (such as institutional checks) are also important.

To find the option that is not an implied meaning or conclusion from the passage, we must look for the statement that does not logically follow the emphasis on self-interest. Option (D) suggests that awareness alone is sufficient for regulation, which contradicts the idea that individuals may act in self-interest, even against broader societal expectations. Therefore, it does not fit the passage's implied meanings and conclusions.

It turned out that only one of the three instructors was right. Which one of the following must be true?
(A) The shooting performance of everyone in the class is not excellent. (B) Someone in the class has excellent shooting performance. (C) The squad leader's shooting performance is excellent. (D) The shooting performance of the Sports Committee is not excellent.","To determine which of the instructors was correct, let's analyze their statements in combination with the information that only one of them was right:

1. **Instructor Zhang's Statement**: ""This time the military training time is too short, no one in this class will have excellent shooting results.""
   - If Instructor Zhang is correct, then all shooting performances are not excellent.

2. **Instructor Sun's Statement**: ""Several people have trained before, and their shooting performance will be excellent.""
   - If Instructor Sun is correct, there will be several students with excellent shooting performance.

3. **Another Instructor's Statement**: ""I think the monitor or the sports commissioner can achieve excellent results.""
   - If this instructor is correct, then either the monitor or the sports commissioner has excellent shooting performance.

Given that only one of the instructors can be correct, let's examine the options:

**Option A**: ""The shooting performance of everyone in the class is not excellent.""
   - This means Instructor Zhang would be correct, making everyone else's statement incorrect. However, this would directly contradict Instructor Sun's statement because if several people have trained before and have excellent results, then this statement cannot be correct. Therefore, option A is not viable if only one statement can be true.

**Option B**: ""Someone in the class has excellent shooting performance.""
   - This aligns with Instructor Sun's statement if at least one person has excellent performance, making Instructor Sun correct. It could also align with the possibility that the monitor or the sports commissioner performed excellently, making this another instructor correct.

**Option C**: ""The squad leader's shooting performance is excellent.""
   - If this is true, then the final instructor is correct while making the other two incorrect (since the statement does not suppose several excellent shooters).

**Option D**: ""The shooting performance of the Sports Committee is not excellent.""
   - If true, it doesn’t fully resolve the scenario, because it doesn't necessarily indicate who is telling the truth.

Analyzing all this, since there cannot be several people with excellent performance according to the condition, it is likely that one specific person such as the squad leader performed excellently, not several people. So, either C or the third instructor could be correct. 

Given that there must be at least one excellent performance to contradict Instructor Zhang, it is most plausible that:

1. **40%** of people believe the attacks were due to the unfair foreign policy of the United States.
2. **55%** of people believe it was due to the conflict between Islamic and Western civilizations.
3. **23%** believe it is due to the evil nature of terrorists.
4. **19%** did not express their views.

Notice that if we simply add these percentages together, we get 137%. This exceeds 100%, which suggests that some respondents attributed the cause of the attacks to more than one factor. This is supported by option (C), which states that many investigators believe the causes were not single but compound. This means that individuals could have selected multiple reasons, causing the total percentage to exceed 100%.

Therefore, the most reasonable explanation for the contradictory statements is that many respondents attributed the terrorist attacks to a combination of factors, which accounts for the overlap in percentages.

(C) The floors sold by the company must be real solid wood floors. (D) From the customer's perspective, the company's contract terms are acceptable.","Answer_Reasoning:

To evaluate the contract, we should consider the binding effect and sincerity of the clauses provided by the company. Let's analyze each option:

(A) The company's willingness to pay more than 1,000 times in compensation if fraud is discovered might seem sincere, but it does not necessarily confirm honesty. It is possible to make bold promises without intent to follow through or with terms difficult to prove.

(B) The contract includes a clause stating that the company reserves the right to interpret the contract. This could potentially limit the binding force of the contract, as it provides the company with significant control over how the contract is interpreted. This kind of clause might render the contract less reliable and give the company leeway to manipulate terms to its advantage.

(C) The company claims in the contract that the floors are definitely made of wood. However, the mere statement does not guarantee the material's authenticity unless backed by independent verification. Therefore, this cannot be taken as definitive proof that the floors are real solid wood simply because it is in the contract.

(D) From a customer's perspective, the contract offers several beneficial terms like free installation and a one-year free warranty. However, the free warranty has an exclusion clause, and given the company's broad right to interpret the contract, there is room for dispute and ambiguity, which could be concerning for customers.

Considering these points, option (B) seems to highlight the potential issue of the contract's binding power due to the company's self-reserved right to interpret it, which can undermine its effectiveness.

(B) ""Some workers are Northerners.""
   - This statement could also be true, but it is not explicitly guaranteed by the premises. Since there is no information provided about workers, we can't make a definite conclusion.

(C) ""Some northerners are not workers.""
   - This statement must be true. Since all people from Harbin are northerners and there are some people in Harbin who are not workers, it follows that there are some northerners (those in Harbin) who are not workers.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) Some robots are able to play games with chess masters.
- This statement is unrelated to the experiment described, which involves distinguishing answers between a human and a robot on a computer screen, not about playing chess.

(B) The doctoral student is a master of Go.
- This detail does not address the core issue regarding the inability to distinguish answers between the doctrinal student and the robot. Even if the student were a Go master, that specific talent is irrelevant unless the test questions involved Go.

(C) That robot is IBM's latest generation product.
- This information could imply that the robot has advanced capabilities, but it doesn't serve as the basis for people's suspicion about the inadequacy of the question set, nor does it relate directly to the error in distinguishing answers.

(D) There was a considerable difference between the doctoral student and the robot.
- This option implies a fundamental expectation from the individuals that a doctoral student and a robot should have sufficiently different capabilities, such that their answers could reasonably be expected to diverge if the experiment design were adequate. Thus, if there is no discernible difference in their answers, the question set might not have effectively capitalized on that difference.

The unstated premise most directly responding to the suspicion that the experimental design was inadequate is option (D). If there is a significant innate difference between a human and a robot, then the formulation of questions should be able enough to highlight this disparity.

     - Is a doctor, but uncertain if he is tall (only one of Wang Wei and Li Qiang can be tall based on point 2).
     - Not confirmed as handsome.

   - **Wu Gang:**
     - Is tall and a doctor.
     - If he is the only handsome one as well, then he fits all three criteria (tall, handsome, doctor).

   - **Li Qiang:**
     - Cannot be tall (since Liu Dawei and Wu Gang are confirmed as tall and only one of Li Qiang and Wang Wei can be tall).
     - Not a doctor.
     - Not confirmed as handsome.

   - **Liu Dawei:**
     - Is tall (based on same height as Li Qiang, but that means Li Qiang is not tall, therefore Liu Dawei must be).
     - Not a doctor.
     - Not confirmed as handsome.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Wu Gang is the only person meeting all conditions: he is tall, a doctor, and the only candidate left to potentially meet the handsome criterion, considering each person only fulfills one condition for handsomeness.

Thus, the person who fulfills all the requirements of being tall, handsome, and a doctor is Wu Gang.

117,"Take n (n> 1) natural numbers in turn to form a finite sequence. The odd sequence and even sequence are obviously shorter than the natural sequence. However, if the natural number sequence is extended indefinitely, the odd and even sequence must be smaller than the whole; in an infinite world, the part may be equal to the whole. Which of the following cannot be a logical inference from the above conclusion?
(A) In a poor world, part may be smaller than whole. (B) In an infinite world, parts must not be equal to wholes. (C) In an infinite world, the whole may equal parts. (D) In a poor world, the whole must be larger than the part.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the statements about the sequences and extract logical inferences.

The given statement is:
- For a finite sequence of natural numbers, the odd and even sequences are both shorter than the natural sequence. However, for an infinitely extended natural sequence, the odd and even sequences are considered parts but may equate to the whole.

Let's consider the given options:

(A) In a poor world, part may be smaller than whole.
- This statement can be true. It aligns with the idea that, for finite sequences, parts are smaller than the whole.

(B) In an infinite world, parts must not be equal to wholes.
- This statement contradicts the conclusion that, in an infinite sequence, parts (odd or even sequences) may equate to the whole because they both constitute half of the infinite sequence.

(C) In an infinite world, the whole may equal parts.
- This statement is consistent with the given conclusion that, in an infinite sequence, a part (like the odd sequence) may be considered equal to the whole in terms of cardinality due to their infinite nature.

(D) In a poor world, the whole must be larger than the part.
- This is consistent with finite worlds, where, generally, a whole is larger than just a part of it.

The task is to find which inference cannot be logically drawn from the statements provided. Based on the analysis:

- Option (B) ""In an infinite world, parts must not be equal to wholes"" is the one that contradicts the information given in the initial statement and thus cannot be a logical inference from the conclusions stated about infinite sequences.

118,"People who participate in Taekwondo exercise are generally healthier than those who do not participate in Taekwondo exercise. Therefore, Taekwondo exercise helps improve health. Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of the above conclusion?
(A) Every year, a small number of people are injured by accidents in Taekwondo. (B) Taekwondo can train people's reaction ability and enhance people's agility. (C) Only healthy people participate in Taekwondo. (D) Men love taekwondo more than women.","To evaluate which option most doubts the conclusion that Taekwondo exercise helps improve health, we must identify any assumption made in the argument.

The conclusion: ""Taekwondo exercise helps improve health.""
Premise: ""People who participate in Taekwondo exercise are generally healthier than those who do not.""

For the conclusion to be valid, there should be a causal relationship between participating in Taekwondo and improved health. Alternatively, it assumes that participating in Taekwondo is the reason for people being healthier.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) Every year, a small number of people are injured by accidents in Taekwondo.
- This option points out the existence of injuries, which could suggest a potential negative aspect of Taekwondo, but it does not explicitly challenge the overall health benefits for those who participate.

(B) Taekwondo can train people's reaction ability and enhance people's agility.
- This suggests that Taekwondo has positive health-related benefits, which supports the conclusion rather than doubts it.

(C) Only healthy people participate in Taekwondo.
- This option challenges the assumption by suggesting a reverse causation: people are healthier not because of Taekwondo, but they do Taekwondo because they are already healthy. This reverses the presumed causation, making the conclusion less certain.

(D) Men love taekwondo more than women.
- This option is irrelevant to the health aspect of Taekwondo exercise since it refers to differences in the popularity of Taekwondo between genders.

Option (C) introduces significant doubt about the causation direction, suggesting that Taekwondo participants were already healthier before participation rather than becoming healthier due to the exercise.

Therefore, the most suitable answer that doubts the conclusion is:

(D) Scientists have figured out the molecular structure of SK3 protein.","To determine which option best supports the conclusion that increased SK3 protein content leads to memory loss in experimental mice, we need evidence that directly shows a causal relationship between high SK3 protein levels and memory decline.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) In young experimental rats, it is also found that the brain SK3 protein content is high. 
- This statement about high levels of SK3 protein in young rats does not directly link the protein to memory decline. It merely states a condition that exists but doesn't show causation.

(B) It has been found that the human brain also contains SK3 protein.
- This statement provides no information about the relationship between SK3 protein content and memory loss in mice. It is about humans, not rats, and doesn't address memory decline.

(C) When the scientists tried to reduce the content of SK3 protein in the brains of old experimental mice, their memory improved.
- This statement directly supports the conclusion as it provides evidence of a causal relationship by showing that reducing SK3 protein levels leads to an improvement in memory, suggesting that high levels contribute to memory loss.

(D) Scientists have figured out the molecular structure of SK3 protein.
- Knowing the molecular structure doesn't provide evidence for the protein's impact on memory.

Thus, the best support for the conclusion is option (C), which directly links a reduction in SK3 protein with improved memory in older mice.

120,"The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words ""Money is like dung"" and ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars"" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of ""friends are like dung"". Since the conclusion of ""friends like dung"" is not true, it can be logically derived?
(A) The expression ""money is like dung"" is false. (B) If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. (C) The statement that ""friends are valuable"" is true. (D) The words ""Money is like dung"" and ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars"" are either true or false.","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements: ""Money is like dung"" and ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars"" that can lead to the conclusion ""friends are like dung.""

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The analogy ""Money is like dung"" suggests that money is not valuable or desirable, as dung generally has a negative connotation and is considered waste.
2. The statement ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars"" implies friends are highly valuable.
3. The conclusion ""friends are like dung"" is derived from combining these two statements, but it is acknowledged as absurd and not true.

Now, let's examine which option(s) could lead us to this conclusion:

(A) The expression ""money is like dung"" is false.
   - If ""money is like dung"" is false, then money is not waste and possibly valuable, which aligns with valuing friends highly. However, this alone does not directly address the absurd conclusion.

(B) If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
   - This statement logically contradicts the analogy that ""money is like dung."" If friends are valuable, and they are equated to money, then money must also be valuable and not dung, counteracting the absurd conclusion. Therefore, this addresses the logical contradiction.

(C) The statement that ""friends are valuable"" is true.
   - While this confirms the value of friends, it doesn't directly address the issue with the absurdity of ""friends are like dung.""

(D) The words ""Money is like dung"" and ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars"" are either true or false.
   - This option states these are definitive truths or falsehoods but does not address the resulting absurd conclusion directly.

From this, option (B) specifically addresses the absurdity by clarifying the contradiction in value judgments presented in the original statements. If friends are valuable, equating them to something of no value (like dung) through money is invalid—leading us to understand the inconsistency in the original premises.

Let's evaluate each option.

(A) Japan has been in recession for more than ten years. At that time, China’s merchandise exports were very small, and the renminbi was very weak.  
- This statement challenges the view by suggesting that Japan's economic problems existed long before China's significant export growth and the fixed exchange rate system could have influenced it.

(B) The US economic recession was mainly caused by the destruction of the myth of the Internet economy, and the ""9.11"" terrorist attacks exacerbated this recession.  
- This statement challenges the view by attributing the US recession to other factors than China's exchange rate policy, specifically internal factors like the dot-com bubble burst and external events like the terrorist attacks.

(C) China's GDP accounts for only 3.9% of the world's total, foreign trade is less than 5% of the world's, and it does not have the ability to affect the world market price and supply and demand.  
- This statement challenges the view by arguing that China's economic size and trade influence are not large enough to impact global market dynamics significantly.

(D) Consumers in Western countries have benefited greatly from cheap goods in China.  
- This statement does not challenge the view; rather, it highlights a positive outcome of China's economic practices, which could be consistent with the view that China's fixed exchange rates impact other economies by allowing cheap goods to flow into these markets.

Among the options, (D) does not directly dispute the view but rather provides a benefit resulting from the situation. Hence, the correct choice that does not challenge the view is (D).

""The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team. The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong. According to the above situation, we know that the winner is.
(A) Tsinghua University Team. (B) China University of Science and Technology Team. (C) Zhejiang University Team. (D) Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.","To solve this problem, let's break down the statements and determine which is correct.

1. **Professor Zhao's prediction:**
   - ""The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.""

2. **Professor Qian's prediction:**
   - ""The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.""

3. **Professor Sun's prediction:**
   - ""The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.""

The results indicate only one of the professors is entirely correct and another made one correct and one incorrect statement.

Let's assume: 
- If Professor Zhao is entirely correct, then the champion is neither Tsinghua nor Zhejiang, leaving the possibility of the University of Science and Technology of China or another team not mentioned directly by him.
- If Professor Qian is entirely correct, the champion cannot be Tsinghua but is the University of Science and Technology of China. 
- If Professor Sun is entirely correct, then the champion is indeed the Tsinghua University team.

Now, let's examine cases of one correct and one incorrect answer:

- **Case if Professor Zhao is one-to-one wrong:**
  - If one part is correct, either Tsinghua or Zhejiang is the champion, contradicting Professor Qian, as both teams cannot win simultaneously.
  
- **Case if Professor Qian is one-to-one wrong:**
  - If one part is correct, either Tsinghua is not the champion (accurate) or the University of Science and Technology of China is the champion (incorrect). This leaves the possibility of another team, but it fits Professor Zhao's prediction if he was entirely wrong.

- **Case if Professor Sun is one-to-one wrong:**
  - If one part is accurate, either the champion is not the University of Science and Technology of China or the Tsinghua team did not win. If one is right and one wrong, if Tsinghua won, they must be the champions.

Considering these deductions:
- Only one possibility conveniently satisfies these conditions: The champion is not Tsinghua simplifies the case showing Professor Qian wrong on the champion's part about the University of Science and Technology of China being incorrect, but perhaps Tsinghua not winning could be accurate.
- If Tsinghua did not win, and the China University of Science and Technology did not win because Professor Sun failed where Tsinghua might win, then Zhejiang could be the only other viable choice if Professor Zhao and Qian mislead similarly.

After consideration, the championship going to the **Zhejiang University Team** would fulfill these contradictions, as existing conditions below Professor Zhao's prediction are needed.

(A) You should determine your life goals as soon as possible. (B) Life has no meaning, but we should add a meaning to it. (C) Whether there is a long-term and clear life goal has a very important impact on the size of life achievements. (D) If you have a long-term and clear life goal, you will be successful in life.","To answer this question, let's evaluate the given scenario and the answer options one by one.

The scenario describes a study conducted on Harvard University graduates regarding their life goals. It finds that:
- 27% had no goals
- 60% had blurred goals
- 10% had close relationship goals
- 3% had long-term and clear goals

Twenty-five years later, it was observed that the 3% with long-term and clear goals became elites in society, while others had much lesser achievements.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) ""You should determine your life goals as soon as possible.""
   - This suggests urgency in defining life goals. The scenario doesn't directly indicate that time urgency is key, just that having clear goals is linked to higher success.

(B) ""Life has no meaning, but we should add a meaning to it.""
   - This is philosophical in nature and doesn't directly relate to the correlation between having clear, long-term goals and achieving success.

(C) ""Whether there is a long-term and clear life goal has a very important impact on the size of life achievements.""
   - This directly links having a clear goal with the observed impact on achievements, making it a suitable choice as it aligns directly with the scenario described.

(D) ""If you have a long-term and clear life goal, you will be successful in life.""
   - This statement is more absolute and deterministic. While the data suggests a strong trend, it doesn't guarantee that everyone with clear goals will succeed without considering other factors.

Given the evaluation, option (C) best captures the essence of the observation, that clear, long-term goals significantly impact achievements, without making an absolute determination. Hence, the most appropriate choice is:

(D) Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.","To determine which option is not a logical inference from the statement by Confucius, we will evaluate each choice based on the original saying: ""Do not do what you don't want to do to others.""

(A) ""Only those who do what they want can do it to others."" This suggests that only when a person's actions align with their wishes can they impose them on others. This is not a direct implication of Confucius's statement.

(B) ""If you want, then give it to others."" This suggests that if you desire something for yourself, it is acceptable to offer or impose it on others. This is consistent with the principle that one should only do unto others what one would have done unto oneself.

(C) ""Don't treat others unless you want to."" This directly derives from Confucius's statement that you should not do to others what you do not want for yourself.

(D) ""Whatever is applied to people should be what they want."" This slightly misinterprets Confucius's intention. While the original statement is about not imposing unwanted actions on others, this option implies that you must cater to others' desires, which is beyond what Confucius suggested.

Thus, the option that does not logically follow from the original statement is (D).

(A) The ratio of the purchase price to the selling price of the supermarket goods. (B) The quantity and price of goods sold by the supermarket every day. (C) The number of customers who shop at the supermarket every day and the level of consumption. (D) The ratio of the loss in the supermarket caused by customers stealing commodities, compared with the cost of operating monitoring equipment and increasing shopping guides.","To evaluate the decision of the supermarket management to install monitoring equipment and increase the number of shopping guides, we need to compare the potential benefits of these actions with their costs. 

The primary motivation for the decision is to reduce losses due to theft, which negatively affects the profit margin. By installing monitoring equipment and hiring more guides, the supermarket aims to deter theft and, therefore, increase profits.

The relevant factors to consider are:
- The current loss due to theft: This is a key metric because the purpose of installing monitoring equipment and hiring more staff is to reduce this loss.
- The cost of installing monitoring equipment and hiring more staff: These are the new expenses incurred due to the management's decision.
- The potential reduction in theft: If the reduction in theft increases profits by more than the cost of these new measures, the decision is justified.

Among the given options:
(A) The ratio of the purchase price to the selling price of the supermarket goods: This option is more related to pricing strategy than theft loss.
(B) The quantity and price of goods sold daily: This provides revenue data but doesn't directly address the relevant comparison between theft losses and the costs of monitoring and staffing.
(C) The number of customers and their consumption level: This could influence theft rates, but it doesn't directly compare loss versus the cost of countermeasures.
(D) The ratio of loss due to theft compared with the cost of monitoring and hiring staff: This is directly relevant because it addresses whether the reduction in theft yields a financial benefit greater than the costs, directly impacting the supermarket's profit margin.

Therefore, the most important factor to evaluate the supermarket management's decision is option (D).

(D) Like the earth, the moon has a solid surface structure and a core of lava.","To determine which conclusion is best supported by the given theory about the origin of the moon, let's analyze the theory and each option:

The given theory states that during its early formation, Earth was a fast-rotating body with a molten state, mostly containing iron in its core. Some of this molten material was ejected and later condensed to form the moon. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) The moon is the only fairly large object that orbits the earth.  
- This statement concerns the present orbital dynamics rather than the composition or formation of the moon. The theory does not provide information to support or refute the notion that the moon is the only large object orbiting Earth. Hence, it is not specifically supported by the theory.

(B) The iron content of the core part of the moon is smaller than that of the core part of the earth.
- The theory suggests that most of the iron was in Earth's core, and only some molten material from the Earth's surface was ejected to form the moon. Therefore, it's logical to infer that the moon's core would have less iron compared to Earth's core, aligning with the theory regarding composition differences due to the source of the material. This makes option B a compelling inference.

(C) The solidification of the lunar surface is after the solidification of the earth's surface.
- The theory doesn't specify the timelines of solidification for Earth and the moon. It focuses on the origin of the moon's material. Without specific temporal sequence information, we can't conclude C with certainty.

(D) Like the earth, the moon has a solid surface structure and a core of lava.
- The theory describes the Earth’s initial molten state but does not give specific information about the current state of the moon's core. Therefore, this statement cannot be directly linked to or inferred from the given theory.

Considering the above analysis, the conclusion that can best be supported by the theory is (B): The iron content of the core part of the moon is smaller than that of the core part of the earth.

(C) Two entrepreneurs are Chinese, and another American is a lawyer. (D) One of the lawyers is the legal adviser of one of the entrepreneurs.","To solve the problem, we need to determine how the mentioned identities overlap among the 9 passengers. The task is to reconcile the given identities with the total number of passengers.

Let's break down the people based on their identities:

1. Total passengers: 9

2. Specific identities given:
   - 1 scientist
   - 2 entrepreneurs
   - 2 lawyers
   - 3 Americans
   - 4 Chinese

The key here is to realize that some individuals hold multiple identities, and therefore, some overlap is required.

We need to find an explanation that reconciles the number of people with different identities summing more than 9 by some people belonging to multiple categories.

Let's evaluate the answer options:

(A) The scientist and one of the Americans are husband and wife.
- This does not help in reducing the number of different identities since it only indicates a personal relationship.

(B) The products of one of the entrepreneurs are mainly exported to the United States.
- This does not provide any overlap between the identities and just describes business operations.

(C) Two entrepreneurs are Chinese, and another American is a lawyer.
- This suggests that the entrepreneurs and the lawyer overlap with the nationalities, potentially reducing the count of different people required. Two Chinese entrepreneurs mean they overlap with the 4 Chinese. An American being a lawyer suggests overlap with the Americans, reducing different individuals.

(D) One of the lawyers is the legal adviser of one of the entrepreneurs.
- While this suggests a relationship between the lawyer and entrepreneur, it doesn't explicitly reduce the total number of identities.

Option (C) is the only one that explicitly shows how people can have overlapping roles and explains the discrepancy in numbers — specifically, reducing the number of different people needed.

1. Player No.4 would play only if their competitive state is good and the injury has healed.
2. If player No.4 cannot play, then player No.6 will be sent out.

Given that player No.6 is playing in the final, it implies that player No.4 cannot play. The possible reasons for player No.4 not playing are:
- Player No.4's competitive state is not good.
- Player No.4's injury has not healed.

Statement Analysis:
(A) Player 4 is seriously injured. - This is possible but not necessarily true. Player 4 might not play due to a lack of a good competitive state despite being healed.
(B) Player 4's competitive state is not good. - This could prevent player No.4 from playing. 
(C) No.6 player was not injured. - The injury status of player No.6 is not conditional for the lineup; it is not necessarily related to why player No.4 cannot play.
(D) If player 4's injury has healed, then his competitive state is not good. - This aligns with the condition that to play, player No.4 must meet both criteria. If No.4 is not playing, the failing of at least one condition must be true. If we assume the injury is healed, the competitive state must not be good.

Therefore, option (D) must be true because if player No.4's injury is healed and they are still not playing, it means the competitive state was not good.

Which of the following is most helpful in explaining the Osprey ’s predatory habits mentioned above?
(A) Osprey rarely catch herring, cod or courgette. (B) The water where plaice lives is shallower than the water where herring, cod or courgette lives. (C) Herring, cod or courgette are group activities, but plaice is not. (D) Plaice and cod have protective colors, while herring and courgette have no protective colors.","To explain the osprey's predatory habits, we need to understand why ospreys behave differently when an osprey returns with plaice compared to when it returns with herring, cod, or courgette. The crucial part of understanding this behavior lies in determining the characteristics of the fish that influence the osprey's decision-making when choosing to seek similar prey.

Option (A) suggests that ospreys rarely catch herring, cod, or courgette. This doesn't explain the differential behavior when an osprey catches plaice versus other fish. 

Option (B) states that the water where plaice lives is shallower than the water where herring, cod, or courgette lives. While this information provides some environmental context, it does not directly explain the osprey's predatory habits or their social behavior when seeking food.

Option (C) suggests that herring, cod, or courgette are group activities, but plaice is not. This option directly addresses a potential reason why ospreys may follow others when they catch fish like herring, cod, or courgette but not when they catch plaice. If these fish tend to be in groups, it could mean there's a higher chance of finding more fish in one area, making it worthwhile for other ospreys to follow.

Option (D) mentions that plaice and cod have protective colors, while herring and courgette do not. This option describes a characteristic that might influence the prey's visibility and potentially the success of catching them, but it doesn't make a clear connection to the osprey's follow-the-leader behavior when catching fish.

The option that most logically explains osprey behavior concerning following each other to fishing grounds is (C), as it directly highlights the difference in the behavior of the fish (group activity versus solitary) that could influence the osprey's decision on whether it's beneficial to follow another osprey back to a fishing location.

131,"The function of the government is to meet the real needs of the people. Unless the government knows what those needs are, the government cannot meet those needs. Freedom of expression can ensure that government officials hear such demand messages. Therefore, for a healthy country, free speech is essential. Which of the following, if true, cannot weaken the above argument?
(A) In most cases, the people do not know what they really need. (B) Free speech ultimately tends to disrupt social order, and good social order is a prerequisite for meeting the needs of the masses. (C) The legitimate function of the government is not to satisfy the needs of the people, but to provide equal opportunities for the people. (D) Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.","To determine which statement cannot weaken the argument, let's first understand the core argument.

The argument is as follows:
1. The function of the government is to meet the real needs of the people.
2. The government cannot meet those needs unless it knows what they are.
3. Freedom of expression ensures that government officials are aware of those needs.
4. Therefore, free speech is essential for a healthy country.

Now, let's evaluate each of the options:

(A) In most cases, the people do not know what they really need.
- This statement suggests that people might not effectively communicate their needs to the government, which could potentially weaken the argument about the importance of free speech in informing the government. 

(B) Free speech ultimately tends to disrupt social order, and good social order is a prerequisite for meeting the needs of the masses.
- This implies that free speech might cause social disruptions, which could be counterproductive to meeting people's needs and hence weakens the argument that free speech is essential for a healthy country.

(C) The legitimate function of the government is not to satisfy the needs of the people, but to provide equal opportunities for the people.
- This statement challenges the fundamental premise of the argument that the government's function is to meet the people's needs, which weakens the argument.

(D) Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.
- This statement suggests that free speech alone is not sufficient for a healthy country, implying that other factors (like social order) are also necessary. While this might introduce a consideration of additional factors, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that free speech is essential.

After evaluating each option, option (D) cannot weaken the argument because it acknowledges the importance of free speech while highlighting the need for additional factors. It does not challenge the argument about the essential nature of free speech.

132,"In the past, we had a lot of unrealistic high-profile in moral propaganda, so that a lot of the population said one thing and made one behind the other, and split personality. Through thinking about this phenomenon, some scholars have proposed that we should only ask ordinary people to abide by the ""bottom line ethics"". Based on your understanding, which of the following options is most appropriate as the definition of ""bottom line ethics""?
(A) The bottom line ethics is not to steal or kill. (B) The bottom line ethics are some of the most basic and basic codes of conduct and rules that should be observed by ordinary people in a society. (C) The bottom line ethics is not an ethics that requires selfless dedication. (D) If one compares human morality to a building, the bottom line ethics is the fundamental part of that building.","To determine the most appropriate definition of ""bottom line ethics,"" we need to consider what the term typically entails in the context given. 

1. **Option (A)**: States ""The bottom line ethics is not to steal or kill."" This specifies particular actions to avoid, but ""bottom line ethics"" generally implies a broader set of fundamental ethical principles, not just a prohibition against stealing or killing.

2. **Option (B)**: Suggests ""The bottom line ethics are some of the most basic and basic codes of conduct and rules that should be observed by ordinary people in a society."" This aligns well with the idea that ""bottom line ethics"" refer to fundamental ethical principles or basic societal norms that everyone should follow.

3. **Option (C)**: States ""The bottom line ethics is not an ethics that requires selfless dedication."" While this describes what ""bottom line ethics"" is not, it doesn't provide a clear definition of what it is.

4. **Option (D)**: Provides a metaphor, saying ""If one compares human morality to a building, the bottom line ethics is the fundamental part of that building."" This does highlight that ""bottom line ethics"" are fundamental, but it's more abstract compared to (B).

Based on this analysis, Option (B) offers the clearest and most comprehensive description of ""bottom line ethics"" by stating that they are the fundamental codes of conduct for society, which aligns with how the term is generally interpreted.

133,"In the 3000m finals of the World Athletics Championships, they always ran among the top three players A. B, and C. One was an American player, one was a German player, and the other was a Kenyan player. After the game, I learned? (1) A ’s performance is better than German ’s; (2) Kenyan ’s performance is worse than B ’s; and (3) C praises Kenyan ’s performance. Which of the following must be true?
(A) A. B, and C are Kenyan, German, and American. (B) The Kenyan player is the champion, the American player is the runner-up, and the German player is the third. (C) A. B and C are Kenyan players, American players and German players. (D) The American player is the champion, the German player is the runner-up, and the Kenyan player is the third.","To solve this problem, we need to analyze each of the given conditions within the statements and determine how they relate to points (1), (2), and (3) in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **A’s performance is better than German's.** 
   - This implies that A is not the German player.

2. **Kenyan’s performance is worse than B’s.**
   - This implies that B performed better than the Kenyan player.

3. **C praises Kenyan’s performance.**
   - While C praises the Kenyan, this doesn't directly give us performance information about C compared to the Kenyan.

Let's analyze the potential placement of players.

- Since A's performance is better than the German's, A cannot be German, which leaves A as either Kenyan or American.
- Since B's performance is better than the Kenyan's, B cannot be Kenyan, which leaves B as either American or German.
- Combining all points, since A cannot be German and B cannot be Kenyan, C could be the German.

Let's now analyze the potential outcomes and cross-check them with the conditions:

- If A was Kenyan, then by condition (1) the Kenyan would have outperformed German, which conflicts with condition (2) as B outperformed Kenyan. So A can't be Kenyan.
  
- If A was American:
  - A is better than German (which complies with statement 1).
  - Therefore, C must be Kenyan because Kenyan is worse than B and C is the only option left.
  - Since B is not Kenyan (from conditions), B can only be German.
  
This leads to the distribution:
- A is American
- B is German
- C is Kenyan

Therefore, with the hierarchy established:
- **A (American) is performing best, which means A is the champion.**
- **B (German) would then follow as the runner-up.**
- **C (Kenyan) is in third place.**

The setup fits all conditions logically. Therefore, the correct answer is:

134,"Recently, hundreds of seals died from eating a fish contaminated with chemicals. Even small amounts of this chemical can poison mammals. However, some people have not been poisoned after eating this fish. Which of the following, if correct, is most helpful in explaining the contradictions in the above statement?
(A) The fish contaminated with this chemical has not been harmed by the chemical itself. (B) Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't. (C) Traces of this chemical poison were also found in the bodies of some people who ate neither fish nor fish products. (D) Fish contaminated with this chemical only accounts for a small portion of the seal ’s total food intake.","In this question, we need to explain why some people were not poisoned after eating fish contaminated with chemicals, while hundreds of seals died from the same cause. 

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) The fish contaminated with this chemical has not been harmed by the chemical itself. 
- This statement doesn't address the main question, which is the difference in effects between humans and seals.

(B) Toxic chemicals gather in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't.
- This statement explains that the parts of the fish consumed by seals contain higher concentrations of the toxic chemical compared to what people consume. It provides a plausible reason for why seals were poisoned while people were not.

(C) Traces of this chemical poison were also found in the bodies of some people who ate neither fish nor fish products.
- This statement introduces a new scenario where the poison is present in people who didn't eat the fish, but it doesn't directly explain the difference in effects between seals and people who did eat the fish.

(D) Fish contaminated with this chemical only accounts for a small portion of the seal’s total food intake.
- This statement suggests that seals eat many fish that are contaminated, but it doesn't explain why those contaminated fish would affect seals and not humans.

The most relevant and helpful option is (B) because it directly addresses the contradiction by explaining that the toxic parts of the fish are consumed by seals but not by humans.

This ""either/or"" ultimatum is rigid and presents two mutually exclusive outcomes with no middle ground.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) ""Either you drive a Cadillac, then you are rich; or you don't drive at all, then you are poor."" This also presents an either/or ultimatum with two extreme outcomes, similar to the stem.

(B) ""People who take football as a profession have only two destinies: either win and you're a hero; or lose, then you're a scumbag."" This also features a binary outlook with mutually exclusive extremes, similar to the stem.

(C) ""If a professor can train stupid students, then he has enough ability; if not, he lacks ability."" This is a conditional statement about ability related to outcomes but not an either/or ultimatum with mutually exclusive identities as in the stem.

(D) ""Either you are a morally noble person, contributing selflessly; or you are mean, acting for personal gain."" This is another division into two conflicting moral states, with no middle ground, much like the stem.

Option (C) differs from the others. It deals with a hypothetical conditional about the professor's ability concerning an outcome (training students), unlike the strict ""friend or enemy"" dichotomy present in the stem and other options. The stem’s logic is not conditional but categorical in labeling someone as a friend or enemy based on a single action.

Therefore, (C) is different in its logical structure from the ultimatum in the stem.

(A) Select an excellent breed of laying hens to feed on the grassland, and then compare with the nutrient composition of the common chickens fed on the grassland. (B) Test and compare the nutritional content of chicken food on grassland and non-grassland chicken food. (C) Choose laying hens of the same breed grade, half of them are fed on the grassland and half are fed on the non-steppe, and then compare their nutritional content. (D) Select different breeds of laying hens, feed them on the grassland, and compare their nutritional content.","To verify the conclusion that the nutritional value of breeder chickens and their eggs is related to the grassland food eaten by the chickens, we need to design an experiment that isolates the influence of the grassland diet from other variables that could affect nutritional content, such as the breed of the chickens. 

Let's evaluate each experimental method:

(A) Select an excellent breed of laying hens to feed on the grassland, and then compare with the nutrient composition of the common chickens fed on the grassland. 
This method does not control for variables other than the diet, such as the breed of the hen, meaning differences in nutritional content could be attributed to breed rather than diet.

(B) Test and compare the nutritional content of chicken food on grassland and non-grassland chicken food. 
While this analysis can provide insight into potential dietary differences, it doesn't directly measure the nutritional content of the chickens themselves, which is what we're studying.

(C) Choose laying hens of the same breed grade, half of them are fed on the grassland and half are fed on the non-steppe, and then compare their nutritional content. 
This method controls for the variable of breed and directly compares the dietary influence of grassland versus non-grassland environments on the nutritional content of chickens, making it the most reliable experiment.

(D) Select different breeds of laying hens, feed them on the grassland, and compare their nutritional content.
Any differences found could be due to inherent breed characteristics rather than the grassland food, so it doesn't isolate the impact of the diet.

Ultimately, option (C) provides the most reliable method, as it controls for other factors and isolates the dietary influence, resulting in a clear comparison between the grassland diet and a non-grassland diet on chickens of the same breed.

"". Which of the following, if proven, can reasonably lead to the salesperson ’s conclusion?
(A) Polar bear brand refrigerators have more advertisements than penguin brand refrigerators. (B) The salesperson earned less revenue from selling a Penguin refrigerator than from selling a Polar Bear refrigerator. (C) The refrigeration effect of a refrigerator is solely determined by the quality of its compressor. (D) The annual sales volume of refrigerators is larger than the annual sales volume of Polar Bear refrigerators.","The salesperson's conclusion is that purchasing a Penguin refrigerator results in the same cooling effect for less money compared to the Polar Bear refrigerator, because both share the same high-quality compressor. The key premise for this conclusion is that the cooling effect is comparable due to the shared component, the compressor.

To prove or reasonably support this conclusion, it must be shown that the effect of refrigeration is indeed comparable between the two brands based solely on the compressor quality. Therefore, any additional features or factors that could affect the cooling performance must not play a significant role.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) This option discusses the advertising difference and doesn't directly impact or support a conclusion about the cooling effect or value proposition in terms of cooling ability.

(B) This option talks about the revenue earned by the salesperson from selling the refrigerators. While it touches on the price point, it doesn't address whether the cooling effect is the same, so it doesn't support the conclusion about cooling effect equivalence.

(C) This option states that the refrigeration effect of a refrigerator is solely determined by the quality of its compressor. If true, this directly supports the salesperson's claim that the Penguin refrigerator would offer the same cooling effect as a Polar Bear refrigerator, making this option the most relevant in supporting the conclusion.

(D) This option touches on sales volumes of refrigerators but does not address or support the equivalence of cooling effects, which is the core component of the salesperson's argument.

(A) There are savages in the Shennongjia area because someone has seen the savages. (B) Since you can't prove that ghosts don't exist, so ghosts exist. (C) Scientists are not born smart, for example, Einstein did not seem very smart when he was a child. (D) A scholastic philosopher does not believe that human nerves converge in the brain. The reason is that in Aristotle's writings, nerves are generated from the heart.","To solve this problem, we need to identify the reasoning pattern in the argument given in the question stem and then find the option that follows the same reasoning pattern.

The argument in the question stem is based on the fallacy of appealing to ignorance: it claims there exist other advanced civilizations in the universe simply because there is no theory or evidence proving that such civilizations cannot exist. This reasoning is flawed because the absence of disproof is not evidence of proof.

Now, let's analyze each option to see which one follows the same flawed logic:

(A) ""There are savages in the Shennongjia area because someone has seen the savages."" - This argument is based on evidence (someone's claim of having seen the savages), not on the lack of disproof. Hence, it doesn't follow the same reasoning.

(B) ""Since you can't prove that ghosts don't exist, so ghosts exist."" - This statement exactly mirrors the fallacy in the question stem by arguing that something exists due to the lack of evidence disproving it. This matches the flawed reasoning pattern.

(C) ""Scientists are not born smart, for example, Einstein did not seem very smart when he was a child."" - This statement attempts to provide an example (Einstein) rather than using the lack of disproof to claim existence, hence it doesn't follow the same faulty logic as the question stem.

(D) ""A scholastic philosopher does not believe that human nerves converge in the brain. The reason is that in Aristotle's writings, nerves are generated from the heart."" - This statement relies on an appeal to authority (Aristotle’s writings) rather than using the absence of disproof, which is not the same reasoning as the question stem.

Based on this analysis, option (B) uses the same reasoning pattern as the argument in the question stem. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. There is evidence that Chen Hu did not commit the crime.
2. The perpetrator is either Wang Guang, Chen Hu, or Zhu Tong.
3. There is also evidence that Wang Guang did not commit the crime.
4. The TV screen showed that at the time of the incident, Zhu Tong was in the auditorium of a football game away from the crime scene.

Let's examine the implications:

- **Assertion 2** states that only three people could be the perpetrator: Wang Guang, Chen Hu, or Zhu Tong.

- **Assertion 1** provides evidence that Chen Hu did not commit the crime.
  
- **Assertion 3** provides evidence that Wang Guang also did not commit the crime.
  
- **Assertion 4** reveals that at the time of the incident, Zhu Tong was seen away from the crime scene.

If all assertions are true:
- None of the suspects (Chen Hu, Wang Guang, or Zhu Tong) could have committed the crime, which would lead to a contradiction. This implies that at least one of the assertions must be false.

Let's evaluate the given options:

(A) It can be deded from the above assertion that there is only one crime: This option does not tackle the issue of the contradictions within the existing assertions and is not necessarily true based solely on the information provided.

(B) At least one of the above assertions is false: This is a plausible conclusion because the statements lead to a contradiction if all were true (no available suspect committed the crime).

(C) From these assertions, it can be concluded that the evidence that Wang Guang did not commit the crime is false: This explicitly points to assertion 3 being false, which we cannot specifically determine without further evidence.

(D) Zhu Tong is definitely not in the audience of the football match: This explicitly points to assertion 4 being false, which we cannot specifically ascertain without further evidence.

By considering the information given and the inherent contradictions, the most reasonable conclusion is that there is at least one false assertion among the four, which aligns with option B.

(D) The craft of Bancheng casserole is excellent.","To make the final sentence a logical inference from the previous sentences, we need to provide a premise that connects the idea of a good wine, its associated characteristics (longer and refined craft), and the specific wine Bancheng Shaoguo.

1. The commercial suggests that good wine should be longer and more refined in craft.
2. The final sentence in the commercial directly refers to Bancheng Shaoguo as something you can drink, implying it fits the qualities of good wine.

To make this assertion logical, we need to establish that Bancheng Shaoguo meets the criteria for good wine.

- Option (A) talks about Moutai, which is unrelated to Bancheng Shaoguo or the characteristics discussed.
- Option (B) suggests that Bancheng Shaojiao is a good wine but doesn't address the need for ""longer"" or ""a refined craft,"" thereby not fully supporting the transition.
- Option (C) mentions that Bancheng casserole wine has been around for a long time, which may loosely relate to the idea of ""longer,"" but doesn't involve the craft aspect.
- Option (D) directly asserts that Bancheng casserole has excellent craftsmanship, which fits the claim that good wine should be refined in craft.

Combining Option (D) with the earlier statements allows us to logically conclude that Bancheng Shaoguo's quality is fit for consumption as a good wine. Therefore, Option (D) helps make the last line a logical inference from the preceding statements.

(B) In addition to eating European ferns, the moths they stock also eat other wild grasses that grow in the northern hemisphere. (C) The stocked moths can survive in the northern hemisphere and can form a large enough group to reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth. (D) When the number of European ferns decreases, livestock will become immune to diseases caused by this wild grass.","The proposal involves releasing moths from the southern hemisphere into the northern hemisphere to control the growth of the European fern. For this proposal to be successful, certain conditions must be met:

(A) The similarity in climate and soil conditions between the areas where European ferns grow in both hemispheres is not necessary for the success of the proposal. The primary focus is on the moths controlling the fern population in the northern hemisphere.

(B) If the moths also eat other wild grasses in the northern hemisphere, it could lead to undesirable ecological consequences by harming local ecosystems. This condition could potentially undermine the success of the proposal.

(C) The ability of the stocked moths to survive and form a large enough population is crucial. They must effectively reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth, ensuring that the moths can have a significant impact on controlling the fern population. Without this condition, the intervention would be ineffective.

(D) The focus of the proposal is on controlling the growth of European ferns, not on livestock immunity. The success of the proposal doesn't hinge on livestock becoming immune to diseases caused by the wild grass.

Given this analysis, option C is critical for the success of the moth introduction. The moths must be able to survive and control the fern population effectively. Therefore, the necessary condition for the success of the scientist's proposal is:

Cuihua loves pickled cabbage. Therefore, Nishimura loves pickled cabbage. (D) All gold glitters, so some glitters are gold.","The reasoning in the statement ""Koreans love sauerkraut and Cuihua loves sauerkraut, so Cuihua is Korean"" is flawed because it makes an erroneous assumption that sharing a characteristic implies belonging to the same group. This is a type of faulty logic known as a logical fallacy, specifically the fallacy of affirming the consequent.

Now, let's analyze each given option to find the one that mirrors this type of flawed reasoning:

(A) ""All Cretans are lying, John is Cretan, so John is lying."" - This argument is not parallel to the flawed reasoning in the initial statement. While it is a paradoxical statement (related to the ""liar paradox""), it doesn't follow the format or error of affirming the consequent.

(B) ""Walking animals have legs, and tables have legs, so tables are walking animals."" - This statement is an example of affirming the antecedent, a valid form of reasoning. It compares two things with a shared characteristic and erroneously concludes they are the same, paralleling the faulty reasoning above.

(C) ""Nishimura loves Cuihua. Cuihua loves pickled cabbage. Therefore, Nishimura loves pickled cabbage."" - This presents a similar faulty logic where the characteristic of liking something is incorrectly transferred due to a relationship with someone else; this isn't quite analogous to the original flaw but instead another fallacious conclusion.

(D) ""All gold glitters, so some glitters are gold."" - This is an example of a logical fallacy as well, where the conclusion reached is unsupported and assumes a reverse relationship. However, it doesn't mirror the same structure or problem as the original argument.

Option (B) captures the essence of the flawed logic used in the original statement, as it also incorrectly deduces that because two different entities share a characteristic, they must belong to the same group or be equivalent in nature.

(A) Only by increasing the scale of economic development and accelerating the speed of economic development can more jobs be created. (B) There is a certain relationship between the scale and speed of economic development and the social employment rate. (C) If a person is unemployed, it will affect the life of himself and his family. (D) Unemployed people are easily irritable, emotionally depressed, and deviant.","To analyze the argument presented in the question stem, let's break it down:

The problem identified is a high unemployment rate and the threat it poses to social stability, caused by laid-off workers from state-owned enterprises and the influx of migrant workers. The proposed solution is to increase the scale and speed of economic development.

The question asks us to identify which option provides the strongest support for this solution.

(A) ""Only by increasing the scale of economic development and accelerating the speed of economic development can more jobs be created."" 
- This option directly links the proposed solution (economic growth) with the desired outcome (job creation), suggesting that such economic measures are crucial for addressing unemployment. It provides strong support for the argument by explicitly stating that economic development is necessary for job creation.

(B) ""There is a certain relationship between the scale and speed of economic development and the social employment rate.""
- This option is more general and does not specify the nature or strength of the relationship. It indicates that economic factors influence employment, but it lacks the specificity and assertiveness of option A.

(C) ""If a person is unemployed, it will affect the life of himself and his family.""
- This statement describes the impact of unemployment on individuals and families but does not directly support or oppose the argument about economic development as a solution.

(D) ""Unemployed people are easily irritable, emotionally depressed, and deviant.""
- This statement discusses the psychological effects of unemployment but does not address how economic development would alleviate such issues.

Among the options, (A) provides the strongest support for the argument because it clearly ties the proposed actions (increasing the scale and speed of economic development) to creating more jobs, which is the primary goal to address the high unemployment rate and its threats to social stability.

1. **Condition**: If W is on, then X must be on.
   
2. **Condition**: Only off turn on S to turn off T.
   - Since S is on, this implies that T must be off because S being on doesn't flip T to any other state.

3. **Condition**: T and X cannot be connected at the same time, nor can they be turned off at the same time.
   - Since T is off (from condition 2), X must be on to satisfy this requirement.

4. **Condition**: If Y and Z are turned on at the same time, then W must also be turned on.

Let's cross-check the options:

- **Option (A)**: T is the on state and Y is the off state.
  - T cannot be on; hence (A) is incorrect.

- **Option (B)**: Both T and Y are off.
  - T is confirmed to be off. For this statement to be true, Y must also be off, but we have no definitive evidence about Y's state in the conditions directly affecting T.

- **Option (C)**: Both W and T are on.
  - T cannot be on, so this option is incorrect.

- **Option (D)**: X is the on state and Y is the off state.
  - From the analysis, X must be on since T is off (condition 3). This is consistent. Y being off is not directly determined, but does not contradict existing conditions. 

The known logic leads us to conclude option (D) is the most consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, this option has to be true, regardless of Y's unspecified state because it doesn't cause a contradiction, and X must be on.

145,"There are 7 heart disease patients E, F, G, H, I, J, K to be assigned to 4 doctors for treatment, they are Dr. Zhang, Dr. Li, Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu. Only one doctor is responsible for each patient, and each doctor is responsible for the treatment of up to two patients. Among the patients, J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults; E, F, and J are males, and the remaining 4 are females. The following conditions must be met? (1) Dr. Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients. (2) Dr. Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient. (3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?
(A) Doctor F is responsible for treatment. (B) J is treated by Dr. Zhang. (C) C is treated by Dr. Liu. (D) H is treated by Dr. Wang.","To determine which of the statements must be true, let's go through the process of assignment based on the provided conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** Dr. Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.  
   Male patients: E, F, J  
   Therefore, Dr. Zhang can only treat these patients.

2. **Condition 2:** Dr. Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.  
   
3. **Condition 3:** If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.  
   Child patients are J (male) and K (female).  
   This means if Dr. Zhang treats J (a male child), he must also treat an adult male (E or F).  
   If a doctor treats K (a female child), they must also treat an adult female (G, H, or I).

Let's apply these conditions and deduce who must treat whom:

- Dr. Zhang can treat two male patients. If he treats J (a male child), he must treat an adult male as well, either E or F.

- Since Dr. Li can only treat one patient and conditions for child treatment require the doctor to treat both a child and an adult of the same sex, Dr. Li cannot treat a child if treating them requires treating someone else.

- Dr. Zhang could treat J and either E or F as the male patients.

Now analyzing the statements:

**Option A:** Doctor F does not exist as one of the doctors (this seems to be a typo or incorrect option). Hence, this cannot be true.

**Option B:** J is treated by Dr. Zhang.  
If Dr. Zhang treats male patients and we need to maximize the constraints, it makes sense for Dr. Zhang to treat J (a male child) and either E or F to satisfy condition 3 (one child and one adult male).

**Option C:** C is treated by Dr. Liu.  
Since C is not one of the patients, this option seems irrelevant or meant to confuse.

**Option D:** H is treated by Dr. Wang.  
H being female could potentially be treated by Dr. Wang or Dr. Liu since there are no constraints specifically for the doctor assignment given in the problem.

Given this evaluation, statement B must be true according to the constraints, as it logically follows from assigning Dr. Zhang only to male patients, satisfying the conditions.

Each of the following patients can be treated by Dr. Li, except which one?
(A) E. (B) G. (C) I. (D) K.","To solve this problem, let's analyze the conditions given and apply them to find the patient that Dr. Li cannot treat. 

1. Dr. Zhang only treats male patients. Therefore, Dr. Zhang can treat E, F, or J, as these are the male patients. 
2. Dr. Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.
3. If a doctor treats a child patient, they must also treat an adult patient of the same sex as the child. This condition restricts certain possible pairings for doctors who treat child patients.

Let's examine the options:

- **Patient E**: E is a male adult. Dr. Li can treat E since there are no conditions violated here.
  
- **Patient G**: G is a female adult. Dr. Li can treat G as there are no conditions violated here.
  
- **Patient I**: I is a female adult. Again, Dr. Li can treat I without violating any conditions.
  
- **Patient K**: K is a male child. If Dr. Li were to treat K, Dr. Li would also need to treat a male adult due to condition 3. However, Dr. Li can only be responsible for one patient (condition 2), making it impossible for Dr. Li to satisfy both condition 2 and condition 3 simultaneously if treating K.

Therefore, the patient that Dr. Li cannot treat is K.

(A) Doctor F is responsible for treatment. (B) H is treated by Dr. Liu. (C) G is treated by Dr. Wang. (D) K is treated by Dr. Liu.","To solve the problem, we need to consider the constraints given in the question and figure out the possible assignments of doctors to the patients.

Firstly, let's outline the constraints:
1. Dr. Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.
2. Dr. Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.
3. If a doctor treats a child patient, they must also treat an adult patient of the same sex.

Patients:
- J and K are children.
- E, F, and J are males.
- H, I, G, and K are females.

Let's go through the patients one by one given the clue that E is treated by Dr. Wang:

- E is a male, so Dr. Zhang could have treated him based on constraint 1, but we know E is treated by Dr. Wang.
- Dr. Zhang can treat J or F, as they are the other male patients. Since E is not treated by Dr. Zhang, Dr. Zhang must treat J (to meet the condition of a male child treated by treating an adult male as well). Therefore, Dr. Zhang treats both J and F.
- Dr. Li can treat only one patient. Since Dr. Li must follow the condition of treating one child and one adult (if treating a child), and Dr. Zhang already treats J, Dr. Li cannot treat a child. So, Dr. Li treats one adult, either G or H or I.
- Dr. Liu must treat K (a child). As per constraint 3, Dr. Liu must then also treat an adult female patient (since K is female).

Now let’s try to assign patients to the doctors:

1. Dr. Zhang treats J (child male) and F (adult male).
2. Dr. Li treats either H, I, or G (only one patient).
3. Dr. Liu treats K (child female) and I or G (adult female).
4. Dr. Wang treats E (the original given condition) and one of the remaining adults not chosen by Dr. Liu or Dr. Li.

Since E is already placed with Dr. Wang, Dr. Liu taking K and another female results in Dr. Li treating the last adult female or male, rather than H.

By assigning Dr. Liu to K and I, or another combination, Dr. Wang gets the remaining possible adult, either H or G.

By deduction and elimination, one consistent conclusion aligns with several combinations and respect the gender rule; therefore, within the options given:

(B) H is treated by Dr. Liu.

(D) Dr. Wang is responsible for the treatment of E and K.","To solve this question, we need to carefully analyze the conditions provided to determine which doctor can treat which patient under the given circumstances.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. Dr. Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.
2. Dr. Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient, which is G in this case.
3. If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then they must also treat an adult patient of the same sex as the child.

Given that Dr. Li treats G, we must determine the allocations for the rest, keeping in mind other constraints.

Now let's analyze each option:

(A) Dr. Liu is responsible for the treatment of E and F:
- E and F are both males. However, Dr. Zhang should treat male patients unless the allocation constraints force otherwise.

(B) H and I are treated by Dr. Liu:
- Both H and I are females. Since there's no constraint directly preventing this, this could be a possible allocation.

(C) I and K are treated by Dr. Wang:
- I is female and K is a male child. If Dr. Wang treats K (a male child), Dr. Wang should also treat an adult male. However, I is female, making this option not feasible.

(D) Dr. Wang is responsible for the treatment of E and K:
- E is a male adult and K is a male child. This satisfies Condition 3, as Dr. Wang is treating a child and an adult of the same sex.

Based on the analysis:

- Option (A) falls short as E and F are both males, better fitting Dr. Zhang if possible.
- Option (B) is possible as there are no specific constraints against it.
- Option (C) is not feasible due to gender mismatch as per Condition 3.
- Option (D) satisfies all given conditions, making it true under these constraints.

(C) Dr. Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient. (D) Dr. Liu is responsible for treating at least one child patient.","To solve this problem, let's break down the constraints and see if we can assign the patients to doctors based on the given conditions:

1. **Patients:**
   - J, K are children.
   - E, F, J are males; G, H, I, K are females.

2. **Doctors and Conditions:**
   - Dr. Zhang can only treat male patients.
   - Dr. Li can only treat one patient.
   - If a doctor treats a child, they must also treat an adult of the same sex.

3. **Assigning Patients:**

   - **Dr. Zhang:** He can treat males only. The male patients are E, F, J.
     - Possible assignment: E and F (since J is a child and would require another adult male to be assigned to the same doctor, but no other male is left if Dr. Li can only handle one patient).
   
   - **Dr. Li:** Can treat only one patient. With constraint (3), Dr. Li can treat an adult or a child.
     - Possible assignment for Dr. Li: Let him treat one adult female: H (for example).
   
   - **Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu:** They must handle the remaining patients, keeping in mind the constraint if a child is assigned.
     - Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu need to manage J, K, G, and I.

4. **Applying Constraint 3:**
   - If a doctor treats a child, he must also treat an adult of the same sex.
     - J is male, K is female.
     - One of them can handle a pair like (J and G) or (K and I), or some variation that fulfills the condition.

   - **Assigning Dr. Wang:**
     - (Option A) Dr. Wang needs to treat at least one female.
     - Possible assignment: Let Dr. Wang handle G and I. This ensures Dr. Wang treats at least one female, fulfilling constraint (A).

5. **Assigning Dr. Liu:**
   - Dr. Liu should then be responsible for the remaining patients J and K.
     - Therefore, Dr. Liu treats one male (J) and one female (K).

Based on these assignments and the constraints given, one conclusion that consistently needs to be true in every setup is:

**Dr. Liu needs to manage J as a male child and can cover K as the female child. This fits constraint (3) as Dr. Liu can cover both a male and a female.**

Hence, this setup shows that Dr. Liu must treat at least one male patient (J), covering option **(C).**

(A) Anna went to Zhangjiajie. (B) Li Shan went to Xi'an. (C) Zhang Lin went to Dalian. (D) John went to Hangzhou.","To determine the most correct answer, let's analyze the situation using the given conditions:

1. Each person can only go to one place.
2. Wherever Chinese students go, foreign students must go.
3. Where there are foreign students, Chinese students must go.
4. John went to Xi'an or Hangzhou, and Zhao Qiang went to Zhangjiajie.

We are given that Jesse goes to Dalian.

Now, we must analyze what happens given each option:

(A) Anna went to Zhangjiajie:
- If Anna goes to Zhangjiajie, then per condition (3), at least one Chinese student must also go there. Since Zhao Qiang already went to Zhangjiajie, this condition is satisfied regardless of Anna's presence. However, only Jesse going to Dalian merely suggests Anna does not necessarily have to go to Zhangjiajie, i.e., no necessity here because Jesse's presence doesn't influence Anna's alone.

(B) Li Shan went to Xi'an:
- There's no direct reasoning leading Li Shan to go to Xi'an based on Jesse going to Dalian. Thus, this option doesn't seem necessarily true.

(C) Zhang Lin went to Dalian:
- Let us consider the condition that wherever Chinese students go, foreign students must go, and vice-versa. Jesse is a foreign student, and he's going to Dalian. There must be at least one Chinese student going to Dalian because Jesse (a foreign student) is going there. Therefore, Zhang Lin must go to Dalian to satisfy the condition (2). This condition ensures that Zhang Lin follows, making this answer true.

(D) John went to Hangzhou:
- Knowing John could have either gone to Xi'an or Hangzhou does not get restricted from Jesse going to Dalian. John's movement to any specific location cannot be concluded by Jesse going to Dalian.

Conclusively, by process of elimination and aligning with condition (2) and (3), the only viable, necessary condition based on Jesse going to Dalian is that a Chinese student is present, ensuring Zhang Lin goes to Dalian.

If the conclusion of the question is true, which two people cannot go to Hangzhou at the same time?
(A) Zhang Lin and Li Shan. (B) Li Shan and Anna. (C) Jesse and Anna. (D) Zhang Lin and Jessie.","To determine which two people cannot go to Hangzhou at the same time, let’s analyze the statements given in the problem:

1. Each person can only go to one place.
2. Wherever Chinese students go, foreign students must go.
3. Where there are foreign students, Chinese students must go.
4. John went to Xi'an or Hangzhou.
5. Zhao Qiang went to Zhangjiajie.

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If John goes to Xi'an, Jesse and Anna must also be in Xi'an because ""wherever Chinese students go, foreign students must go"" and vice versa.
- If John goes to Hangzhou, Jesse and Anna must also go to Hangzhou if any Chinese students are there. 

Now, consider Zhao Qiang, who must be in Zhangjiajie. This implies that wherever there are foreign students, he or another Chinese student must also be present, but since he is in Zhangjiajie, this means that John could not be with Zhao Qiang unless they are both at Zhangjiajie, which contradicts the options for John (Xi'an or Hangzhou).

Now, look at who can be with Zhao Qiang at Zhangjiajie:
- Since Zhao Qiang is already at Zhangjiajie, no foreign students can be at Zhangjiajie, otherwise, they wouldn't meet the condition of ""foreign students must accompany a Chinese student.""

Applying all these constraints to the premise:

- If John is in Xi'an, none of the other Chinese students could be in Hangzhou unless their foreign counterparts (Jesse and Anna) are also permitted because it would violate the rule of ""where one group is, the other must follow or lead.""

To isolate who cannot both be in Hangzhou, ponder over:
- John and Anna cannot be in Hangzhou simultaneously if another student is to go to Zhangjiajie other than Zhao Qiang because this breaks the uniformity of the other conditions necessary to establish the locations of all present Chinese and foreign delegates. But since Zhao Qiang is distinctly in Zhangjiajie, the inability to pair together in Hangzhou among the list should be closer to mutual or distantly bound choices amid Jesse and Anna, both not individually tied to a placement besides John or the broader decisions.

Thus, further logical simplification and trials present that Jesse and Anna, foreign students influenced by John's placement, hold a unique orientation. If John chooses Hangzhou, the mutual exclusivity of placement keeps them apart on pair analysis, leading us to:

(D) The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects.","To solve this problem, we need to focus on the information given and consider what conclusions can logically be drawn.

1. We are told that Xiao Qiang's study time is longer than Xiao Gang's. This indicates that Xiao Qiang spends more time studying but does not directly imply anything about his knowledge, intelligence, or life treatment effectiveness.

2. We also know that Xiao Qiang has more books than Xiao Gang. Again, this fact suggests an availability of resources for Xiao Qiang but does not directly indicate his knowledge level, intelligence, or how effectively he handles life.

Let's examine each option based on this information:

(A) Xiao Qiang's knowledge is richer than Xiao Gang's.  
While studying longer and having more books may enhance knowledge, the statement does not guarantee richer knowledge, as the quality of study or comprehension is not addressed.

(B) Xiao Qiang himself is smarter than Xiao Gang.
The information given does not provide any evidence about the innate intelligence of either brother. Studying longer or possessing more books does not inherently equate to being smarter.

(C) Xiao Qiang's treatment of life is more effective than Xiao Gang's treatment.
There is no information to assess the effectiveness of life treatment based solely on study time and the number of books.

(D) The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects.
This option correctly states that the current information is insufficient to definitively compare other aspects of Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang's lives, such as knowledge richness, intelligence, or life treatment effectiveness.

It emphasizes persistence and effort until failure is truly unavoidable. Here's how each option holds up:

(A) ""The real strong will never accept failure."" - This is too absolute. The passage acknowledges that failure may eventually be accepted, but only when it's a final fact, not something that should never happen.

(B) ""Only when failure becomes a fact that cannot be changed, will the real strong accept failure."" - This statement aligns with the lesson in the passage. It speaks to the notion of continuing to strive for victory until there is absolutely no possible way to succeed, at which point accepting failure becomes reasonable.

(C) ""Losers will easily accept failure."" - This statement is not directly supported by the passage. The passage focuses more on the characteristics of the strong rather than defining what losers do.

(D) ""As the song that the female line sings loves to say, the sunshine is always behind the wind and rain."" - This is metaphorical and poetical. While it captures a hopeful sentiment similar to the passage's, it's not a direct conclusion that can be logically deduced from the given text.

154,"A rare and endangered animal of the northern salamander in Xinjiang. It was first discovered by a Russian explorer in 1840, but disappeared for more than 100 years. It was rediscovered in Hot Spring County, Xinjiang in 1898. But the data shows that in the 15 years since 1898, the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang has been reduced by half. Some experts believe that the habitat of the northern salamander in Xinjiang was originally a local pasture, and the cattle and sheep walking around on the grassland in summer will trample them to death, resulting in a sharp decline in their numbers. Which of the following is true will raise the most doubts about the opinions of the above experts?
(A) In 1997, the ""Hot Spring Xinjiang Northern Salamander Nature Reserve"" was established, and local herders' awareness of protecting Xinjiang Northern Salamander is increasing. (B) In recent years, the rainfall has decreased and the groundwater level has fallen, which has affected the water source environment in which the northern salamander in Xinjiang lives. (C) Xinjiang salamander is a kind of animal that is afraid of light. Most of them hide under the rocks of the creek during the day, and avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep. (D) Xinjiang's northern salamanders are located in the mountains, and most tourists cannot enter at all.","To evaluate which statement raises the most doubts about the experts' opinion regarding the decline in the northern salamander population in Xinjiang, we need to analyze how each statement interacts with the experts' explanation.

The experts attribute the sharp decline in the number of northern salamanders to cattle and sheep trampling them in their pasture habitat.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) ""In 1997, the 'Hot Spring Xinjiang Northern Salamander Nature Reserve' was established, and local herders' awareness of protecting Xinjiang Northern Salamander is increasing.""  
This statement suggests increased protection after 1997, creating a reserve and awareness that would likely reduce trampling, but it does not directly challenge the initial claim regarding past decline.

(B) ""In recent years, the rainfall has decreased and the groundwater level has fallen, which has affected the water source environment in which the northern salamander in Xinjiang lives.""  
This statement introduces an alternative reason for the decline, potentially independent of trampling. However, it does not directly refute the trampling explanation.

(C) ""Xinjiang salamander is a kind of animal that is afraid of light. Most of them hide under the rocks of the creek during the day, and avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep.""  
This statement directly undermines the experts' claim by suggesting that the salamanders naturally avoid trampling by hiding, thus raising significant doubts about trampling as the primary cause of decline.

(D) ""Xinjiang's northern salamanders are located in the mountains, and most tourists cannot enter at all.""  
This statement does not relate directly to the trampling hypothesis, as it only indicates limited tourist access, not addressing the presence of cattle.

The statement that raises the most doubt about the experts' opinion is option (C), which makes it less likely that the salamanders were significantly trampled by cattle and sheep.

(C) The United States thinks that the ""9.11 incident"" did not happen, and the ""9.11 incident"" really did not happen.
- This statement indicates that merely thinking something did not happen means it did not happen. It doesn't seem to relate intention with reality, unlike Bush's logic, but rather question perception and reality, which doesn't align with the conflation in Bush's logic.

(D) If the Iraq War is not waged, there will be no more than 1,000 Americans killed in Iraq.
- This statement makes a prediction about the outcome contingent upon an action or lack of action. It doesn't follow Bush's logic of equating intent and action in WMD possession, but rather speaks to outcomes based on actions taken.

The option that does not apply to Bush’s logic is option C. It is about perception and occurrence, unrelated to the intent versus reality conundrum that exemplifies Bush's reasoning.

157,"There are six statements A. B, C, D, E, and F in a database, but this database is currently uncoordinated, and certain statements must be deleted to restore the coordination of the database. Known? (1) If statement A is retained, then statement B and statement C must be retained. (2) If statement E is retained, statement D and statement C must be deleted at the same time. (3) Statement F can only be retained if statement E is retained. (4) Statement A is important information and cannot be deleted. If the above items are true, which of the following must be true?
(A) Keep statement E and delete statement C. (B) At the same time retain the statement C and statement D. (C) Keep statement E and delete statement D. (D) Delete statement E and statement F at the same time.","To determine which statements must be deleted or retained to restore the coordination of the database, let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step:

1. If statement A is retained, then statements B and C must be retained.
   - Since statement A is important and cannot be deleted, B and C must also be retained.

2. If statement E is retained, then statements D and C must be deleted.
   - However, from the first condition, statement C must be retained. Therefore, statement E cannot be retained because its retention conflicts with the requirement to keep statement C.

3. Statement F can only be retained if statement E is retained.
   - Since statement E cannot be retained, statement F must also be deleted.

4. Statement A is important and cannot be deleted.
   - As noted in the first point, A, B, and C must be retained.

Based on these analyses:

- Statement E cannot be retained because it conflicts with retaining statement C. Therefore, E and F must be deleted.
- Statement C must be retained because of the first condition and therefore conflicts with option (B).
  
Thus, the only valid option is:
(D) Delete statement E and statement F at the same time.

So, the correct answer is:

158,"The brain tissue of animals with behavior disorder contains a large amount of aluminum. Because a silicon-based compound can fix these aluminum elements and prevent them from affecting brain tissue, this compound can be used to treat behavioral disorders in animals. The above argument is based on which of the following unstated premises?
(A) There are no side effects after introducing these silicon-based compounds into the brain. (B) These aluminum elements are the cause of behavior disorder, not the result. (C) Different kinds of animals require different amounts of silicon-based compounds for treatment. (D) Normal animal brain tissue does not contain aluminum.","To evaluate the argument, we need to identify the underlying assumption that links the presence of aluminum in brain tissue to the potential effectiveness of a silicon-based compound in treating behavioral disorders. 

The argument goes as follows: 
1. Animals with behavioral disorders have large amounts of aluminum in their brain tissue.
2. A silicon-based compound can fix these aluminum elements and prevent them from affecting the brain tissue.
3. Therefore, the compound can be used to treat behavioral disorders.

The unstated premise that must hold true for this argument to be valid is that aluminum is not merely correlated with behavioral disorders but is actually a causal factor in them. This means that removing or neutralizing the aluminum will directly address and potentially alleviate the disorder.

Let's analyze the options:
- (A) This premise concerns the safety of the silicon-based compound but does not address the causal link between aluminum and behavioral disorders.
- (B) This premise directly addresses the causal relationship by asserting that the aluminum elements are the cause of behavioral disorders, not just a result, which supports the idea that treating aluminum presence will treat the disorder.
- (C) This suggests variation in treatment but does not address the causal link.
- (D) This implies that aluminum is not part of normal brain function, but it does not establish causation between aluminum and behavioral disorders.

For the argument to hold, it's crucial to assume that aluminum causes the behavioral disorder, thereby supporting the use of a compound that mitigates aluminum's effects as a treatment. Therefore, the most crucial unstated premise is option (B).

(A) Triangles can be divided into three types? right triangle, obtuse triangle, and acute triangle. The sum of three internal angles of a right triangle is equal to 180 ℃, the sum of three internal angles of an obtuse triangle is equal to 180 ℃, and the sum of three internal angles of an acute triangle is equal to 180 ℃, so the sum of the triangles of all triangles is equal to 180 ℃.

It's an argument that concludes ""invisible"" things are more valuable than ""visible"" ones based on listed examples of things.

Let's analyze each option in terms of its reasoning method:

(A) This option discusses different types of triangles and the sum of their internal angles. It generalizes that the internal angles always add up to 180° for triangles. This is a mathematical fact, not a generalization about value based on the distinctiveness of particular attributes, so it doesn’t match the reasoning method.

(B) This option talks about a preference for ""accidental"" over ""necessary"" by giving various examples where unexpected occurrences lead to positive outcomes. It then concludes with a declaration of love for ""accidental."" This mirrors a similar pattern of preference and conclusion based on specific examples, much like the question's argument about valuing the ""invisible."" Thus, it uses the same reasoning method.

(C) This option is a critique of examination policies, arguing students should be allowed to use textbooks during exams, paralleling other professionals using resources in their work. This is a comparative argument about fairness and resources, not about valuing something based on invisibility, so it does not match the question's reasoning method.

(D) This option asserts that roses are beautiful because all words are beautiful. This doesn’t engage in the same generalization or logic pattern as the question stem, as it does not create a valuation based on an invisible or inherently unseen attribute.

The option that mirrors the reasoning of valuating certain attributes based on given examples, similar to the ""invisible"" valuation, is Option (B). Therefore, the final answer is:

(D) If who is the king of sprint, whoever has the African-black descent.","Liu Xiang's victory in the 110-meter hurdles, in which he broke the Olympic record and tied the world record, challenges certain assertions about racial or ethnic capabilities in athletics, particularly sprinting. Let's analyze the assertions one by one in light of Liu Xiang's achievements and declarations:

(A) Only black athletes can become track and field champions.
- Liu Xiang, not being of African descent, becoming a track and field champion, directly rebuts this assertion. His victory disproves the claim that only black athletes can achieve this.

(B) All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players.
- Liu Xiang, being a yellow-skinned player and becoming the sprint king in the 110-meter hurdles, refutes this assertion by demonstrating that a yellow-skinned player can indeed achieve this title.

(C) Most track and field champions are black athletes.
- The fact presented does not necessarily refute this assertion. Liu Xiang's statement and victory introduce a new chapter but do not necessarily change the statistical majority of black athletes in sprint events at the time, especially historically up to that point. This assertion could still be true, even with Liu Xiang's achievement.

(D) If who is the king of sprint, whoever has the African-black descent.
- Liu Xiang's victory directly counters this assertion. As a non-African descent individual, his victory as a sprint king disproves the condition stated in this assertion.

Thus, Liu Xiang's victory and his subsequent statements do not constitute a rebuttal to assertion (C): ""Most track and field champions are black athletes."" This assertion could still hold true on a broader scale, despite Liu Xiang's individual success.

161,"Some insects die after the first propagation of the larvae, while others can survive for a few years after their next generation is guaranteed survival. The latter insects include those that make a beneficial contribution to the ecosystem, such as bees. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn from the above statement?
(A) Insects that do not play a major role in the ecosystem usually die after the first reproduction. (B) Most bees will live well after the next generation can live on their own. (C) Bees usually do not die immediately after a reproduction. (D) Most insects can live independently as soon as they are born and do not require the care of adult insects.","To analyze the statement, we start by examining the information provided:

1. Some insects die after their first generation of larvae is propagated.
2. Other insects survive several years after ensuring their next generation’s survival.
3. Bees belong to the latter group of insects that survive longer.
4. These longer-surviving insects contribute positively to the ecosystem.

Now, evaluate each option based on the given information:

(A) Insects that do not play a major role in the ecosystem usually die after the first reproduction. 
   - The statement implies that insects which play an important role (like bees) survive longer, but it does not definitively say that those not playing major roles always die after the first reproduction. This option generalizes too much without enough supporting detail.

(B) Most bees will live well after the next generation can live on their own.
   - This is not conclusively supported. While bees are part of the longer-surviving group, the term ""most"" and ""well after"" are assumptions that cannot be directly drawn from the statement.

(C) Bees usually do not die immediately after a reproduction.
   - This is a reasonable conclusion because bees are mentioned as part of the group of insects that survive for years after their offspring’s survival is assured. Thus, they typically don't die immediately after reproduction.

(D) Most insects can live independently as soon as they are born and do not require the care of adult insects.
   - The statement doesn't provide any information about insect independence at birth or the need (or lack thereof) for parental care.

The conclusion most directly supported by the statement is option C because it accurately reflects the information provided about bees surviving longer and contributing to the ecosystem. Therefore, the most correct answer is:

162,"The media has recently been filled with gossip news about a celebrity, which puts the celebrity in an awkward situation? if she does not come forward to clarify and refute, those rumors will be believed by the public; if she comes forward to clarify and refute, This will attract more people's attention and make those gossip news spread faster and wider. This may be the price that celebrities have to pay. If the statement in the stem is true, which of the following must be true?
(A) The celebrity can't actually stop the gossip news from damaging her personal reputation. (B) The reputation of a celebrity will not be affected by gossip news in the media. (C) When faced with gossip news, the best strategy the celebrity can take is to clarify the truth. (D) Some friends of the celebrity came forward to praise her, which would have a counter-effect.","To analyze the given situation, let's outline the key premises:

1. A celebrity is facing gossip news.
2. If the celebrity does not refute the rumors, the public will likely believe them.
3. If the celebrity does refute the rumors, it will attract more attention and could cause the gossip to spread further and faster.

Given these premises, we need to determine which of the answer choices must be true:

(A) The celebrity can't actually stop the gossip news from damaging her personal reputation.
- If the celebrity is in a situation where addressing the rumors could amplify them, and ignoring them could lead to public belief in the rumors, it suggests a lack of effective options to control damage to her reputation. This makes option A likely true.

(B) The reputation of a celebrity will not be affected by gossip news in the media.
- This contradicts the scenario presented, where gossip could plausibly affect her reputation whether she acts or not. Thus, option B cannot be true.

(C) When faced with gossip news, the best strategy the celebrity can take is to clarify the truth.
- The scenario implies that clarifying and refuting will attract more attention, making this option less viable as a ""best"" strategy. There isn't enough information to confirm this as a must-be-true statement given the risk of increasing exposure by refuting.

(D) Some friends of the celebrity came forward to praise her, which would have a counter-effect.
- There is no direct connection in the provided scenario between friends praising her and the impact on the gossip's spread or containment. Hence, this option lacks substantial backing from the premises.

Considering the analysis of the given statements, option (A) aligns most closely with the logical consequences of the premises, suggesting a lack of effective mitigation options for the celebrity.

(A) Neither Mr Zhang nor Ms Wang bought Mongolian knives. (B) Mr. Zhang bought a Mongolian knife, but Ms. Wang did not. (C) Mr. Li of the tour group bought a Mongolian knife. (D) Both Mr Zhang and Ms Wang bought Mongolian knives.","To solve the problem, we need to analyze the statements given and identify which one is true since only one can be true.

1. **Someone bought a Mongolian knife.**
2. **Someone did not buy a Mongolian knife.**
3. **Both Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang of the regiment bought Mongolian knives.**

Let's evaluate the possibilities:

- If statement (1) is true, then someone bought a Mongolian knife. This would imply that statement (3) could also be true simultaneously since Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang are ""someone."" Therefore, (1) cannot be true alone since (3) could also be true, contradicting the condition that only one statement is true.

- If statement (2) is true, then someone did not buy a Mongolian knife. Now let's check its consistency with the others:
  - If (2) is true, (3) cannot be true because both purchasing would contradict (2). Thus, assuming (2) as true and (3) as false does not lead to a contradiction.
  - Now, evaluate it with (1): If statement (2) is true, then statement (1) being true would not contradict statement (2) being false, meaning the reverse must also be true — if only one person did not buy a knife, others could have.
  
- If statement (3) is true, both Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang bought Mongolian knives. 
  - This contradicts statement (2) since if both bought, statement (2) that ""someone did not buy"" would not hold. Thus, only one statement being true condition fails because statement (3) being true implies either statement (1) could also be true. 

Thus, statement (2) being true fulfills the condition of only one statement being true without contradiction, given:

- Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang cannot both have bought the knife, as that would make both statement (1) and (3) true.
- So neither Mr. Zhang nor Ms. Wang could have bought a knife.

Therefore, the true situation complies with option (A): Neither Mr. Zhang nor Ms. Wang bought Mongolian knives.

(A) If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt. (B) In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt. (C) If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy. (D) In the next two years, Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve the goal of increasing by 20%.","To solve this, let's first analyze what we know from the statement:

1. Green Island needs to increase productivity by 10% in the next two years to avoid bankruptcy.
2. Green Island's production and management structure is such that if it can increase productivity by 10%, it can also increase it by 20%.

Now let's examine each option:

(A) If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.  
- This statement is not necessarily true. Green Island only needs a 10% increase to avoid bankruptcy. The statement does not require a 20% increase unless stated otherwise.

(B) In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.  
- This statement must be true. Since Green Island needs a minimum of 10% to avoid bankruptcy, an increase of 20% would certainly ensure it does not go bankrupt.

(C) If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.  
- This statement is not necessarily true or necessarily related to the conditions provided. The statement relates only to the need to increase productivity to avoid bankruptcy, regardless of market changes.

(D) In the next two years, Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve the goal of increasing by 20%.  
- This statement is contradicted by our knowledge that Green Island can achieve a 20% increase if it can secure a 10% increase.

From this analysis, the statement that must be true with the given information is (B) because an increase of 20% ensures that Green Island will not go bankrupt, as it exceeds the minimum requirement of a 10% increase.

165,"There is a toxin-producing microorganism that turns sea water into red. This phenomenon is called red tide. When the main food source of sea otters is contaminated with red tide toxins, sea otters will not forage in those areas.

Which of the following is true will most strongly indicate that the above explanation is incorrect?
(A) In some sea areas where red tides appear, there are no clams or sea otters. (B) A small amount of red tide toxin will not cause any harm, but a large amount of this toxin will kill sea otters. (C) When a piece of seawater affected by the red tide was artificially dyed brown-red, the sea otters did not eat the clams in those places. (D) The presence of sea otters in a certain sea area is a remarkable sign that other marine life can be found there.","To evaluate which option most strongly indicates that the explanation of sea otters tasting clams to detect toxins is incorrect, let's analyze the options:

(A) The fact that some sea areas with red tide have no clams or sea otters does not directly challenge the explanation, as it merely describes an environment without the presence of the organisms being studied. Hence, it does not disprove or contradict the taste-testing hypothesis.

(B) This option mentions that a small amount of red tide toxin is not harmful, implying sea otters could afford to taste-test without fatal consequences. However, this does not invalidate the hypothesis that they taste the clams before foraging more widely.

(C) This option presents a scenario where sea otters avoid clams in artificially dyed seawater, which suggests that the visual cue of red coloration, rather than tasting for toxins, prevents sea otters from consuming clams. This directly challenges the argument that sea otters rely on tasting to detect toxins, as they are also avoiding areas based on the visual appearance.

(D) This option states that the presence of sea otters indicates other marine life, but it does not relate to the taste-testing explanation, as it is more about the ecological surroundings and not specific sea otter behaviors relating to detecting toxins.

Out of all the options, (C) provides an alternative explanation for why sea otters avoid certain foraging areas infected with red tide. This suggests that sea otters might be responding to visual cues rather than taste-testing and therefore the explanation in the paragraph (that they rely on tasting to avoid toxins) might be incorrect.

(A) Professor Huck attended the conference. (B) Professor Mas participated in the conference. (C) Professor Regg attended the conference. (D) Both Professor Huck and Professor Mas participated in the conference.","To solve this problem, we must evaluate each piece of information:

1. **At least one of Professor Huck, Professor Maas, and Professor Regg participated in the conference.**

2. **If Professor Huck participates in this conference, then Professor Maas must participate.**  
   This means that if Huck attends, Maas necessarily attends too. However, if Maas attends, it does not automatically imply that Huck attends.

3. **Anyone who wants to register for the conference must submit an English academic paper.**  
   Professor Leigh submitted a German paper, which is not relevant unless converted to the requirement of English. Thus, this information does not directly affect the participation of the three professors in question.

Let's consider the possibilities:

- If only Professor Maas attends, we satisfy the condition that at least one of the named professors participates without contradicting any other information provided.  

- If Professor Maas attends, it could be that if Professor Huck did attend, then Maas would automatically have to attend as per statement (2). 

- We don't have any information about Professor Regg, independent of the other professors. Professor Regg could attend without any of these conditions weighing on him, and he can attend on his own without impact on the other options.

Given the information and relying solely on the available assertions:

- There is no direct requirement that necessarily dictates that Professor Huck attends.
- Consequently, there is no automatic implication that Professor Maas attends unless conditioned by Professor Huck's attendance. 

Therefore, without any conditions affecting him, the possible answer, following logic, would not guarantee Huss, Maas, or Regg would attend specifically. 

From the above analysis, since we only have a secure conditional on the consecutive relationship, the answer that must be true based on the initial condition (1) and the secure link (2) without explicit claims or requirements but potentially satisfies, relies on the reserve solution, which is that mass (whom could stand independently if obliged by H but is not absent under conditions):

Therefore, a large amount of rainfall must be the cause of the hurricane that increases the pressure of the airflow. Which of the following arguments contains defects most similar to those in the above argument?
(A) Cars drive faster on long streets than on short streets, so pedestrians on long streets are more dangerous than pedestrians on short streets. (B) Many people who later become entrepreneurs often participate in competitive sports when they are in college. Therefore, participation in competitive sports must promote the ability to make people entrepreneurs. (C) The petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will be closed at noon, so the petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will definitely open at night. (D) The events in Eastern Europe will affect the political situation in Central America, so the liberalization of Eastern Europe will lead to the liberalization of Central America.","To evaluate the argument and identify a similarly flawed argument from the given options, let's first break down the logic of the original argument:

**Original Argument:**  
1. Heavy rainfall south of the Sahara Desert leads to frequent hurricanes in the continental United States.
2. This is because the rainfall is assumed to increase airflow pressure.
3. Therefore, a large amount of rainfall must cause hurricanes by increasing airflow pressure.

The flaw here is **causal oversimplification** or **correlation implies causation**. The argument attributes the primary cause of hurricanes solely to rainfall and the resultant increase in airflow pressure, ignoring other factors that could contribute to hurricane formation. 

Now let's examine the options:

**(A) Cars drive faster on long streets than on short streets, so pedestrians on long streets are more dangerous than pedestrians on short streets.**  
- This makes a causal connection based on location and speed but doesn't clearly show a causation error similar to the original argument.

**(B) Many people who later become entrepreneurs often participate in competitive sports when they are in college. Therefore, participation in competitive sports must promote the ability to make people entrepreneurs.**  
- This argument attributes entrepreneurship ability (effect) solely to participation in sports (cause), exhibiting a similar causal oversimplification flaw. It fails to consider other contributing factors or that correlation does not imply causation.

**(C) The petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will be closed at noon, so the petals of mulberry chrysanthemum will definitely open at night.**  
- This assumes a definitive contrast based on observed timing, not on causal oversimplification akin to the original argument.

**(D) The events in Eastern Europe will affect the political situation in Central America, so the liberalization of Eastern Europe will lead to the liberalization of Central America.**  
- While this suggests a causal link, it doesn’t replicate the same type of causal simplification as the original argument.

The argument in option **(B)** is most similar to the original because it takes a correlation (college sports participation and later entrepreneurship) and incorrectly assumes a direct causal relationship, ignoring other potential contributing factors or intervening variables.

168,"It is generally believed that the result of tossing a coin of uniform quality is random. But in fact, the result of tossing is determined by the momentum of the coin toss and the initial height. Nonetheless, it is very difficult to accurately predict the outcome of a coin toss. Which of the following is most helpful in explaining the phenomenon mentioned in the title, that is, the result of the throw is determined by certain factors, but it is difficult to predict?
(A) For a long time, tossing coins has been used as a typical example of random events. (B) If you toss a coin of uneven quality, the result can always be accurately predicted. (C) If the initial height of the coin toss remains stable, the result of the coin toss will be determined solely by the tossing force. (D) Accurate prediction of coin tossing results requires accurate estimation of the initial height and impulse of coin tossing.","To understand why the result of a coin toss is determined by certain factors, yet remains difficult to predict, we need to focus on the aspects that contribute to the outcome being both predictable and unpredictable.

The result of a coin toss is determined by variables such as the momentum with which it is tossed and the initial height from which it is released. These factors, in theory, should allow for an outcome prediction. However, in practice, precisely measuring these variables is challenging, which contributes to the perceived randomness of the result.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) ""For a long time, tossing coins has been used as a typical example of random events."" - This cannot explain why the result is determined by certain factors; it merely states the historical perception of coin tosses.

(B) ""If you toss a coin of uneven quality, the result can always be accurately predicted."" - This statement doesn't apply because it discusses an uneven coin, which is not the condition presented in the original scenario. Here we are concerned with the unpredictability of a fair coin toss.

(C) ""If the initial height of the coin toss remains stable, the result of the coin toss will be determined solely by the tossing force."" - While this isolates one factor (tossing force), it oversimplifies the situation and doesn't directly address the difficulty of prediction or why this difficulty arises due to factors like initial height and momentum.

(D) ""Accurate prediction of coin tossing results requires accurate estimation of the initial height and impulse of coin tossing."" - This option directly addresses both the deterministic nature (outcome depends on measurable factors like initial height and impulse) and the challenge that arises from it (the difficulty in accurately estimating these elements prevents easy prediction).

The most helpful option in explaining the phenomenon is (D) because it acknowledges both the determinism in the coin toss and the practical difficulties in achieving an accurate prediction.

169,"No notochords are catheter animals, and all pterosaurs are catheter animals. Therefore, no pterosaurs belong to the great ape family. Which of the following statements must be assumed in the above reasoning?
(A) All great apes are catheter animals. (B) All great apes are notochords. (C) No great apes are notochords. (D) No notochord is pterosaur.","To determine which statement must be assumed, let's break down the reasoning process and the premises involved:

1. No notochords are catheter animals.
2. All pterosaurs are catheter animals.
3. Therefore, no pterosaurs belong to the great ape family.

We need to identify the assumption that makes the conclusion logically valid.

The premise 1 states that no notochords are catheter animals. Hence, if something is a notochord, it cannot be a catheter animal. 

Premise 2 states that all pterosaurs are catheter animals. So, if something is a pterosaur, it must be a catheter animal.

The conclusion claims that no pterosaurs belong to the great ape family. For this to follow logically, we have to exclude the possibility of great apes being pterosaurs. In logical terms, if we show a relation between not being a notochord and not being a pterosaur, it helps solidify the exclusion.

Therefore, the statement ""No notochord is pterosaur"" (D) must be assumed in order to derive the conclusion that no pterosaurs belong to the great ape family. 

This is because if notochords are structurally or categorically excluded from being pterosaurs, and given that pterosaurs are catheter animals (and great apes can't fit in this category due to the original premise about notochords), the reasoning aligns.

(D) Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high.","Premier Wen Jiabao's statement involves understanding the complexity and challenges posed by the large population of China. The statement highlights the impact of China's population on both problems and accomplishments. A small issue can become significant when multiplied by 1.3 billion, and similarly, a major accomplishment can appear modest when divided by the same number.

Let's analyze each option considering this context:

(A) It suggests that it's hard for 1.3 billion people to lead a good life and questions the need to threaten others. This implies difficulty but does not reflect the mathematical illustration made by Premier Wen Jiabao. Therefore, it is not closely aligned.

(B) This option reflects the complexity and challenges due to China's large population, suggesting that politicians need to be cautious. It aligns with the notion that a large population makes managing issues intricate, thus corresponding more closely with Premier Wen's statement.

(C) It indicates that the large population makes it impossible to threaten other countries, which seems to focus more on geopolitical stances rather than the specific complexity and mathematical interpretation presented by Wen Jiabao.

(D) This metaphor suggests collective effort leads to success, which is unrelated to the statement's focus on the impacts of division and multiplication.

Upon reviewing the context provided and the given options, option B aligns most closely with the message that China's large population makes managing issues very complicated and requires cautious consideration. Thus, the option captures the essence of complexity and caution as highlighted by Premier Wen Jiabao's statement.

171,"Scientists applied desulfurized ash residues from some power plants to 40 acres of saline-alkali land in Inner Mongolia. As a result, corn and grass have grown in this land. The scientists concluded that the desulfurized ash residues from coal-fired power plants can be used to transform saline-alkali land. Which of the following, if true, best supports the scientist ’s conclusion?
(A) The corn grown in the saline-alkali land improved with desulfurized ash has similar growth to the corn in the fertile soil. (B) The main component of desulfurized ash is gypsum, and the use of gypsum to improve saline-alkali land has a history of more than 100 years. (C) The saline land without desulfurized ash residue is covered with dust on the 40-mu test field, and weeds are rare. (D) The contents of heavy metals and pollutants in these desulfurized ash residues have not exceeded national standards.","In order to support the scientist's conclusion that the use of desulfurized ash residues from coal-fired power plants can aid in transforming saline-alkali land, we must look for the option that provides direct evidence of the effectiveness of these residues in improving the soil's condition.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) This option states that the corn grown in the treated land has similar growth to corn in fertile soil. This supports the effectiveness of the treatment because it shows that the use of the residues brings the quality of the soil closer to that of fertile soil.

(B) This option highlights that the main component of the ash is gypsum, which has a long-standing history of improving saline-alkali land. While this shows that it is plausible for the ash to work, it does not directly support the exclusive effectiveness of the specific ash residue used in this experiment.

(C) This option describes the condition of the land without the ash residue, showing it is less favorable. This does support using the ash to improve conditions, but it is more indirect as it does not speak directly to the success of the treatment.

(D) This option assures that the ash resides within a harmless range of pollutants and heavy metals, guaranteeing safety, but does not provide insight into whether or not the ash is effective at transforming saline-alkali land.

The option that best supports the conclusion is (A), as it directly demonstrates the success of the method by comparing the outcome on the treated land to that of naturally fertile soil.

Based on the above questions, which of the following options for night duty is true?
(A) Wu on Sunday. (B) The money is on Tuesday. (C) Lee is on Tuesday. (D) Sun is on Friday.","To solve the problem, let's rely on the provided information about the shifts of the security guards: 

1. **Zheng is on Thursday.**
2. **Zhao is one day later than Sun.** Thus, if Sun is on day X, then Zhao is on day X + 1.
3. **Li is two days later than Wu.** Hence, if Wu is on day Y, then Li is on day Y + 2.
4. **Qian is three days earlier than Wang.** Therefore, if Wang is on day Z, then Qian is on day Z - 3.
5. **Qian is also before Zheng, and since Qian is three days earlier than Wang, we must adjust Wang's day. Given that Zheng is on Thursday, let's establish a timeline:**
   - If Zheng is on Thursday, then potential candidates for Thursday to Sunday are Q, S, Z, and W.

Using the information from point 5, we need to start placing the known values and work to fit the rest into the seven-day week:
- **Zheng is on Thursday.** Let's quickly try finding the places for the other days:

   - If Q (Qian) is three days before some day Z (Wang), and if W (Wang) follows the timeline today, he would be after Thursday that minuses three days, making Monday possibly a candidate for Qoon day.
  
   - If Q is potentially Monday, then Wang is on Thursday.
   - Sun is variable against Zhao, and Q and Z must be on top of each other. With Z (Zheng) fixed on this day.

173,"As long as they stay in academia, novelists cannot become great. The observation and analysis skills accumulated by the discipline of college life are very useful for novelists. However, only by sinking into daily life can one grasp the various emotions of life by intuition, and college life is obviously incompatible with it. Which of the following statements is based on the assumptions that the above argument relies on?
(A) Great novelists have the ability to observe and analyze. (B) The grasp of emotions in daily life cannot be obtained only through observation and analysis. (C) Without an intuitive grasp of emotions in everyday life, novelists cannot achieve their greatness. (D) Along with the investment in life and sensible observation, the novelist will become great.","To determine the assumption that the given argument relies on, let's break down the argument into its constituent parts and analyze the underlying assumptions.

The argument states:
1. Novelists cannot become great while staying in academia.
2. Observation and analysis skills from college life are useful for novelists.
3. However, great novelists need to grasp emotions by intuition, which comes from daily life, not academia.

From this, we can derive the following:
- Staying in academia limits exposure to daily life, which is necessary for an intuitive grasp of emotions.
- An intuitive grasp of emotions from daily life is critical to being a great novelist.

Now, let's evaluate each answer option:

(A) Great novelists have the ability to observe and analyze.
- This is mentioned in the argument as an important skill, but not the main assumption for greatness; it's necessary but not sufficient according to the argument.

(B) The grasp of emotions in daily life cannot be obtained only through observation and analysis.
- This supports the argument's premise that intuition is needed beyond mere observation and analysis of college life, highlighting the gap between college skills and necessary daily life emotional intuition.

(C) Without an intuitive grasp of emotions in everyday life, novelists cannot achieve their greatness.
- This directly supports the argument's claim that intuition from daily life is essential for becoming a great novelist, implying that without this, greatness is unattainable.

(D) Along with the investment in life and sensible observation, the novelist will become great.
- While this is close, it assumes a combination is sufficient for greatness, but the argument mainly stresses intuition from daily life, not a combined effect.

The argument is fundamentally assuming that the intuitive grasp which comes from daily life experiences is essential for achieving greatness as a novelist. Thus, the most directly related assumption that the argument relies on is captured in option C.

174,"Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease that is transmitted by sand flies biting sick mice and then biting. When building a new town in a certain area, although leishmaniasis and sand flies are both swords in the area, epidemiologists warn that strengthening rodent control to reduce the number of rats will do more harm than good. Profit. If the above statement is true, which of the following best confirms the expert's warning?
(A) Rats infected with Leishmaniasis have few chances of directly transmitting the disease to people. (B) Leishmaniasis is more contagious in rats than in humans. (C) Sand flies that do not infect leishmaniasis are not harmful to human health. (D) Sand flies bite people only when the number of mice is insufficient.","To determine which option best confirms the expert's warning about reducing the number of rats doing more harm than good, we must understand the transmission dynamics of leishmaniasis.

1. **Background Information**: 
   - Leishmaniasis is transmitted by sand flies, which bite infected mice and then can transmit the disease to humans.
   - The expert warns against reducing the rodent population, suggesting that doing so could actually cause more harm.

2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - (A) Rats infected with Leishmaniasis have few chances of directly transmitting the disease to people: This statement implies that while rats are infected, they are not the direct cause of transmission to humans, relying instead on sand flies. It doesn't directly explain why reducing the number of rats would be harmful.
   
   - (B) Leishmaniasis is more contagious in rats than in humans: If leishmaniasis is more contagious among rats, removing rats might seem like a viable strategy to reduce the reservoir for the disease, but this doesn't address why reducing rats would cause more harm.
   
   - (C) Sand flies that do not infect leishmaniasis are not harmful to human health: This statement is neutral regarding the benefits or harms of reducing rat populations, as it addresses sand flies that do not carry the disease.
   
   - (D) Sand flies bite people only when the number of mice is insufficient: This option suggests that if rats (mice) are reduced significantly, sand flies may turn to humans more frequently to feed, potentially increasing the transmission of leishmaniasis to people. This aligns directly with the expert's warning, as reducing the rat population could inadvertently increase the risk to humans.

3. **Conclusion**:
   Option (D) clearly establishes a link between reducing the number of rats and increased harm to humans, making it the best confirmation of the expert's warning.

175,"Zhang Shan said? The cruel murderer should be sentenced to capital punishment, which is a wise act. Because it can stop abhorrent crimes and minimize the suffering of the entire society over a long period of time. The death penalty is a self-prevention for a sound society. Li Si said? You have ignored a statement about whether a country or society has the right to deprive anyone. If there is no such right, it does not matter whether the death penalty can prevent crime. Assuming that the death penalty cannot prevent crime, then in which of the following ways will Zhang Shan and Li Si ’s views be affected?
(A) Neither Zhang Shan nor Li Si ’s views will be strengthened or weakened. (B) Li Si ’s view was weakened, and Zhang Shan ’s view was strengthened. (C) Zhang Shan's view was weakened, Li Si's view was not affected. (D) Both Zhang Shan and Li Si's views were weakened.","Answer Reasoning: 

To analyze how the assumption given (that the death penalty cannot prevent crime) affects Zhang Shan's and Li Si's views, we must first understand their arguments.

1. Zhang Shan's view is that the death penalty is justified because it can stop abhorrent crimes and minimize societal suffering. If the death penalty cannot prevent crime (as per the assumption), then it challenges the effectiveness of the death penalty in achieving the purposes Zhang Shan describes. This would weaken Zhang Shan's argument because the primary justification (prevention of crime) is no longer valid.

2. Li Si's view questions the moral and ethical right of a society to impose the death penalty, regardless of its effectiveness in crime prevention. The assumption that the death penalty cannot prevent crime does not directly affect Li Si's argument. His viewpoint is not contingent upon the effectiveness of the death penalty in preventing crime; rather, it is a philosophical question about rights and morality. Therefore, Li Si’s view would remain unaffected.

Considering these points, Zhang Shan's view would be weakened because the assumption directly undermines the effectiveness of the death penalty in preventing crime, which is central to his argument. On the other hand, Li Si’s view remains unaffected by whether or not the death penalty can prevent crime.

176,"Professor? If both parents are O-type blood, the blood type of their children can only be O-type, which is a genetic rule. Student? This is not true. My father has blood type B, and I have blood type O. Students are most likely to understand the professor ’s statement as?
(A) Only people with blood type O will have children with blood type O. (B) People with type O blood cannot have children with type B blood. (C) People with blood type B will always have children with blood type O. (D) If both parents have type B blood, their children will also have type B blood.","To understand the professor's statement, we need to determine the rule for blood type inheritance:

1. **Oxygen Blood Type Genetics**: Blood type is determined by alleles. Type O blood is recessive (denoted as 'ii'), and type B blood can be either homozygous (BB) or heterozygous (Bi).

2. **Professor’s Statement**: The professor claims that if both parents have O-type blood, their children can only have an O-type blood. This is scientifically accurate because both parents only have 'i' alleles to pass on, meaning the child will inherit 'ii', or blood type O.

3. **Student's Counterclaim**: The student misunderstood the professor's statement, thinking it related to his familial situation: his father has type B, and he has type O. 

   - This is possible if his father's genetic constitution for blood type is Bi. If the student inherits the 'i' allele from him and another 'i' from the mother with type O blood, the student can have type O blood.

Given the professor's statement, the correct understanding by the student should be:

**Interpretation**:

- The professor’s statement addresses the scenario that if both parents have O type blood, their children's blood type can only be O. This rule states people with O type blood can't have children with any other type than O if both parents are type O.

- The student likely misunderstood this as a general statement about inheritance rather than the specific scenario of both parents being type O as mentioned by the professor.

Therefore, the student is likely to understand the professor's statement as:

**Answer Choice(B):** People with type O blood cannot have children with type B blood.

177,"There is a psychological theory that to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with another. However, the greatest philosophers in the world spent most of their lives in isolation, and had no intimate relationships. Therefore, this psychological theory must be wrong. Which of the following must be assumed in the above conclusion?
(A) The greatest philosophers in the world prefer to avoid intimate relationships. (B) People with intimate relationships rarely spend their time alone. (C) Loneliness is necessary for philosophers to meditate. (D) The greatest philosophers in the world are happy.","To evaluate the conclusion in the argument, let's carefully examine its premises and conclusion:

1. Premise: There's a psychological theory stating that to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with another.
2. Evidence: Some of the greatest philosophers in the world, who presumably have achieved happiness, spent most of their lives in isolation and without intimate relationships.
3. Conclusion: Therefore, the psychological theory must be wrong.

The argument is concluding that the theory is incorrect because the greatest philosophers were happy without intimate relationships. To reach this conclusion, the argument must assume that these philosophers, despite their lack of intimate relationships, achieved happiness. Therefore, the assumption crucial to the argument is:

(D) The greatest philosophers in the world are happy.

The conclusion depends on the notion that these philosophers achieved happiness without the need for intimate relationships, thus contradicting the psychological theory.

Which of the following is the speaker who is most willing to answer the question?
(A) Social interests always take priority over personal interests. (B) Interference with individual actions does not increase the interests of society as a whole. (C) Actions that do not harm the interests of others should not be criticized and interfered by society. (D) When one ’s actions are beneficial to others, the overall interests of a society can be improved.","The speaker in the given scenario is discussing conditions under which interference in an individual's actions is justified. According to the speaker, interference should depend on whether it benefits the public interest and does not violate the legal rights of the parties involved. The examples provided, such as smoking alone in one's own house or yelling in the wilderness, highlight actions that do not harm others or societal interests.

Let's evaluate each answer option:

(A) Social interests always take priority over personal interests. - This does not closely align with the speaker's stance, as the speaker doesn't imply that social interests always take precedence, but rather that they should be considered when deciding whether to interfere.

(B) Interference with individual actions does not increase the interests of society as a whole. - While this statement suggests that interference may not always benefit society, it doesn't fully capture the speaker's emphasis on weighing public interest and legal rights.

(C) Actions that do not harm the interests of others should not be criticized and interfered by society. - This option aligns well with the speaker's view that interference is unwarranted when personal actions do not negatively impact others or violate rights.

(D) When one’s actions are beneficial to others, the overall interests of a society can be improved. - This statement focuses on the positive outcomes of actions rather than the criteria for interference discussed by the speaker.

Based on the speaker's focus on not interfering when actions do not harm others, option C most closely reflects the viewpoint being expressed.

(C) One of the more popular recreational projects is playing mahjong. (D) On average, people who lived a century ago have far less leisure time than people who are now.","To weaken the argument that people who lived a century ago liked reading more than people do today because they had fewer recreational projects, we need to introduce information that challenges the premise or the conclusion. 

Let's analyze the options one by one:

(A) Many books published a century ago have poor literacy.  
   - This statement doesn't directly address the amount of interest or preference in reading. It simply comments on the quality of books, which may not directly contradict the argument.

(B) The number of books sold today is much greater than it was a century ago.  
   - This statement directly undermines the conclusion by suggesting that people today may like reading just as much, if not more, than people in the past. If more books are being sold today, it could indicate that modern people do engage in reading extensively, despite the availability of other recreational activities.

(C) One of the more popular recreational projects is playing mahjong.  
   - This statement doesn't affect the argument about reading preferences of people a century ago compared to today. It only provides information about a current recreational activity.

(D) On average, people who lived a century ago have far less leisure time than people who are now.  
   - This provides a potential reason why people a century ago might not have been more inclined to reading, since they had less leisure time to engage in any kind of recreational activity, including reading. This somewhat weakens the argument.

The strongest weakening comes from option (B), as it directly challenges the conclusion by presenting evidence that people today still greatly engage with reading.

(A) Some people often take antibiotics because their doctors prescribe antibiotics for both viral and bacterial infections. (B) People with strong immunity rarely contract diseases that people usually treat with antibiotics. (C) Despite the many side effects of antibiotics, some people still use these drugs. (D) People with poor immunity can hardly recover from bacterial infections without taking antibiotics.","To reconcile the inconsistency between the information given—that people who rarely take antibiotics have a stronger immune system, but there is no evidence that taking antibiotics weakens the immune system—we need to find a reason why people who take antibiotics regularly might have weaker immune systems without the antibiotics being the direct cause.

Let's examine the answer options:

(A) Some people often take antibiotics because their doctors prescribe antibiotics for both viral and bacterial infections.  
- This statement does not explain the correlation between stronger immune systems and not taking antibiotics, as it focuses on prescribing practices rather than immunity.

(B) People with strong immunity rarely contract diseases that people usually treat with antibiotics.  
- This statement provides an explanation: those with strong immunity rarely get sick with diseases requiring antibiotic treatment, hence they end up using antibiotics less frequently. Therefore, the cause of the stronger immune system is not taking antibiotics but rather their strong immunity in the first place.

(C) Despite the many side effects of antibiotics, some people still use these drugs.  
- This statement does not address the inconsistency between the data about immune systems and antibiotic use; it highlights the side effects of antibiotics but not the relationship to immune strength.

(D) People with poor immunity can hardly recover from bacterial infections without taking antibiotics.  
- This statement suggests that individuals with weakened immune systems need antibiotics more often, which indirectly supports the idea that they use antibiotics frequently. However, it does not fully reconcile why this pattern occurs without suggesting that antibiotics directly weaken the immune system.

Thus, option (B) best reconciles the inconsistency: it suggests that people with stronger immune systems simply do not need to take antibiotics as often because they don't get sick as frequently. This way, the correlation between not taking antibiotics and having a strong immune system doesn't imply causation in either direction, consistent with the assertion that antibiotics don't directly weaken immunity.

We need to identify the sentence that differs logically from this statement.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) If you do stupid things, be prepared to be caught on the spot while doing stupid things.
- This statement implies that doing stupid things will likely lead to being caught, similar to the original statement.

(B) Only by not being stupid can we avoid being caught on the spot when doing stupid things.
- This statement suggests that the only way to avoid being caught is by not doing stupid things, which aligns with the original statement.

(C) Either you are caught on the spot when you are stupid, or you don’t do stupid things.
- This is a logical negation or rephrasing of the original statement and implies that avoiding being caught is possible only by not doing stupid things, which aligns with the original.

(D) If you are caught on the spot when doing stupid things, consider yourself unlucky.
- This statement introduces an element of luck not found in the original. It implies that being caught is a matter of chance (unlucky) rather than a direct consequence of the action. This differs from the other options and the original statement, which imply a direct causal relationship.

(A) Bacteria deep in the wound thrive in a humid environment, and sucrose has a dehydrating effect.  
- This option suggests that sucrose removes moisture from the environment in which bacteria thrive, effectively dehydrating and killing them. This explanation aligns with how osmotic pressure works where sugar can draw water out of cells.

(B) Many kinds of bacteria take sucrose as a nutrient, and when they get sugar, they multiply quickly.  
- This statement contradicts the idea that sucrose helps kill bacteria, as it suggests sucrose would provide more food for bacteria, potentially leading to an increase in bacterial growth.

(C) Some foods containing sucrose can weaken the effects of certain antibiotics.
- This does not directly explain how sucrose itself removes or kills bacteria deep in the wound. It suggests a possible interaction with antibiotics, which is not directly related to sucrose's independent antibacterial action.

(D) High-efficiency antibiotics have only been developed recently, and the use of sucrose to treat wounds has a long history.
- This option provides historical context but does not explain the mechanism by which sucrose acts against bacteria.

(C) David will go to Cantor because he will spend an extra $ 50,000 per year. (D) David will go to Huizhong Company because he will spend an extra $ 70,000 every year.","To determine which company offers the best pay for David, we need to calculate the total salary he would receive from each company over a two-year period.

**Huizhong Company:**
- First 6 months salary: $500,000
- After first 6 months, salary increases by $50,000, making it $550,000 for the next 6 months.
- Total salary for the first year = $500,000 + $550,000 = $1,050,000

- Second 6 months salary: $550,000 + $50,000 = $600,000
- After second 6 months, salary increases again by $50,000, making it $650,000 for the next 6 months.

**Kangtuo Company:**
- First year's salary: $1,000,000 
- Second year salary increases by $200,000, making it $1,200,000

Comparing the total salaries over two years:
- Huizhong Company: $2,300,000
- Kangtuo Company: $2,200,000

David will receive $2,300,000 from Huizhong Company and $2,200,000 from Kangtuo Company after two years, which means David will earn $100,000 more with Huizhong Company over the two-year period.

Since Huizhong Company offers a higher pay increase and results in more total earnings over two years, the correct choice is for David to choose Huizhong Company.

(A) ""Doximayo"" means ""hostage"". (B) ""Mugbudengs"" means ""kidnapping"". (C) ""Doximayo"" means ""student"". (D) I don't know what they mean.","To solve this problem, we should break down the information from the intercepted messages:

1. ""Alingoits Doximayo Makasey"" means ""kidnapping student (host) hostage"".
2. ""Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs"" means ""hostage holding (see) Reporter"".
3. ""Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits"" means ""kidnapping reporters away"".

From these pieces of information, let's analyze each word:

- ""Alingoits"" appears in both sentences 1 and 3 and coincides with ""kidnapping"" because the word ""kidnapping"" is the only common English word in those two sentences.
- ""Makasey"" appears in sentences 1 and 2, which both contain the word ""hostage"". Hence, ""Makasey"" likely means ""hostage"".
- ""Mugbudengs"" appears in sentences 2 and 3, which both contain the word ""Reporter"", indicating that ""Mugbudengs"" means ""Reporter"".

Now let's match the answer options:

(A) ""Doximayo"" means ""hostage"" - This is not correct because we already identified ""Makasey"" as ""hostage"".
(B) ""Mugbudengs"" means ""kidnapping"" - This is not correct because we identified ""Mugbudengs"" as ""Reporter"".
(C) ""Doximayo"" means ""student"" - This could be correct because ""Doximayo"" is in the first sentence alongside ""student"" and no other sentence, implying that ""Doximayo"" could mean ""student"".
(D) I don't know what they mean. - Since we have deduced potential meanings, this option is less likely.

The only statement that aligns with the derived translations based on provided information is:

186,"Aluminum alloys have widely replaced steel in military equipment because they provide the same protection and are lighter in weight. But the manufacturing cost of an aluminum alloy armored vehicle is twice that of a newly armored vehicle. Therefore, from a financial point of view, it is not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles with the same protective properties. Which of the following is true can raise greater doubts about the above conclusion?
(A) After the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is put into use, the running cost is one-third of the steel armored vehicle with the same performance. (B) After the introduction of aluminum alloy armored vehicles, the army must retain maintenance personnel and purchase new tools and parts. (C) The maintenance cost of steel armored vehicles is the lowest among all armored vehicles currently used by the military. (D) It is expected that the price of aluminum alloy materials will remain stable, while the price of steel materials may decline.","To evaluate which statement could raise greater doubts about the conclusion in the argument, we need to determine which option would challenge the financial perspective that it is not cost-effective to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles.

The conclusion is based on the higher initial manufacturing costs of aluminum alloy vehicles compared to steel vehicles. Thus, to cast doubt on the conclusion, we need information that might offset the initial high costs of aluminum alloy vehicles, making them financially worthwhile.

Let's analyze each option:

(A) **After the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is put into use, the running cost is one-third of the steel armored vehicle with the same performance.**  
If this statement is true, it suggests that the lower operational costs of aluminum alloy vehicles might offset their higher initial costs over time. This challenges the conclusion and could make aluminum alloy vehicles more financially viable in the long run. Therefore, this statement raises doubts about the conclusion.

(B) **After the introduction of aluminum alloy armored vehicles, the army must retain maintenance personnel and purchase new tools and parts.**  
This statement suggests additional costs after the introduction of aluminum alloy vehicles. It supports the conclusion rather than raising doubts about it.

(C) **The maintenance cost of steel armored vehicles is the lowest among all armored vehicles currently used by the military.**  
This statement implies that steel vehicles are cost-effective in terms of maintenance, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that aluminum alloy vehicles are not financially advantageous.

(D) **It is expected that the price of aluminum alloy materials will remain stable, while the price of steel materials may decline.**  
This suggests that future steel may become even cheaper to use, supporting the idea that steel is more cost-effective, thereby reinforcing the conclusion rather than challenging it.

The option that best raises doubts about the conclusion by addressing the long-term financial implications of using aluminum alloy vehicles is option (A).

187,"At the beginning of this century, Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift. Because his theory assumed that the motive force enough to cause continental drift was found, he was strongly opposed. We can now accept Wegener ’s theory, not because we have determined enough power to drift the continent, but because the new instrument finally allows us to confirm the movement of the continent through observation. The above example best illustrates which of the following scientific statements?
(A) The goal of science is to use a simple and harmonious theory to accurately explain the diversity of nature. (B) In the mathematical description of nature, science has become very precise in identifying potential dynamics. (C) With the help of probability theory and mathematical statistics, science has shifted from describing single phenomena to studying the whole thing. (D) When an event assumed by a theory is confirmed, the theory can be accepted even if there is no explanation for the cause of the event.","The question discusses how Wegener's theory of continental drift was initially opposed due to the lack of a known motive force that could cause drift. The theory was eventually accepted because new instruments allowed scientists to confirm the movement of continents through observation, not because the motive forces were fully understood. This indicates that the confirmation of a theory's predictions through observation can lead to its acceptance, even if the underlying causes are not fully understood.

Let's evaluate the options:

(A) The goal of science is to use a simple and harmonious theory to accurately explain the diversity of nature. - This emphasizes simplicity and harmony in scientific theories, but it does not address the acceptance of a theory based solely on confirmed observations.

(B) In the mathematical description of nature, science has become very precise in identifying potential dynamics. - This statement focuses on precision and identifying dynamics, which is not the main point illustrated by the acceptance of Wegener's theory.

(C) With the help of probability theory and mathematical statistics, science has shifted from describing single phenomena to studying the whole thing. - This statement is about a shift in scientific method but does not relate directly to the acceptance of a theory based on observable outcomes rather than understanding the underlying cause.

(D) When an event assumed by a theory is confirmed, the theory can be accepted even if there is no explanation for the cause of the event. - This option directly correlates with the passage's main point: Wegener's theory was accepted because the phenomenon of continental movement was observed and confirmed, despite the absence of a fully understood motive force.

Thus, option (D) is the most relevant conclusion based on the given information.

188,"Both Zhang Fei and Li Bai applied for the MBA this year. There are four assertions about their exams? (1) They have at least one exam; (2) Zhang Fei is not necessarily exam; Bai did pass the exam; (4) Not that Zhang Fei might fail the exam. The final admission result shows that two of the four assertions are true and two are false. Which of the following results can be derived from the above conditions?
(A) Zhang Fei was admitted, but Li Bai was not. (B) Both Zhang Fei and Li Bai were admitted. (C) Zhang Fei and Li Bai failed the exam. (D) Li Bai was admitted, but Zhang Fei was not.","To solve this problem, we need to examine the scenarios in which two of the assertions are true and the other two are false, and then determine which conditions lead to a consistent outcome for Zhang Fei and Li Bai's admission results.

Let's analyze the assertions one by one:

1. They have at least one exam: Assume this is true, meaning at least one of them passed the exam. Thus, if this statement is true, one or both of them must have been admitted.

2. Zhang Fei is not necessarily exam (ambiguous statement): It seems this should imply Zhang Fei is not necessarily admitted. If we assume this statement is true, it means whether Zhang Fei was admitted or not isn't certain based solely on exam results.

3. Bai did pass the exam: Assume this is true, meaning Li Bai was admitted.

4. Not that Zhang Fei might fail the exam: This implies Zhang Fei did not necessarily pass, meaning he could have failed. If true, it indicates Zhang Fei might have not been admitted, depending on how you interpret ambiguous statements 2 and 4.

Now, let's pair them, trying with different combinations to ensure exactly two assertions hold true:

Combination 1:
- (1) True: They have at least one exam (at least one of Zhang Fei or Li Bai passed).
- (3) True: Bai did pass the exam (Li Bai was admitted).
- (2) False: Zhang Fei is not necessarily exam (meaning Zhang Fei likely passed).
- (4) False: Not that Zhang Fei might fail the exam (meaning Zhang Fei indeed passed).

This combination indicates both Zhang Fei and Li Bai were admitted, leading to answer choice (B).

Let's verify other logical scenarios:
Combination 2:
- (2) False: Zhang Fei is not necessarily exam (meaning Zhang Fei likely passed).
- (4) True: Not that Zhang Fei might fail the exam (meaning Zhang Fei indeed passed).

This indicates Zhang Fei must have passed, and given assertion (3) is true, Li Bai also passed. Again, both were admitted.

All logical attempts to make only either Zhang Fei or Li Bai passing fail to comply with two true assertions.

Thus, the most consistent and logical solution is:
Final_Answer:{B} (Both Zhang Fei and Li Bai were admitted.)"
189,"On the African grassland, a ferocious leopard can catch almost any antelope that it decides to hunt. And once the antelope does not stare at the hungry leopard, its best chance of escape is that the leopard quickly finds another animal as its target. Therefore, antelopes follow the group activities to reduce the risk of being eaten by leopards. Which of the following is the assumption on which the above argument is based?
(A) Leopards depend on predators for their livelihood. (B) The sheer number of antelopes in the antelope flock can prevent leopard attacks. (C) Leopards cannot eat the entire antelope flock at once. (D) On the African grasslands, leopards are the main natural enemies of antelopes.","To determine the assumption on which the argument is based, we need to identify the underlying premise that makes the conclusion valid. The argument states that antelopes follow group activities to reduce the risk of being eaten by leopards. This implies that the group behavior of antelopes has a protective effect against leopard attacks.

Let's examine each option:

(A) ""Leopards depend on predators for their livelihood."" - This statement is irrelevant to the argument since it doesn't address the relationship between antelope group behavior and leopard attacks.

(B) ""The sheer number of antelopes in the antelope flock can prevent leopard attacks."" - This option suggests that the presence of many antelopes in a group may make it harder for leopards to successfully hunt them, which aligns with the protective aspect of group behavior against predation.

(C) ""Leopards cannot eat the entire antelope flock at once."" - While this statement is true, it doesn't directly address how group activities prevention effectiveness is assumed in the argument. It states something rather obvious and not directly linked to the strategic aspect of group behaviors.

(D) ""On the African grasslands, leopards are the main natural enemies of antelopes."" - This adds context but doesn't articulate the necessary assumption about why group behavior reduces predation risk.

The most appropriate choice is (B), which assumes that having a large number of antelopes in a group can deter or complicate leopard attacks, thereby supporting the strategy that group activities reduce the risk of being eaten by leopards. Therefore, the final answer is:

190,"If a person increases the number of meals per day but does not increase the total amount of meals, his cholesterol level will obviously decrease. However, most people consume more food while increasing the number of meals. If the above statement is true, which of the following options will it most strongly support?
(A) For most people, his daily food intake does not significantly affect his cholesterol level. (B) For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels. (C) For most people, the amount of food eaten per day will not be affected by the number of foods eaten per day. (D) For most people, the amount of food consumed is greatly affected by the time taken to eat.","To solve this problem, we need to understand the implication of the statement: 

1. The statement suggests that increasing the number of meals per day without increasing the total amount of food consumed will lead to a decrease in cholesterol levels. However, it notes that most people tend to eat more food when they increase the number of meals.

2. We are asked to find an option that is most strongly supported by this statement.

Let's analyze each of the given options:

(A) For most people, their daily food intake does not significantly affect their cholesterol level. 
- This option conflicts with the given statement, which implies that consuming more food generally correlates with higher cholesterol levels. Thus, increased food intake does not align with decreased cholesterol.

(B) For most people, increasing the number of meals a day will not result in a significant reduction in cholesterol levels.
- According to the passage, most people eat more food when they increase the number of meals. Since increased food consumption is associated with higher cholesterol, increasing the number of meals for most people would not reduce cholesterol levels, which aligns with this option. This option is supported.

(C) For most people, the amount of food eaten per day will not be affected by the number of meals eaten per day.
- This contradicts the passage, which explicitly states that most people consume more food as they increase the number of meals.

(D) For most people, the amount of food consumed is greatly affected by the time taken to eat.
- The passage does not mention timing as a factor; it focuses on the increase in total food due to the increase in meal frequency rather than the time involved.

Based on the analysis, option (B) is most strongly supported by the passage:

191,"To treat a person fairly is to treat him without prejudice. But our friends usually hope that we regard their interests as more important than others. In this way, considering that we always strive to maintain friendship with our friends, we cannot treat our friends fairly. The above argument must assume which of the following?
(A) When dealing with interpersonal relationships between non-friends, people can remain impartial. (B) The ideal of justice has nothing to do with dealing with most relationships. (C) Keeping close friends with some people is very important in one's life. (D) A person cannot be fair to someone at the same time and will regard his interests as more important than others.","To analyze the argument provided, let's break it down into components:

1. The argument suggests that to treat someone fairly means to treat them without prejudice.
2. It further suggests that friends often hope that we regard their interests as more important than the interests of others.
3. Therefore, maintaining a friendship may prevent one from treating their friend fairly (i.e., without prejudice).

The key assumption in the argument is regarding what it means to treat friends fairly: treating them without prejudice is contrary to prioritizing their interests over others. In other words, the assumption is that you cannot be both fair and prioritize a friend's interests above others simultaneously. 

Let's evaluate the answer options based on this understanding:

(A) When dealing with interpersonal relationships between non-friends, people can remain impartial.
- This statement does not directly relate to treating friends. It's more about relationships between non-friends, so it isn't the necessary assumption.

(B) The ideal of justice has nothing to do with dealing with most relationships.
- This statement is too broad and does not directly concern the argument about fairness towards friends. It isn't necessary.

(C) Keeping close friends with some people is very important in one's life.
- This statement might be true, but it isn't critical to the logic of treating friends fairly; it doesn't address the issue of the conflict between fairness and prioritizing a friend's interests.

(D) A person cannot be fair to someone at the same time and will regard his interests as more important than others.
- This directly addresses the core assumption: fairness requires impartiality, which is not possible if one prioritizes a friend's interests over others. This assumption is necessary for the conclusion that we can't treat friends fairly.

Hence, the correct answer is the one that aligns with maintaining the logic and conclusion of the argument:

(A) F. (B) L. (C) G. (D) M.","To solve this problem, we need to determine the sequence of speakers based on the given rules. Let's go through the logic step by step. 

1. **Initial Facts**:
   - There are six scholars: F, G, J, L, M, and N.
   - Three speakers speak before lunch and three after lunch.
   - Rule: G must speak before lunch.
   - Rule: Only one speaker is between M and N.
   - Rule: F speaks in the first or third place.

2. **Considering J as the first speaker**:
   - If J is the first speaker, then F cannot be in the first place. 
   - Options for F are now only in the third place.

3. **Arranging Before Lunch Speakers**:
   - Since G must speak before lunch and we've already placed J in the first position, possible positions for G before lunch are 2 or 3.

4. **Examining the M and N Condition**:
   - Only one speaker is between M and N. This allows for a few possible arrangements:
     - M is second and N is fourth.
     - N could be in any position after lunch if M is positioned accordingly.

5. **Determining the Second Speaker**:
   - Since G is a must before lunch and F can only speak in the third position (when J is first), the only logical place for G is the second position before lunch.

Following this analysis, if J is the first speaker, the second speaker must be G. Let's verify the sequence:

- First position: J
- Second position: G
- Third position: F (since F can only be in the third position now if J is first)
- We don't need to figure out the exact placement of L, M, and N for the question about the second speaker.

Therefore, based on the deduction, the second speaker must be G.

(A) F or M. (B) L or N. (C) G or L. (D) M or N.","To solve this problem, let's follow the given conditions step by step:

1. We have six scholars: F, G, J, L, M, and N.
2. All these scholars speak only once.
3. There are two sessions: before lunch (three speeches) and after lunch (three speeches).
4. G must speak before lunch.
5. There is only one speaker between M and N.
6. F can speak either in the first or third position.
7. J is the fourth speaker.

Now, let's analyze:

- Since J is the fourth speaker, J is the first speaker after lunch.
- Three speakers have to speak before lunch, and G is one of them. So, G is in one of the three spots before lunch.
- F can speak in the first or third position. Since J is in the fourth position and F is not there, F could be one of the pre-lunch speakers. This means F can be in the first position, as putting F in the third would occupy all pre-lunch spots due to placing G there, contradicting other conditions.

Given conditions clearly state only one person is between M and N, which means:
- Possible orders for M and N could be (M - ? - N) or (N - ? - M).

Let's examine positions:
1. Suppose F speaks in the first position. Thus, the order is: F, then G (who must speak before lunch), then one more speaker to make 3 before lunch. 
   
   Thus: F - G - ? | J - ? - ?. 

- From remaining M, N, L, one must be the unknown speaker before lunch. Because J is the fourth speaker, M and N either follow J with one speaker between them, or they take the last two spots with L being the third speaker who speaks pre-lunch.

Finally, if F is first, then the order can be:

1. F (first)
2. G (second)
3. L (third) - valid choice since M and N cannot be here together as between them has to be one other speaker.
4. J (fourth)
5. M (fifth)
6. N (sixth)
   
If L is third and follows the stated rules about F's position, G's requirement, and the M/N gap stipulation, then L is a valid option for the third speaker: 

Let's confirm:
- F is allocated: G is confirmed: allows M, N, L distribution satisfying condition ""only one speaker is between M and N.""

(A) F. (B) J. (C) G. (D) N.","To solve the problem, we must consider the given conditions individually and how they fit together:

1. Each speaker speaks only once, and only one at a time.
2. Three speakers speak before lunch, and the other three speak after lunch.
3. G must speak before lunch.
4. Only one speaker is between M and N.
5. F speaks in the first or third place.
6. L speaks before lunch, and M is not the sixth speaker.

Based on condition 5, F can be in positions 1 or 3. Let's consider both scenarios:

**Scenario 1: F speaks in the first position**  
- Position 1: F  
- G must speak before lunch, so G can be in positions 2 or 3. 

If G is in position 2, L must also speak before lunch. We'll proceed with L in position 3:

- Position 1: F  
- Position 2: G  
- Position 3: L

At this point, we've placed three people, fulfilling the requirement to complete the before-lunch slots (positions 1, 2, and 3). Now M and N must speak after lunch in positions 4, 5, or 6 with only one speaker between them.

For M and N, since they must have exactly one speaker between them and M is not in the sixth position, we can have:

- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: (J or N)  
- Position 6: (J or N)

Assuming M is in 4, N can be in 5, and J can be in 6:

- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: N  
- Position 6: J

This satisfies all conditions:
- G is before lunch.
- L is before lunch.
- F is in the first position.
- M is not in the sixth position.
- N is immediately after M.
  
**Scenario 2: F speaks in the third position**  
- Position 3: F  

Following similar logic for G and L, let G and L speak before F:

- Position 1: G  
- Position 2: L  
- Position 3: F

Now, applying the conditions for M, N, and J after lunch, trying the arrangement, we find that:

- Position 4: M  
- Position 5: N  
- Position 6: J  

In this setup, the speaker immediately after M is N. 

Thus, considering both scenarios, the result is consistent: the speaker immediately after M must be N, which corresponds to option D.

1. G must speak before lunch.
2. There is only one speaker between M and N.
3. F speaks in the first or third place.

We will consider the scenario where M and N are separated by lunch, which means one speaks before lunch and the other after lunch.

Given that there are three speakers before lunch and three after lunch, we can split the schedule into two segments and see how the conditions fit:

### Before Lunch:
1. Possible positions: 1, 2, 3
2. G must be in one of these positions.
3. F must be in position 1 or 3.

### After Lunch:
1. Possible positions: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's apply the condition that M and N are separated by lunch:

Since G must speak before lunch, F can speak in:
- First (1st) or third (3rd) position.

Let's map out the possibilities based on F's positions:

1. If **F speaks first**:  
   Before Lunch: F, G, ___  
   Possible Speech Order: F, G, X 
   
   After Lunch: ___, ___, ___  
   Possible Speech Order: M, N, X OR N, M, X

   Since there's only one speaker between M and N, and they must be separated by lunch:
   
   Before Lunch: F, G, X (cannot be M or N based on separation)  
   After Lunch: M, N, X or N, M, X

   Possible X: J, L

2. If **F speaks third**:  
   Before Lunch: ___, ___, F  
   Possible Speech Order: G, X, F  
   
   After Lunch: ___, ___, ___  
   Possible Speech Order: M, N, X OR N, M, X
   
   Before Lunch: G, X (cannot be M or N), F  
   After Lunch: M, N, X or N, M, X
   
   Possible X: J, L

Considering both scenarios, the speakers that can be arranged between M and N are J and L, as G is already set to speak before lunch, and F is constricted to the first or third place.

Therefore, the speakers that can be arranged between M and N are J and L.

- There is only one speaker between M and N.
- F can speak either in the first or third place.
- J must speak before F.
  
Possible order of speeches:

1. Constraint: F speaks in the 1st or 3rd place, and J speaks before F. 
   - If F is in the 1st position, J cannot speak, so F must be in the 3rd position. Therefore, J must be before F.

2. Constraint: G has to speak before lunch, so G must occupy one of the first three positions.

3. M and N have exactly one person between them.

Given these constraints, let's try to create a valid sequence:

- Since F is the first or third, and J must be before F, let's start with F in the 3rd position:
  1. __ , 2. J, 3. F
- G must speak before lunch, so G takes either the 1st or 2nd position. Let’s put G in the 1st position:
  1. G, 2. J, 3. F

With G, J, and F in the first three slots (before lunch), the remaining positions (after lunch) are for L, M, and N:
   
- One speaker is between M and N. Potential orders for M and N with one gap are: ""M _ N"" or ""N _ M"". If M starts in position 4:
  - Fourth: M
  - Fifth: L (only place left for L)

- Condition 3: If J participates, then G must participate. (J is in, but G is not, so this breaks the rule)
- This set violates condition 3. Invalid option.

(C) E, G, J, M
- Condition 1: E or F, but not both. (E is in, F is out, so this is satisfied)
- Condition 2: J or K, but not both. (J is in, K is out, so this is satisfied)
- Condition 3: If J participates, then G must participate. (J and G both are in, so this is satisfied)
- Condition 4: Unless F participates, M does not participate. (F is out, M is in, so this violates the rule)
- This set violates condition 4. Invalid option.

(D) F, H, K, M
- Condition 1: E or F, but not both. (F is in, E is out, so this is satisfied)
- Condition 2: J or K, but not both. (K is in, J is out, so this is satisfied)
- Condition 3: If J participates, then G must participate. (J is out, so this does not apply)
- Condition 4: Unless F participates, M does not participate. (F and M both are in, so this is satisfied)
- This set satisfies all conditions. Valid option.

The selection that satisfies all the given conditions is option (D).

198,"A provincial Go team coach selects 4 of the 7 players from E, F, G, H, J, K and M to participate in the professional league. The selection must meet the following conditions? E or F has one person to participate, but not both . One of J or K will participate, but not both. If J participates, then G participates. Unless F participates, M does not participate. Which of the following players will definitely participate in the game?
(A) F or M, or both. (B) H or J, or both. (C) G or H, or both. (D) J or M, or both.","To determine which players will definitely participate in the game, we need to analyze the provided conditions:

1. Either E or F participates, but not both.
2. Either J or K participates, but not both.
3. If J participates, then G participates.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.

Let's examine the implications:

- If F does not participate, E must, fulfilling the first condition. M also will not participate due to the fourth condition.
- If F participates, M must also participate (fourth condition).
- If J participates, G must participate (third condition).
- One between J and K must participate.

Now, we explore outcomes when J participates vs. when K participates:

**Case 1: J Participates**
- If J participates, G also participates (condition 3).
- K does not participate.
- E or F may participate, following condition 1.
- If F participates, M participates (condition 4).
- In this case, likely participants based on conditions are J, G, (either E or F), and possibly M if F is included.

**Case 2: K Participates**
- If K participates, J is out, so G is not obligated.
- One between E or F will participate (condition 1).
- If F participates, M also participates (condition 4).
- Likely participants are K, (either E or F), and possibly M if F is selected.

From conditions and possible scenarios above:

- Regardless of the case, G will definitely participate if J is selected and indirectly favored more often, but not concretely certain.
- H has no conditions restricting or obligating participation.

Therefore, ensuring G or H partakes eliminates dependency solely on other's selection constraints and achieves fulfilling roster with more assurance.

E or F has one person to participate, but not both . One of J or K will participate, but not both. If J participates, then G participates. Unless F participates, M does not participate. Which of the following listed players cannot participate in the game together?
(A) E and J. (B) E and M. (C) F and G. (D) F and J.","To determine which players cannot participate together, let's analyze the constraints given:

1. E or F has one person to participate, but not both.
   - If E participates, F cannot participate, and vice versa.

2. One of J or K will participate, but not both.
   - If J participates, K cannot participate, and vice versa.

3. If J participates, then G participates.
   - This means J’s participation mandates G’s participation.

4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.
   - This means if F does not participate, M also cannot participate. 
   - If M does participate, F must participate.

Now, let's assess each option:

(A) E and J.
- If E participates, F cannot participate. 
- J's participation implies G also participates.
- No direct conflict is seen here between E and J based on the provided conditions.

(B) E and M.
- If E participates, then F cannot participate.
- If F does not participate, then M cannot participate (based on the fourth condition).
- Therefore, E and M cannot participate together.

(C) F and G.
- F and G can participate simultaneously as there are no restrictions combining them.
- No direct conflict between F and G based on the conditions.

(D) F and J.
- If F participates, E cannot.
- J’s participation means G must also participate, but F's participation does not violate any condition applicable with J.
- No direct conflict is seen between F and J.
