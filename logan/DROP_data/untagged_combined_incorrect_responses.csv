These reflect historic and early 20th-century immigration, as well as that since the late 20th century. How many percent more people were in the the second largest group compared to the second smallest?

Answer: The question asks the difference between the second largest and second smallest ancestry groups.  The passage lists ancestries in descending order.
The second largest group is Guyanese at 12.3%.
The second smallest group listed is Polish at 5.4%.

12.3% - 5.4% = 6.9%

So the answer is {6.9}.

history_1042_8d1d1067-668e-47c9-9c68-4047b59b178b,"In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa.

How many cities did Venice try to take?


Answer: Venice attempted to take the following cities: Sinj (successfully on the third attempt), Herceg Novi, Knin, and Vrgorac.  They also took multiple areas north of Ragusa, though the question asks about cities and the passage lists several specific locations, suggesting these are smaller settlements rather than cities.  Therefore, Venice tried to take 4 cities. So the answer is {4}.

The Giants scored first, sending Jacobs in for a 4-yard touchdown run following a Terrell Thomas interception. Later, Arizona running back Beanie Wells scored his first career touchdown on a 13-yard rush. Manning responded by throwing a 62-yard touchdown to Nicks for his longest reception of the year. In the second half, the Cardinals' Tim Hightower and Jason Wright scored touchdowns. But it was turnovers that decided this game; Manning's 3 interceptions were as many as he had thrown all season. The Giants scored only 3 points in the second half, ending the game on an interception to Antrel Rolle.

**Answer:** The question asks how many interceptions *Arizona* caught. The passage states that there was one interception by Terrell Thomas, which resulted in a Giants touchdown.  It also mentions three interceptions thrown by Manning and that the game ended on an interception by Antrel Rolle. Since Manning was the Giants' quarterback, and Rolle plays for the Giants, the three interceptions of Manning and the interception by Rolle were all caught by Arizona. Therefore, Arizona caught 3 + 1 = 4 interceptions.  So the answer is {4}.

In 2010 the Russian leasehold was renegotiated with an extension until 2042 and an option for an additional five years until 2047. How many years was the leasehold renegotiated for?

Answer: The passage says the lease was renegotiated in 2010 and extended until 2042, with an option for 5 more years until 2047.  2042 - 2010 = 32 years. Including the optional 5 years, the renegotiated lease was for 32 + 5 = 37 years. Since the question asks ""How many years *was* the leasehold renegotiated for"", this implies the initial agreement, not including the optional extension. Therefore the answer is {32}.

**Answer:** We are looking for the number of times the entrant count exceeded 760 between the 2008-09 and 2011-12 FA Cups.  The passage tells us there were 759 entrants in the 2010-11 FA Cup.  Since 759 is not over 760, there were zero seasons with more than 760 entrants between 2008-09 and 2011-12.  Therefore, the answer is {0}.

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918.

How many field goals did Garrett Hartley kick in the fourth quarter?","**Reformatted Question:** Coming off their home win over the Vikings, the Saints flew to Candlestick Park for a Week 2 Monday Night duel with the San Francisco 49ers.  New Orleans would deliver the opening punch in the first quarter as 49ers center David Baas' high snap deep within San Francisco territory went out of the back of the endzone for a safety.

Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically.

How many of the 293 prisoners were not pardoned, purchased amnesty or were executed?

Answer: The passage states that out of the 293 comuneros excluded from the initial pardon, 23 were executed, 20 died in prison, 50 purchased amnesty, and 100 were pardoned later.  This accounts for 23 + 20 + 50 + 100 = 193 comuneros.  Since there were 293 total, the number whose fates are unknown is 293 - 193 = 100.  So the answer is {100}.

Charles V of France became more active in the conflict after 1369, taking advantage of his country's greater economic strength to commence cross-Channel raids on England.

Answer: According to the passage, the garrisons in Calais and Brest cost £36,000 a year. Military expeditions could consume £50,000 in six months. This means that in a year, military expeditions could cost £50,000 * 2 = £100,000. So the yearly cost for the garrisons in Calais and Brest is £36,000, and yearly military expeditions could consume £100,000.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I.

The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage. How many wars are mentioned?
Answer: According to the passage, the following wars are mentioned: Thirty Years' War and Great Turkish War. The Bohemian Revolt is also mentioned, which can be considered a war. The Battle of White Mountain is a battle, not a war, but it is part of the Thirty Years' War. So the answer is {3}.",2.0

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side. That led to the collapse of the uprising against Austria.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén.
