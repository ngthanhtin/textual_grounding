The population density was 73 people per square mile (28/km²).  There were 12,064 housing units at an average density of 36 per square mile (14/km²).  The racial makeup of the county was <fact1>97.90% White (U.S. Census)</fact1>, <fact2>0.56% African American (U.S. Census)</fact2>, <fact3>0.15% Native American (U.S. Census)</fact3>, <fact4>0.28% Asian (U.S. Census)</fact4>, <fact5>0.02% Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)</fact5>, <fact6>0.36% from Race (United States Census)</fact6>, and <fact7>0.74% from two or more races</fact7>. Hispanic (U.S. Census) or Latino (U.S. Census) of any race were <fact8>0.93% of the population</fact8>. 21.3% were of English people, 16.5% Germans, 11.4% Irish people, 10.7% United States, 5.3% danish people and 5.3% Italian people ancestry according to Census 2000. How many people, in terms of percentage, were not solely White or solely African American?

Answer: According to the passage, <fact1>97.9% were White</fact1> and <fact2>0.56% were African American</fact2>. The percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American is <fact3>100% - (97.9% + 0.56%) = 1.54%</fact3>. However, this 1.54% includes <fact7>0.74% from two or more races</fact7> which may include White and/or African American. To find the percentage of people who were not solely White or solely African American, we need to subtract the percentage of people who were two or more races from the total percentage of people who were not White or African American: <fact3>1.54%</fact3> - <fact7>0.74%</fact7> is not correct since 0.74% is part of the 1.54%. Instead, we should consider that 0.74% from two or more races may include White and/or African American, and the remaining percentage is from other races: <fact3>0.15% Native American</fact3>, <fact4>0.28% Asian</fact4>, <fact5>0.02% Pacific Islander</fact5>, and <fact6>0.36% from other races</fact6>. The sum of these percentages is <fact3>0.15%</fact3> + <fact4>0.28%</fact4> + <fact5>0.02%</fact5> + <fact6>0.36%</fact6> = 0.81%. Adding the percentage of people who were two or more races (which may include White and/or African American) to this sum, we get: 0.81% + <fact7>0.74%</fact7> = 1.55%. So the answer is {1.55}.",1.54

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa.

The gender makeup of the city was 64.3% male and 35.7% female. How many in percent weren't between the ages of 18 and 24?

Answer: According to the passage, to find the percentage of residents who weren't between the ages of 18 and 24, we need to subtract the percentage of residents who were between the ages of 18 and 24 (<fact2>56.2%</fact2>) from 100%. However, we can also add up the percentages of residents who were under 18 (<fact1>10.1%</fact1>), between 25 and 44 (<fact3>16.1%</fact3>), between 45 and 64 (<fact4>10.5%</fact4>), and 65 or older (<fact5>7%</fact5>). <fact1>10.1%</fact1> + <fact3>16.1%</fact3> + <fact4>10.5%</fact4> + <fact5>7%</fact5> = 43.7%.

history_1313_797e963c-52f2-4f8e-ba70-5a382cda0d85,"Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia  immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended.

New Orleans would deliver the opening punch in the first quarter as 49ers center David Baas' high snap deep within San Francisco territory went out of the back of the endzone for a safety.  The Saints would add onto their lead as quarterback Drew Brees hooked up with running back Reggie Bush on a 6-yard touchdown pass.  The 49ers would answer in the second quarter as quarterback Alex Smith found running back Frank Gore on a 12-yard touchdown pass.
