Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering <fact1>Russian Revolution of 1905</fact1>, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the <fact2>February Revolution of 1917</fact2>. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement  sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising.

A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.  About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side. That led to the collapse of the uprising against Austria. How many regions did the popular uprising start in?

Alarmed by desertions among his followers and fearing further treachery, Manfred sought to bring Charles to battle as swiftly as possible. Charles attempted to turn Manfred's position at Capua by a perilous crossing of the Apennines which wrecked his supply line; but Manfred had intelligence of his move and lay in a strong position across the River Calore, crossed only by one bridge.

Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza.

The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich.  The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder  or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the <fact1>Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men</fact1>, but the <fact2>Austrians lost only about 40</fact2>. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.

""Polish-Soviet War"" is the most common but other names include ""<fact1>Russo-Polish War of 1919-1921</fact1>"" and ""Polish-Bolshevik War"". This second term is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it is also referred as the ""War of 1920"". There is disagreement over the dates of the war. <fact2>The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its article with the date range 1919-1920</fact2> but then states, ""Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state Józef Piłsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May."" <fact3>The Polish Internetowa encyklopedia PWN, as well as Western historians such as Norman Davies, consider 1919 the starting year of the war.</fact3> <fact4>The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the ceasefire was put in force in the autumn of 1920, the official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in March 1921.</fact4> While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier.

Answer:
Several sources give different dates for the war. <fact1>One source gives the dates as 1919-1921</fact1>, which is two years. <fact2>Encyclopædia Britannica gives 1919-1920</fact2>, which is one year.  <fact3>Other sources consider 1919 as the starting year</fact3> and <fact4>1921 as the ending year (due to the treaty being signed in March of 1921)</fact4>, which is also two years.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. <fact1>On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September</fact1>. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. <fact2>On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac</fact2>, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa. How many years were there between the siege of Herceg Novi and Venice taking Vrgorac?

Answer: The passage states that <fact1>the siege of Herceg Novi started on 1 September 1687</fact1>.  It also states that <fact2>Venice took Vrgorac on 26 November 1690</fact2>. From September 1687 to September 1690 is three years.  Therefore, there are three years between the siege of Herceg Novi and Venice taking Vrgorac.

Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.

In January 1944, <fact1>the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino</fact1> and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament  is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months.

The racial makeup of the county was 97.63% White, 0.18% African American or Black, 1.07% Native American, 0.19% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.22% from other races, and 0.69% from two or more races.  1.26% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. <fact2>33.7% were of German</fact2> ancestry, <fact3>13.9% Swedish</fact3>, <fact4>10.1% Irish</fact4>, 8.8% United States, 7.0% English, and <fact5>5.4% Danish</fact5> ancestry according to Census 2000. How many more people were German than Irish and Danish combined?

Answer:
The question asks the difference between the German population and the combined Irish and Danish populations.  Here are the calculations:

* **German Population:** <fact1>7,791 people</fact1> * <fact2>0.337 (33.7%)</fact2> = 2624.67 people
* **Irish Population:** <fact1>7,791 people</fact1> * <fact4>0.101 (10.1%)</fact4> = 786.89 people
* **Danish Population:** <fact1>7,791 people</fact1> * <fact5>0.054 (5.4%)</fact5> = 420.71 people
* **Combined Irish and Danish:** 786.89 + 420.71 = 1207.6 people
* **Difference:** 2624.67 - 1207.6 = 1417.07 people

Since we are dealing with people, we should round to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, there were approximately {1417} more people of German ancestry than Irish and Danish combined.

Some 90 percent of people with Circassian descent now live in other countries, primarily in Turkey, Jordan and other countries of the Middle East, with only 300,000-400,000 remaining in what is now Russia. The depopulated Circassian lands were resettled by numerous ethnic groups, including Russians, Ukrainians and Georgians. Friction developed between the latter group and the remaining indigenous people in Abkhazia, a factor later contributing to friction between the two ethnic groups and the resulting War in Abkhazia.

Answer: The question asks for the number of *countries* Circassian refugees fled to.

**Answer:** The passage states that the Broncos ""<fact1>jumped out to a 10-0 lead</fact1>"" before the Rams ""<fact4>responded</fact4>"" with their first score.  This means the Rams were 10 points behind before they scored.  Since touchdowns are worth 6 points and the Broncos scored one touchdown (<fact2>4-yard touchdown run</fact2>) and one field goal (<fact3>49-yard field goal</fact3>), we know field goals are worth 3 points (6 + 3 = 9 + 1 for the extra point after the TD = 10 total points).  Therefore, the Rams were 10 points, or two scores (one touchdown and one field goal),  behind before their first score. While the questions asks how many *scores* behind they were, and since ""score"" can be interpreted as points, the answer is {10}.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties.

The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further  Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.

Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays.

The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys.  The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter.

Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of <fact1>25 men</fact1> ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjK'ixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of <fact2>49 soldiers</fact2> and <fact3>34 porters and archers</fact3> from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxB'ol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjK'ixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén. How many fighters did Diaz have with <fact2>49 soldiers</fact2> and <fact3>34 porters and archers</fact3>?

After joining with the advance party at Río Chakal, his force increased to <fact2>49 soldiers</fact2> and <fact3>34 porters and archers</fact3>. The question asks for the number of *fighters*. While the porters and archers likely had some combat capability,  the passage clearly distinguishes between the soldiers (<fact2>49</fact2>) and the porters and archers (<fact3>34</fact3>).  Therefore, considering only the soldiers as confirmed fighters, Díaz had 49 fighters.  If we assume all porters and archers were also fighters, then the total would be 49 + 34 = 83. However, the question doesn't explicitly state that the porters and archers are fighters, hence the more precise answer is {49}.

To find the percentage of crude palm oil produced in Thailand that is not consumed locally, we need to subtract the percentage consumed locally from the global output percentage.

How many percent of households as of <fact1>2000</fact1> were not married couples living together?

Answer: According to the passage, <fact4>44.0%</fact4> of households were married couples living together. Since the total percentage of households cannot exceed 100%, the percentage of households that are not married couples living together can be found by subtracting <fact4>44.0%</fact4> from 100%. However, we must note that the passage also mentions <fact5>11.6%</fact5> had a female householder with no husband present and <fact6>39.9%</fact6> were non-families. These percentages are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together. Therefore, we can find the percentage of households that are not married couples living together by subtracting <fact4>44.0%</fact4> from 100% and then subtracting <fact5>11.6%</fact5> and <fact6>39.9%</fact6> from the result. However, since <fact5>11.6%</fact5> and <fact6>39.9%</fact6> are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together, we can simply subtract <fact4>44.0%</fact4> from 100% and then subtract the result from 100% again. The first step is to subtract <fact4>44.0%</fact4> from 100%. <fact4>100%</fact4> - <fact4>44.0%</fact4> = <fact11>56.0%</fact11>. The second step is to subtract <fact11>56.0%</fact11> from 100%. <fact4>100%</fact4> - <fact11>56.0%</fact11> = <fact12>44.0%</fact12>. However, we must note that the passage also mentions <fact7>23.2%</fact7> of all households were made up of individuals and <fact8>3.8%</fact8> had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. These percentages are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together. Therefore, we can find the percentage of households that are not married couples living together by subtracting <fact4>44.0%</fact4> from 100% and then subtracting <fact7>23.2%</fact7> and <fact8>3.8%</fact8> from the result. However, since <fact7>23.2%</fact7> and <fact8>3.8%</fact8> are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together, we can simply subtract <fact4>44.0%</fact4> from 100% and then subtract the result from 100% again.

In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the ""Lenin Levy"", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had <fact2>1,025,000</fact2> members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to <fact3>1,200,000</fact3>. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately <fact4>3.5 million</fact4> members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in <fact5>1933</fact5> and <fact6>1935</fact6>, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from <fact7>1933</fact7> to <fact8>November 1936</fact8>. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to <fact9>1.9 million</fact9> by <fact10>1939</fact10>. Nicholas DeWitt gives <fact11>2.307 million</fact11> members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with <fact12>1.535 million</fact12> in 1929 and <fact13>6.3 million</fact13> in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over <fact14>19 million</fact14> members approximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly. How many members did the party lose 1933 to 1939?

Answer: According to the passage, the party membership in 1933 was approximately <fact4>3.5 million</fact4> members and in 1939 it was <fact9>1.9 million</fact9> members. To find the number of members lost, we need to subtract the 1939 membership from the 1933 membership. However, the passage does not explicitly state the membership in 1933, but it mentions that the party closed its ranks to new members from <fact7>1933</fact7> to <fact8>November 1936</fact8> and document verifications of membership ensued in <fact5>1933</fact5> and <fact6>1935</fact6>, removing supposedly unreliable members. This suggests that the membership in 1933 was not the actual number of members, but rather the number before the removal of unreliable members. Therefore, the actual number of members lost is the difference between the number of members in 1939 and the number of members before the removal of unreliable members in 1933, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, we can infer that the number of members lost is at least the difference between the number of members in 1933 and the number of members in 1939.",1600000,False,history_2234_a2ea2d15-157c-495e-8078-7634045e0643,True,DROP,248

Answer: The total number of students who like to dance or play badminton is <fact2>74</fact2> + <fact3>6</fact3> = 80 students.
The number of students who like to read or paint is the total number of students minus the number of students who like to dance or play badminton, which is <fact1>186</fact1> - <fact5>80</fact5> = 106 students.

It takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>. If they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes the maintenance worker spends cleaning rooms per day. Since it takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3> and they have to clean <fact1>160 rooms</fact1>, they will spend <fact1>160</fact1> * <fact3>15</fact3> = 2400 minutes cleaning rooms per day.
Since they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work a total of <fact4>10</fact4> * <fact5>60</fact5> = 600 minutes per day.
Therefore, they spend <fact6>2400</fact6> / <fact7>600</fact7> = 4 minutes out of every 10 minutes working on cleaning rooms.
To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, we can divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (<fact6>2400</fact6> / <fact7>600</fact7>) * 100 = 400%.
However, this is not the correct answer. The question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, not the percentage of the total minutes spent cleaning rooms. To find the correct answer, we need to divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (<fact6>2400</fact6> / <fact7>600</fact7>) * 100 = 400%. Then we need to convert the fraction of the day into a percentage. 400% is equivalent to 4/10, which is equivalent to 2/5. 2/5 is equivalent to 40%. Therefore, the maintenance worker spends 40% of their day cleaning rooms.

How many students are leaving early?

Answer: To find the number of students who are leaving early, we need to find the total number of students who are either swimmers, debate team members, or part of the choir. 
First, we need to find the number of students who are not swimmers. Since <fact1>40% of the class are swimmers</fact1>, the number of students who are not swimmers is <fact1>100%</fact1> - <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60% of the class. 
The number of students who are not swimmers is <fact3>60%</fact3> * <fact1>125 students</fact1> = 0.6 * 125 = 75 students.
Out of the remaining 75 students, <fact3>32%</fact3> are debate team members or part of the choir. 
The number of students who are debate team members or part of the choir is <fact3>32%</fact3> * 75 = 0.32 * 75 = 24 students.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many plums Yuki has in total. Since <fact1>Yuki has 35 square meters of plum field</fact1> and <fact2>there are 78 plums per square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the total number of plums as <fact1>35</fact1> * <fact2>78</fact2> = 2730 plums.
Since <fact3>Yuki can harvest his plums every 2 months</fact3>, we need to find out how many 2-month periods are there in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12/2 = 6 periods of 2 months in a year.
Therefore, Yuki can harvest <fact4>2730</fact4> plums / <fact3>6</fact3> periods = 455 plums per period.
Since there are 6 periods in a year, Yuki can harvest a total of 455 * 6 = 2730 plums within a year.

Answer: First, we need to find out how many pineapples are in Leon's field. Since there are <fact2>99 pineapples per square yard</fact2> and Leon has <fact1>90 square yards of pineapple field</fact1>, the total number of pineapples is <fact2>99</fact2> * <fact1>90</fact1> = 8910 pineapples.
Since Leon can harvest his pineapples every <fact3>4 months</fact3>, he can harvest a total of <fact3>4</fact3> / <fact4>12</fact4> = 1/3 of the pineapples per month.
In one year, there are <fact4>12</fact4> months, so Leon can harvest <fact4>12</fact4> * (1/3) = 4 times a year.
Therefore, Leon can harvest a total of <fact5>8910</fact5> * <fact6>4</fact6> = 35640 pineapples within a year.

Answer: Since <fact1>Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months</fact1>, he can harvest them twice within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months. 
First, we need to find out how many apricots <fact2>Luis has in total</fact2>. Since <fact1>he has 15 square yards of apricot field</fact1> and <fact2>there are 43 apricots per square yard</fact2>, he has <fact1>15</fact1> * <fact2>43</fact2> = 645 apricots in total.
Now, we need to find out how many apricots <fact3>Luis can harvest in 6 months</fact3>. Since he has 645 apricots in total and he can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest 645/2 = 322.5 apricots in 6 months. However, since he cannot harvest a fraction of an apricot, we can assume that he can harvest 322 apricots in 6 months.
Now, we can find out how many apricots <fact4>Luis can harvest within a year</fact4>. Since <fact3>Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months</fact3>, he can harvest 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 * 322 = 644 apricots.

After Theo takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 14 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Theo have to eat?
Answer: In the first 14 seconds, <fact1>80 kernels</fact1> popped.
In the next 14 seconds, <fact2>3 times that amount</fact2> popped, so <fact2>3*80=240 kernels</fact2> popped.

If they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?
Answer: The cleaner has <fact2>8 days</fact2> to clean <fact1>160 rooms</fact1>. Since it takes them <fact3>15 minutes per room</fact3>, they will need <fact1>160</fact1> * <fact3>15</fact3> = 2400 minutes to clean all the rooms.
Since they work <fact4>10 hours each day</fact4>, they work <fact4>10</fact4> * 60 = 600 minutes per day.

How many like to <fact4>play music</fact4> if the number that like to <fact5>dance</fact5> is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>?

Answer: The total number of students who like to hike or play hurling is <fact2>7</fact2> + <fact3>34</fact3> = 41 students.
Since the rest of the students like to either play music or dance, the number of students who like to play music or dance is <fact1>189</fact1> - <fact2>41</fact2> = 148 students.
Let's assume the number of students who like to play hurling is x. Then, the number of students who like to dance is <fact6>twice the number that prefer playing hurling</fact6>, which is 2x.
We know that the total number of students who like to dance or play music is 148. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 148.
Combine like terms: 3x = 148.
Divide both sides by 3: x = 49.33 (round down to 49 since we can't have a fraction of a student).
Now that we know x, we can find the number of students who like to dance: 2x = 2(49) = 98 students.
The number of students who like to play music is the total number of students who like to play music or dance minus the number of students who like to dance: 148 - 98 = 50 students.

On <fact4>Friday, he sold 13 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday</fact4> and <fact5>28 boxes of grape pie</fact5>. If <fact6>the cupcake cost ₣9</fact6> and <fact7>the grape pie cost ₣23</fact7>, how much did <fact8>Ibrahim earn for two days</fact8>?
Answer: On <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 boxes of cupcake</fact2> and <fact3>19 fewer boxes of grape pie, than on Friday</fact3>. So on <fact2>Thursday, he sold 26 - <fact3>19</fact3> = 7 boxes of grape pie.
On <fact4>Friday, he sold 13 more boxes of cupcakes than on Thursday</fact4> and <fact5>28 boxes of grape pie</fact5>. So on <fact4>Friday, he sold 26 + <fact4>13</fact4> = 39 boxes of cupcake.
The total number of boxes of cupcake sold is 26 + 39 = 65 boxes of cupcake.
The total number of boxes of grape pie sold is 7 + 28 = 35 boxes of grape pie.
Ibrahim earned <fact6>₣9</fact6> * 65 = ₣585 for the cupcake.
Ibrahim earned <fact7>₣23</fact7> * 35 = ₣805 for the grape pie.
Therefore, Ibrahim earned a total of ₣585 + ₣805 = ₣1390.

Due to the flu season, <fact3>50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied wards in the hospital after <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.
Answer: First, we need to find out how many wards are occupied at the beginning. Since <fact2>2/5</fact2> of the wards are occupied, the number of occupied wards is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>2/5</fact2> = 760 wards.
The total number of unoccupied wards at the beginning is <fact1>1900</fact1> - 760 = 1140 wards.
Since <fact3>50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day</fact3>, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is <fact3>50</fact3> * 21 = 1050 patients.
However, we are only interested in the number of wards, not the number of patients. Since each ward can accommodate 2 patients (as the number of occupied wards is 2/5 of the total wards), the total number of wards occupied by these patients is 1050 / 2 = 525 wards.
So, the total number of unoccupied wards after 3 weeks is 1140 - 525 = 615 wards.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we note that there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. 
To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we note that there are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.
The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we note that 25% is 25/25 = 1 times 25%, so it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a d20 die is 14/20, since there are 14 numbers greater than 5 on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total.

The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4, since there are 10 even numbers on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total, and the rolls are independent.

To find the difference in probability, we need to convert both probabilities to a common format. We can convert 14/20 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 14/20 = 0.7. We can convert 1/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1/4 = 0.25.

The difference in probability is 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.45. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: 0.45 * 100 = 45%.

Therefore, it is 45% more likely that Jin rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

Ava has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2> in her book, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>2 more weeks</fact4> of spring break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> between them by the end of the break.

How many signatures will Quinn need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Ava currently has <fact2>30 signatures</fact2>, and Quinn has <fact3>37 signatures</fact3>. Together, they have 30 + 37 = 67 signatures. Their goal is to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> by the end of spring break.  This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 67 = 68 signatures in the remaining <fact4>2 weeks</fact4>.

Ava's collection will be reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so over the <fact4>2 weeks</fact4> she will collect 5 * 2 = 10 fewer signatures than she did during the first <fact1>3 weeks</fact1>.  We don't know her exact rate during the first 3 weeks, but it's not necessary. We only need to know her reduction from the previous rate.

Therefore, Quinn needs to collect the remaining signatures herself, taking into account Ava's reduced rate: 68 signatures (total needed) - 10 signatures (Ava's reduction) = 58 signatures.

She wants to make a <fact2>vest, cardigan, shawl, gloves, and mittens</fact2> for each of them. It takes <fact3>5 skeins of wool to make a vest</fact3>, <fact4>4 for a cardigan</fact4>, <fact5>10 for a shawl</fact5>, <fact6>12 for a pair of gloves</fact6>, and <fact7>9 for a pair of mittens</fact7>. Sakura wants to make <fact8>two warm jackets for herself</fact8>, each needing <fact9>4 skeins of wool</fact9>. Each <fact10>dozen skeins of wool costs $9</fact10>. The store has a promotion where customers receive a <fact11>$20 discount on purchases over $100</fact11>. How much should Sakura pay for all the skeins of wool she needs?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins of wool needed for each grandchild.  For each grandchild, Sakura needs:

* Vest: <fact3>5 skeins</fact3>
* Cardigan: <fact4>4 skeins</fact4>
* Shawl: <fact5>10 skeins</fact5>
* Gloves: <fact6>12 skeins</fact6>
* Mittens: <fact7>9 skeins</fact7>

Total per grandchild: 5 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 9 = 40 skeins

Since she has <fact1>4 grandchildren</fact1>, she needs 40 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 160 skeins for her grandchildren.

Next, let's calculate the wool needed for her jackets. She needs <fact9>4 skeins</fact9>/jacket * <fact8>2 jackets</fact8> = 8 skeins for herself.

Therefore, the total number of skeins Sakura needs is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins.

Now, let's calculate the cost.  Since each <fact10>dozen (12) skeins costs $9</fact10>, the cost of 168 skeins is (168/12) * $9 = 14 * $9 = $126.

Finally, let's apply the discount. Since the total cost ($126) is <fact11>over $100</fact11>, Sakura receives a <fact11>$20 discount</fact11>.  So, the final amount Sakura should pay is $126 - $20 = $106.

How much more do <fact5>2 loaves of sourdough</fact5> cost than <fact6>8 muffins</fact6>?

Answer:  The cost of one muffin is one-eighth the cost of a loaf of sourdough, which is <fact1>$10</fact1> / 8 = $1.25. Since we are buying <fact6>8 muffins</fact6>, and this is more than <fact3>6 muffins</fact3>, we apply the <fact4>10% discount</fact4>.  The discount per muffin is $1.25 * 0.10 = $0.125.  Therefore, the discounted price per muffin is $1.25 - $0.125 = $1.125. The cost of <fact6>8 muffins</fact6> is 8 * $1.125 = $9. The cost of <fact5>2 loaves of sourdough</fact5> is 2 * <fact1>$10</fact1> = $20.  The difference in cost is $20 - $9 = $11.

After a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1330</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Nia bought <fact1>60 croissants</fact1>, which is 60/12 = 5 dozen croissants.  The cost of the croissants is 5 dozen * <fact1>$19/dozen</fact1> = $95.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons.  Nia bought <fact2>72 macarons</fact2>, which is 72/12 = 6 dozen macarons. The cost of the macarons is 6 dozen * <fact2>$20/dozen</fact2> = $120.

Before the discount, the total cost of the croissants and macarons was $95 + $120 = $215.  Let's denote the cost of the 36 brownies as 'x'.  So, before the discount, the total cost of all items was $215 + x.

Nia received a <fact4>5% discount</fact4>, meaning she paid 95% of the original price.  Therefore, 0.95 * ($215 + x) = <fact5>$1330</fact5>.

To solve for x, we first divide both sides by 0.95: $215 + x = $1330 / 0.95 = $1400

Subtracting $215 from both sides, we find the total cost of the brownies: x = $1400 - $215 = $1185.

Finally, since Nia bought <fact3>36 brownies</fact3>, this is 36/12 = 3 dozen brownies. Therefore, the cost of the brownies per dozen is $1185 / 3 = $395.

Answer: A d4 die has four sides, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For <fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>:  There are three numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, and 4). The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4. To roll it twice in a row, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.  Expressed as a percentage, this is (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%.

For <fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>: There are two odd numbers on a d4 die (1 and 3). The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2. To roll four odd numbers in a row, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%.

The difference in likelihood is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points.

Therefore, it is 50 percentage points more likely that Gabriel rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.  The answer is {50}.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to play music is <fact6>7 less than two times the number that prefer playing volleyball</fact6>?

Answer: First, let's find the total number of students who enjoy dance, chess, swimming, and volleyball.  This is <fact2>5</fact2> + <fact3>8</fact3> + <fact4>13</fact4> + <fact5>32</fact5> = 58 students.

Next, we determine the number of students who like to play music.  The question states that this number is <fact6>7 less than two times the number of students who prefer playing volleyball</fact6>.  Since <fact5>32 students like to play volleyball</fact5>, the number of students who like music is (2 * 32) - 7 = 57 students.

Now we can find the number of students who like to play video games. The total number of students is <fact1>230</fact1>. Subtracting the students with other hobbies, we get 230 - 58 - 57 = 115 students who like video games.

Therefore, 50% of the students like to play video games.  The answer is {50}.

How much younger is Leilani than the average age of all three?

Answer:

First, let's find Ravi's current age using <fact1>Ravi will be 47 in 8 years</fact1>.  His current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old.

Next, let's find Pavel's current age using <fact3>Ravi and Pavel are currently 22 years apart in age</fact3> and the fact that Ravi is younger than Pavel.  Pavel's current age is 39 + 22 = 61 years old.

Now, let's find Leilani's current age using <fact4>Ravi and Leilani are currently 10 years apart in age</fact4> and the fact that Ravi is older than Leilani. Leilani's current age is 39 - 10 = 29 years old.

To find the average age of all three, we add their ages together and divide by 3: (39 + 61 + 29) / 3 = 129 / 3 = 43 years old.

Finally, to determine how much younger Leilani is than the average age, we subtract Leilani's age from the average age: 43 - 29 = 14 years.

How many pizzas does this family eat in two months?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the daily pizza consumption of the family. The uncle and spouse together eat <fact1>16</fact1> + <fact2>16</fact2> = 32 pizzas per day.  The grandchild eats half of this, which is 32 / 2 = <fact3>16 pizzas per day</fact3>.  Therefore, the family's total daily consumption is 32 + 16 = 48 pizzas per day.

Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 48 pizzas/day * 30 days/month = 1440 pizzas in the first month.

In the second month, they reduce their consumption. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by <fact4>25%</fact4>.  This means they eat 48 pizzas/day * 0.75 = 36 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 36 pizzas/day * 15 days = 540 pizzas.

For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an <fact5>additional 50%</fact5> from the already reduced amount.  So they eat 36 pizzas/day * 0.5 = 18 pizzas/day.  Over 15 days, they consume 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas.

Therefore, in the second month, they eat a total of 540 + 270 = 810 pizzas.

Over the two months, the family eats 1440 + 810 = 2250 pizzas.

Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day.  <fact2>25% of 32 emails don't need a response</fact2>, which is 0.25 * 32 = 8 emails.  This means 32 - 8 = 24 emails require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many emails Sanjay responds to daily. He responds to <fact3>2 less than half</fact3> of the 24 emails that require a response. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is 12 - 2 = 10 emails.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first five complexes.  According to <fact2>, each of the first five complexes has 100 apartments, so there are 5 * 100 = 500 apartments in total.

Next, let's find the number of apartments in the sixth complex.  The question states in <fact3> that the sixth complex is 40% bigger than the other five combined (500 apartments).  Therefore, the sixth complex has 500 + (0.40 * 500) = 700 apartments.

Now let's account for the vacant apartments.  <fact4> states that 8 apartments in each of the first 5 complexes were vacant. This means a total of 5 * 8 = 40 apartments did not require service.

This leaves a total of 500 + 700 - 40 = 1160 apartments requiring garbage collection.

<fact5> tells us Hiroshi collects garbage twice a week from each apartment. So he makes 1160 apartments * 2 collections/apartment = 2320 collections.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Sunday through Friday, excluding Tuesday.

* **Sunday and Monday:**  He watched 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours of TV.
* **Wednesday:** He watched a 2-hour episode + a 1-hour episode = 3 hours of TV.
* **Thursday:** He watched 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours of TV.

Prof. Miller's net proceeds from the sale are the selling price (<fact1>$760,000</fact1>) minus the total fees and costs ($638,200) which equals $121,800.

This amount ($121,800) was invested in stocks.  After the first year, the stocks gained 10%, so the value increased by 0.10 * $121,800 = $12,180. The value at the end of the first year is $121,800 + $12,180 = $133,980.

After the second year, the stocks gained another 10%, which is 0.10 * $133,980 = $13,398.  Therefore, Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years are $133,980 + $13,398 = $147,378.

Answer:

First, let's determine the number of questions in each subject.

* **Chemistry:** <fact2>40% of 100 questions</fact2> = 0.40 * 100 = 40 questions
* **Geography:** <fact3>20% of 100 questions</fact3> = 0.20 * 100 = 20 questions
* **History and Algebra:** The remaining questions are 100 - 40 - 20 = 40 questions.  Since these are equally divided, there are 40 / 2 = 20 questions in each subject.

Next, let's calculate how many questions Aisha is sure to answer correctly in each subject:

* **Chemistry:** Aisha is sure to get <fact5>100% of the 40 chemistry questions</fact5>, so she will get 1.00 * 40 = 40 questions correct.
* **Geography:** Aisha is sure to get <fact4>25% of the 20 geography questions</fact4>, so she will get 0.25 * 20 = 5 questions correct.
* **History and Algebra:** Aisha is sure to get <fact6>a tenth of the 20 history and 20 algebra questions</fact6>, meaning she'll get (1/10) * 20 + (1/10) * 20 = 4 questions correct in total from these two subjects (2 correct from each subject).


Finally, let's add up the number of questions Aisha is sure to answer correctly across all subjects: 40 + 5 + 4 = 49 questions.  Since each question is worth one point, Aisha is sure to get 49 points.

Therefore, the answer is {49}.

How much money does Valeria have left?

Answer: Let's break down Valeria's spending:

* **Cotton Candy:**  She bought 23 pounds. The sale is for 15 pounds at €21/pound, with an additional 5 pounds at a 1/3 discount (€21 * (1 - 1/3) = €14).  The cost of the first 15 pounds is 15 * €21 = €315.  The cost of the next 5 pounds (at a discount) is 5 * €14 = €70.  The cost of the remaining 3 pounds is 3 * €21 = €63. The total cost of the cotton candy is €315 + €70 + €63 = €448.

* **Coral:** The coral cost <fact5>€11.0</fact5>.

* **Pins:** The pins cost 11 * €21.0 = €231.

* **Charity:** Valeria donated <fact7>€5</fact7>.

Total spending: €448 + €11 + €231 + €5 = €695

Leon has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to <fact6>cover a fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop</fact6>. How much money is Leon still missing?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop per day:  <fact1>¥150 (hotel)</fact1> + <fact2>¥30 (food)</fact2> + <fact3>¥10 (transportation)</fact3> = ¥190 per day. For a 2-day workshop, the total cost is ¥190 * 2 = ¥380.

Next, we subtract the cost covered by Leon's friends.  Since his friends are covering all the food, we need to calculate the daily food cost and then the total food cost for the 2 days.  The daily food cost is <fact2>¥30</fact2>, so for two days this is ¥30 * 2 = ¥60.  The total cost is now ¥380 - ¥60 = ¥320.

Now we consider the youth club's contribution. The youth club covers a fifth (<fact6>a fifth</fact6>) of the remaining cost, which is ¥320 / 5 = ¥64.

Therefore, after the youth club's contribution, the amount Leon still needs to raise is ¥320 - ¥64 = ¥256.  Finally, we consider the money Leon already has (<fact4>¥155</fact4>).  The amount Leon is still missing is ¥256 - ¥155 = ¥101.

How many more ounces of breads does Carlos need to consume than Zahra?

Answer: First, let's calculate Carlos's calorie needs.  His healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact4>200 lbs</fact4> = 3000 calories. He has consumed <fact5>900 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, meaning his net calorie consumption is 900 - 150 = 750 calories. Therefore, he needs 3000 - 750 = 2250 more calories.

Next, let's calculate Zahra's calorie needs. Her healthy daily calorie target is <fact3>15 calories per pound</fact3> * <fact7>150 lbs</fact7> = 2250 calories. She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>225 calories</fact9> = 1125 calories.  Therefore, she needs 2250 - 1125 = 1125 more calories.

Now, let's figure out how many calories are in one ounce of bread.  A <fact2>300-ounce bag</fact2> has 5 servings, so each serving is 300/5 = 60 ounces.  Since each serving has <fact1>225 calories</fact1>, one ounce of bread contains 225/60 = 3.75 calories.

Carlos needs 2250 more calories, so he needs 2250 / 3.75 = 600 ounces of bread.  Zahra needs 1125 more calories, so she needs 1125 / 3.75 = 300 ounces of bread.

Finally, the difference in the amount of bread Carlos and Zahra need is 600 - 300 = 300 ounces.

How many forks were in the package that Valentina bought?

Answer: Let's work backward from the final number of forks Valentina had.

* **Step 1: Account for guest forks:** The guests brought 2 packs * 8 forks/pack = 16 forks.  Subtract these from the final total: 49 - 16 = 33 forks.

* **Step 2: Account for used and defective forks:** Valentina used 6 forks and threw away 8 defective forks, meaning she lost 6 + 8 = 14 forks. Add these back to the total from Step 1: 33 + 14 = 47 forks.

* **Step 3: Account for husband's contribution:**  Her husband gave her 19 forks. Subtract these from the total from Step 2: 47 - 19 = 28 forks.

Therefore, the package Valentina bought initially contained 28 forks.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>3 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow</fact4>. How many potted plants will Sakura remain with?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Sakura had before receiving any new plants.  She had <fact2>7 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 420 plants</fact2>.

Next, let's account for the new plants. Two days ago, she received <fact1>49 new plants</fact1>, and yesterday, she bought <fact3>100 new plants</fact3>.  This means she received a total of 49 + 100 = 149 new plants. Note that the 50% discount is irrelevant to the total number of plants she now has.

So, before giving plants away, Sakura had 420 + 149 = 569 potted plants.

Finally, she will give away <fact4>3 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 180 plants</fact4>.

Therefore, Sakura will remain with 569 - 180 = 389 potted plants.  The answer is {389}.

If they work for <fact5>10 hours a day</fact5>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?

Answer:  The janitor initially takes <fact3>6 minutes</fact3> to clean a room, but due to the injury (<fact4>twice as long</fact4>), it now takes them 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes per room.  To clean all <fact1>80 rooms</fact1>, it will take them 12 minutes/room * 80 rooms = 960 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 960 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 16 hours of work.

Over <fact2>4 days</fact2>, this means they need to work an average of 16 hours / 4 days = 4 hours per day.

However, due to a recent injury, Fatima's speed has decreased by half <fact5>both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>26-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Fatima's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Due to her injury, her current speed on the beach is s/2.  Since she walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 44 minutes doing so, her current speed on the beach is:

Speed_beach = Distance_beach / Time_beach = <fact2>11 miles</fact2> / <fact6>44 minutes</fact6> = 0.25 miles/minute

Her original speed on the beach was therefore 2 * 0.25 miles/minute = 0.5 miles/minute.

According to <fact4>the problem</fact4>, her original speed on the sidewalk was three times her beach speed, which is 3 * 0.5 miles/minute = 1.5 miles/minute.  Due to the injury, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles/minute / 2 = 0.75 miles/minute.

The time spent on the sidewalk is:

Time_sidewalk = Distance_sidewalk / Speed_sidewalk = <fact3>15 miles</fact3> / 0.75 miles/minute = 20 minutes

Therefore, the total time to complete her walk is the sum of her time on the beach and her time on the sidewalk:

Note that Aisha can't work in parallel and needs to take a <fact5>7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them</fact5>.

Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Aisha to peel 120 clams.  Since she peels <fact1>10 clams per minute</fact1>, it will take her 120 clams / 10 clams/minute = 12 minutes to peel all the clams.

Next, we need to account for the clam washing time.  Washing each clam takes <fact4>14 seconds</fact4>, and there are 120 clams, so the total washing time is 120 clams * 14 seconds/clam = 1680 seconds.  Converting this to minutes, we get 1680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 28 minutes.

The total time for peeling is the peeling time plus washing time: 12 minutes + 28 minutes = 40 minutes.

After peeling, Aisha takes a <fact5>7-minute break</fact5> before sautéing.

Now let's figure out the sautéing time.  Aisha sautés <fact2>30 clams in 6 minutes</fact2>, meaning her sautéing rate is 30 clams / 6 minutes = 5 clams per minute. To sauté <fact3>120 clams</fact3> will take 120 clams / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes.

Finally, we add up all the times: 40 minutes (peeling and washing) + 7 minutes (break) + 24 minutes (sautéing) = 71 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Aisha 71 minutes to peel and sauté 120 clams. The answer is {71}.

Andre gives <fact6>1/10 of the made popcorn to his brother Jin</fact6>. How many more pieces of popcorn does Andre have to eat than his brother?

Answer:  First, let's calculate the popcorn popping in each 10-second interval:

* **Interval 1:** <fact1>80 kernels popped</fact1>.
* **Interval 2:** <fact2>4 * 80 = 320 kernels popped</fact2>.
* **Interval 3:** <fact3>6 * 80 = 480 kernels popped</fact3>.
* **Interval 4:** <fact4>480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped</fact4>.

After the pot is removed,  <fact5>240 / 4 = 60 kernels pop from residual heat</fact5>.

The total number of popped kernels is 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180.

Andre gives <fact6>1/10 of 1180 to Jin</fact6>, which is 1180 / 10 = 118 kernels.

Andre keeps 1180 - 118 = 1062 kernels.

Answer:  First, let's determine Priya's current age.  In 5 years, Priya will be twice Diego's current age (<fact2>2 times as old as Diego is now</fact2>), which is 2 * <fact1>21</fact1> = 42 years old.  Therefore, Priya's current age is 42 - 5 = 37 years old.

Next, let's find Qasim's current age.  Qasim is 9 years younger than Diego (<fact3>Diego's brother, Qasim, is 9 years younger than Diego</fact3>), so Qasim is <fact1>21</fact1> - 9 = 12 years old.

Now, let's find Mia's current age. Mia is 10 years older than Qasim (<fact4>Priya's sister Mia is 10 years older than Qasim</fact4>), making Mia 12 + 10 = 22 years old.

In 4 years, their ages will be:

* Priya: 37 + 4 = 41 years old
* Qasim: 12 + 4 = 16 years old
* Mia: 22 + 4 = 26 years old

To find the average age in 4 years, we add their ages and divide by 4: (25 + 41 + 16 + 26) / 4 = 108 / 4 = 27 years old.

Therefore, the average age of all four in 4 years will be 27.

How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

Answer:  Currently, Chen and Tara have a combined total of <fact2>36</fact2> + <fact3>32</fact3> = 68 signatures.  Their goal is to reach <fact5>140 signatures</fact5> by the end of the <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> of winter break. This means they need to collect an additional 140 - 68 = 72 signatures.

During the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen's weekly collection is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures</fact6>.  Therefore, over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen will collect 4 weeks * (her current weekly rate - 5) signatures = an unknown number of signatures.  We don't know Chen's current weekly rate, but we can work out how many signatures Chen will add to her total:

Let's say Chen's current weekly average is 'x' signatures. Then her new weekly rate is (x-5) signatures. After 4 weeks she will have collected 4(x-5) signatures in total.

Tara needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach their goal.  Let's say Tara collects 'y' signatures per week.  Over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Tara will collect 4y signatures.

The total number of signatures collected by Chen and Tara in the remaining 4 weeks must equal 72.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

4(x-5) + 4y = 72

We don't know 'x', but we know that over 5 weeks Chen collected 36 signatures. Therefore we can estimate x to be approximately 36/5 = 7.2. Thus 4(7.2-5) = 8.8


Solving for 'y' (Tara's weekly collection):

4(7.2 - 5) + 4y = 72
8.8 + 4y = 72
4y = 72 - 8.8
4y = 63.2
y = 15.8

Since Tara cannot collect parts of signatures, she needs to collect at least 16 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 140 signatures.

Therefore, Tara will need to collect at least  {16} signatures per week.

Now let's add up all Ava's expenses:  The cotton candy cost $418, the coral cost <fact5>$11.0</fact5>, the pins cost $369, and the charity donation was <fact7>$5</fact7>.  Therefore, her total spending is $418 + $11 + $369 + $5 = $803.

Finally, to find out how much money Ava has left, we subtract her total spending from the amount her parents gave her: <fact1>$1400</fact1> - $803 = $597.

Therefore, Ava has $597 left. The answer is {597}.

From the rest, Carlos can only respond to <fact3>4 less than the half of them</fact3>. How many emails does Carlos respond to in a <fact4>4 day work week</fact4>? Carlos work overtime on the last day so he can respond to <fact5>75% more emails than usual</fact5>.

Answer:

First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day.  Since <fact2>25% of the 32 emails don't require a response</fact2>, that means 32 * 0.25 = 8 emails don't need a response.  Therefore, Carlos receives 32 - 8 = 24 emails that require a response each day.

Next, let's determine how many of those emails Carlos can actually respond to.  <fact3>He responds to 4 less than half</fact3>, so he responds to (24 / 2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 emails daily.

Now, let's calculate the number of emails Carlos responds to during a regular <fact4>4-day work week</fact4>.  That's 8 emails/day * 4 days = 32 emails.

Finally, let's account for the overtime on the last day. On that day, due to <fact5>responding to 75% more emails than usual</fact5>, Carlos responds to 8 emails * 1.75 = 14 emails.  Therefore, the total number of emails responded to during the work week is 32 (regular days) + 14 (overtime) = 46 emails.

Therefore, Carlos responds to 46 emails in his 4-day work week.

Benjamin has <fact2>720 crackers</fact2>, <fact3>9 bowls</fact3> and <fact4>3 plates</fact4>. Unfortunately, <fact5>2 plates break</fact5>. Benjamin then eats <fact6>one-eighth of all the crackers</fact6>. How many more bowls does Benjamin need so he can place all the remaining crackers?

Answer: First, let's determine the capacity of each plate.  Since each plate holds twice the number of crackers as a bowl (<fact1>21 crackers per bowl</fact1>), each plate can hold 21 * 2 = 42 crackers.

Next, calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates before the breakage.  Benjamin has <fact3>9 bowls</fact3>, each holding <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, for a total of 9 * 21 = 189 crackers. He initially has <fact4>3 plates</fact4>, each holding 42 crackers, for a total of 3 * 42 = 126 crackers.  Combined, the bowls and plates could hold 189 + 126 = 315 crackers.

After <fact5>2 plates break</fact5>, the total capacity is reduced by 2 * 42 = 84 crackers. The new capacity is 315 - 84 = 231 crackers.

Benjamin starts with <fact2>720 crackers</fact2> and eats <fact6>one-eighth</fact6> of them, which is 720 / 8 = 90 crackers.  This leaves him with 720 - 90 = 630 crackers.

To determine how many more bowls are needed, we find out how many bowls would be required to hold all 630 remaining crackers.  Each bowl holds <fact1>21 crackers</fact1>, so the number of bowls needed is 630 / 21 = 30 bowls.

Finally, subtract the number of bowls Benjamin already has (<fact3>9 bowls</fact3>) from the number of bowls needed (30 bowls): 30 - 9 = 21.  Therefore, Benjamin needs 21 more bowls.

If he watched <fact7>28 hours</fact7> of TV in all, how many <fact2>30-minute</fact2> episodes did he watch on Friday?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Wednesday to Monday excluding Friday:

* **Wednesday:** 4 hours
* **Thursday:** 4 hours
* **Saturday:** 5 hours + (15 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 5.25 hours
* **Sunday:** 4 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 12 hours
* **Monday:** 3 episodes * (45 minutes/episode / 60 minutes/hour) = 2.25 hours

Total time (excluding Friday): 4 + 4 + 5.25 + 12 + 2.25 = 27.5 hours

Now, subtract this from the total TV time for the week (<fact7>28 hours</fact7>): 28 hours - 27.5 hours = 0.5 hours.

This 0.5 hours is the time spent watching the 30-minute show on Friday.  Since each episode is <fact2>30 minutes</fact2> (or 0.5 hours), Faisal watched 0.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 1 episode on Friday. The answer is {1}.

When they reach the mall, they remember they forgot their wallets at home, so they have to return to pick up their wallets and then walk all the way back to the mall again. Once they reach the mall for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the grocery store without being late?

Answer:  The total time it takes to initially reach the mall is the sum of the time to reach the gym and the time to reach the mall from the gym: <fact2>24 minutes</fact2> + <fact3>27 minutes</fact3> = 51 minutes.

Returning home from the mall and then going back to the mall takes twice the initial travel time to the mall: 51 minutes * 2 = 102 minutes.

The total time spent going to the mall, returning home, and then returning to the mall is 102 minutes.

The time remaining after these trips is the initial time allotted minus the time spent: <fact1>261 minutes</fact1> - 102 minutes = 159 minutes.

If the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each item:

* **Apples:** <fact1>5 boxes * 7 pounds/box = 35 pounds</fact1>
* **Carrots:** <fact2>14 bags * 5 pounds/bag = 70 pounds</fact2>
* **Hay:** <fact3>35 packs * 44 pounds/pack = 1540 pounds</fact3>
* **Wheat:** <fact4>19 sacks * 15 pounds/sack = 285 pounds</fact4>
* **Groceries:** <fact5>43 pounds</fact5>
* **Tools:** <fact6>27 pounds</fact6>
* **Wood:** <fact7>100 pounds</fact7>

Now, let's find the total weight of all the items: 35 + 70 + 1540 + 285 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 2100 pounds

Since each truck can carry <fact8>100 pounds</fact8>, the total number of trips needed with one truck would be 2100 pounds / 100 pounds/trip = 21 trips.

However, the farmer has <fact9>three trucks</fact9>, so the number of trips per truck is 21 trips / 3 trucks = 7 trips per truck.

Therefore, the farmer needs a total of 21 trips to transport all the purchased items.  Each of the three trucks will make 7 trips.

If <fact6>56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>32-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Emma walks 14 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 56 minutes.  Therefore, her speed on the beach *before* her injury was (14 kilometers / 56 minutes) = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or 0.25/2 = 0.125 kilometers per minute.

Emma walks 18 kilometers on the sidewalk. Before her injury, she walked three times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach (<fact4>three times the rate of speed</fact4>), meaning her sidewalk speed was 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 kilometers per minute.  After her injury, her sidewalk speed is halved (<fact5>speed has decreased by half</fact5>), so it's now 0.75/2 = 0.375 kilometers per minute.


It takes her 18 kilometers / 0.375 kilometers/minute = 48 minutes to walk on the sidewalk.

After a <fact4>20% discount</fact4>, she paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. What was the cost of <fact3>brownies per dozen</fact3>?

Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants.  Aisha bought <fact1>24 croissants at $12 per dozen</fact1>, which means she bought 2 dozen croissants (24 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 2 dozen).  The cost of the croissants was 2 dozen * $12/dozen = $24.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Aisha bought <fact2>48 macarons at $20 per dozen</fact2>, which means she bought 4 dozen macarons (48 macarons / 12 macarons/dozen = 4 dozen). The cost of the macarons was 4 dozen * $20/dozen = $80.

Now, let's find the pre-discount total cost. Before the discount, the total cost was the cost of the croissants plus the cost of the macarons plus the cost of the brownies (which we'll call 'x').  So, the pre-discount total was $24 + $80 + x.

Aisha received a <fact4>20% discount</fact4> and paid a total of <fact5>$1520</fact5>. This means that 80% of the original price was $1520.  We can set up an equation: 0.80 * ($24 + $80 + x) = $1520.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.80 * (104 + x) = 1520.  Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get: 104 + x = 1900.  Subtracting 104 from both sides, we find x = $1800.  Therefore, the total cost of the brownies was $1800.

Finally, since Aisha bought <fact3>24 brownies</fact3>, which is 2 dozen (24 brownies / 12 brownies/dozen = 2 dozen), the cost per dozen brownies was $1800 / 2 dozen = $900 per dozen.

How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura?

Answer: First, let's calculate Theo's and Sakura's calorie needs.  Theo's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact4>250 lbs</fact4> = 3750 calories. He has already consumed <fact5>1100 calories</fact5> and burned <fact6>150 calories</fact6>, so his net calorie consumption is 1100 - 150 = 950 calories. Therefore, Theo needs 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.  Sakura's target calorie intake is <fact3>15 calories/lb</fact3> * <fact7>130 lbs</fact7> = 1950 calories.  She has consumed <fact8>900 calories</fact8> + <fact9>175 calories</fact9> = 1075 calories. Thus, Sakura needs 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Next, let's determine the calorie content per ounce of cookies.  Each serving contains <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a <fact2>125 oz bag</fact2> has 5 servings.  Therefore, one ounce of cookies contains 175 calories / 5 servings / (125 oz / 5 servings) = 2.8 calories/oz.

If <fact6>65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>29-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Olivia walks 13 miles on the beach and it takes her 65 minutes.  Therefore, her speed on the beach before her injury was 13 miles / 65 minutes = 0.2 miles/minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that,  0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles/minute <fact5>(speed decreased by half on the beach)</fact5>.

Since she walks at four times the speed on the sidewalk as on the beach <fact4>(four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk)</fact4>, her sidewalk speed before the injury was 4 * 0.2 miles/minute = 0.8 miles/minute. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is half that: 0.8 miles/minute / 2 = 0.4 miles/minute <fact5>(speed decreased by half on the sidewalk)</fact5>.

Now we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk.  Olivia walks 16 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.4 miles/minute. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 0.4 miles/minute = 40 minutes.

Finally, to find the total time for the walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 65 minutes (beach) + 40 minutes (sidewalk) = 105 minutes.

Answer:  A four-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Let's analyze the probabilities:

* **Fact 2: Rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:** The numbers greater than 2 on the <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> are 3 and 4.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2 = 50%. The probability of this happening twice in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25% or 0.25.

* **Fact 3: Rolling four even numbers in a row:** The only even number on the <fact1>four-sided die</fact1> is 2.  Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number (a 2) on a single roll is 1/4 = 25%. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/256 ≈ 0.39% or 0.0039.

To find the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:

25% - 0.39% = 24.61%

Therefore, Tariq is 24.61 percentage points more likely to roll a number greater than 2 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.

After a <fact4>third swam away</fact4>, 24/3 = 8 remoras left, representing a total length of 8 * 18 = 144 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the 144 inches is equivalent to 144/12 = 12 feet.

The percentage of the <fact1>48-foot dolphin's</fact1> body length covered by remoras is (12 feet / 48 feet) * 100% = 25%.

Next, let's consider the second dolphin. It had <fact6>6 remoras</fact6>, each <fact7>8 inches long</fact7>, totaling 6 * 8 = 48 inches.  This is equivalent to 48/12 = 4 feet.

The percentage of the <fact5>10-foot dolphin's</fact5> body length covered by remoras is (4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%.

To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 40%) / 2 = 32.5%.

Therefore, on average, 32.5% of each dolphin's body length is covered by remoras.  The answer is {32.5}.

She also needs <fact4>9 washers</fact4> at <fact5>¥0.59 each</fact5>, and <fact6>8 gallons of paint</fact6>. Liam has <fact7>¥90</fact7> and wants <fact8>10 gallons of paint</fact8> at <fact9>¥8.0 each</fact9>, and <fact10>3 carpenter pencils</fact10> at <fact11>¥2 each</fact11>. The store offers a <fact12>10% discount on paint for members</fact12>, and Liam is a member. How much more money does Valentina have left than Liam after they leave the store?

Answer: Let's calculate Valentina's expenses first.

* **Screws:** <fact2>17 screws</fact2> * <fact3>¥0.3/screw</fact3> = ¥5.10
* **Washers:** <fact4>9 washers</fact4> * <fact5>¥0.59/washer</fact5> = ¥5.31
* **Paint:**  The cost of Valentina's paint is 8 gallons * the price per gallon (which is not given but is irrelevant since we only need the final amount).

Valentina's total spending is ¥5.10 + ¥5.31 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint) =  ¥10.41 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint).  We don't need to know the exact price per gallon of paint since it will subtract equally from both total amounts.


Now let's calculate Liam's expenses.

* **Paint:** <fact8>10 gallons</fact8> * <fact9>¥8.0/gallon</fact9> = ¥80.00.  With a <fact12>10% discount</fact12>, Liam pays ¥80.00 * 0.90 = ¥72.00
* **Pencils:** <fact10>3 pencils</fact10> * <fact11>¥2/pencil</fact11> = ¥6.00

Liam's total spending is ¥72.00 + ¥6.00 = ¥78.00

To find the difference in remaining money, we calculate:

Valentina's remaining money: <fact1>¥99.41</fact1> - ¥10.41 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)  = ¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)
Liam's remaining money: <fact7>¥90</fact7> - ¥78.00 = ¥12.00

The difference is (¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)) - ¥12.00 = ¥77 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint).  As long as the price per gallon for paint is the same for both, the cost of paint cancels out, and Valentina has ¥77 more left than Liam.


Therefore, Valentina has ¥77 more money left than Liam after they leave the store. Note that we don't need the price per gallon of paint to solve this problem.

On the sidewalk, Keisha walks at <fact4>two times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Keisha's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If <fact5>51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as 's'.  Before her injury, her sidewalk speed was <fact4>twice her beach speed</fact4>, or 2s. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now s/2, and her speed on the sidewalk is now 2s/2 = s.

We know she spends <fact5>51 minutes on the beach</fact5> and covers <fact2>17 miles</fact2>. Therefore, her current beach speed is 17 miles / 51 minutes = 1/3 mile per minute.

Since her sidewalk speed is the same as her original speed on the beach, her current sidewalk speed is also 1/3 mile per minute.  The time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance on the sidewalk (<fact3>16 miles</fact3>) divided by her sidewalk speed (1/3 mile/minute), which is 16 miles / (1/3 mile/minute) = 48 minutes.

To find the total walking time, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 51 minutes (beach) + 48 minutes (sidewalk) = 99 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Keisha 99 minutes to complete her entire <fact1>33-mile walk</fact1>.

If <fact5>42 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact5>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>28-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer:  We know Rania walks <fact2>14 kilometers on the beach</fact2> and it takes her <fact5>42 minutes</fact5>.  This means her speed on the beach, before her injury, would have been 14 km / 42 min = 1/3 km/min. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or (1/3)/2 = 1/6 km/min.  Therefore, her current walking time on the beach remains 42 minutes.

Rania walks <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Before her injury, her speed on the sidewalk was <fact4>twice her beach speed</fact4>, so it would have been 2 * (1/3 km/min) = 2/3 km/min.  After her injury, her sidewalk speed is half of that, or (2/3)/2 = 1/3 km/min.

To find her current sidewalk walking time, we divide the distance by her reduced speed: 14 km / (1/3 km/min) = 42 minutes.

Therefore, her total walking time is the sum of her beach and sidewalk times: 42 minutes (beach) + 42 minutes (sidewalk) = 84 minutes.

**Answer:**

1. **First 10 seconds:** <fact1>80 kernels</fact1> popped.
2. **Next 10 seconds:** <fact2>4 times</fact2> the initial amount popped, so 80 * 4 = 320 kernels popped.
3. **Following 10 seconds:** <fact3>6 times</fact3> the initial popping rate (<fact1>80 kernels</fact1>) occurred, meaning 80 * 6 = 480 kernels popped.
4. **Final 10 seconds:** The rate slowed to <fact4>half</fact4> of the previous 10 seconds, so 480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped.
5. **Residual heat:** <fact5>A quarter</fact5> of the kernels from the final 10 seconds popped after the heat was off, which is 240 / 4 = 60 kernels.

Answer: 
A <fact1>d4 die</fact1> has four possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For the first scenario (<fact2>rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row</fact2>):
* The numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, and 4.  So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4.
* The probability of this happening twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

For the second scenario (<fact3>rolling four odd numbers in a row</fact3>):
* The odd numbers on a d4 are 1 and 3. So there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes.
* The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2.
* The probability of this happening four times in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16.

To express the difference in percentage points, we convert the probabilities to percentages:
* Probability of rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row: (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%
* Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row: (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%

The difference is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points. The answer is {50}.

**Answer:**

First, let's figure out how many emails Sanjay receives that *do* require a response each day. Since <fact2>25% don't require a response</fact2>, that means 100% - 25% = 75% *do* require a response.  So, he needs to respond to 0.75 * <fact1>32 emails</fact1> = 24 emails.

How many pizzas does this family eat in <fact10>two months</fact10>?


**Answer:**

1. **Pizzas per day (Month 1):**
    * Uncle: <fact1>16 pizzas</fact1>
    * Spouse: <fact2>16 pizzas</fact2>
    * Grandchild: (<fact1>16</fact1> + <fact2>16</fact2>) / 2 = <fact3>16 pizzas</fact3>
    * Total: 16 + 16 + 16 = 48 pizzas

2. **Pizzas in first month (<fact4>Month 1</fact4>):**
    * Assuming a 30-day month: 48 pizzas/day * 30 days = 1440 pizzas

3. **Pizzas per day (first half of <fact5>second month</fact5>):**
    * Reduction of <fact6>25%</fact6>: 48 pizzas * (1 - 0.25) = 36 pizzas/day

4. **Pizzas in first half of second month (<fact7>first half</fact7>):**
    * 36 pizzas/day * 15 days = 540 pizzas

5. **Pizzas per day (second half of <fact5>second month</fact5>):**
    * Additional reduction of <fact8>50%</fact8> from the reduced amount: 36 pizzas * (1 - 0.50) = 18 pizzas/day

6. **Pizzas in second half of second month (<fact9>second half</fact9>):**
    * 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas

7. **Total pizzas in second month (<fact5>Month 2</fact5>):**
    * 540 + 270 = 810 pizzas

8. **Total pizzas in <fact10>two months</fact10>:**
    * <fact4>Month 1</fact4>: 1440 pizzas
    * <fact5>Month 2</fact5>: 810 pizzas
    * Total: 1440 + 810 = 2250 pizzas


Therefore, the family eats 2250 pizzas in two months.  The answer is {2250}.

If they work for <fact5>10 hours a day</fact5>, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms?


Answer:
It takes the janitor <fact3>6 minutes</fact3> * <fact4>2</fact4> = 12 minutes to clean each room now.
To clean all <fact1>80 rooms</fact1>, it will take them 12 minutes/room * <fact1>80 rooms</fact1> = 960 minutes.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 960 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 16 hours.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is <fact3>7% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the transfer fee that is <fact4>12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount</fact5> on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

**Answer:**

1. **Discounted Price:** With a <fact5>20% discount</fact5>, the selling price of the house becomes <fact2>$500,000</fact2> * (1 - 0.20) = $400,000.

2. **Brokerage Fee:** The brokerage fee is <fact3>7%</fact3> of the discounted selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.07 = $28,000.

3. **Transfer Fee:** The transfer fee is <fact4>12%</fact4> of the discounted selling price, which is $400,000 * 0.12 = $48,000.

4. **Total Cost:** The total cost of the house, including fees, is the discounted price + brokerage fee + transfer fee: $400,000 + $28,000 + $48,000 = $476,000.

5. **Amount Over Budget:** The total cost exceeds Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$410,000 budget</fact1> by $476,000 - $410,000 = $66,000.

Therefore, the total cost will be $66,000 more than Mrs. Smith's budget. The answer is {66000}.

**Answer:**

Chen started with <fact1>$1300</fact1>.

She bought <fact3>23 kgs</fact3> of taffy. The first 16 kgs cost <fact2>$22/kg</fact2>, so that's 16 * <fact2>$22</fact2> = $352.  The remaining 23 - 16 = 7 kgs were 1/4 off, but since the deal is for 6 kgs, she got a discount only on the first 6 kg.  These 6 kgs cost 3/4 * <fact2>$22</fact2> * 6 = $99. The last remaining 1 kg of the 7kg was at normal price and it cost <fact2>$22</fact2> * 1 = $22. Her total taffy cost was $352 + $99 + $22 = $473.

She also spent <fact4>$11</fact4> on starfish and <fact5>11</fact5> * <fact6>$21</fact6> = $231 on keychains.

**Answer:**

1. **Donuts:** Nadia bought <fact1>60 donuts</fact1>, which is <fact1>60</fact1> / 12 = 5 dozens.  At <fact2>$14 per dozen</fact2>, the donuts cost 5 * <fact2>$14</fact2> = $70.

2. **Mini Cupcakes:** Nadia bought <fact3>60 mini cupcakes</fact3>, which is <fact3>60</fact3> / 12 = 5 dozens. At <fact4>$25 per dozen</fact4>, the cupcakes cost 5 * <fact4>$25</fact4> = $125.

3. **Total before discount and cheesecakes:** The cost of donuts and cupcakes combined is $70 + $125 = $195.

4. **Total before discount:**  Since Nadia paid <fact7>$1540</fact7> after a <fact6>20% discount</fact6>, this amount represents 80% of the original price. Therefore, the total cost before the discount was <fact7>$1540</fact7> / 0.80 = $1925.

**Answer:**

The cost of a muffin is <fact2>one-eighth</fact2> the cost of <fact3>a loaf of sourdough</fact3>, which costs <fact1>$10</fact1>. So, each muffin costs <fact1>10</fact1> * (<fact2>1/8</fact2>) = $1.25.

Since 8 muffins qualifies for the <fact4>6 muffins or more</fact4> promotion, the cost of <fact7>8 muffins</fact7> is reduced by <fact5>10%</fact5>.  The discount is $1.25 * <fact7>8</fact7> * <fact5>0.10</fact5> = $1.00. Thus, <fact7>8 muffins</fact7> cost $1.25 * <fact7>8</fact7> - $1.00 = $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

She used a total of <fact4>220 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

**Answer:**

Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (51:5)</fact1>, we have s/w = 51/5.
From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (7 tablespoons milk : 5 cups water)</fact2>, we have m/w = 7/5.
From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons cream : 1 teaspoon sugar)</fact3>, we have c/s = 2/1 or c = 2s.

We are given that the total quantity of ingredients is <fact4>220</fact4>:  s + w + m + c = 220.

We can express w, m, and c in terms of s:

* w = (5/51)s
* m = (7/5)w = (7/5) * (5/51)s = (7/51)s
* c = 2s

Now substitute these into the total quantity equation:

s + (5/51)s + (7/51)s + 2s = 220

Combine the terms with 's':

(1 + 5/51 + 7/51 + 2)s = 220
(3 + 12/51)s = 220
(3 + 4/17)s = 220
(55/17)s = 220

Now, solve for s:

s = (220 * 17) / 55
s = (4 * 17)
s = 68

Therefore, Olivia used 68 teaspoons of sugar.  The answer is {68}.

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at <fact4>three times</fact4> the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, <fact5>Emma's speed has decreased by half</fact5> both on the beach and sidewalk. If <fact6>56 minutes</fact6> of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk, in minutes?


**Answer:**

Before the injury, Emma walked 14 kilometers on the beach in some amount of time *t*.  Since her speed is halved after the injury (<fact5>), she now takes twice as long, 2*t, to walk the same distance on the beach (<fact2>). We are told this time is <fact6>56 minutes</fact6>. So, 2*t = <fact6>56 minutes</fact6>, which means t = 28 minutes. This was her time on the beach *before* the injury.

Her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was three times her speed on the beach (<fact4>).  So, if it took her 28 minutes to walk the 14 km on the beach, it would have taken her 28 / 3 = 9.33 minutes to walk 14 km on the sidewalk at that faster pace (before the injury).

Since the sidewalk portion of her walk is 18 km (<fact3>), not 14 km, we can set up a proportion to find the pre-injury sidewalk time:

(9.33 minutes / 14 km) = (x minutes / 18 km)

Solving for x, we get approximately 12 minutes. This was her sidewalk time before the injury.

After the injury, her speed was halved on *both* the beach and the sidewalk (<fact5>). So, her beach time is now 28 minutes * 2 = 56 minutes (as given - <fact6>).  Her sidewalk time is now 12 minutes * 2 = 24 minutes.

Therefore, her total walking time after the injury is 56 minutes + 24 minutes = 80 minutes. The answer is {80}.

2. **Medium cubes:** He used <fact9>12 medium cubes</fact9> * <fact3>3 ounces/cube</fact3> = 36 ounces of water.

3. **Small cubes:** He used <fact8>14 small cubes</fact8> * <fact4>0.5 ounces/cube</fact4> = 7 ounces of water.

4. **Tiny cubes:**  Since he made a total of <fact6>47 ice cubes</fact6>, and we know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes (<fact7>9</fact7> + <fact9>12</fact9> + <fact8>14</fact8> = 35 cubes), there must be <fact6>47</fact6> - 35 = 12 tiny cubes.  Tiny cubes use <fact5>half the water of small cubes</fact5>, so each tiny cube uses <fact4>0.5 ounces</fact4> / 2 = 0.25 ounces.  Therefore, he used 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces of water.

5. **Total water used:** In total, Luca used 126 + 36 + 7 + 3 = 172 ounces of water.

6. **Water remaining:** Luca started with <fact1>337 ounces</fact1> and used 172 ounces, so he has <fact1>337</fact1> - 172 = 165 ounces of water left.

What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits?

**Answer:**

Gabrielle saw <fact5>15 bees</fact5>.  She saw <fact1>two-fifths as many wasps</fact1>, which means she saw (2/5) * <fact5>15</fact5> = 6 wasps.

She saw <fact3>half as many rabbits as white animals</fact3>, and there were <fact2>38 white animals</fact2>. So, she saw <fact2>38</fact2> / 2 = 19 rabbits.

The total number of animals is the sum of wasps, bees, rabbits, and caterpillars: 6 + <fact5>15</fact5> + 19 + <fact4>41</fact4> = 81 animals.

The percentage of rabbits is (number of rabbits / total number of animals) * 100%.  Therefore, the percentage of rabbits is (19 / 81) * 100% ≈ 23.46%.  Rounded to the nearest whole number, the answer is {23}.

During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, <fact2>Chen has 36 signatures</fact2> in her book, and <fact3>Tara has 32</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>4 more weeks</fact4> of winter break, and they decide they want to <fact5>reach 140 signatures between them</fact5> by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Chen's weekly collection rate during the first <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>.  She collected a total of <fact2>36 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, meaning she averaged <fact2>36</fact2> / <fact1>5</fact1> = 7.2 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate how many signatures Chen will collect in the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her collection rate is reduced by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so she will now collect 7.2 - <fact6>5</fact6> = 2.2 signatures per week. Over the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, she'll collect 2.2 * <fact4>4</fact4> = 8.8 signatures.  Since signatures must be whole numbers, we round this down to 8 signatures.

Now, let's determine how many signatures they have in total so far.  <fact2>Chen has 36</fact2> and <fact3>Tara has 32</fact3>, totaling <fact2>36</fact2> + <fact3>32</fact3> = 68 signatures.

Adding Chen's expected 8 additional signatures from the next <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, they will have 68 + 8 = 76 signatures.

They want to reach <fact5>140 signatures total</fact5>.  This means Tara needs to collect the remaining <fact5>140</fact5> - 76 = 64 signatures.

Finally, since Tara has <fact4>4 weeks</fact4> left, she needs to collect 64 / <fact4>4</fact4> = 16 signatures per week to meet their goal.

**Answer:**

1. **Calculate the space each plant needs:** Each plant requires <fact2>3 meters</fact2> (for its width) plus <fact3>15 meters</fact3> of space between it and the next plant, totaling 3 + 15 = 18 meters.

2. **Determine how many plants can fit:**  The flower bed is <fact1>150 meters long</fact1>.  Divide the total length by the space needed for each plant: 150 / 18 = 8.33. Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, Gabrielle can fit a maximum of 8 plants.

Due to the natural disaster, <fact4>30 patients are admitted into the clinic each day</fact4>. Calculate the <question>total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 3 weeks</question>.

**Answer:**

1. **Initial unoccupied rooms:** The clinic has a capacity of <fact1>1600 rooms</fact1>.  <fact2>One-tenth (1/10)</fact2> are occupied, meaning 1600 * (1/10) = 160 rooms are occupied.  <fact3>Two-fifths (2/5)</fact3> are out of service, meaning 1600 * (2/5) = 640 rooms are out of service. Initially, the number of unoccupied rooms is <fact1>1600</fact1> - 160 - 640 = 800.

2. **Rooms occupied after 3 weeks:**  There are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days.  <fact4>30 patients</fact4> are admitted each day, so 21 days * <fact4>30 patients/day</fact4> = 630 new patients are admitted.

3. **Total unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:** We assume each patient occupies one room. After 3 weeks, the number of occupied rooms will be 160 (initially occupied) + 630 (newly admitted) = 790 rooms.  The number of unoccupied serviceable rooms will be 1600 - 640 (out of service) - 790 (occupied) = 170 rooms. 

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms (including those out of service) after 3 weeks is 170 (serviceable unoccupied) + 640 (out of service) = 810 rooms.

She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer:
Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream.

From <fact1>the ratio of sugar to water (48:10)</fact1>, we have s/w = 48/10. This simplifies to w = (10/48)s = (5/24)s.

From <fact2>the ratio of milk to water (6 tablespoons for every 10 cups)</fact2>, we have m/w = 6/10. This means m = (3/5)w. Substituting the expression for 'w' in terms of 's', we get m = (3/5)*(5/24)s = (1/8)s.

From <fact3>the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons for every teaspoon)</fact3>, we have c/s = 2/1. So, c = 2s.

We are given that <fact4>the total quantity of ingredients used is 210</fact4>. Therefore, s + w + m + c = 210. Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get:
s + (5/24)s + (1/8)s + 2s = 210

Multiplying throughout by 24 to eliminate fractions:
24s + 5s + 3s + 48s = 5040
70s = 5040
s = 5040 / 70
s = 72

Therefore, Olga used 72 teaspoons of sugar. The answer is {72}.

2. **Determine the number of plants that can fit:** The flower bed is <fact1>144 feet long</fact1>.  So, <fact1>144 feet</fact1> / 25 feet/plant = 5.76 plants. Since Valentina can only plant whole plants, she can fit 5 plants in the flower bed.

3. **Calculate how many plants Valentina needs to buy:** She needs 5 plants and already has <fact4>5</fact4>.  Therefore, she doesn't need to buy any additional plants.

4. **Calculate the cost:** Since she doesn't need to buy any plants, Valentina will spend $0 at the store.

Haruka's flowers grow <fact2>3 meters wide</fact2>, so she needs to leave <fact3>13 meters</fact3> between every plant (including the plant's width). Haruka already owns <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. Each flowering plant costs <fact5>€8</fact5> at the store. However, if she buys more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she'll receive a <fact7>€9 discount</fact7> on the entire purchase. How much money will Haruka spend at the store to fill up her flower bed?


Answer:
The space each plant will occupy in the flower bed is the width of the plant (<fact2>3 meters</fact2>) plus the space between plants (<fact3>13 meters</fact3>), which is 3 + 13 = 16 meters.

The flower bed is <fact1>117 meters long</fact1>, so it can hold 117 / 16 = 7 plants with some space left over (5 meters, which isn't enough for another plant).

Haruka already has <fact4>6 flowers</fact4>. Since she can fit 7 plants and needs 1 more, she only needs to buy 7 - 6 = 1 plant from the store.

Since she's buying only 1 plant, which is not more than <fact6>2 plants</fact6>, she doesn't get the <fact7>€9 discount</fact7>.

Therefore, she'll spend 1 plant * <fact5>€8/plant</fact5> = €8 at the store.  The answer is {8}.

In Ms. Johnson's class of <fact1>150 students</fact1>, <fact2>40% of the class are soccer players</fact2>. Out of <fact3>the remaining class</fact3>, <fact4>30% of the students are dancers or part of choir members</fact4>. These <fact5>3 groups of students</fact5> will need to <fact6>leave early today to travel to an away competition</fact6>. <fact7>Half of the soccer players are absent for being sick</fact7>. Also, <fact8>3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups</fact8>. <fact9>How many students are leaving early to the competition?</fact9>


**Answer:**

First, we calculate the number of soccer players in the class: <fact1>150 students</fact1> * <fact2>40%</fact2> = 60 soccer players.  However, <fact7>half of these soccer players are absent</fact7>, so 60 / 2 = 30 soccer players are going to the competition.

Next, we determine the number of students who are not soccer players: <fact1>150 students</fact1> - 60 soccer players = 90 students.  Of these <fact3>remaining students</fact3>, <fact4>30% are dancers or choir members</fact4>: 90 students * <fact4>30%</fact4> = 27 dancers/choir members.

So, the total number of students from the <fact5>three groups</fact5> (<fact6>leaving early for the competition</fact6>) is 30 soccer players + 27 dancers/choir members = 57 students.

Finally, we add the cheerleaders:  <fact5>3 groups</fact5> * <fact8>3 cheerleaders/group</fact8> = 9 cheerleaders.

Therefore, the total number of people <fact6>leaving early for the competition</fact6> is 57 students + 9 cheerleaders = 66 people. Since the question asks for the number of *students* leaving early, the answer is 57.

The healthy daily calorie target is <fact4>15 calories per pound of body weight</fact4>. <fact5>Theo weighs 250 lbs</fact5>, and he has <fact6>already consumed 1100 calories</fact6> and <fact7>burned 150 calories through exercise</fact7>. <fact8>Sakura weighs 130 lbs</fact8>, and she has <fact9>already consumed 900 in food</fact9> and <fact10>175 calories in ice cream</fact10>. How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura?

**Answer:**

Theo's daily calorie target is <fact5>250 lbs</fact5> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 3750 calories.  He has a net calorie consumption of <fact6>1100 calories</fact6> - <fact7>150 calories</fact7> = 950 calories. This means he can still consume 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories.

Sakura's daily calorie target is <fact8>130 lbs</fact8> * <fact4>15 calories/lb</fact4> = 1950 calories. She has consumed <fact9>900 calories</fact9> + <fact10>175 calories</fact10> = 1075 calories. This means she can still consume 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories.

Each serving of cookies has <fact1>175 calories</fact1>, and a bag contains <fact3>5 servings</fact3>, totaling 175 * 5 = 875 calories per bag.  Since a bag is <fact2>125 oz</fact2>, each serving is 125 oz / 5 servings = 25 oz.

Theo can consume 2800 more calories, so he can eat 2800 calories / 175 calories/serving = 16 servings of cookies. This translates to 16 servings * 25 oz/serving = 400 oz of cookies.  Since a bag is 125 oz, this is more cookies than we have information for.  So we focus on how much he *can* eat from what is available: 125 oz.

Sakura can consume 875 more calories, which is exactly the number of calories in a <fact2>125 oz</fact2> bag of cookies (<fact3>5 servings</fact3> at <fact1>175 calories/serving</fact1>). Therefore, Sakura can eat 125 oz of cookies.

The difference in the amount of cookies they can consume is 125 oz (Theo) - 125 oz (Sakura) = 0 oz.


Thus, from the available bag of cookies, Theo can consume exactly the same amount as Sakura can, so Theo needs to consume 0 more oz of cookies than Sakura. The answer is {0}.

33,pro,"**Reformatted Question:** Mei and Haruka are sisters from Singapore who love collecting signatures from politicians. During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, <fact2>Mei has 24 signatures</fact2> in her book, and <fact3>Haruka has 51</fact3>. The sisters have <fact4>3 more weeks</fact4> of summer break, and they decide they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures between them</fact5> by the end of the break. However, during the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>, Mei is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by <fact6>5 per week</fact6>, while Haruka decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Haruka need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?

**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Mei's current collection rate.  She collected <fact2>24 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>5 weeks</fact1>, so her current rate is 24 / <fact1>5</fact1> = 4.8 signatures per week.

Next, we calculate Mei's reduced collection rate.  Due to only collecting signatures on weekends, her rate decreases by <fact6>5 signatures per week</fact6>, so her new rate will be 4.8 - <fact6>5</fact6> = -0.2 signatures per week.  Since she can't collect negative signatures, we assume she collects 0 signatures during these weeks.

Now, let's determine how many signatures Mei will collect in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.  At her reduced collection rate, she collects 0 signatures/week * <fact4>3 weeks</fact4> = 0 signatures. 

We know they want to reach <fact5>135 signatures</fact5> total. They currently have <fact2>24</fact2> (Mei) + <fact3>51</fact3> (Haruka) = 75 signatures. So, they need <fact5>135</fact5> - 75 = 60 more signatures.

Since Mei will collect 0 additional signatures, Haruka needs to collect all the remaining 60 signatures in the remaining <fact4>3 weeks</fact4>.  Therefore, Haruka needs to collect 60 / <fact4>3</fact4> = 20 signatures per week.

However, during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>, Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, <fact6>reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week</fact6>, while Zahra decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal?


**Answer:**

First, we need to figure out Uma's average weekly signature collection rate during the first <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>. She collected <fact2>29 signatures</fact2> over <fact1>6 weeks</fact1>, meaning she collected 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week.

Next, we determine how many signatures Uma will collect during the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Due to her reduced collection ability, she will collect 4.83 - <fact6>5</fact6> = -0.17 signatures per week.  Since she can't collect negative signatures, we can assume she collects 0 signatures in the last <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. Her total collected will remain at <fact2>29</fact2>.

Now we calculate how many signatures Zahra needs to collect in total.  Together they want <fact5>130</fact5> signatures, and Uma will have <fact2>29</fact2>, so Zahra needs to collect 130 - 29 = 101 signatures in total.

Finally, we figure out Zahra's required weekly collection rate.  She already has <fact3>37</fact3> signatures, so she needs to collect an additional 101 - 37 = 64 signatures over the remaining <fact4>4 weeks</fact4>. This means she needs to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

Ava recently bought <fact7>a tube of bouncy balls</fact7>, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to <fact8>350</fact8>. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>44 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>7 stuffed animals</fact2> = 51 items. 
Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is <fact3>twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined</fact3>. So, there are 2 * 51 = 102 action figures.
Next, we find the total number of crayons, which is <fact4>12 different colors of crayon</fact4> = 12 crayons.
We also find the total number of stickers, which is <fact5>7 pages, each with 13 stickers</fact5> = 7 * 13 = 91 stickers.

What is the least amount Sanjay can spend on everything?

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the markers is <fact1>8 markers</fact1> * $7.75 = $62. The total cost of the folders is <fact2>12 folders</fact2> * $13 = $156. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>$14</fact3>. The total cost of the pencils is <fact4>8 pencils</fact4> * $11 = $88. So, the total cost without any discount is $62 + $156 + $14 + $88 = $320.

If Sanjay becomes a member, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>, but he will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time $20 fee</fact5>. The total discount will be 20% of $320, which is 0.2 * $320 = $64. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $320 - $64 + $20 = $276.

If Sanjay does not become a member, he will get <fact6>only a 5% discount</fact6>. The total discount will be 5% of $320, which is 0.05 * $320 = $16. So, the total cost without the membership discount is $320 - $16 = $304.

Since $276 is less than $304, the least amount Sanjay can spend on everything is $276.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items James bought. The cost of the notebooks is <fact1>6 notebooks</fact1> * ¥7.0 = ¥42. The cost of the pencils is <fact2>14 pencils</fact2> * ¥10.0 = ¥140. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>¥24</fact3>. The cost of the markers is <fact4>6 markers</fact4> * ¥9 = ¥54.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the markers is <fact1>24</fact1> * €<fact1>4.0</fact1> = €96. The cost of the rulers is <fact2>4</fact2> * €<fact2>13.5</fact2> = €54. The cost of the ream of bond paper is €<fact3>13</fact3>. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact4>7</fact4> * €<fact4>11</fact4> = €77. So, the total cost without any discount is €96 + €54 + €13 + €77 = €240.

Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €240, which is €240 * 0.05 = €12. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €240 - €12 = €228.

Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time €20 fee. The discount amount is 20% of €240, which is €240 * 0.20 = €48. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €240 - €48 = €192. Adding the one-time €20 fee, the total cost is €192 + €20 = €212.

Comparing the two options, the least amount Ali can spend on everything is €212, which is the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time €20 fee.

The total cost of crayons is <fact4>5 crayons</fact4> * €8 = €40. So, the total cost without any discount is €45 + €114 + €21 + €40 = €220.

If Diego becomes a member and pays the <fact5>one-time €20 fee</fact5>, he will get a <fact5>20% discount on all purchases</fact5>. The total discount will be €220 * 0.20 = €44.

6,405B,"Reformatted Question: Luis has <fact1>60 square meters of grape field</fact1>. There are <fact2>16 grapes per five-sixths of a square meter</fact2>. Luis can harvest his grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3>. In addition, Luis owns a <fact4>9-square meter apricot field</fact4> that produces <fact5>13 apricots per square meter</fact5>. The apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more grapes does Luis harvest than apricots?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years. Since Luis can harvest his grapes every <fact3>12 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The number of grapes per square meter is <fact2>16 grapes per five-sixths of a square meter</fact2>, so the number of grapes per square meter is 16 / (5/6) = 16 * 6 / 5 = 96 / 5 = 19.2 grapes per square meter. Therefore, the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years is 2 * <fact1>60 square meters of grape field</fact1> * 19.2 grapes per square meter = 2 * 60 * 19.2 = 2304 grapes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years. Since the apricots can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Luis can harvest 6 times in <fact7>two years</fact7>. The total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years is 6 * <fact4>9-square meter apricot field</fact4> * <fact5>13 apricots per square meter</fact5> = 6 * 9 * 13 = 702 apricots.

Finally, we subtract the total number of apricots from the total number of grapes to find the difference. The difference is 2304 - 702 = 1602.

Mia recently bought <fact7>a tube of bouncy balls</fact7>, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to <fact8>320</fact8>. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?

Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is <fact1>42 blocks</fact1> + <fact2>8 stuffed animals</fact2> = 50 items. 
Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is <fact3>twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined</fact3>. So, there are 2 * 50 = 100 action figures.
Next, we find the total number of crayons in the crayon box, which is <fact4>12 different colors of crayon</fact4>.

Now, we add up the total number of items Mia had before buying the bouncy balls: 42 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 100 action figures + 12 crayons + 66 stickers + 25 rings = 253 items.
Since Mia now has a total of <fact8>320 items</fact8>, the number of bouncy balls she bought is 320 - 253 = 67.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since a <fact2>quarter of the balls are tennis balls</fact2>, the number of tennis balls is <fact1>320</fact1> / 4 = 80. The rest are golf balls, so there are <fact1>320</fact1> - 80 = 240 golf balls.

Next, we need to find out how many marked tennis balls there are. A <fact3>fifth of the tennis balls are pink</fact3>, so there are 80 / 5 = 16 pink tennis balls. Of these, <fact4>1/8 are marked</fact4>, so there are 16 / 8 = 2 marked tennis balls.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the rulers is <fact1>10 rulers</fact1> * ₺9.0 = ₺90. The cost of the colored pencils is <fact2>6 colored pencils</fact2> * ₺14.0 = ₺84. The cost of the ream of bond paper is <fact3>₺18</fact3>. The cost of the crayons is <fact4>8 crayons</fact4> * ₺11 = ₺88. The total cost is ₺90 + ₺84 + ₺18 + ₺88 = ₺280.

If Yusuf becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay <fact5>a one-time ₺20 fee</fact5>. The discount amount will be 20% of ₺280, which is 0.20 * ₺280 = ₺56. The total cost after the discount will be ₺280 - ₺56 = ₺224. Adding the one-time fee, the total cost will be ₺224 + ₺20 = ₺244.

If your total bill is more than <fact6>₺15</fact6>, you get a <fact7>10% discount on your total bill</fact7>. How much would a <fact8>65-minute call</fact8> cost?

Answer: The call can be divided into three parts: the first <fact2>5 minutes</fact2>, the next <fact4>25</fact4> - <fact2>5</fact2> = 20 minutes, and the remaining <fact8>65</fact8> - <fact4>25</fact4> = 40 minutes. 
For the first <fact2>5 minutes</fact2>, the cost is <fact1>₺0.8 per minute</fact1> * <fact2>5 minutes</fact2> = ₺4.
For the next 20 minutes, the cost is <fact3>₺0.6 per minute</fact3> * 20 minutes = ₺12.
For the remaining 40 minutes, the cost is <fact5>₺0.2 per two minutes</fact5> * (40 minutes / 2) = ₺4.
The total cost is ₺4 + ₺12 + ₺4 = ₺20.
Since the total bill is more than <fact6>₺15</fact6>, a <fact7>10% discount</fact7> is applied, making the final cost ₺20 - (₺20 * 0.1) = ₺18.

32,405B,"Reformatted Question: Mrs. Smith is looking for a new house that will not go beyond her <fact1>$490000 budget</fact1>. She saw a property that has a <fact2>selling price of $590000</fact2>. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $590000</fact2>, which is 0.2 x <fact2>$590000</fact2> = $118000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$590000</fact2> - $118000 = $472000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 x <fact2>$590000</fact2> = $17700. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 x <fact2>$590000</fact2> = $70800.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $472000 + $17700 + $70800 = $560500.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$490000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $560500 - <fact1>$490000</fact1> = $70500.

She also uses <fact2>10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, and uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>. She used a total of <fact4>210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk</fact4>. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use?

Answer: Let's assume that Elena used x sets of the ratio of <fact1>44:11</fact1> for teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Then, she used 44x teaspoons of sugar and 11x cups of water. Since she uses <fact2>10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water</fact2>, she used 11x * (10/10) = 11x tablespoons of milk. Since she uses <fact3>2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar</fact3>, she used 44x * 2 = 88x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is <fact4>210</fact4>. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 44x + 11x + 88x + 11x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 154x = 210. Dividing both sides by 154, we get x = 1.36 (round down to 1 since we can't have a fraction of a set). Since x represents the number of sets of the ratio, we multiply x by 44 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used: 1 * 44 = 44.

Due to the pandemic, <fact4>45 patients are admitted into the care facility each day</fact4>. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after <fact5>2 weeks</fact5>.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms. Since <fact2>1/3 of the rooms are occupied</fact2>, the number of occupied rooms is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact2>1/3</fact2> = 633.33, which we will round down to 633 rooms.

Next, we need to find the number of rooms that are out of service. Since <fact3>one-sixth of all the rooms are out of service</fact3>, the number of rooms out of service is <fact1>1900</fact1> * <fact3>1/6</fact3> = 316.67, which we will round down to 316 rooms.

Now, we can find the initial number of unoccupied rooms. This is <fact1>1900</fact1> - 633 - 316 = 951 rooms.

Since <fact4>45 patients are admitted each day</fact4>, the total number of patients admitted in <fact5>2 weeks</fact5> is <fact4>45</fact4> * <fact5>14</fact5> = 630 patients.

If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $450000</fact2>, which is 0.2 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $90000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$450000</fact2> - $90000 = $360000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $13500. The <fact4>transfer fee is 14% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.14 * <fact2>$450000</fact2> = $63000.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the discounted selling price plus the brokerage fee and transfer fee, which is $360000 + $13500 + $63000 = $436500.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's budget. The difference is $436500 - <fact1>$390000</fact1> = $46500.

How many marked balls are there in total?

Answer: First, we need to find the number of golf balls and tennis balls. The number of golf balls is <fact1>480</fact1> * <fact2>1/8</fact2> = 60. The number of tennis balls is <fact1>480</fact1> - 60 = 420, which is also <fact3>the rest</fact3> of the balls.
Next, we need to find the number of marked golf balls and marked tennis balls. The number of orange golf balls is 60 * <fact4>1/3</fact4> = 20. The number of marked golf balls is 20 * <fact5>1/5</fact5> = 4.
The number of cyan tennis balls is 420 * <fact6>1/9</fact6> = 46.67, which we will round down to 46 since we can't have a fraction of a ball. The number of marked tennis balls is 46 * <fact7>9/10</fact7> = 41.4, which we will also round down to 41.

Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Jasmine had before receiving the new plants.

The plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>. In the span of <fact7>two years</fact7>, how many more apples does Xavier harvest than plums?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apples harvested in two years. Since there are <fact2>13 apples per four-fifths of a square meter</fact2>, we can calculate the number of apples per square meter as 13 / (4/5) = 16.25 apples per square meter. With <fact1>65 square meters of apple field</fact1>, the total number of apples harvested in one round is 65 * 16.25 = 1056.25 apples. Since Xavier can harvest his apples every <fact3>6 months</fact3>, he can harvest twice in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 4 times. So, the total number of apples harvested in two years is 1056.25 * 4 = 4225 apples.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With <fact4>11-square meter plum field</fact4> and <fact5>13 plums per square meter</fact5>, the total number of plums harvested in one round is 11 * 13 = 143 plums. Since the plums can be harvested every <fact6>4 months</fact6>, Xavier can harvest 3 times in a year, and in <fact7>two years</fact7>, he can harvest 6 times. So, the total number of plums harvested in two years is 143 * 6 = 858 plums.

Luis has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a <fact6>quarter of the remaining cost of the conference</fact6>. How much money is Luis still missing?

Answer: The total cost of the <fact1>2-day conference</fact1> is (<fact2>¥150</fact2> + <fact3>¥20</fact3> + <fact4>¥20</fact4>) * 2 = ¥380. Since Luis' friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the conference</fact3>, which is <fact3>¥20</fact3> * 2 = ¥40, Luis only needs to pay ¥380 - ¥40 = ¥340. Luis has <fact5>¥10</fact5>, so he still needs ¥340 - ¥10 = ¥330. The youth club will cover a <fact6>quarter of the remaining cost of the conference</fact6>, which is ¥330 / 4 = ¥82.50. Therefore, Luis still needs ¥330 - ¥82.50 = ¥247.50.

Dr. Johnson used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks <fact6>gained 10% each year for two years</fact6>. How much were Dr. Johnson's net proceeds after two years?

Answer: Dr. Johnson paid <fact2>1% of the selling price</fact2> in legal fees, which is <fact2>0.01</fact2> * <fact1>$780000</fact1> = $7800. He also paid <fact3>4% of the selling price</fact3> in realtor fees, which is <fact3>0.04</fact3> * <fact1>$780000</fact1> = $31200. Adding these fees to the <fact4>$490000 remaining loan amount</fact4> and the <fact5>$10000 closing costs</fact5>, Dr. Johnson paid a total of $7800 + $31200 + $490000 + $10000 = $538000.

Answer: First, we need to find the number of questions for each subject. The number of physics questions is <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact2>0.25</fact2> = 20. The number of biology questions is <fact1>80</fact1> * <fact3>0.10</fact3> = 8. The number of algebra and geometry questions is <fact1>80</fact1> - 20 - 8 = 52, and since they are equally divided, there are 52/2 = 26 questions for each subject.

Now, let's calculate the number of correct answers for each subject. For biology, Kayla will get <fact4>25% of 8 questions</fact4> correct, which is 0.25 * 8 = 2. For physics, Kayla will get <fact5>65% of 20 questions</fact5> correct, which is 0.65 * 20 = 13. For algebra and geometry, Kayla will get <fact6>a quarter of 26 questions</fact6> correct for each subject, which is 0.25 * 26 = 6.5 for each subject. Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we'll round down to 6 correct answers for each subject.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give <fact4>3 potted plants from each ledge</fact4> to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Gabrielle remain with?

Answer: Gabrielle originally had <fact2>10 potted plants on each of the 56 window ledges</fact2>, so she had <fact2>10</fact2> * 56 = 560 potted plants. She received <fact1>28 new potted plants</fact1> and purchased <fact3>90 new plants</fact3> at a 50% discount, which means she purchased 90 * 0.5 = 45 plants.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a <fact3>brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, and also the <fact4>transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price</fact4>. If Mrs. Smith can get a <fact5>20% discount on the selling price</fact5>, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget?

Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is <fact5>20%</fact5> of the <fact2>selling price of $580000</fact2>, which is 0.2 * <fact2>$580000</fact2> = $116000. So, the discounted selling price is <fact2>$580000</fact2> - $116000 = $464000.

Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The <fact3>brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price</fact3>, which is 0.03 * <fact2>$580000</fact2> = $17400. The <fact4>transfer fee is 12% of the selling price</fact4>, which is 0.12 * <fact2>$580000</fact2> = $69600.

However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees.

The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $464000 + $17400 + $69600 = $550000.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's <fact1>$400000 budget</fact1>. The difference is $550000 - <fact1>$400000</fact1> = $150000.

On the sidewalk, Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Nia's speed has <fact5>decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk</fact5>. If <fact6>60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach</fact6>, how long does it take for her to complete the entire <fact1>24-kilometer walk</fact1>, in minutes?

Answer: First, we need to find Nia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> in <fact6>60 minutes</fact6>, so her speed on the beach is <fact2>10 kilometers</fact2> / <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> = 1/6 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute.

We also know that Nia walks at <fact4>four times the rate of speed</fact4> on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. 

Since her speed has <fact5>decreased by half</fact5>, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute.

Now, we can find the time it takes for Nia to walk <fact3>14 kilometers on the sidewalk</fact3>. Time = distance / speed = <fact3>14 kilometers</fact3> / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 42 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes for Nia to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time. Total time = <fact6>60 minutes</fact6> + 42 minutes = 102 minutes.

Answer: The total cost of the science fair is (<fact2>$150</fact2> + <fact3>$40</fact3> + <fact4>$30</fact4>) * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = $440. Since Diego's friends will cover the cost of all the <fact3>food for the science fair</fact3>, which is <fact3>$40</fact3> * <fact1>2 days</fact1> = $80, Diego only needs to cover $440 - $80 = $360.

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia.

Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina. The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.

This backfired when the Redskins running back Quinton Ganther recovered the kick and returned it 25 yards to the Eagles 24-yard line. Four plays later, Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell ran for a two-yard touchdown to score the game's first touchdown, as the Redskins took the lead 7-0. After a holding penalty on Eagles tight end Brent Celek, the Eagles had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker David Akers. On the following drive by the Eagles, quarterback Donovan McNabb found wide receiver DeSean Jackson wide open in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown to bring the Eagles up 10-7. On the ensuing drive by the Redskins, Campbell threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss to take the lead 14-10. Late in the second quarter, after both teams punting the ball away after three unsuccessful drives, Eagles cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a Jason Campbell pass that was intended for Santana Moss. The Eagles could not convert a third down with 10 to go, and David Akers kicked a 24-yard field goal to get the Eagles within a point of the Redskins, 14-13. The Redskins received the ball again and Campbell threw a second straight interception to Samuel, who returned it for 17 yards. The Eagles ended the first half with a second straight field goal to take the lead 16-14. The Eagles got the ball to start the second half, but the drive ended with a Sav Rocca punt.

For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917. In Poland, which Russia partitioned in the late 18th century, and where Russian rule already caused two major uprisings, the population was so restless that an army of 250,000-300,000—larger than the one facing the Japanese—had to be stationed to put down the unrest. Some political leaders of the Polish insurrection movement sent emissaries to Japan to collaborate on sabotage and intelligence gathering within the Russian Empire and even plan a Japanese-aided uprising. In Russia, the defeat of 1905 led in the short term to a reform of the Russian military that allowed it to face Germany in World War I. However, the revolts at home following the war planted seeds that presaged the Russian Revolution of 1917. This was because Tsar Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto, which included only limited reforms such as the Duma and failed to address the societal problems of Russia at the time. How many revolutions did Russia suffer in the early 20th century? Answer: According to the passage, there were the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the February Revolution of 1917, which is also referred to as the Russian Revolution of 1917.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich. The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered. About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side. That led to the collapse of the uprising against Austria. How many regions did the popular uprising start in?

Back in Valladolid, Charles declared a general pardon on November 1. The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of 293 comuneros, a small figure given the huge number of rebels. Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the 293 excluded from the pardon. More pardons were issued later, after pressure from the Cortes; by 1527, the repression was completely at end.

Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza.

The next year brought ""replacement notes"" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or ""bayong"" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos. Inflation plagued the country with the devaluation of the Japanese money, evidenced by a 60% inflation experienced in January 1944. How many pesos was the Mickey Mouse money created by the Japanese worth? Answer: According to the passage, the value of the Mickey Mouse money varied. Initially, the Japanese issued notes worth 1, 5, and 10 Pesos, then later issued notes worth 100 Pesos, 500 Pesos, and 1,000 Pesos. However, due to severe inflation, the value of the Mickey Mouse money decreased significantly, with a box of matches costing more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos in 1944 and a kilogram of camote costing around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos in 1945.

However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble.

After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich. The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered. About two weeks later, on 8 January 1706, the Battle of Aidenbach ended with the utter defeat of the insurgents and about 4,000 casualties on the Bavarian side. That led to the collapse of the uprising against Austria. what is the difference in casualty numbers between Bavarian and Austrian? Answer: According to the passage, the Bavarian side lost 1,100 men and 4,000 casualties in another battle, for a total of 1,100 + 4,000 = 5,100 casualties. The Austrians lost 40 men.

In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917 , the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917 , the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror was started in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life. The Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904.

""Polish-Soviet War"" is the most common but other names include ""Russo-Polish War of 1919-1921"" and ""Polish-Bolshevik War"". This second term is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it is also referred as the ""War of 1920"". There is disagreement over the dates of the war. The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its article with the date range 1919-1920 but then states, ""Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state Józef Piłsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May."" The Polish Internetowa encyklopedia PWN, as well as Western historians such as Norman Davies, consider 1919 the starting year of the war. The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the ceasefire was put in force in the autumn of 1920, the official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier. In the end, the events of 1920 were a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude. How many years did the Polish-Soviet War last? Answer: Several sources give different dates for the war. One source gives the dates as 1919-1921, which is two years. Encyclopædia Britannica gives 1919-1920, which is one year. Other sources consider 1919 as the starting year and 1921 as the ending year (due to the treaty being signed in March of 1921), which is also two years.

In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković. In the final peace treaty, Venice did relinquish the areas of Popovo polje as well as Klek and Sutorina, to maintain the pre-existing demarcation near Ragusa. How many years were there between the siege of Herceg Novi and Venice taking Vrgorac? Answer: The passage states that the siege of Herceg Novi started on 1 September 1687. It also states that Venice took Vrgorac on 26 November 1690. From September 1687 to September 1690 is three years.

In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history. The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region. By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops. The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, on 4 June, Rome was captured. The Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against British positions in Assam, India, and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima. In May 1944, British forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma, and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.

The lands adjoining towns and strongholds were captured by the rebels and the peasant uprising spread to the Bavarian Forest, parts of the Upper Palatinate and Kelheim on the Danube. A Braunau Parliament meeting was held in December 1705 in the then-Bavarian Braunau. Long before the French Revolution and early German parliamentarianism the meeting was held on 21 December 1705 in an inn belonging to the Baron von Paumgarten; representatives met of the four estates in Bavaria: aristocracy, clergy, burghers and peasants. The Braunau Parliament is the name of the congress on the defence of the state of Bavaria held at Braunau am Inn convened on 21 December 1705. Following the initial uprising in November 1705, there was little response from the Austrians for nearly two months. However, that changed following an attempt by the rebels to capture the Bavarian capital, Munich. Following their unsuccessful attack, the night of 25 December 1705 saw an Austrian column encounter the peasant army near Sendling outside of Munich. The battle was known as Sendling's Night of Murder or the Sendling Christmas Day Massacre. The insurgents from the Bavarian Oberland were defeated and completely routed by Emperor Joseph I's troops. The number of deaths on the Bavarian side in this battle is estimated at around 1,100 men, but the Austrians lost only about 40. Some of the insurgents were killed after they had already surrendered.

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania. Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918. Under the treaty, Romania was obliged to end the war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the Carpathian Mountains, and to grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over Bessarabia. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the Alexandru Marghiloman government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918.

The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. In the Veracruz port, another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida, Yucatan. They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas. Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas. The town of Motul, Yucatan, located in the heart of the henequen zone, was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants. Subsequently, in 1909, at the end of their contracts, they began a new stage in which they scattered even further Thus, the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women. While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents, males had greater freedom when it came to making a family. This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula. After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded, until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905. These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigración Coreana a Yucatán, a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey. How many Korean immigrants were more men than woman and children? Answer: According to the passage, 802 men and 201 women and children were among the 1,003 Korean immigrants. To find the difference between the number of men and women and children, subtract the number of women and children from the number of men: 802 - 201 = 601.

The Soviet 11th Red Army's invasion of the First Republic of Armenia started on the 29th of November 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan, when the Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia agreed to join the Soviet sphere, while Soviet Russia agreed to protect its remaining territory from the advancing Turkish army. The Soviets also pledged to take steps to rebuild the army, to protect the Armenians and not to persecute non-communists, although the final condition of this pledge was reneged when the Dashnaks were forced out of the country. The Soviet Government proposed the annexation of the Nagorno-Karabagh and Syunik regions of Armenia to Soviet Azerbaijan. This step was strongly rejected by Garegin Nzhdeh, who declared Syunik as a self-governing region on December 25, 1920. In January 1921 Drastamat Kanayan sent a telegram to Njdeh, suggesting allowing the sovietisation of Syunik, through which they could gain the support of the Bolshevik government in solving the problems of the Armenian lands. Njdeh again proved himself as a long-sighted politician, he did not depart from Syunik and continued his struggle against the Red Army and Soviet Azerbaijan.

After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their ""Wildcat"" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the ""Wildcat"" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone.

Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line.

At the time, the Habsburg King Ferdinand I of Bohemia immediately rejected the agreement; nevertheless, in 1675 the ""Great Elector"" Frederick William of Brandenburg laid claim to the Silesian principalities when, with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, the Piast line ended. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg also inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach. After the Bohemian Revolt and the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, however, the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the possessions of the Protestant Hohenzollerns in his Bohemian lands in 1621 after winning the Battle of White Mountain. The Electors of Brandenburg continued, nevertheless, to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. Brandenburg, however, was unable to enforce these dynastic territorial claims. In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor Leopold I gave Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. However, after the accession of the Elector's son and successor, Frederick III of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, asserting that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Frederick William for life. Furious, Frederick III in turn reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.

The 49ers had the NFLs highest scoring offense with 473 points, 97 more than the runner-up Cowboys. The last time the two teams played for the NFC title, Dallas won when Aikman thwarted an attempted 49ers comeback with a touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter. But this time, the game was extremely one-sided. The Cowboys scored touchdowns on four of their five first-half possessions. Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 25 yards, but was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter. Then San Francisco scored a touchdown, making the score 28-14 with plenty of time left for a comeback. However, their hopes were soon dashed as backup quarterback Bernie Kosar, who had already played in three conference championship games and was unable to advance to the Super Bowl each time, led the Cowboys 82 yards to go up 35-14 on his 42-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper. Murray then put the finishing touches on San Francisco with a 50-yard field goal, while all the 49ers could do was score a useless touchdown in ""garbage time"" to make the final score 38-21. Smith rushed for 88 yards, caught seven passes for 85 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Meanwhile, the Dallas defense held 49ers running back Ricky Watters, who rushed for over 100 yards and scored 5 touchdowns in the divisional round, to just 37 yards on 12 carries. How many passes did Aikman not complete in the first half? Answer: The passage states that in the first half, Aikman completed 14 of 18 passes.

In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and oidor José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed oidor Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas.

The Polish problems were further aggravated by the incompetent leadership of hetman Michał Kazimierz Pac, who obstructed Sobieski's leadership, while the Ottomans continued to receive reinforcements. Nonetheless in 1674 the Commonwealth resumed the offensive, taking advantage of a new Muscovy-Ottoman conflict that year, and the Polish-Ottoman war remained undecided.:275 Sobieski's force of 6,000 defeated 20,000 Turks and Tatars under Ibrahim Shyshman in the battle of Lwow in August 1675.:653 Even after the Battle of Trembowla, the Sejm still refused his pleas for more funds and a larger army.:653 In 1676, after Sobieski's 16,000 withstood the two-week siege of Żurawno, by 100,000 men under Ibrahim Pasha, a new peace treaty was signed, the Treaty of Żurawno.:655 The peace treaty partially reversing those from Buczacz: the Ottomans kept approximately two thirds of the territories they gained in 1672, and the Commonwealth no longer was obliged to pay any kind of tribute to the Empire; a large number of Polish prisoners were released by the Ottomans. How many more forces were under the Turks than in Sobieski's forces? Answer: The passage states that in the battle of Lwow in 1675, Sobieski had a force of 6,000, while the Turks and Tatars numbered 20,000. 20,000 - 6,000 = 14,000. Therefore, there were 14,000 more Turkish and Tatar forces than in Sobieski's force. However, the passage also mentions the siege of Żurawno in 1676 where Sobieski's 16,000 men withstood a siege by 100,000 men under Ibrahim Pasha. In this case, 100,000 - 16,000 = 84,000.

In October 1599, just as Toungoo and Arakanese were laying siege on Pegu, Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo. After Pegu fell, Nyaungyan declared himself king on 25 February 1600. Nyaungyan then systematically reacquired nearer Shan states. He captured Nyaungshwe in February 1601, and the large strategic Shan state of Mone in July 1603, bringing his realm to the border of Siamese Lan Na. In response, Naresuan of Siam marched in early 1605 to attack Mone but died at the border in April after which Siam ceased to be a military concern to Burma. In early 1606, his 7,000-strong forces took Theinni, Thibaw and Momeik but the king died during the campaign on 3 March 1606. How many months after Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo in October 1599 did he declare himself king on 25 February 1600? Answer: Nyaungyan sent a force to reclaim Mohnyin, Mogaung, and Bhamo in October 1599. He declared himself king on February 25, 1600. From October 1599 to February 1600 there are: October (31 days), November (30 days), December (31 days), and January (31 days), plus 25 days in February. This totals 148 days. Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, 148 days is approximately 148/30 = 4.9 months. Therefore, he declared himself king approximately 5 months after sending the force.",4,False,history_1002_e9ae0bd8-9a5d-4809-8ce8-ace215b971c2,False,DROP,197

However, he could not enforce the Habsburg succession to the Hungarian throne and in 1491 his son King Maximilian I signed the Peace of Pressburg with Vladislaus Jagiellon, who was elected Matthias' successor in Hungary. The treaty arranged for the return of Matthias' conquests, and the agreement that Maximilian would succeed Vladislaus should he produce no heir. This did not happen as Vladislaus' son Louis II was born in 1506, but the Habsburgs did exert significant pressure on the Jagiellonians with the 1515 First Congress of Vienna in which they arranged two royal weddings of Vladislaus' daughter Anne with Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand and of Maximilian's granddaughter Mary with Louis II. The double wedding celebrated at St. Stephen's Cathedral decisively advanced the Habsburg succession agenda. During his reign in Hungary, the new Polish king would go on to undo many of Matthias' efforts, unmaking the reformed system of taxation, the standing army, and the centralized authority of the monarch. Hungary's nobles would act in complicity with this, contributing to the weakening of the country until 1526, when Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács, whereby King Louis II was killed. The Habsburg archduke Ferdinand of Austria by his marriage with Anne of Bohemia and Hungary claimed the succession, he was enfoffed with the Bohemian kingdom by his elder brother Emperor Charles V and also reached the consent of the Hungarian magnates.

Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases. An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan, which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco. When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10,000. In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4,000. In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast, so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities. In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute-paying inhabitants of Tixchel, which probably had a total population of about 1,100. This indicates a 90% drop in population over a 36-year span. Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest, while others had succumbed to disease, malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción. Coastal reducciones, while convenient for Spanish administration, were vulnerable to pirate attacks; in the case of Tixchel, pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. How many more people lived in Acalan in in 1525 compared to 1553?

In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. Of these mandatory candidates, only one Bolshevik and seven Socialist Revolutionary delegates were women. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets. On 16 December 1917, the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated. On 20 December 1917, the Cheka was created by the decree of Vladimir Lenin. These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The Red Terror was started in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin's life. The Jacobin Terror was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. Leon Trotsky had compared Lenin to Maximilien Robespierre as early as 1904.

Ninety-five percent of Thai production is consumed locally. Almost 85 percent of palm plantations and extraction mills are in south Thailand. At year-end 2016, 4.7 to 5.8 million Rai (unit) were planted in oil palms, employing 300,000 farmers, mostly on small landholdings of 20 rai. ASEAN as a region accounts for 52.5 million tonnes of palm oil production, about 85 percent of the world total and more than 90 percent of global exports. Indonesia accounts for 52.2 percent of world exports. Malaysian exports total 37.9 percent. The biggest consumers of palm oil are India, the European Union, and China, with the three consuming nearly 50 percent of world exports. Thailands Department of Internal Trade (DIT) usually sets the price of crude palm oil and refined palm oil. Thai farmers have a relatively low yield compared to those in Malaysia and Indonesia. Thai palm oil crops yield 4-17 percent oil compared to around 20 percent in competing countries. In addition, Indonesian and Malaysian oil palm plantations are 10 times the size of Thai plantations. What percent of crude palm oil produced in Thailand is not consumed locally? Answer: According to the passage, Ninety-five percent of Thai production is consumed locally, and 1.2 percent of global output is produced in Thailand. To find the percentage of crude palm oil produced in Thailand that is not consumed locally, we need to subtract the percentage consumed locally from the global output percentage. However, since the global output percentage is given as a percentage of global output, we need to assume that the global output is 100% to find the actual amount produced in Thailand. If we assume the global output is 100%, then 1.2% of it is produced in Thailand. Ninety-five percent of 1.2% is consumed locally, which is 0.95 * 1.2 = 1.14%. Since the total is 100%, the percentage that is not consumed locally is 100% - 1.14% = 98.86%.",5,False,history_1876_a0e4aa81-3902-487b-a6c1-7f406a15aa27,False,DROP,233

Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked).

The average household size was 2.59 and the average family size was 3.13. How many percent of households as of 2000 were not married couples living together? Answer: According to the passage, 44.0% of households were married couples living together. Since the total percentage of households cannot exceed 100%, the percentage of households that are not married couples living together can be found by subtracting 44.0% from 100%. However, we must note that the passage also mentions 11.6% had a female householder with no husband present and 39.9% were non-families.

The first step is to subtract 44.0% from 100%. 100% - 44.0% = 56.0%. The second step is to subtract 56.0% from 100%. 100% - 56.0% = 44.0%. However, we must note that the passage also mentions 23.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 3.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. These percentages are already included in the percentage of households that are not married couples living together. Therefore, we can find the percentage of households that are not married couples living together by subtracting 44.0% from 100% and then subtracting 23.2% and 3.8% from the result.

history_2234_a2ea2d15-157c-495e-8078-7634045e0643,8b,"Reformatted Question: In 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the ""Lenin Levy"", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to ""proletarianize"" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed ""social-alien elements"" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members approximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly. How many members did the party lose 1933 to 1939? Answer: According to the passage, the party membership in 1933 was approximately 3.5 million members and in 1939 it was 1.9 million members. To find the number of members lost, we need to subtract the 1939 membership from the 1933 membership. However, the passage does not explicitly state the membership in 1933, but it mentions that the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936 and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. This suggests that the membership in 1933 was not the actual number of members, but rather the number before the removal of unreliable members. Therefore, the actual number of members lost is the difference between the number of members in 1939 and the number of members before the removal of unreliable members in 1933, which is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, we can infer that the number of members lost is at least the difference between the number of members in 1933 and the number of members in 1939.",1600000,False,history_2234_a2ea2d15-157c-495e-8078-7634045e0643,False,DROP,248

On the sidewalk, Kimia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 29-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: Since 11 miles of walking on the beach is 44 minutes of her walk, the rate at which Kimia walks on the beach is 11 miles / 44 minutes = 11/44 miles per minute. Since Kimia walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach, the rate at which Kimia walks on the sidewalk is 2 * 11/44 = 22/44 miles per minute. The time it takes for Kimia to walk 18 miles on the sidewalk is 18 miles / 22/44 miles per minute = 18 * 44 / 22 = 36 minutes. The time it takes for Kimia to walk 11 miles on the beach is 11 miles / 11/44 miles per minute = 44 minutes.

39,8b,"Reformatted Question: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 160 rooms. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 15 minutes per room. If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms? Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes the maintenance worker spends cleaning rooms per day. Since it takes them 15 minutes per room and they have to clean 160 rooms, they will spend 160 * 15 = 2400 minutes cleaning rooms per day. Since they work 10 hours each day, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they work a total of 10 * 60 = 600 minutes per day. Therefore, they spend 2400 / 600 = 4 minutes out of every 10 minutes working on cleaning rooms. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, we can divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (2400 / 600) * 100 = 400%. However, this is not the correct answer. The question asks for the percentage of their day spent cleaning rooms, not the percentage of the total minutes spent cleaning rooms. To find the correct answer, we need to divide the number of minutes spent cleaning rooms by the total number of minutes worked per day, and then multiply by 100: (2400 / 600) * 100 = 400%. Then we need to convert the fraction of the day into a percentage. 400% is equivalent to 4/10, which is equivalent to 2/5. 2/5 is equivalent to 40%.

The remoras are 6 inches long each, so the combined length of the remoras is 6 * 6 = 36 inches. We need to convert the dolphin's body length from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the dolphin's body length is 60 feet * 12 inches per foot = 720 inches. The combined length of the remoras is 36 inches, and the dolphin's body length is 720 inches.

Answer: To find the number of students who are leaving early, we need to find the total number of students who are either swimmers, debate team members, or part of the choir. First, we need to find the number of students who are not swimmers. Since 40% of the class are swimmers, the number of students who are not swimmers is 100% - 40% = 60% of the class.

The number of students who are debate team members or part of the choir is 32% * 75 = 0.32 * 75 = 24 students. Since 40% of the class are swimmers, the number of students who are swimmers is 40% * 125 students = 0.4 * 125 = 50 students.

Since Yuki has 35 square meters of plum field and there are 78 plums per square meter, we can calculate the total number of plums as 35 * 78 = 2730 plums. Since Yuki can harvest his plums every 2 months, we need to find out how many 2-month periods are there in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so there are 12/2 = 6 periods of 2 months in a year. Therefore, Yuki can harvest 2730 plums / 6 periods = 455 plums per period. Since there are 6 periods in a year, Yuki can harvest a total of 455 * 6 = 2730 plums within a year. However, this is the number of plums Yuki can harvest per period, not the total number of plums he can harvest in a year.

If she used a total of 1455 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used. Answer: Let's use the ratio to set up an equation. Let s be the number of teaspoons of sugar and w be the number of cups of water. We know that 197 : 94 = s : w, so we can write 197w = 94s. We are also given that 1455 = s + w. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of s. Rearranging the second equation, we get w = 1455 - s. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 197(1455 - s) = 94s. Expanding and simplifying, we get 288,095 - 197s = 94s. Adding 197s to both sides, we get 288,095 = 291s. Dividing both sides by 291, we get s = 992.

Answer: The total price of the house includes the selling price of $370000, the brokerage fee which is 3% of $370000, and the transfer fee which is 14% of $370000. The brokerage fee is 3% * $370000 = $11100. The transfer fee is 14% * $370000 = $52000. So the total price of the house is $370000 + $11100 + $52000 = $533100. This is $533100 - $410000 = $123100 more than Mrs. Smith's budget. The answer is {123100}.",22900.0,False,1629,False,symbolic,27

If a 100 oz bag has 5 servings, how many oz can you eat if your daily calorie target is 1975 and you have already consumed 1525 calories? Answer: First, we need to find out how many calories are in the 100 oz bag of cookies. Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and each serving has 450 calories, the total number of calories in the bag is 5 * 450 = 2250 calories. Since you have already consumed 1525 calories, you still have a daily calorie target of 1975 - 1525 = 450 calories left. Now, we need to find out how many servings of cookies you can eat with the remaining calories. Since each serving has 450 calories, you can eat 450/450 = 1 serving. Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and you can eat 1 serving, the total number of oz you can eat is 5 * 100 oz / 5 = 100 oz. The answer is {100}.",20.0,False,1222,False,symbolic,29

How many pineapples can Leon harvest within a year? Answer: First, we need to find out how many pineapples are in Leon's field. Since there are 99 pineapples per square yard and Leon has 90 square yards of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples is 99 * 90 = 8910 pineapples. Since Leon can harvest his pineapples every 4 months, he can harvest a total of 4 / 12 = 1/3 of the pineapples per month. In one year, there are 12 months, so Leon can harvest 12 * (1/3) = 4 times a year. Therefore, Leon can harvest a total of 8910 * 4 = 35640 pineapples within a year.

6,8b,"Reformatted Question: Luis has 15 square yards of apricot field. There are 43 apricots per square yard. Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months. How many apricots can Luis harvest within a year? Answer: Since Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest them twice within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months. First, we need to find out how many apricots Luis has in total. Since he has 15 square yards of apricot field and there are 43 apricots per square yard, he has 15 * 43 = 645 apricots in total. Now, we need to find out how many apricots Luis can harvest in 6 months. Since he has 645 apricots in total and he can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest 645/2 = 322.5 apricots in 6 months. However, since he cannot harvest a fraction of an apricot, we can assume that he can harvest 322 apricots in 6 months. Now, we can find out how many apricots Luis can harvest within a year. Since Luis can harvest his apricots every 6 months, he can harvest 2 times the number of apricots he can harvest in 6 months within a year. Therefore, the total number of apricots he can harvest within a year is 2 * 322 = 644 apricots. The answer is {644}.",1290.0,False,337,False,symbolic,31

After Theo takes the skillet off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 14 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. How many pieces of popcorn does Theo have to eat? Answer: In the first 14 seconds, 80 kernels popped. In the next 14 seconds, 3 times that amount popped, so 3*80=240 kernels popped. In the next 14 seconds, the kernels increased to 6 times the initial popping rate, so 6*80=480 kernels popped.

How many like to play music if the number that like to dance is twice the number that prefer playing hurling? Answer: The total number of students who like to hike or play hurling is 7 + 34 = 41 students. Since the rest of the students like to either play music or dance, the number of students who like to play music or dance is 189 - 41 = 148 students. Let's assume the number of students who like to play hurling is x. Then, the number of students who like to dance is twice the number that prefer playing hurling, which is 2x. We know that the total number of students who like to dance or play music is 148. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 148. Combine like terms: 3x = 148. Divide both sides by 3: x = 49.33 (round down to 49 since we can't have a fraction of a student). Now that we know x, we can find the number of students who like to dance: 2x = 2(49) = 98 students.

Since corns are a rare treat, he only buys six 5-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys fourteen 6-pound bags. Oats are the main diet of his horses, so he buys thirty two 41-pound packs. Apples are a staple to supplement the oats, so he buys eighteen 18-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed? Answer: The total weight of the corns is six 5-pound boxes = 6 * 5 = 30 pounds. The total weight of the carrots is fourteen 6-pound bags = 14 * 6 = 84 pounds. The total weight of the oats is thirty two 41-pound packs = 32 * 41 = 1312 pounds. The total weight of the apples is eighteen 18-pound sacks = 18 * 18 = 324 pounds.

Answer: To calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 5, we note that there are 5 numbers greater than 5 on a d10 die (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 5 is 5/10 = 1/2 = 50%. To calculate the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row, we note that there are 5 odd numbers on a d10 die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 5/10 = 1/2. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%. The difference in probability is 50% - 25% = 25%. To express this as a percentage, we note that 25% is 25/25 = 1 times 25%, so it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 5 than to roll two odd numbers in a row.

If he also paid $480000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage, how much is Mr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the cottage? Answer: Mr. Jones paid 3% of $610000 = 0.03 * 610000 = $18300 for the transfer fees. He also paid 5% of $610000 = 0.05 * 610000 = $30500 for the brokerage fee. So, the total fees paid by Mr. Jones is $18300 + $30500 = $48800. He also paid $480000 for the remaining loan amount of the cottage. Thus, Mr. Jones's net proceeds from selling the cottage is $610000 - $48800 - $480000 = $610000 - $529800 = $80200. The answer is {80200}.",81200.0,False,1719,False,symbolic,76

Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 5 on a d20 die is 14/20, since there are 14 numbers greater than 5 on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (10/20) * (10/20) = 100/400 = 1/4, since there are 10 even numbers on a d20 die and 20 possible outcomes in total, and the rolls are independent. To find the difference in probability, we need to convert both probabilities to a common format. We can convert 14/20 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 14/20 = 0.7. We can convert 1/4 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 1/4 = 0.25. The difference in probability is 0.7 - 0.25 = 0.45. To express this as a percentage, we can multiply by 100: 0.45 * 100 = 45%. Therefore, it is 45% more likely that Jin rolls a number greater than 5 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two odd numbers in a row? Answer: There are 12 possible outcomes when rolling a twelve-sided die. Of these, 8 are numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 8/12 = 2/3. There are 6 odd numbers on a twelve-sided die (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11). So the probability of rolling an odd number is 6/12 = 1/2. The probability of rolling two odd numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4. The difference between these probabilities is 2/3 - 1/4 = 5/12.

During their spring break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 3 weeks, Ava and Quinn compare their autograph books, counting up the number of signatures each sister has collected. Ava has 30 signatures in her book, and Quinn has 37 signatures. The sisters have 2 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 135 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 2 weeks, Ava is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Quinn decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Quinn need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? Answer: Ava currently has 30 signatures, and Quinn has 37 signatures. Together, they have 30 + 37 = 67 signatures. Their goal is to reach 135 signatures by the end of spring break. This means they need to collect an additional 135 - 67 = 68 signatures in the remaining 2 weeks.

It takes 5 skeins of wool to make a vest, 4 for a cardigan, 10 for a shawl, 12 for a pair of gloves, and 9 for a pair of mittens. Sakura wants to make two warm jackets for herself, each needing 4 skeins of wool. Each dozen skeins of wool costs $9. The store has a promotion where customers receive a $20 discount on purchases over $100. How much should Sakura pay for all the skeins of wool she needs? Answer: First, let's calculate the total skeins of wool needed for each grandchild. For each grandchild, Sakura needs: * Vest: 5 skeins * Cardigan: 4 skeins * Shawl: 10 skeins * Gloves: 12 skeins * Mittens: 9 skeins Total per grandchild: 5 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 9 = 40 skeins Since she has 4 grandchildren, she needs 40 skeins/grandchild * 4 grandchildren = 160 skeins for her grandchildren. Next, let's calculate the wool needed for her jackets. She needs 4 skeins/jacket * 2 jackets = 8 skeins for herself. Therefore, the total number of skeins Sakura needs is 160 + 8 = 168 skeins. Now, let's calculate the cost. Since each dozen (12) skeins costs $9, the cost of 168 skeins is (168/12) * $9 = 14 * $9 = $126. Finally, let's apply the discount. Since the total cost ($126) is over $100, Sakura receives a $20 discount. So, the final amount Sakura should pay is $126 - $20 = $106. The answer is {106}.",106.0,True,138,False,symbolic,101

The cafe has a promotion that if one buys 6 muffins or more, they get a 10% discount on muffins. How much more do 2 loaves of sourdough cost than 8 muffins? Answer: The cost of one muffin is one-eighth the cost of a loaf of sourdough, which is $10 / 8 = $1.25. Since we are buying 8 muffins, and this is more than 6 muffins, we apply the 10% discount. The discount per muffin is $1.25 * 0.10 = $0.125. Therefore, the discounted price per muffin is $1.25 - $0.125 = $1.125. The cost of 8 muffins is 8 * $1.125 = $9. The cost of 2 loaves of sourdough is 2 * $10 = $20. The difference in cost is $20 - $9 = $11. Therefore, 2 loaves of sourdough cost $11 more than 8 muffins.

After a 5% discount, she paid a total of $1330. What was the cost of brownies per dozen? Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Nia bought 60 croissants, which is 60/12 = 5 dozen croissants. The cost of the croissants is 5 dozen * $19/dozen = $95. Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Nia bought 72 macarons, which is 72/12 = 6 dozen macarons. The cost of the macarons is 6 dozen * $20/dozen = $120. Before the discount, the total cost of the croissants and macarons was $95 + $120 = $215. Let's denote the cost of the 36 brownies as 'x'. So, before the discount, the total cost of all items was $215 + x. Nia received a 5% discount, meaning she paid 95% of the original price. Therefore, 0.95 * ($215 + x) = $1330. To solve for x, we first divide both sides by 0.95: $215 + x = $1330 / 0.95 = $1400 Subtracting $215 from both sides, we find the total cost of the brownies: x = $1400 - $215 = $1185. Finally, since Nia bought 36 brownies, this is 36/12 = 3 dozen brownies. Therefore, the cost of the brownies per dozen is $1185 / 3 = $395. The answer is {395}.",395.0,True,217,False,symbolic,103

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row, than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row? Answer: A d4 die has four sides, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. For rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row: There are three numbers greater than 1 (2, 3, and 4). The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4. To roll it twice in a row, the probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%. For rolling four odd numbers in a row: There are two odd numbers on a d4 die (1 and 3). The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2. To roll four odd numbers in a row, the probability is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. Expressed as a percentage, this is (1/16) * 100% = 6.25%. The difference in likelihood is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points. Therefore, it is 50 percentage points more likely that Gabriel rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row.

What percentage of the students like to play video games if the number of the students that like to play music is 7 less than two times the number that prefer playing volleyball? Answer: First, let's find the total number of students who enjoy dance, chess, swimming, and volleyball. This is 5 + 8 + 13 + 32 = 58 students. Next, we determine the number of students who like to play music. The question states that this number is 7 less than two times the number of students who prefer playing volleyball. Since 32 students like to play volleyball, the number of students who like music is (2 * 32) - 7 = 57 students. Now we can find the number of students who like to play video games. The total number of students is 230. Subtracting the students with other hobbies, we get 230 - 58 - 57 = 115 students who like video games. Finally, to find the percentage of students who like video games, we divide the number of students who like video games by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (115 / 230) * 100 = 50%.

How much younger is Leilani than the average age of all three? Answer: First, let's find Ravi's current age using Ravi will be 47 in 8 years. His current age is 47 - 8 = 39 years old. Next, let's find Pavel's current age using Ravi and Pavel are currently 22 years apart in age and the fact that Ravi is younger than Pavel. Pavel's current age is 39 + 22 = 61 years old.

After one month, the family decides to go on a diet in the second month, reducing their food consumption by 25% for the first half of the month, and then by an additional 50% for the second half. How many pizzas does this family eat in two months? Answer: First, let's calculate the daily pizza consumption of the family. The uncle and spouse together eat 16 + 16 = 32 pizzas per day. The grandchild eats half of this, which is 32 / 2 = 16 pizzas per day. Therefore, the family's total daily consumption is 32 + 16 = 48 pizzas per day. Assuming a 30-day month, the family eats 48 pizzas/day * 30 days/month = 1440 pizzas in the first month. In the second month, they reduce their consumption. For the first half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by 25%. This means they eat 48 pizzas/day * 0.75 = 36 pizzas/day. Over 15 days, they consume 36 pizzas/day * 15 days = 540 pizzas. For the second half of the month (15 days), they reduce their consumption by an additional 50% from the already reduced amount. So they eat 36 pizzas/day * 0.5 = 18 pizzas/day. Over 15 days, they consume 18 pizzas/day * 15 days = 270 pizzas. Therefore, in the second month, they eat a total of 540 + 270 = 810 pizzas. Over the two months, the family eats 1440 + 810 = 2250 pizzas. The answer is {2250}.",2250.0,True,156,False,symbolic,107

How many emails does Sanjay respond to in a 4 day work week? Sanjay works overtime on the last day so he can respond to 20% more emails than usual. Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day. 25% of 32 emails don't need a response, which is 0.25 * 32 = 8 emails. This means 32 - 8 = 24 emails require a response each day. Next, let's determine how many emails Sanjay responds to daily. He responds to 2 less than half of the 24 emails that require a response. Half of 24 is 12, and 2 less than that is 12 - 2 = 10 emails. Now, let's calculate the number of emails Sanjay responds to during the first three days of the work week. For three days, he responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails. On the last day, Sanjay responds to 20% more emails than usual. This is an increase of 0.20 * 10 = 2 emails. So, on the last day, he responds to 10 + 2 = 12 emails. Finally, let's find the total number of emails responded to during the 4 day work week.

Answer: First, let's calculate the number of occupied rooms: 1700 rooms * 1/5 = 340 rooms. Next, let's find the number of rooms out of service: 1700 rooms * 1/5 = 340 rooms. Now, let's determine the number of initially unoccupied rooms: 1700 rooms - 340 rooms - 340 rooms = 1020 rooms. Over 2 weeks (2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days), 20 patients are admitted each day, resulting in a total of 14 days * 20 patients/day = 280 additional patients. This means 280 more rooms are occupied. Therefore, the total number of unoccupied rooms after 2 weeks is: 1020 rooms - 280 rooms = 740 rooms. The answer is {740}.",740.0,True,168,False,symbolic,110

However, this week, 8 apartments from each of the first 5 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Hiroshi collects garbage 2 times a week from each place, and he gets paid ₣0.25 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week? Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first five complexes. According to , each of the first five complexes has 100 apartments, so there are 5 * 100 = 500 apartments in total. Next, let's find the number of apartments in the sixth complex. The question states in that the sixth complex is 40% bigger than the other five combined (500 apartments). Therefore, the sixth complex has 500 + (0.40 * 500) = 700 apartments. Now let's account for the vacant apartments. states that 8 apartments in each of the first 5 complexes were vacant. This means a total of 5 * 8 = 40 apartments did not require service. This leaves a total of 500 + 700 - 40 = 1160 apartments requiring garbage collection. tells us Hiroshi collects garbage twice a week from each apartment. So he makes 1160 apartments * 2 collections/apartment = 2320 collections. His base pay is 2320 collections * ₣0.25/collection = ₣580. Finally, he receives an additional 10% in tips, so his tip earnings are 0.10 * 580 = ₣58. Therefore, his total weekly earnings are ₣580 + ₣58 = ₣638. The answer is {638}.",638.0,True,295,False,symbolic,111

On Tuesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Wednesday, he finished homework early and watched a 2-hour episode and a 60-minute show. On Thursday, he got to stay up late, so he watched three 3-hour episodes. On Friday, he watched three episodes, each 30 minutes. If he watched 24 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Tuesday? Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Sunday through Friday, excluding Tuesday. * **Sunday and Monday:** He watched 2 nights * 4 hours/night = 8 hours of TV. * **Wednesday:** He watched a 2-hour episode + a 1-hour episode = 3 hours of TV. * **Thursday:** He watched 3 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 9 hours of TV. * **Friday:** He watched 3 episodes * 0.5 hours/episode = 1.5 hours of TV. Total TV time excluding Tuesday: 8 + 3 + 9 + 1.5 = 21.5 hours. Since he watched a total of 24 hours of TV, the time spent watching TV on Tuesday was 24 hours - 21.5 hours = 2.5 hours.

He paid registration fees that amounted to 3% of the selling price and also paid an agent fee that is 4% of the selling price. He also paid $570,000 for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and $15,000 for closing costs. Prof. Miller used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years? Answer: First, we calculate the registration fees: 3% of $760,000 is 0.03 * $760,000 = $22,800. Next, we calculate the agent fee: 4% of $760,000 is 0.04 * $760,000 = $30,400. The total fees and costs paid by Prof. Miller are the registration fees ($22,800) + the agent fee ($30,400) + the remaining loan amount ($570,000) + closing costs ($15,000) = $638,200. Prof. Miller's net proceeds from the sale are the selling price ($760,000) minus the total fees and costs ($638,200) which equals $121,800. This amount ($121,800) was invested in stocks. After the first year, the stocks gained 10%, so the value increased by 0.10 * $121,800 = $12,180. The value at the end of the first year is $121,800 + $12,180 = $133,980. After the second year, the stocks gained another 10%, which is 0.10 * $133,980 = $13,398. Therefore, Prof. Miller's net proceeds after two years are $133,980 + $13,398 = $147,378.

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the workshop. Leon has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a fifth of the remaining cost of the workshop. How much money is Leon still missing? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the workshop per day: ¥150 (hotel) + ¥30 (food) + ¥10 (transportation) = ¥190 per day. For a 2-day workshop, the total cost is ¥190 * 2 = ¥380. Next, we subtract the cost covered by Leon's friends. Since his friends are covering all the food, we need to calculate the daily food cost and then the total food cost for the 2 days. The daily food cost is ¥30, so for two days this is ¥30 * 2 = ¥60. The total cost is now ¥380 - ¥60 = ¥320. Now we consider the youth club's contribution. The youth club covers a fifth (a fifth) of the remaining cost, which is ¥320 / 5 = ¥64. Therefore, after the youth club's contribution, the amount Leon still needs to raise is ¥320 - ¥64 = ¥256.

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Carlos weighs 200 lbs, and he has already consumed 900 calories and burned 150 calories through exercise. Zahra weighs 150 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 calories in food and 225 calories in ice cream. How many more ounces of breads does Carlos need to consume than Zahra? Answer: First, let's calculate Carlos's calorie needs. His healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound * 200 lbs = 3000 calories. He has consumed 900 calories and burned 150 calories, meaning his net calorie consumption is 900 - 150 = 750 calories. Therefore, he needs 3000 - 750 = 2250 more calories. Next, let's calculate Zahra's calorie needs. Her healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound * 150 lbs = 2250 calories. She has consumed 900 calories + 225 calories = 1125 calories. Therefore, she needs 2250 - 1125 = 1125 more calories. Now, let's figure out how many calories are in one ounce of bread. A 300-ounce bag has 5 servings, so each serving is 300/5 = 60 ounces. Since each serving has 225 calories, one ounce of bread contains 225/60 = 3.75 calories. Carlos needs 2250 more calories, so he needs 2250 / 3.75 = 600 ounces of bread. Zahra needs 1125 more calories, so she needs 1125 / 3.75 = 300 ounces of bread. Finally, the difference in the amount of bread Carlos and Zahra need is 600 - 300 = 300 ounces.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 3 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Sakura remain with? Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Sakura had before receiving any new plants. She had 7 plants per ledge * 60 ledges = 420 plants. Next, let's account for the new plants. Two days ago, she received 49 new plants, and yesterday, she bought 100 new plants. This means she received a total of 49 + 100 = 149 new plants.

However, due to a recent injury, the janitor has become slower and it will take them twice as long to clean a room these days. If they work for 10 hours a day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning rooms? Answer: The janitor initially takes 6 minutes to clean a room, but due to the injury (twice as long), it now takes them 6 minutes * 2 = 12 minutes per room. To clean all 80 rooms, it will take them 12 minutes/room * 80 rooms = 960 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 960 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 16 hours of work. Over 4 days, this means they need to work an average of 16 hours / 4 days = 4 hours per day. They work for 10 hours a day, and spend 4 hours cleaning.

On the sidewalk, Fatima walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Fatima's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 44 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 26-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: Let's denote Fatima's original speed on the beach as 's'. Due to her injury, her current speed on the beach is s/2. Since she walks 11 miles on the beach and spends 44 minutes doing so, her current speed on the beach is: Speed_beach = Distance_beach / Time_beach = 11 miles / 44 minutes = 0.25 miles/minute Her original speed on the beach was therefore 2 * 0.25 miles/minute = 0.5 miles/minute. According to the problem, her original speed on the sidewalk was three times her beach speed, which is 3 * 0.5 miles/minute = 1.5 miles/minute. Due to the injury, her current speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles/minute / 2 = 0.75 miles/minute. The time spent on the sidewalk is: Time_sidewalk = Distance_sidewalk / Speed_sidewalk = 15 miles / 0.75 miles/minute = 20 minutes Therefore, the total time to complete her walk is the sum of her time on the beach and her time on the sidewalk: Total_time = Time_beach + Time_sidewalk = 44 minutes + 20 minutes = 64 minutes The answer is {64}.",64.0,True,104,False,symbolic,121

How many minutes will it take her to peel and saute 120 clams if it takes 14 seconds to wash each clam before peeling it? Note that Aisha can't work in parallel and needs to take a 7-minute break after peeling the clams before she can start sautéing them. Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes Aisha to peel 120 clams. Since she peels 10 clams per minute, it will take her 120 clams / 10 clams/minute = 12 minutes to peel all the clams. Next, we need to account for the clam washing time. Washing each clam takes 14 seconds, and there are 120 clams, so the total washing time is 120 clams * 14 seconds/clam = 1680 seconds. Converting this to minutes, we get 1680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 28 minutes. The total time for peeling is the peeling time plus washing time: 12 minutes + 28 minutes = 40 minutes. After peeling, Aisha takes a 7-minute break before sautéing. Now let's figure out the sautéing time. Aisha sautés 30 clams in 6 minutes, meaning her sautéing rate is 30 clams / 6 minutes = 5 clams per minute. To sauté 120 clams will take 120 clams / 5 clams/minute = 24 minutes. Finally, we add up all the times: 40 minutes (peeling and washing) + 7 minutes (break) + 24 minutes (sautéing) = 71 minutes. Therefore, it will take Aisha 71 minutes to peel and sauté 120 clams.

After Andre takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Andre gives 1/10 of the made popcorn to his brother Jin. How many more pieces of popcorn does Andre have to eat than his brother? Answer: First, let's calculate the popcorn popping in each 10-second interval: * **Interval 1:** 80 kernels popped. * **Interval 2:** 4 * 80 = 320 kernels popped. * **Interval 3:** 6 * 80 = 480 kernels popped. * **Interval 4:** 480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped. After the pot is removed, 240 / 4 = 60 kernels pop from residual heat. The total number of popped kernels is 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180. Andre gives 1/10 of 1180 to Jin, which is 1180 / 10 = 118 kernels. Andre keeps 1180 - 118 = 1062 kernels. The difference between the amount Andre eats and the amount Jin eats is 1062 - 118 = 944.

Diego's brother, Qasim, is 9 years younger than Diego, and Priya's sister Mia is 10 years older than Qasim. What will be the average of all four in 4 years? Answer: First, let's determine Priya's current age. In 5 years, Priya will be twice Diego's current age (2 times as old as Diego is now), which is 2 * 21 = 42 years old. Therefore, Priya's current age is 42 - 5 = 37 years old. Next, let's find Qasim's current age. Qasim is 9 years younger than Diego (Diego's brother, Qasim, is 9 years younger than Diego), so Qasim is 21 - 9 = 12 years old. Now, let's find Mia's current age. Mia is 10 years older than Qasim (Priya's sister Mia is 10 years older than Qasim), making Mia 12 + 10 = 22 years old. In 4 years, their ages will be: * Diego: 21 + 4 = 25 years old * Priya: 37 + 4 = 41 years old * Qasim: 12 + 4 = 16 years old * Mia: 22 + 4 = 26 years old To find the average age in 4 years, we add their ages and divide by 4: (25 + 41 + 16 + 26) / 4 = 108 / 4 = 27 years old.

The sisters have 4 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 140 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? Answer: Currently, Chen and Tara have a combined total of 36 + 32 = 68 signatures. Their goal is to reach 140 signatures by the end of the 4 weeks of winter break. This means they need to collect an additional 140 - 68 = 72 signatures. During the remaining 4 weeks, Chen's weekly collection is reduced by 5 signatures. Therefore, over the next 4 weeks, Chen will collect 4 weeks * (her current weekly rate - 5) signatures = an unknown number of signatures. We don't know Chen's current weekly rate, but we can work out how many signatures Chen will add to her total: Let's say Chen's current weekly average is 'x' signatures. Then her new weekly rate is (x-5) signatures. After 4 weeks she will have collected 4(x-5) signatures in total. Tara needs to collect the remaining signatures to reach their goal. Let's say Tara collects 'y' signatures per week. Over the next 4 weeks, Tara will collect 4y signatures. The total number of signatures collected by Chen and Tara in the remaining 4 weeks must equal 72. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 4(x-5) + 4y = 72 We don't know 'x', but we know that over 5 weeks Chen collected 36 signatures. Therefore we can estimate x to be approximately 36/5 = 7.2. Thus 4(7.2-5) = 8.8 Solving for 'y' (Tara's weekly collection): 4(7.2 - 5) + 4y = 72 8.8 + 4y = 72 4y = 72 - 8.8 4y = 63.2 y = 15.8 Since Tara cannot collect parts of signatures, she needs to collect at least 16 signatures per week to ensure they reach their goal of 140 signatures.

She also bought a mixed bag of starfish for $11.0 and 11 keychains that were $21.0 each. Chen then donated $5 at a charity stand along the way. How much money does Chen have left? Answer: Let's break down Chen's spending: First, the taffy: She bought 23 kgs of taffy. The deal was 16 kgs at $22/kg, so that's 16 kgs * $22/kg = $352. The additional 23-16=7 kgs received a 1/4 discount, meaning each kg cost $22 - ($22 * 0.25) = $16.50. The cost of those 7 kgs is 7 kgs * $16.50/kg = $115.50. Her total taffy cost is $352 + $115.50 = $467.50. Next, the starfish and keychains: The starfish cost $11.0, and the keychains cost 11 * $21.0 = $231. Finally, the donation: Chen donated $5.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pins: Ava bought 18 pins at $20.5 each, costing 18 * $20.5 = $369. Now let's add up all Ava's expenses: The cotton candy cost $418, the coral cost $11.0, the pins cost $369, and the charity donation was $5. Therefore, her total spending is $418 + $11 + $369 + $5 = $803. Finally, to find out how much money Ava has left, we subtract her total spending from the amount her parents gave her: $1400 - $803 = $597. Therefore, Ava has $597 left.

How many emails does Carlos respond to in a 4 day work week? Carlos work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 75% more emails than usual. Answer: First, let's find out how many emails require a response each day. Since 25% of the 32 emails don't require a response, that means 32 * 0.25 = 8 emails don't need a response. Therefore, Carlos receives 32 - 8 = 24 emails that require a response each day. Next, let's determine how many of those emails Carlos can actually respond to. He responds to 4 less than half, so he responds to (24 / 2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 emails daily. Now, let's calculate the number of emails Carlos responds to during a regular 4-day work week. That's 8 emails/day * 4 days = 32 emails. Finally, let's account for the overtime on the last day. On that day, due to responding to 75% more emails than usual, Carlos responds to 8 emails * 1.75 = 14 emails. Therefore, the total number of emails responded to during the work week is 32 (regular days) + 14 (overtime) = 46 emails. Therefore, Carlos responds to 46 emails in his 4-day work week.

12,flash,"Reformatted Question: Benjamin places crackers on bowls and plates. Each bowl can hold 21 crackers while each plate can hold two times that. Benjamin has 720 crackers, 9 bowls and 3 plates. Unfortunately, 2 plates break. Benjamin then eats one-eighth of all the crackers. How many more bowls does Benjamin need so he can place all the remaining crackers? Answer: First, let's determine the capacity of each plate. Since each plate holds twice the number of crackers as a bowl (21 crackers per bowl), each plate can hold 21 * 2 = 42 crackers. Next, calculate the total capacity of the bowls and plates before the breakage. Benjamin has 9 bowls, each holding 21 crackers, for a total of 9 * 21 = 189 crackers. He initially has 3 plates, each holding 42 crackers, for a total of 3 * 42 = 126 crackers. Combined, the bowls and plates could hold 189 + 126 = 315 crackers. After 2 plates break, the total capacity is reduced by 2 * 42 = 84 crackers. The new capacity is 315 - 84 = 231 crackers. Benjamin starts with 720 crackers and eats one-eighth of them, which is 720 / 8 = 90 crackers. This leaves him with 720 - 90 = 630 crackers. To determine how many more bowls are needed, we find out how many bowls would be required to hold all 630 remaining crackers. Each bowl holds 21 crackers, so the number of bowls needed is 630 / 21 = 30 bowls. Finally, subtract the number of bowls Benjamin already has (9 bowls) from the number of bowls needed (30 bowls): 30 - 9 = 21. Therefore, Benjamin needs 21 more bowls.

In addition, she saw 24 caterpillars, and 12 wasps. What percentage of animals in the patch were rabbits? Answer: The question asks for the percentage of white animals that were rabbits. We are told that Ava found 60 white animals, and half of which were rabbits. Therefore, the number of rabbits is 60 / 2 = 30 rabbits. The other information provided (one-third as many bees as wasps, 24 caterpillars, and 12 wasps) is irrelevant to determining the percentage of rabbits among the white animals. To find the percentage of rabbits among the white animals, we divide the number of rabbits (30) by the total number of white animals (60) and multiply by 100: (30/60) * 100 = 50%.

When the lift chain was pulled, the balloon would rise at a rate of 50 feet per minute. But when the chain was not being pulled, the balloon would slowly descend at a rate of 10 feet per minute. During his balloon ride, he pulled the chain for 15 minutes, then released the rope for 10 minutes, then pulled the chain for another 15 minutes, and finally released the chain and allowed the balloon to slowly descend back to the earth. During his balloon ride, what was the highest elevation reached by the balloon? Answer: The first 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise 50*15=750 feet. Releasing the chain for 10 minutes caused the balloon to descend 10*10=100 feet. The second 15-minute chain pull caused the balloon to rise another 50*15=750 feet. Thus, at the end of the second chain pull, when the balloon was at its highest elevation, the balloon had risen to an elevation of 750-100+750=1400 feet above the earth's surface.

On Friday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Saturday, he finished homework early and watched a 5-hour episode and a 15-minute show. On Sunday, he got to stay up late, so he watched four 3-hour episodes. On Monday, he watched three episodes, each 45 minutes. If he watched 28 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Friday? Answer: First, let's calculate the total TV time from Wednesday to Monday excluding Friday: * **Wednesday:** 4 hours * **Thursday:** 4 hours * **Saturday:** 5 hours + (15 minutes / 60 minutes/hour) = 5.25 hours * **Sunday:** 4 episodes * 3 hours/episode = 12 hours * **Monday:** 3 episodes * (45 minutes/episode / 60 minutes/hour) = 2.25 hours Total time (excluding Friday): 4 + 4 + 5.25 + 12 + 2.25 = 27.5 hours Now, subtract this from the total TV time for the week (28 hours): 28 hours - 27.5 hours = 0.5 hours. This 0.5 hours is the time spent watching the 30-minute show on Friday. Since each episode is 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours), Faisal watched 0.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 1 episode on Friday.

Once they reach the mall for the second time, how much longer do they have to get to the grocery store without being late? Answer: The total time it takes to initially reach the mall is the sum of the time to reach the gym and the time to reach the mall from the gym: 24 minutes + 27 minutes = 51 minutes. Returning home from the mall and then going back to the mall takes twice the initial travel time to the mall: 51 minutes * 2 = 102 minutes. The total time spent going to the mall, returning home, and then returning to the mall is 102 minutes. The time remaining after these trips is the initial time allotted minus the time spent: 261 minutes - 102 minutes = 159 minutes. Therefore, they have 159 minutes remaining to reach the grocery store.

Finally, he buys 43 pounds of groceries, 27 pounds of tools, and 100 pounds of wood. A farm truck can carry 100 pounds at a time. If the farmer has three trucks, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the purchased items? Answer: First, let's calculate the total weight of each item: * **Apples:** 5 boxes * 7 pounds/box = 35 pounds * **Carrots:** 14 bags * 5 pounds/bag = 70 pounds * **Hay:** 35 packs * 44 pounds/pack = 1540 pounds * **Wheat:** 19 sacks * 15 pounds/sack = 285 pounds * **Groceries:** 43 pounds * **Tools:** 27 pounds * **Wood:** 100 pounds Now, let's find the total weight of all the items: 35 + 70 + 1540 + 285 + 43 + 27 + 100 = 2100 pounds Since each truck can carry 100 pounds, the total number of trips needed with one truck would be 2100 pounds / 100 pounds/trip = 21 trips. However, the farmer has three trucks, so the number of trips per truck is 21 trips / 3 trucks = 7 trips per truck. Therefore, the farmer needs a total of 21 trips to transport all the purchased items. Each of the three trucks will make 7 trips. The answer is {21}.",7.0,False,45,False,symbolic,135

On the sidewalk, Emma walks at three times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Emma's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 56 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 32-kilometer walk, in minutes? Answer: We know Emma walks 14 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 56 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach *before* her injury was (14 kilometers / 56 minutes) = 0.25 kilometers per minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or 0.25/2 = 0.125 kilometers per minute. Emma walks 18 kilometers on the sidewalk. Before her injury, she walked three times faster on the sidewalk than on the beach (three times the rate of speed), meaning her sidewalk speed was 3 * 0.25 = 0.75 kilometers per minute. After her injury, her sidewalk speed is halved (speed has decreased by half), so it's now 0.75/2 = 0.375 kilometers per minute. It takes her 18 kilometers / 0.375 kilometers/minute = 48 minutes to walk on the sidewalk. Therefore, her total walking time is the time spent on the beach plus the time spent on the sidewalk: 56 minutes + 48 minutes = 104 minutes. The answer is {104}.",80.0,False,102,False,symbolic,137
36,flash,"Reformatted Question: Aisha went to the patisserie and bought various types of baked goods. She bought 24 croissants at $12 per dozen, 48 macarons at $20 per dozen, and 24 brownies. After a 20% discount, she paid a total of $1520. What was the cost of brownies per dozen? Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of the croissants. Aisha bought 24 croissants at $12 per dozen, which means she bought 2 dozen croissants (24 croissants / 12 croissants/dozen = 2 dozen). The cost of the croissants was 2 dozen * $12/dozen = $24. Next, let's calculate the cost of the macarons. Aisha bought 48 macarons at $20 per dozen, which means she bought 4 dozen macarons (48 macarons / 12 macarons/dozen = 4 dozen). The cost of the macarons was 4 dozen * $20/dozen = $80. Now, let's find the pre-discount total cost. Before the discount, the total cost was the cost of the croissants plus the cost of the macarons plus the cost of the brownies (which we'll call 'x'). So, the pre-discount total was $24 + $80 + x. Aisha received a 20% discount and paid a total of $1520. This means that 80% of the original price was $1520. We can set up an equation: 0.80 * ($24 + $80 + x) = $1520. Simplifying the equation, we get: 0.80 * (104 + x) = 1520. Dividing both sides by 0.80, we get: 104 + x = 1900. Subtracting 104 from both sides, we find x = $1800. Therefore, the total cost of the brownies was $1800. Finally, since Aisha bought 24 brownies, which is 2 dozen (24 brownies / 12 brownies/dozen = 2 dozen), the cost per dozen brownies was $1800 / 2 dozen = $900 per dozen.

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Theo weighs 250 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 150 calories through exercise. Sakura weighs 130 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 calories in food and 175 calories in ice cream. How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura? Answer: First, let's calculate Theo's and Sakura's calorie needs. Theo's target calorie intake is 15 calories/lb * 250 lbs = 3750 calories. He has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 150 calories, so his net calorie consumption is 1100 - 150 = 950 calories. Therefore, Theo needs 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories. Sakura's target calorie intake is 15 calories/lb * 130 lbs = 1950 calories. She has consumed 900 calories + 175 calories = 1075 calories. Thus, Sakura needs 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories. Next, let's determine the calorie content per ounce of cookies. Each serving contains 175 calories, and a 125 oz bag has 5 servings. Therefore, one ounce of cookies contains 175 calories / 5 servings / (125 oz / 5 servings) = 2.8 calories/oz. Now we can find out how many ounces of cookies each person needs. Theo needs 2800 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 1000 oz of cookies. Sakura needs 875 calories / 2.8 calories/oz = 312.5 oz of cookies. Finally, let's find the difference in the amount of cookies needed. Theo needs 1000 oz - 312.5 oz = 687.5 more ounces of cookies than Sakura. The answer is {687.5}.",275.0,False,147,False,symbolic,139

On the sidewalk, Olivia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Olivia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 65 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 29-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: We know Olivia walks 13 miles on the beach and it takes her 65 minutes. Therefore, her speed on the beach before her injury was 13 miles / 65 minutes = 0.2 miles/minute. Due to the injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, 0.2 miles/minute / 2 = 0.1 miles/minute (speed decreased by half on the beach). Since she walks at four times the speed on the sidewalk as on the beach (four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk), her sidewalk speed before the injury was 4 * 0.2 miles/minute = 0.8 miles/minute. After her injury, her speed on the sidewalk is half that: 0.8 miles/minute / 2 = 0.4 miles/minute (speed decreased by half on the sidewalk). Now we can calculate the time spent on the sidewalk. Olivia walks 16 miles on the sidewalk at a speed of 0.4 miles/minute. Therefore, the time spent on the sidewalk is 16 miles / 0.4 miles/minute = 40 minutes. Finally, to find the total time for the walk, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 65 minutes (beach) + 40 minutes (sidewalk) = 105 minutes.

Answer: A four-sided die has faces numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's analyze the probabilities: * **Fact 2: Rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row:** The numbers greater than 2 on the four-sided die are 3 and 4. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2 = 50%. The probability of this happening twice in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25% or 0.25. * **Fact 3: Rolling four even numbers in a row:** The only even number on the four-sided die is 2. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number (a 2) on a single roll is 1/4 = 25%. The probability of rolling four even numbers in a row is (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/256 ≈ 0.39% or 0.0039. To find the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of rolling four even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 2 twice in a row: 25% - 0.39% = 24.61% Therefore, Tariq is 24.61 percentage points more likely to roll a number greater than 2 twice in a row than to roll four even numbers in a row.

The sisters have 4 more weeks of spring break, and they decide they want to reach 130 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Zahra decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? Answer: Currently, Uma and Zahra have a combined total of 29 + 37 = 66 signatures. Their goal is to reach 130 signatures by the end of spring break. This means they need to collect an additional 130 - 66 = 64 signatures in the remaining 4 weeks. Uma's collection rate will be reduced by 5 signatures per week due to collecting only on weekends. Over 4 weeks, this means she will collect 4 * (her current average - 5) signatures. We don't know Uma's current average weekly collection rate, but it can be calculated by dividing the number of signatures she has by the number of weeks: 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week. So she will collect approximately 4 * (4.83 - 5) = -0.68 signatures (we can round this to 0 because you can't collect a negative number of signatures). Therefore, Zahra needs to collect the remaining 64 signatures herself, during the remaining 4 weeks. To achieve this, she will need to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

Later, Luis saw another 10-foot dolphin with 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, attached to it. On average, what percentage of each dolphin's body length is covered by the remoras? Answer: First, let's calculate the total length of remoras on the first dolphin. Initially, there were 24 remoras, each 18 inches long, totaling 24 * 18 = 432 inches. After a third swam away, 24/3 = 8 remoras left, representing a total length of 8 * 18 = 144 inches. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the 144 inches is equivalent to 144/12 = 12 feet. The percentage of the 48-foot dolphin's body length covered by remoras is (12 feet / 48 feet) * 100% = 25%. Next, let's consider the second dolphin. It had 6 remoras, each 8 inches long, totaling 6 * 8 = 48 inches. This is equivalent to 48/12 = 4 feet. The percentage of the 10-foot dolphin's body length covered by remoras is (4 feet / 10 feet) * 100% = 40%. To find the average percentage, we add the two percentages and divide by 2: (25% + 40%) / 2 = 32.5%. Therefore, on average, 32.5% of each dolphin's body length is covered by remoras.

How much more money does Valentina have left than Liam after they leave the store? Answer: Let's calculate Valentina's expenses first. * **Screws:** 17 screws * ¥0.3/screw = ¥5.10 * **Washers:** 9 washers * ¥0.59/washer = ¥5.31 * **Paint:** The cost of Valentina's paint is 8 gallons * the price per gallon (which is not given but is irrelevant since we only need the final amount). Valentina's total spending is ¥5.10 + ¥5.31 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint) = ¥10.41 + (cost of 8 gallons of paint). We don't need to know the exact price per gallon of paint since it will subtract equally from both total amounts. Now let's calculate Liam's expenses. * **Paint:** 10 gallons * ¥8.0/gallon = ¥80.00. With a 10% discount, Liam pays ¥80.00 * 0.90 = ¥72.00 * **Pencils:** 3 pencils * ¥2/pencil = ¥6.00 Liam's total spending is ¥72.00 + ¥6.00 = ¥78.00 To find the difference in remaining money, we calculate: Valentina's remaining money: ¥99.41 - ¥10.41 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint) = ¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint) Liam's remaining money: ¥90 - ¥78.00 = ¥12.00 The difference is (¥89 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint)) - ¥12.00 = ¥77 - (cost of 8 gallons of paint). As long as the price per gallon for paint is the same for both, the cost of paint cancels out, and Valentina has ¥77 more left than Liam. Therefore, Valentina has ¥77 more money left than Liam after they leave the store. Note that we don't need the price per gallon of paint to solve this problem.

The number of plants Kimia can fit in her 126-foot-long flower bed is 126 feet / 21 feet/plant = 6 plants.

On the sidewalk, Keisha walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Keisha's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 51 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 33-mile walk, in minutes? Answer: Let's denote Keisha's original speed on the beach as 's'. Before her injury, her sidewalk speed was twice her beach speed, or 2s. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now s/2, and her speed on the sidewalk is now 2s/2 = s. We know she spends 51 minutes on the beach and covers 17 miles. Therefore, her current beach speed is 17 miles / 51 minutes = 1/3 mile per minute. Since her sidewalk speed is the same as her original speed on the beach, her current sidewalk speed is also 1/3 mile per minute. The time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance on the sidewalk (16 miles) divided by her sidewalk speed (1/3 mile/minute), which is 16 miles / (1/3 mile/minute) = 48 minutes. To find the total walking time, we add the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk: 51 minutes (beach) + 48 minutes (sidewalk) = 99 minutes. Therefore, it takes Keisha 99 minutes to complete her entire 33-mile walk. The answer is {99}.",75.0,False,107,False,symbolic,148

On the sidewalk, Rania walks at two times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Rania's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 42 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 28-kilometer walk, in minutes? Answer: We know Rania walks 14 kilometers on the beach and it takes her 42 minutes. This means her speed on the beach, before her injury, would have been 14 km / 42 min = 1/3 km/min. Due to her injury, her speed on the beach is now half that, or (1/3)/2 = 1/6 km/min. Therefore, her current walking time on the beach remains 42 minutes. Rania walks 14 kilometers on the sidewalk. Before her injury, her speed on the sidewalk was twice her beach speed, so it would have been 2 * (1/3 km/min) = 2/3 km/min. After her injury, her sidewalk speed is half of that, or (2/3)/2 = 1/3 km/min. To find her current sidewalk walking time, we divide the distance by her reduced speed: 14 km / (1/3 km/min) = 42 minutes. Therefore, her total walking time is the sum of her beach and sidewalk times: 42 minutes (beach) + 42 minutes (sidewalk) = 84 minutes. The answer is {84}.",63.0,False,105,False,symbolic,149

As the pot of kernels heats up, the kernels start popping faster. 80 pop in the first 10 seconds of cooking, then 4 times that amount in the next 10 seconds. The kernels increase to 6 times the initial popping rate in the next 10 seconds. In the final 10 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 10 seconds. After Andre takes the pot off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 10 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat. Andre gives 1/10 of the made popcorn to his brother Jin. How many more pieces of popcorn does Andre have to eat than his brother? **Answer:** 1. **First 10 seconds:** 80 kernels popped. 2. **Next 10 seconds:** 4 times the initial amount popped, so 80 * 4 = 320 kernels popped. 3. **Following 10 seconds:** 6 times the initial popping rate (80 kernels) occurred, meaning 80 * 6 = 480 kernels popped. 4. **Final 10 seconds:** The rate slowed to half of the previous 10 seconds, so 480 / 2 = 240 kernels popped. 5. **Residual heat:** A quarter of the kernels from the final 10 seconds popped after the heat was off, which is 240 / 4 = 60 kernels. 6. **Total popped kernels:** 80 + 320 + 480 + 240 + 60 = 1180 kernels. 7. **Kernels given to Jin:** Andre gave 1/10 of the popcorn to Jin, so 1180 * (1/10) = 118 kernels. 8. **Kernels Andre has left:** Andre has 1180 - 118 = 1062 kernels. 9. **Difference:** Andre has 1062 - 118 = 944 more kernels than Jin.

How much more likely is it (expressed as a difference in percentage points) that he rolls a number greater than 1 twice in a row, than that he rolls four odd numbers in a row? Answer: A d4 die has four possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, and 4. For the first scenario (rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row): * The numbers greater than 1 are 2, 3, and 4. So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes. * The probability of rolling a number greater than 1 on a single roll is 3/4. * The probability of this happening twice in a row is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. For the second scenario (rolling four odd numbers in a row): * The odd numbers on a d4 are 1 and 3. So there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes. * The probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is 2/4 = 1/2. * The probability of this happening four times in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/16. To express the difference in percentage points, we convert the probabilities to percentages: * Probability of rolling a number greater than 1 twice in a row: (9/16) * 100% = 56.25% * Probability of rolling four odd numbers in a row: (1/16) * 100% = 6.25% The difference is 56.25% - 6.25% = 50 percentage points.

How many emails does Sanjay respond to in a 4 day work week? Sanjay work overtime on the last day so he can respond to 20% more emails than usual. **Answer:** First, let's figure out how many emails Sanjay receives that *do* require a response each day. Since 25% don't require a response, that means 100% - 25% = 75% *do* require a response. So, he needs to respond to 0.75 * 32 emails = 24 emails. Next, we find out how many of those emails he *can* respond to. He responds to 2 less than half of the 24 emails requiring responses, which is (24 / 2) - 2 = 10 emails per day. For the first three days of his four-day work week, Sanjay responds to 10 emails/day * 3 days = 30 emails. On the last day (due to overtime), Sanjay responds to 20% more than usual.

So, 2*t = 56 minutes, which means t = 28 minutes. This was her time on the beach *before* the injury. Her speed on the sidewalk before the injury was three times her speed on the beach (). So, if it took her 28 minutes to walk the 14 km on the beach, it would have taken her 28 / 3 = 9.33 minutes to walk 14 km on the sidewalk at that faster pace (before the injury). Since the sidewalk portion of her walk is 18 km (), not 14 km, we can set up a proportion to find the pre-injury sidewalk time: (9.33 minutes / 14 km) = (x minutes / 18 km) Solving for x, we get approximately 12 minutes. This was her sidewalk time before the injury. After the injury, her speed was halved on *both* the beach and the sidewalk (). So, her beach time is now 28 minutes * 2 = 56 minutes (as given - ). Her sidewalk time is now 12 minutes * 2 = 24 minutes. Therefore, her total walking time after the injury is 56 minutes + 24 minutes = 80 minutes. The answer is {80}.",80.0,True,102,False,symbolic,168

He can make giant cubes that use 14 ounces per cube, medium cubes that use 3 ounces, small cubes that use 1/2 of an ounce, and tiny cubes that are half the size of small cubes. He makes 47 total ice cubes, including 9 giant cubes, 14 small cubes, 12 medium cubes, and some tiny cubes. How many ounces of water does Luca have left? **Answer:** 1. **Giant cubes:** Luca used 9 giant cubes * 14 ounces/cube = 126 ounces of water. 2. **Medium cubes:** He used 12 medium cubes * 3 ounces/cube = 36 ounces of water. 3. **Small cubes:** He used 14 small cubes * 0.5 ounces/cube = 7 ounces of water. 4. **Tiny cubes:** Since he made a total of 47 ice cubes, and we know the number of giant, medium, and small cubes (9 + 12 + 14 = 35 cubes), there must be 47 - 35 = 12 tiny cubes. Tiny cubes use half the water of small cubes, so each tiny cube uses 0.5 ounces / 2 = 0.25 ounces. Therefore, he used 12 tiny cubes * 0.25 ounces/cube = 3 ounces of water. 5. **Total water used:** In total, Luca used 126 + 36 + 7 + 3 = 172 ounces of water. 6. **Water remaining:** Luca started with 337 ounces and used 172 ounces, so he has 337 - 172 = 165 ounces of water left.

However, this week, 5 apartments from each of the first 4 complexes were vacant and did not require collection service. Qasim collects garbage 2 times a week from each place and he gets paid ₣0.3 per collection for each apartment. He also earns an additional 10% in tips. How much money does he make in a week? **Answer:** 1. **Apartments in the last complex:** The first 4 complexes have a total of 4 * 100 = 400 apartments. The last complex is 30% bigger, meaning it has 400 * 0.30 = 120 more apartments than the combined total of the others. So, the last complex has 400 + 120 = 520 apartments. 2. **Total apartments served this week:** 5 apartments were vacant in each of the first 4 complexes, for a total of 5 * 4 = 20 vacant apartments. This means Qasim collected from 400 - 20 = 380 apartments in the first four complexes. Adding the last complex, he served a total of 380 + 520 = 900 apartments this week. 3. **Collections per week:** Qasim collects from each apartment twice a week, so he makes 900 * 2 = 1800 collections per week. 4. **Base earnings:** Qasim earns ₣0.3 per collection, so his base earnings are 1800 * ₣0.3 = ₣540. 5. **Tips:** Qasim earns an additional 10% in tips, which is ₣540 * 0.10 = ₣54. 6. **Total earnings:** Qasim's total earnings for the week are ₣540 (base pay) + ₣54 (tips) = ₣594.

He has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more since his favorite brand was sold out. He decides to buy a week's worth of rice and he uses 2 pounds of rice per day. The store has a 20% discount on rice which applies only up to 10 pounds; any additional rice is sold at the regular price. Bodhi also decides to buy himself a cookie for $1. How much does Bodhi have to pay? Answer: Bodhi uses 2 pounds of rice per day, so for a week (7 days), he needs 2 * 7 = 14 pounds of rice. The more expensive rice costs 20% more than the $15 per pound normal brand. So, the expensive rice costs 15 * 1.20 = $18 per pound. The store discount applies to the first 10 pounds. So, 10 pounds of rice will cost 10 * $18 * 0.80 = $144. The remaining 4 pounds (14 - 10) will be at the regular price of the expensive brand: 4 * $18 = $72.

Half of the soccer players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition? **Answer:** 1. **Soccer Players Going:** There are 100 students total, and 46% are soccer players, meaning there are 100 * 0.46 = 46 soccer players.

During their winter break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 5 weeks, Chen has 36 signatures in her book, and Tara has 32. The sisters have 4 more weeks of winter break, and they decide they want to reach 140 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Chen is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Tara decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Tara need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? **Answer:** First, we need to figure out Chen's weekly collection rate during the first 5 weeks. She collected a total of 36 signatures over 5 weeks, meaning she averaged 36 / 5 = 7.2 signatures per week. Next, we calculate how many signatures Chen will collect in the remaining 4 weeks. Her collection rate is reduced by 5 signatures per week, so she will now collect 7.2 - 5 = 2.2 signatures per week. Over the next 4 weeks, she'll collect 2.2 * 4 = 8.8 signatures. Since signatures must be whole numbers, we round this down to 8 signatures. Now, let's determine how many signatures they have in total so far. Chen has 36 and Tara has 32, totaling 36 + 32 = 68 signatures. Adding Chen's expected 8 additional signatures from the next 4 weeks, they will have 68 + 8 = 76 signatures. They want to reach 140 signatures total. This means Tara needs to collect the remaining 140 - 76 = 64 signatures. Finally, since Tara has 4 weeks left, she needs to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week to meet their goal. The answer is {16}.",13.0,False,203,False,symbolic,176

Due to the natural disaster, 30 patients are admitted into the clinic each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the clinic after 3 weeks. **Answer:** 1. **Initial unoccupied rooms:** The clinic has a capacity of 1600 rooms. One-tenth (1/10) are occupied, meaning 1600 * (1/10) = 160 rooms are occupied. Two-fifths (2/5) are out of service, meaning 1600 * (2/5) = 640 rooms are out of service. Initially, the number of unoccupied rooms is 1600 - 160 - 640 = 800. 2. **Rooms occupied after 3 weeks:** There are 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days. 30 patients are admitted each day, so 21 days * 30 patients/day = 630 new patients are admitted. 3. **Total unoccupied rooms after 3 weeks:** We assume each patient occupies one room. After 3 weeks, the number of occupied rooms will be 160 (initially occupied) + 630 (newly admitted) = 790 rooms.

She used a total of 210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use? Answer: Let 's' be the number of teaspoons of sugar, 'w' be the number of cups of water, 'm' be the number of tablespoons of milk, and 'c' be the number of tablespoons of cream. From the ratio of sugar to water (48:10), we have s/w = 48/10. This simplifies to w = (10/48)s = (5/24)s. From the ratio of milk to water (6 tablespoons for every 10 cups), we have m/w = 6/10. This means m = (3/5)w. Substituting the expression for 'w' in terms of 's', we get m = (3/5)*(5/24)s = (1/8)s. From the ratio of cream to sugar (2 tablespoons for every teaspoon), we have c/s = 2/1. So, c = 2s. We are given that the total quantity of ingredients used is 210. Therefore, s + w + m + c = 210. Substituting the expressions for w, m, and c in terms of s, we get: s + (5/24)s + (1/8)s + 2s = 210 Multiplying throughout by 24 to eliminate fractions: 24s + 5s + 3s + 48s = 5040 70s = 5040 s = 5040 / 70 s = 72 Therefore, Olga used 72 teaspoons of sugar.

Since there are half as many wasps as ants, there are 10 / 2 = 5 wasps. Half of the 46 white animals are rabbits, meaning there are 46 / 2 = 23 rabbits. The total number of animals is the sum of wasps, ants, rabbits, and bees: 5 + 10 + 23 + 39 = 77 animals. The percentage of rabbits is (23 / 77) * 100 ≈ 29.87%.

1,pro,"**Reformatted Question:** A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 75 minutes to cover every 10 miles of the city. However, we know that the wind speed is going to be halved in one hour. If the city is 72 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover 1/4 of the city? **Answer:** The fog bank covers 10 miles in 75 minutes. This means it covers 1 mile in 75/10 = 7.5 minutes. We want to know how long it takes to cover 1/4 of the city. The city is 72 miles across, so 1/4 of the city is (1/4) * 72 = 18 miles. The problem mentions a change in wind speed after one hour (60 minutes). However, since we are calculating the time to cover only 18 miles, and at the initial speed the fog covers 10 miles in 75 minutes (which is more than an hour), the change in wind speed is irrelevant for this part of the question. The change would only be a factor if we were calculating a time greater than 75 minutes since it takes longer than an hour to reach the first 10 miles. Therefore, to cover 18 miles, it will take 18 miles * 7.5 minutes/mile = 135 minutes. The answer is {135}.",210.0,False,7,False,symbolic,192

Since there were one-third as many bees as wasps, there were 12 / 3 = 4 bees. Ava saw half of the 60 white animals were rabbits, so there were 60 / 2 = 30 rabbits. The total number of animals Ava saw was 4 bees + 12 wasps + 24 caterpillars + 30 rabbits = 70 animals.

However, if she buys more than 2 plants, she'll receive a €9 discount on the entire purchase. How much money will Haruka spend at the store to fill up her flower bed? Answer: The space each plant will occupy in the flower bed is the width of the plant (3 meters) plus the space between plants (13 meters), which is 3 + 13 = 16 meters. The flower bed is 117 meters long, so it can hold 117 / 16 = 7 plants with some space left over (5 meters, which isn't enough for another plant). Haruka already has 6 flowers. Since she can fit 7 plants and needs 1 more, she only needs to buy 7 - 6 = 1 plant from the store. Since she's buying only 1 plant, which is not more than 2 plants, she doesn't get the €9 discount.

These 3 groups of students will need to leave early today to travel to an away competition. Half of the soccer players are absent for being sick. Also, 3 cheerleaders will accompany each of these groups. How many students are leaving early to the competition? **Answer:** First, we calculate the number of soccer players in the class: 150 students * 40% = 60 soccer players. However, half of these soccer players are absent, so 60 / 2 = 30 soccer players are going to the competition. Next, we determine the number of students who are not soccer players: 150 students - 60 soccer players = 90 students. Of these remaining students, 30% are dancers or choir members: 90 students * 30% = 27 dancers/choir members. So, the total number of students from the three groups (leaving early for the competition) is 30 soccer players + 27 dancers/choir members = 57 students. Finally, we add the cheerleaders: 3 groups * 3 cheerleaders/group = 9 cheerleaders. Therefore, the total number of people leaving early for the competition is 57 students + 9 cheerleaders = 66 people.

The healthy daily calorie target is 15 calories per pound of body weight. Theo weighs 250 lbs, and he has already consumed 1100 calories and burned 150 calories through exercise. Sakura weighs 130 lbs, and she has already consumed 900 in food and 175 calories in ice cream. How many more oz of cookies does Theo need to consume than Sakura? **Answer:** Theo's daily calorie target is 250 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 3750 calories. He has a net calorie consumption of 1100 calories - 150 calories = 950 calories. This means he can still consume 3750 - 950 = 2800 more calories. Sakura's daily calorie target is 130 lbs * 15 calories/lb = 1950 calories. She has consumed 900 calories + 175 calories = 1075 calories. This means she can still consume 1950 - 1075 = 875 more calories. Each serving of cookies has 175 calories, and a bag contains 5 servings, totaling 175 * 5 = 875 calories per bag. Since a bag is 125 oz, each serving is 125 oz / 5 servings = 25 oz. Theo can consume 2800 more calories, so he can eat 2800 calories / 175 calories/serving = 16 servings of cookies. This translates to 16 servings * 25 oz/serving = 400 oz of cookies. Since a bag is 125 oz, this is more cookies than we have information for. So we focus on how much he *can* eat from what is available: 125 oz. Sakura can consume 875 more calories, which is exactly the number of calories in a 125 oz bag of cookies (5 servings at 175 calories/serving). Therefore, Sakura can eat 125 oz of cookies. The difference in the amount of cookies they can consume is 125 oz (Theo) - 125 oz (Sakura) = 0 oz. Thus, from the available bag of cookies, Theo can consume exactly the same amount as Sakura can, so Theo needs to consume 0 more oz of cookies than Sakura.

During their summer break from school, the sisters spend every afternoon collecting signatures. After 5 weeks, Mei has 24 signatures in her book, and Haruka has 51. The sisters have 3 more weeks of summer break, and they decide they want to reach 135 signatures between them by the end of the break. However, during the remaining 3 weeks, Mei is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Haruka decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Haruka need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? **Answer:** First, we need to figure out Mei's current collection rate. She collected 24 signatures over 5 weeks, so her current rate is 24 / 5 = 4.8 signatures per week. Next, we calculate Mei's reduced collection rate. Due to only collecting signatures on weekends, her rate decreases by 5 signatures per week, so her new rate will be 4.8 - 5 = -0.2 signatures per week. Since she can't collect negative signatures, we assume she collects 0 signatures during these weeks. Now, let's determine how many signatures Mei will collect in the remaining 3 weeks. At her reduced collection rate, she collects 0 signatures/week * 3 weeks = 0 signatures. We know they want to reach 135 signatures total. They currently have 24 (Mei) + 51 (Haruka) = 75 signatures. So, they need 135 - 75 = 60 more signatures. Since Mei will collect 0 additional signatures, Haruka needs to collect all the remaining 60 signatures in the remaining 3 weeks.

However, during the remaining 4 weeks, Uma is only able to collect signatures on weekends, reducing her weekly collection by 5 per week, while Zahra decides to increase her weekly collection. How many signatures will Zahra need to collect per week to make sure they reach their goal? **Answer:** First, we need to figure out Uma's average weekly signature collection rate during the first 6 weeks. She collected 29 signatures over 6 weeks, meaning she collected 29 / 6 ≈ 4.83 signatures per week. Next, we determine how many signatures Uma will collect during the remaining 4 weeks. Due to her reduced collection ability, she will collect 4.83 - 5 = -0.17 signatures per week. Since she can't collect negative signatures, we can assume she collects 0 signatures in the last 4 weeks. Her total collected will remain at 29. Now we calculate how many signatures Zahra needs to collect in total. Together they want 130 signatures, and Uma will have 29, so Zahra needs to collect 130 - 29 = 101 signatures in total. Finally, we figure out Zahra's required weekly collection rate. She already has 37 signatures, so she needs to collect an additional 101 - 37 = 64 signatures over the remaining 4 weeks. This means she needs to collect 64 / 4 = 16 signatures per week.

Ava recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of items for her nephew up to 350. How many bouncy balls came in the tube? Answer: First, we need to find the total number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. This is 44 blocks + 7 stuffed animals = 51 items. Then, we find the number of action figures in the action figure pack, which is twice the number of blocks and stuffed animals combined. So, there are 2 * 51 = 102 action figures. Next, we find the total number of crayons, which is 12 different colors of crayon = 12 crayons.

Sanjay can either pay a one-time $20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Sanjay can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of the markers is 8 markers * $7.75 = $62. The total cost of the folders is 12 folders * $13 = $156. The cost of the ream of bond paper is $14. The total cost of the pencils is 8 pencils * $11 = $88. So, the total cost without any discount is $62 + $156 + $14 + $88 = $320. If Sanjay becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay a one-time $20 fee. The total discount will be 20% of $320, which is 0.2 * $320 = $64. So, the total cost with the membership discount is $320 - $64 + $20 = $276. If Sanjay does not become a member, he will get only a 5% discount. The total discount will be 5% of $320, which is 0.05 * $320 = $16. So, the total cost without the membership discount is $320 - $16 = $304. Since $276 is less than $304, the least amount Sanjay can spend on everything is $276.

What is the least amount James can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items James bought. The cost of the notebooks is 6 notebooks * ¥7.0 = ¥42. The cost of the pencils is 14 pencils * ¥10.0 = ¥140. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ¥24. The cost of the markers is 6 markers * ¥9 = ¥54. The total cost is ¥42 + ¥140 + ¥24 + ¥54 = ¥260. If James becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay a one-time ¥20 fee. The discount amount will be ¥260 * 0.20 = ¥52.

Ali can either pay a one-time €20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Ali can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the markers is 24 * €4.0 = €96. The cost of the rulers is 4 * €13.5 = €54. The cost of the ream of bond paper is €13. The cost of the colored pencils is 7 * €11 = €77. So, the total cost without any discount is €96 + €54 + €13 + €77 = €240. Now, let's calculate the cost with the 5% discount. The discount amount is 5% of €240, which is €240 * 0.05 = €12. So, the total cost with the 5% discount is €240 - €12 = €228. Next, let's calculate the cost with the 20% discount and the one-time €20 fee. The discount amount is 20% of €240, which is €240 * 0.20 = €48. So, the total cost with the 20% discount is €240 - €48 = €192. Adding the one-time €20 fee, the total cost is €192 + €20 = €212.

For the first 10 minutes, the cost is $0.9 per minute * 10 minutes = $9. For the next 20 minutes, the cost is $0.4 per minute * 20 minutes = $8. For the last 60 minutes, since the price is $0.1 per two minutes, we need to divide the time by 2 to get the number of 2-minute intervals, which is 60/2 = 30 intervals. The cost for this part is $0.1 per two minutes * 30 intervals = $3. The total cost before discount is $9 + $8 + $3 = $20.

What is the least amount Diego can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The total cost of erasers is 20 erasers * €2.25 = €45. The total cost of colored pencils is 8 colored pencils * €14.25 = €114. The total cost of the ream of bond paper is €21. The total cost of crayons is 5 crayons * €8 = €40.

How many marked balls are there in total? Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since a quarter of the balls are tennis balls, the number of tennis balls is 240 * 1/4 = 60. The rest are golf balls, so there are 240 - 60 = 180 golf balls. Next, we need to find out how many blue tennis balls are marked. Since 1/6 of the tennis balls are blue, the number of blue tennis balls is 60 * 1/6 = 10. And since a tenth of those blue tennis balls are marked, the number of marked blue tennis balls is 10 * 1/10 = 1. Now, we need to find out how many gray golf balls are marked. Since 1/2 of the golf balls are gray, the number of gray golf balls is 180 * 1/2 = 90. And since all except 1/6 of those gray balls are marked, the number of marked gray golf balls is 90 - 90 * 1/6 = 90 - 15 = 75.

In addition, Luis owns a 9-square meter apricot field that produces 13 apricots per square meter. The apricots can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more grapes does Luis harvest than apricots? Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years. Since Luis can harvest his grapes every 12 months, he can harvest twice in two years. The number of grapes per square meter is 16 grapes per five-sixths of a square meter, so the number of grapes per square meter is 16 / (5/6) = 16 * 6 / 5 = 96 / 5 = 19.2 grapes per square meter. Therefore, the total number of grapes Luis harvests in two years is 2 * 60 square meters of grape field * 19.2 grapes per square meter = 2 * 60 * 19.2 = 2304 grapes. Next, we need to calculate the total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years. Since the apricots can be harvested every 4 months, Luis can harvest 6 times in two years. The total number of apricots Luis harvests in two years is 6 * 9-square meter apricot field * 13 apricots per square meter = 6 * 9 * 13 = 702 apricots.

A fifth of the tennis balls are pink, of which 1/8 are marked. 1/6 of the golf balls are black, and all except half of those black balls are marked. How many marked balls are there in total? Answer: First, we need to find out how many tennis balls and golf balls there are. Since a quarter of the balls are tennis balls, the number of tennis balls is 320 / 4 = 80. The rest are golf balls, so there are 320 - 80 = 240 golf balls. Next, we need to find out how many marked tennis balls there are.

Yusuf can either pay a one-time ₺20 fee to become a member and get a 20% discount on all purchases, or not become a member and receive only a 5% discount. What is the least amount Yusuf can spend on everything? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items without any discount. The cost of the rulers is 10 rulers * ₺9.0 = ₺90. The cost of the colored pencils is 6 colored pencils * ₺14.0 = ₺84. The cost of the ream of bond paper is ₺18. The cost of the crayons is 8 crayons * ₺11 = ₺88. The total cost is ₺90 + ₺84 + ₺18 + ₺88 = ₺280. If Yusuf becomes a member, he will get a 20% discount on all purchases, but he will also have to pay a one-time ₺20 fee. The discount amount will be 20% of ₺280, which is 0.20 * ₺280 = ₺56. The total cost after the discount will be ₺280 - ₺56 = ₺224. Adding the one-time fee, the total cost will be ₺224 + ₺20 = ₺244.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget? Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is 20% of the selling price of $590000, which is 0.2 x $590000 = $118000. So, the discounted selling price is $590000 - $118000 = $472000. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 x $590000 = $17700. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 x $590000 = $70800. However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $472000 + $17700 + $70800 = $560500. Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's $490000 budget. The difference is $560500 - $490000 = $70500.

She used a total of 210 teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk. How many teaspoons of sugar did she use? Answer: Let's assume that Elena used x sets of the ratio of 44:11 for teaspoons of sugar and cups of water. Then, she used 44x teaspoons of sugar and 11x cups of water. Since she uses 10 tablespoons of milk for every 10 cups of water, she used 11x * (10/10) = 11x tablespoons of milk. Since she uses 2 tablespoons of heavy cream for every teaspoon of sugar, she used 44x * 2 = 88x tablespoons of heavy cream. The total number of teaspoons of sugar, cups of water, tablespoons of cream, and tablespoons of milk is 210. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 44x + 11x + 88x + 11x = 210. Combining like terms, we get 154x = 210. Dividing both sides by 154, we get x = 1.36 (round down to 1 since we can't have a fraction of a set).

Due to the pandemic, 45 patients are admitted into the care facility each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied rooms in the care facility after 2 weeks. Answer: First, we need to find the number of occupied rooms. Since 1/3 of the rooms are occupied, the number of occupied rooms is 1900 * 1/3 = 633.33, which we will round down to 633 rooms. Next, we need to find the number of rooms that are out of service. Since one-sixth of all the rooms are out of service, the number of rooms out of service is 1900 * 1/6 = 316.67, which we will round down to 316 rooms. Now, we can find the initial number of unoccupied rooms. This is 1900 - 633 - 316 = 951 rooms. Since 45 patients are admitted each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 45 * 14 = 630 patients.

If Mrs. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget? Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is 20% of the selling price of $450000, which is 0.2 * $450000 = $90000. So, the discounted selling price is $450000 - $90000 = $360000.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 7 potted plants from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Jasmine remain with? Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of plants Jasmine had before receiving the new plants. She had 12 potted plants on each of the 69 window ledges, so she had 12 * 69 = 828 plants. Then, she received 29 new potted plants and purchased 190 new plants yesterday at a 50% discount, which means she actually bought 190 / 2 = 95 plants. So, the total number of plants she had initially was 828 + 29 + 95 = 952. Now, she is giving away 7 potted plants from each ledge, which is 7 * 69 = 483 plants. Therefore, the number of plants Jasmine will remain with is 952 - 483 = 469. The answer is {469}.",564.0,False,585,False,symbolic,232

The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Brown's net proceeds after two years? Answer: Dr. Brown sold his villa for $300000. He paid the legal fees that amounted to 3% of the selling price, which is 3% * $300000 = $9000. He also paid a realtor fee that is 3% of the selling price, which is 3% * $300000 = $9000. He also paid $200000 for the remaining loan amount on the villa, and $20000 for closing costs. So, the total amount he paid is $9000 + $9000 + $200000 + $20000 = $239000.

Due to the flu season, 25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 3 weeks. Answer: The hospital has 1400 beds with 1/3 occupied, which means 1/3 * 1400 = 466.67 beds are occupied. Since we can't have a fraction of a bed, we'll round down to 466 beds. Additionally, one-sixth of all the beds are out of service, which is 1/6 * 1400 = 233.33 beds. Again, we'll round down to 233 beds. The total number of unavailable beds is 466 + 233 = 699 beds. Initially, the number of unoccupied beds is 1400 - 699 = 701 beds. Since 25 patients are admitted into the hospital each day, the total number of patients admitted in 3 weeks is 25 patients/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 525 patients.

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the sports tournament. Qasim has also applied for help from the school, which has decided to cover 1/5 of the remaining cost of the sports tournament. How much money is Qasim still missing? Answer: First, let's calculate the total cost of the 3-day sports tournament. The cost of the hotel is $150 * 3 = $450. The cost of the food is $30 * 3 = $90. The cost of the transportation is $30 * 3 = $90. So, the total cost is $450 + $90 + $90 = $630. Since Qasim's friends will cover the cost of all the food for the sports tournament, Qasim only needs to pay $630 - $90 = $540. Qasim has $95, so he still needs $540 - $95 = $445.

In addition, Xavier owns a 11-square meter plum field that produces 13 plums per square meter. The plums can be harvested every 4 months. In the span of two years, how many more apples does Xavier harvest than plums? Answer: First, we need to calculate the total number of apples harvested in two years. Since there are 13 apples per four-fifths of a square meter, we can calculate the number of apples per square meter as 13 / (4/5) = 16.25 apples per square meter. With 65 square meters of apple field, the total number of apples harvested in one round is 65 * 16.25 = 1056.25 apples. Since Xavier can harvest his apples every 6 months, he can harvest twice in a year, and in two years, he can harvest 4 times. So, the total number of apples harvested in two years is 1056.25 * 4 = 4225 apples. Next, we need to calculate the total number of plums harvested in two years. With 11-square meter plum field and 13 plums per square meter, the total number of plums harvested in one round is 11 * 13 = 143 plums. Since the plums can be harvested every 4 months, Xavier can harvest 3 times in a year, and in two years, he can harvest 6 times. So, the total number of plums harvested in two years is 143 * 6 = 858 plums. Finally, we can calculate the difference between the number of apples and plums harvested in two years. The difference is 4225 - 858 = 3367. The answer is {3367}.",3366.0,False,296,False,symbolic,241

His friends have chipped in and will cover the cost of all the food for the conference. Luis has also applied for help from the youth club, which has decided to cover a quarter of the remaining cost of the conference. How much money is Luis still missing? Answer: The total cost of the 2-day conference is (¥150 + ¥20 + ¥20) * 2 = ¥380. Since Luis' friends will cover the cost of all the food for the conference, which is ¥20 * 2 = ¥40, Luis only needs to pay ¥380 - ¥40 = ¥340. Luis has ¥10, so he still needs ¥340 - ¥10 = ¥330. The youth club will cover a quarter of the remaining cost of the conference, which is ¥330 / 4 = ¥82.50. Therefore, Luis still needs ¥330 - ¥82.50 = ¥247.50.

He also paid $490000 for the remaining loan amount on the apartment, and $10000 for closing costs. Dr. Johnson used the net proceeds from selling the apartment to invest in stocks. The stocks gained 10% each year for two years. How much were Dr. Johnson's net proceeds after two years? Answer: Dr. Johnson paid 1% of the selling price in legal fees, which is 0.01 * $780000 = $7800. He also paid 4% of the selling price in realtor fees, which is 0.04 * $780000 = $31200. Adding these fees to the $490000 remaining loan amount and the $10000 closing costs, Dr. Johnson paid a total of $7800 + $31200 + $490000 + $10000 = $538000. Subtracting this amount from the $780000 selling price, Dr. Johnson's initial net proceeds were $780000 - $538000 = $242000.

If Kayla is sure to get 25% of the biology questions, 65% of the physics questions, and a quarter of the algebra and geometry questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get? Answer: First, we need to find the number of questions for each subject. The number of physics questions is 80 * 0.25 = 20. The number of biology questions is 80 * 0.10 = 8. The number of algebra and geometry questions is 80 - 20 - 8 = 52, and since they are equally divided, there are 52/2 = 26 questions for each subject. Now, let's calculate the number of correct answers for each subject. For biology, Kayla will get 25% of 8 questions correct, which is 0.25 * 8 = 2. For physics, Kayla will get 65% of 20 questions correct, which is 0.65 * 20 = 13. For algebra and geometry, Kayla will get a quarter of 26 questions correct for each subject, which is 0.25 * 26 = 6.5 for each subject. Since we can't have a fraction of a question, we'll round down to 6 correct answers for each subject. In total, Kayla will get 2 + 13 + 6 + 6 = 27 questions correct.

On top of that, the buyer has to pay a brokerage fee which is 3% of the selling price, and also the transfer fee that is 12% of the selling price. If Mrs. Smith can get a 20% discount on the selling price, how much more will be the total cost than Mrs. Smith's budget? Answer: First, we need to calculate the discounted selling price. The discount amount is 20% of the selling price of $580000, which is 0.2 * $580000 = $116000. So, the discounted selling price is $580000 - $116000 = $464000. Next, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and transfer fee. The brokerage fee is 3% of the selling price, which is 0.03 * $580000 = $17400. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is 0.12 * $580000 = $69600. However, since the fees are based on the original selling price, not the discounted price, we still use the original selling price to calculate the fees. The total cost is the sum of the discounted selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, which is $464000 + $17400 + $69600 = $550000. Finally, we need to find out how much more the total cost is than Mrs. Smith's $400000 budget. The difference is $550000 - $400000 = $150000.

On the sidewalk, Nia walks at four times the rate of speed that she does on the beach. However, due to a recent injury, Nia's speed has decreased by half both on the beach and sidewalk. If 60 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, how long does it take for her to complete the entire 24-kilometer walk, in minutes? Answer: First, we need to find Nia's speed on the beach before her injury. We know that she walks 10 kilometers in 60 minutes, so her speed on the beach is 10 kilometers / 60 minutes = 1/6 kilometers per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed on the beach is 1/2 * 1/6 = 1/12 kilometers per minute. We also know that Nia walks at four times the rate of speed on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk before her injury was 4 * 1/6 = 2/3 kilometers per minute. Since her speed has decreased by half, her new speed on the sidewalk is 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 kilometers per minute. Now, we can find the time it takes for Nia to walk 14 kilometers on the sidewalk. Time = distance / speed = 14 kilometers / (1/3 kilometers per minute) = 42 minutes. Finally, we add the time it takes for Nia to walk on the beach and the sidewalk to find the total time.
